0;PPL;PPL Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US utility groups Avangrid and PPL in $67bn-plus merger talks;Connecticut and Pennsylvania-based companies in discussions over possible combination;US utility groups Avangrid and PPL Corporation have held talks about a deal to combine all or parts of their business that would create a company worth more than $67bn including debt if a full merger is agreed, people close to the discussions said. If the two companies decide to merge their entire operations, it will form one of the largest publicly traded utilities in the US and the deal will rank as the biggest utility tie-up this year.The companies are exploring various options to structure the transaction, the people said. One person added that it was unclear whether it would include an investment from Iberdrola, the Spanish utility company that owns more than 80 per cent of Avangrid. They cautioned that there was no certainty a deal would be reached. Both Avangrid and PPL said they would not comment on speculation.Avangrid, which is based in Connecticut, provides gas or electricity to more than 3m customers across New York and New England. The company also owns a renewable energy business, made up of wind and solar farms across 22 US states. Its share price has lagged the broader rally in utility stocks, and are down slightly this year, giving the company a market value of about $15bn. It has net debt of $7.1bn.PPL, formerly known as Pennsylvania Power and Light, traces its roots to the consolidation of eight electric companies across eastern and central Pennsylvania in 1920. The company, which is now worth about $22.7bn, before net debt of $22.3bn, owns power assets across Pennsylvania and Kentucky, as well as an electric distribution company in the UK known as Western Power Distribution. The group serves more than 10m electricity customers in the two countries.PPL’s large presence outside the US — the UK accounted for about 29 per cent of its $7.8bn of revenue last year — has limited its potential merger partners, according to one utility industry adviser. They added that the most logical companies to strike a deal with PPL were Avangrid, Iberdrola or National Grid, the £31bn British power group.But any deal is likely to be complicated, given political pressure in the UK, including calls to nationalise the power industry by the opposition Labour party. PPL could choose to spin-off its UK business if that proved a key hurdle, the person added.
1;PPL;PPL Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;US stocks gyrate sharply on fresh turmoil;Utilities and consumer staples benefit from risk aversion;US equity markets gyrated sharply on Tuesday, ending a volatile day higher after briefly falling below a key technical level as turmoil in China and the eurozone knocked investor confidence.The S&P 500 climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,081.34, nearly 2 per cent above lows touched early in the trading day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 17,776.91.The benchmark US index also pared losses that saw it keel through its 200-day moving average — currently 2,055.27 — as investors sold-off positions in mining, technology and banking stocks heading into the close of trading in European stock markets.While investors remain sceptical that a deal will be reached between Athens and its international creditors, the tone of negotiations softened somewhat as new Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos spoke with his counterparts at an emergency summit in Brussels.Strategists said the move in equity markets, which also saw the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rise 0.1 per cent to 4,997.46, was driven by the Greek talks.“This is headline trading,” Gennadiy Goldberg, a US strategist for TD Securities said. “That’s why you’re seeing the whip from the strong negative to the strong positive. I’m flabbergasted by the move today.”Trading activity soared in New York as markets whipsawed — more than 8.6bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, the third busiest trading day of the year.Equity volatility as gauged by the CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of the expected moves in the S&P 500 over the coming month, rose as high as 19.2 in early morning trading, before retreating 4.7 per cent to 16.2. Vix readings above 20 in the past have indicated an escalation of investor worry.Utilities led the benchmark index, with the S&P 500 utility index rising 2.5 per cent, buoyed by a 3.3 per cent rise from Duke Energy to $75.27. Public Service Enterprise Group climbed 3.3 per cent to $41.64 while PPL, an electricity provider in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, gained 3 per cent to $30.93.Often viewed as a proxy for bonds, utilities — which carry high debt loads, are among the most correlated to interest rate moves and offer above average dividend yields — have rallied as turmoil in the Eurozone and China lapped volatility higher.That unease has weighed on trader expectations of when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates — a major headwind for the sector. Federal Funds futures now imply the US central bank will not lift rates until March 2016.The material sector was the only industry to remain in negative territory after the late-day rally, as investors took fright at turmoil in Chinese equities and gold and copper prices slid.Newmont Mining Corp, the gold producer, was the steepest faller on the S&P 500, sliding 6 per cent to $22.41, while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, dropped 3.3 per cent to $17.25, adding to Monday’s 3 per cent decline.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices dropped 15.4 per cent to $2.09 after it warned on sales and cut guidance after the market close yesterday. Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia shed 1.9 per cent to $19.79.Additional reporting by Pan Yuk.
2;PPL;PPL Corp;2015-03-06T18:52:00Z;Utilities among worst performers on Wall Street;Dividend payers lose their appeal as prospect for Fed rate increase rises;Utilities were the worst performing sector on the US benchmark index after a strong February jobs report fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve could lift interest rates as early as this summer.The S&P 500 utilities index, which was the best performing sector last year after rising 25 per cent, has since reversed course. It is the worst performing sector this year, declining more than 8 per cent.Dividend-paying utilities were one of the key beneficiaries of the low interest rate environment as investors rotated into the sector in search of income.S&P 500 utilities have returned an average dividend yield of 3.96 per cent in the past five years compared with 2 per cent for the S&P 500.The strength in the American labour market, which has recorded a more than 200,000 increase in payrolls for 12 straight months, has served as one of the key triggers for the decline in utilities. This is because Fed policy makers are weighing up the improving labour market alongside inflation as they deliberate on the end of zero interest rate policy.The S&P 500 utilities sector declined 3 per cent on Friday following the jobs report.PPL Corp was among the worst performing utilities stocks, falling 4 per cent to $31.74. Other dividend paying sectors like telecommunications and healthcare were also among the worst performing sectors on the blue-chip index.AT&T shares declined nearly 2 per cent to $33.48 as the S&P Dow Jones Indices said that Apple would replace the wireless service provider in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the close of trading on March 18.With AT&T’s exit, Verizon will be the only telecoms company on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Foot Locker shares, which have advanced 40 per cent in the past year, gained 4 per cent on Friday to $59.37 after the athletic shoe retailer reported fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates.Sales at the company rose 6.7 per cent to $1.9bn in the three months to the end of January. Profits climbed to $146m, or $1.01 a share, compared with $121m or 81 cents a share in the year-ago period.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of 90 cents a share on sales of $1.87bn.Shares in Lululemon, the maker of high-end yoga wear, fell 4 per cent to $62.30 after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to “sell” from “neutral”.“We believe Lululemon is a great brand in a compelling category, but that the stock reflects unrealistic growth assumptions for the medium term,” said Lindsay Drucker Mann, an analyst at Goldman.Gap shares declined more than 1 per cent to $40.72 after the retailer reported a 4 per cent decline in February same-store sales, compared with a 7 per cent decline in the previous year. This missed Wall Street expectations for a 1.3 per cent gain.“Recognising that February is a relatively small sales month, we’re focused on the spring shopping months ahead and delivering on our full-year goals,” said Sabrina Simmons, chief financial officer.The S&P 500 fell 1.4 per cent to 2,071.26, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.5 per cent to 17,856.78 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.1 per cent to 4,927.37.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
3;PPL;PPL Corp;2014-06-12T17:32:33Z;US power producers: indie label;Volatility to be found in pure-play electricity generators;Market volatility may be at 10-year lows, but it is still there, if one knows where to look. One intriguing spot: the US independent power producers. IPPs, also known as “merchant” or “competitive” plants, generate electricity. Power transmission is then left to utilities whose returns are mandated by regulators. This week the third largest independent was created when PPL Corporation separated its generation business from its utility. It combined those generating assets with a group of power plants owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings to form a new public company, Talen.Talen and its IPP peers are a wager on the upward, if erratic, trajectory of electricity rates. IPPs have had a nice run of late – but the rally should not be enough to erase memories of high-profile busts.The integration of generation and distribution is fading. Exelon recently expanded its regulated utility exposure through the $4bn acquisition of Pepco. Duke Energy, meanwhile, is trying to sell 11 midwest power plants.PPL’s deal to jettison its power-generation business is cleverly structured. The combination with the Riverstone unit is tax-free and the 15 gigawatts of combined capacity is concentrated in two desirable regions: the densely populated mid-Atlantic and fast-growing Texas.In an era of low returns, investors prefer that utilities protect their dividend (PPL’s yield is 4 per cent) and leave power price speculation to the likes of Talen. Of late though, speculation has been a good business. Shares in NRG Energy, the largest IPP, are up a third in the past year. A harsh winter helped it boost its 2014 cash flow outlook by a fifth. Over the longer term, the hope is that the price of natural gas and electricity demand both edge up, combining to boost power rates. Volatility, though, cuts in both ways. Prominent power producers Energy Future Holdings, Dynegy and Calpine guessed wrong on electricity prices (and capital structure) and found bankruptcy.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex
4;PPL;PPL Corp;2011-03-02T15:46:11Z;PPL / Eon: a good deal for both;A £4bn deal to create the UK’s biggest electricity distributor;"Regulated assets are like comfort blankets. In volatile energy markets you can snuggle down on a bed of steady, unspectacular earnings. That explains the attractions of the UK electricity distribution network. Li Ka-shing’s Cheung Kong Infrastructure bought EDF’s UK distribution business for £5.8bn last July; on Wednesday PPL said it would buy Eon’s UK business, Central Networks, for £4bn, including £500m of debt.Deep pockets are required. Ofgem, the UK regulatory body, estimates that electricity distribution will require £32bn of capital investment over the next decade – 75 per cent more than the current regulated value of the underlying assets.Yet the deal makes sense for seller and buyer. Eon wants to cut debt and move into higher-growth markets. It is raising €15bn through disposals of some European assets and has already sold its Italian gas grid and a stake in Gazprom. The £4bn sale price on the UK business represents a 33 per cent premium to its regulated asset base (CKI paid EDF the equivalent of 27 per cent). Deutsche Bank reckons the sale of Central Networks will reduce Eon’s economic net debt by 14 per cent.PPL is moving in the opposite direction. It is acquiring more regulated assets (it bought Eon’s business in Kentucky last year for $7.6bn, including debt). The latest deal will make it the UK’s biggest electricity distributor; its shares were 3.5 per cent higher. The question is whether PPL has the heft to finance the capex on the UK business: it already has long-term debt of $12bn, roughly equivalent to its market capitalisation, and wants to maintain its investment-grade rating. This should be helped by the acquisition of regulated income and synergies from integrating its expanded UK business. The challenge will be to invest in a demanding, low-growth sector while maintaining its credit rating.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
5;PPL;PPL Corp;2011-03-02T02:42:56Z;PPL buys Eon’s UK electricity network for $5.6bn;;PPL, the US utility, has reached a deal to buy Central Networks, the UK electricity networks business of Eon, Germany’s largest utility, for more than $5.6bn (£3.5bn) in cash and $800m of existing public debt to be assumed through consolidation.The Pennsylvania-based power company is snapping up the UK’s second-biggest electricity network, which provides power to more than 5m customers in the Midlands. PPL and Eon expect to close the transaction in early April.“This acquisition expands our UK business into a very strategic and core element of our overall regulated utility business platform,” said James Miller, PPL’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.Eon, which is being advised by JPMorgan and Barclays Capital, could not immediately be reached.The deal marks PPL’s second large purchase from Eon in the past year. The company last April beat Duke Energy and others to buy the German group’s US supply companies for more than $6.7bn in cash – the US utility’s largest deal to date.PPL’s shares sank 2.1 per cent to $24.90 as investors absorbed the prospect of another large deal.Last year’s purchase of Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, Eon’s two regulated US utilities, was financed in part through a $2.5bn sale of equity, as well as through new debt and existing cash balances.PPL’s regulated status makes it important for the company to maintain its investment-grade credit rating.Eon began considering new approaches after talks last year to sell the business to a group of buyers led by Canada Pension Plan stalled over price.PPL edged out Cheung Kong Infrastructure, the investment vehicle of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, which was also bidding. MidAmerican Energy Holdings, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, was also among the interested parties.The sale of the electricity business is part of Eon’s plan to raise €15bn (£12.7bn) by the end of 2013 from asset sales, as it seeks to cut debt and expand in growth regions outside Europe, such as Latin America.The company expects its businesses outside Europe to deliver one quarter of its total earnings by 2015.Last July, EDF of France sold its UK electricity networks business to CKI for £5.8bn, underlining the prices such distribution systems can fetch in today’s market.At the time, analysts said the sale suggested the market for energy companies was improving and that others with similar network assets in Britain, including Eon and Iberdrola of Spain, might put the businesses up for sale.PPL already owns two companies in the UK, known collectively as Western Power Distribution. One delivers electricity to 1.5m customers in an area stretching from Bristol to Bath, while the other serves 1.1m people in south Wales.
6;PPL;PPL Corp;2011-02-11T01:24:22Z;Suitors approach Eon over UK network;;Eon, Germany’s largest utility, is considering three fresh approaches for its UK electricity networks business in a sale that could fetch as much as $6bn, according to people familiar with the situation.MidAmerican Energy Holdings, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, has emerged as a suitor alongside PPL of the US and Cheung Kong Infrastructure, the investment vehicle of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.Eon is considering the new approaches after talks late last year to sell the business, the UK’s second-biggest electricity network that provides power to more than 5m customers in the Midlands, to a group of buyers led by Canada Pension Plan, stalled over price.CKI, which has hired Deutsche Bank to advise it, first approached Eon late last year. The company last summer paid £5.8bn ($9.3bn) for the UK power transmission network of EDF and is seen to be keen to expand its portfolio of regulated assets in developed countries.PPL, which is based in Pennsylvania, has also been on the acquisition trail, and last year bought Eon’s Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities units in America. The company already operates in the UK through Western Power Distribution, which owns the electricity lines in Wales and south-west England.MidAmerican, meanwhile, owns CE Electric UK, which operates Northern Electric Distribution and Yorkshire Electric Distribution.Eon, which is being advised by JPMorgan Chase and Barclays, declined to comment on Thursday night. Any purchase by one of the three suitors is likely to be looked at by competition authorities in the UK.The sale of the electricity business is part of Eon’s plan to raise €15bn ($20.4bn) by the end of 2013 from asset sales as it seeks to cut debt and expand in growth regions outside Europe, such as Latin America. The company told investors last November that it expected its businesses outside Europe to deliver one-quarter of its total earnings by 2015.Johannes Teyssen, Eon chief executive, said at the time that asset sales would complement divestitures of about €13bn concluded during the past three years. At least 50 per cent of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt. At the end of the third quarter, Eon’s economic debt – including provisions on the decommissioning of old power plants – stood at €44.9bn.“Our objective is to sharpen Eon’s profile as an international energy specialist and to increase our earnings strength by placing it on a broader, more international foundation,” said Mr Teyssen at the time.
7;PPL;PPL Corp;2010-04-29T21:37:19Z;End of an Eon;Consolidation in the utilities sector is painful in the US;"The Kentucky Derby takes place this weekend, but the state’s richest purse will be elsewhere. As part of a €10bn debt reduction programme, Germany’s Eon, the world’s largest utility by revenue, will sell two subsidiaries based in the state to PPL for $7.6bn, including assumed debt.It is the second-largest utility deal globally this year, according to Dealogic, and a bold move for PPL. The $6.7bn cash component is equal to two-thirds of its market value. The buyer expects to raise $2.2bn-$2.6bn of equity, with the rest coming from debt and cash on hand plus preferred equity or convertible debt.This sounds riskier than it is. PPL’s more volatile unregulated businesses had grown to account for about 70 per cent of revenue; buying the regulated Eon subsidiaries will bring this back below half. Although the price was nearly $1bn above some recent analyst estimates, it is not excessive as a percentage of the target company’s rate base – those assets on which regulators permit it to earn a return – after taking tax credits into account. Critically, execution and regulatory risks are also modest. With no overlap or market power issues, a friendly local regulator and few state and federal approvals required, it should go smoothly.Of course, the lack of overlap begs the question of the benefit of doing a deal in the first place. PPL expects it to be accretive to earnings by 2013, but this is unspectacular and represents the magic of leverage rather than industrial logic. The real reason seems to be that there was a deal to be had at all. Utility consolidation is a painful process in the US, with many proposed mergers succumbing to turf wars or requiring disposals. A cash seller exiting the market in an uncontroversial deal was too tempting to resist.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"
8;PPL;PPL Corp;2010-04-28T23:30:21Z;PPL to buy Eon supply assets in US;;PPL, the Pennsylvania-based power company, on Wednesday agreed to buy the US supply companies of Eon, the German energy group, for more than $7.6bn.Shares in PPL, which has a market value of about $9.7bn, fell almost 8 per cent in trading on Wednesday as speculation grew that it had won the auction for Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, two regulated utilities owned by Eon.Industry bankers suggested that PPL could require a large equity sale to help finance the deal – the largest the utility has ever struck – and to maintain its investment grade credit rating.The company on Wednesday said it had bridge financing in place for the deal understood to total $6.5bn and could also explore sales of non-core assets.“We are adding scale, creating a much stronger and more diversified enterprise while providing additional opportunities for regulated-business growth and, importantly, retaining the upside benefits of our competitive fleet when wholesale power market prices improve,” said James H. Miller, PPL’s chairman and chief executive officer.LG&E and Kentucky Utilities between them have about 940,000 customers for electricity and 320,000 for gas, and about 8,000 megawatts of generation capacity.The combined company will have annual revenues of about $10bn, serving nearly 5m electricity customers in the US and the UK.Eon put its US supply assets on the market this year as part of its moves to reduce its debt. The businesses were acquired as part of the purchase of Powergen of the UK, which Eon bought in 2002.The German company had an ambitious global expansion programme until 2008 but has since been selling assets, as have several European energy groups.Last year it set a target of raising at least €10bn ($13.2bn) from disposals by the end of 2010 and has said that it intended to return its focus to Europe, with an emphasis on renewable energy.Duke Energy was among those companies competing in the final stages of the competition to buy the Kentucky utility from Eon. Duke shares rose Wednesday by 4 per cent.The $7.625bn purchase price includes the assumption of $925m in debt. PPL will also take on certain tax benefits as part of the deal, amounting to $450m.The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of this year, could face a tortuous approval process, requiring approvals by three state regulators as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.PPL intends to operate the Kentucky utilities as a subsidiary, maintaining the headquarters in Louisville.Shares in PPL fell 7.7 per cent to $25.60. Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised PPL on the deal. Goldman Sachs and Blackstone advised Eon.
9;PPL;PPL Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Eon puts US supply arms up for sale;;Eon, the German energy group, has put Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, its US supply companies, up for sale with an estimated price of about $6bn, according to people familiar with the situation.Duke Energy of North Carolina and PPL of Pennsylvania are possible buyers, according to SparkSpread, an industry news service.Eon went on an ambitious push for international expansion up to 2008, but has since been retrenching and selling assets, like several other large European energy groups.Last year it set a target of raising at least €10bn ($13.5bn) from disposals by the end of 2010.Eon announced last week that it had sold its high-voltage transmission network for €1.1bn, and last year sold Thüga, its holding company for municipal utility stakes, for about €2.9bn.The proceeds from the sales are being used to pay down Eon’s debts, which were €47bn at the end of June last year.Marcus Schenck, Eon’s chief financial officer, told a German newspaper last month that banks had become more willing to finance acquisitions, helping the company’s disposal programme.Wulf Bernotat, Eon’s chief executive, said last year the company was investing in energy supplies “with the focus on Europe”.LG&E and Kentucky Utilities between them have about 900,000 customers for electricity and 310,000 for gas, and about 8,000 megawatts of generation capacity.The businesses were acquired with Powergen of the UK, which Eon bought in 2002.Eon is being advised on the sale by Goldman Sachs, according to SparkSpread, while Duke Energy is being advised by JPMorgan and Barclays Capital.The companies and their advisers refused to comment.
10;PPL;PPL Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Distributors fear rules will harm grid investment;;"Electricity distribution companies have warned that the new pricing framework from Ofgem, the energy regulator, could strangle vital investment in Britain’s grid.Some have said that they would be prepared to force an investigation by the Competition Commission to adjudicate on their demands for higher prices.Ofgem’s ruling applies to the seven companies that run Britain’s 14 local electricity distribution networks, operating the cables that connect the high-voltage transmission system to the home.The regulator’s plans would let them invest £7.2bn in the distribution network, up from the £5.7bn allowed for the present five-year period. The companies are keen to invest heavily in their networks because the return they are allowed to earn is based on the size of their assets.However,Ofgem is permitting price rises of just 5.6 per cent per year on average, adding £4.30 per year to a typical electricity bill, which the industry argues may not be enough to deliver that investment. Ofgem had mooted capping price rises at 5.3 per centThe companies have until January 6 to decide whether to accept the proposed settlement.The Ofgem ruling could affect the planned sale by France’s EDF of its British electricity distribution business, which had been expected to raise more than £4bn. Both Scottish and Southern Energy and National Grid, which runs the UK’s high voltage backbone network, are interested in the business.SSE is the only UK-listed company to run an electricity distribution business. The others are mostly owned by foreign utilities: EDF, Eon of Germany, Iberdrola of Spain, Pennsylvania-based PPL and Iowa-based MidAmerican Energy, which is controlled by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.The companies in the 14 licence regions charge electricity suppliers for the use of their distribution networks. The costs, which are passed on to consumers and account for 16 per cent of an average £443 annual bill, are regulated by Ofgem.Monday’s decision on the pricing framework for the next five-year period, starting in April 2010, took a tough line on a key issue: the assumed cost of capital that distribution companies need to pay for their financing.The lower the assumed cost of capital, the lower the price that the distributors are permitted to charge their customers.Ofgem assumed a weighted average cost of capital of 4.7 per cent in real terms: lower than the 5.1 per cent used by . Ofwat, the water regulator, in its price control decision last monthThe Energy Networks Association, which represents the industry, des-cribed the figure, which is equivalent to 4 per cent after tax, as “considerably lower than anyone had anticipated”.SSE said the figure was also “significantly below” the cost of capital used by Ofgem for other similar recent price reviews.It went on: “Moreover, these were all set before the reassessment of risk and the cost and availability of finance that has characterised global financial markets in the last 18 months.”The company warned it would “have to reassess its appetite for further investment in, and acquisition of, electricity distribution and transmission assets”.The allowed price increases vary widely, from an 11.1 per cent increase for the north-west England and north-west Wales region run by Iberdrola, down to a 4.3 per cent annual cut in southern Scotland, run by the same company.Ofgem argues that there is still scope for companies to earn good returns, if they perform well.It said shareholders in a company that significantly improved efficiency, reliability and customer service could earn returns of up to 13 per cent, while “shareholders in a mismanaged, inefficient company performing poorly could earn as low as 3 per cent”.The regulator identified SSE and Western Power Distribution, owned by PPL of the US, as the most efficient, and EDF as one of the least efficient.None of the companies is yet prepared to reject the proposals, which would trigger a Competition Commission inquiry lasting many months, because they are still studying the more than 500 pages of analysis.Eon said it was “now looking in detail at the final proposals to see the total impact on our business and whether we can deliver the future network Britain needs under these
conditions”.EDF also said it was studying the decision, but has previously raised the possibility that it could welcome an inquiry. It says higher prices are needed to pay for raising the efficiency of the grid to help cut carbon dioxide emissions.Ofgem also announced yesterday that it is to review its policy on takeovers of distribution companies to address possibilities such as a bid for EDF’s operations from National Grid. It insisted that deals would not be held up while the review was under way, but the uncertainty over the financial regulation is likely to prove a more serious obstacle."
11;PPL;PPL Corp;2009-11-06T23:31:38Z;Now you are all in danger of a flying visit;;“Is that wise?” Life has become so hectic that the only way I seem able to communicate with Mr M between 07.00 and 21.00 every day is by e-mail. This particular inquiry came during an exchange that had started with me telling him that we were going to take Cost Centre #1 out for lunch on his 20th birthday. In Newcastle upon Tyne.“Are we going by train or car?” e-mailed Mr M in reply. Neither, I wrote back. We are going by plane. Piloted by me.I am delighted to tell you that I am now a qualified PPL(A) and can take passengers along with me as I cruise the skies of central England. Newcastle upon Tyne is 255 miles from Oxford as the crow flies, and also as I fly. In a little Piper PA28 at about 95 knots it is therefore more than two hours away. But how fabulous to be able to go up for lunch, looking down at everywhere on the way, and then come home again in time for dinner! The poor boy will soon be living in dread of his mother turning up at the drop of a hat.For the one or two of you who have written to condemn me for continuing to fly and suggesting I should be spending the money on school fees instead, let me assure you that if I could have kept everyone in school by giving up flying, I would have. But the whole exercise, which has taken from March 2008 to October 2009, interrupted by a poor August in ’08 and an equally useless July in ’09, has cost less than one term’s school fees for one child. That is not a measure of how cheap it is to learn to fly, it is a measure of how ridiculously expensive our schools have become in the UK.The final three days of my journey towards qualifying as a pilot saw me take my radio telephony exam, my final written exam and then my skills test. I was not surprised that I passed the written exam, Flight Planning and Performance. Most of it is physics and about doing balance/mass calculations: how does the centre of gravity of an aircraft move if you fly for three hours and use up lots of fuel, and so on. In practice, with me at the controls, the answer is straightforward – I weigh so much more than the average female pilot that the aircraft’s centre of gravity doesn’t move much at all. But exams are not real life – all women pilots wear a size 10 dress as far as I can see.Before I submitted my paperwork to the Civil Aviation Authority I bought a new logbook and copied out my original one, which was, I am ashamed to say, a little scruffy. One pilot with an immaculately completed logbook was Sir Keith Park, who even while directing the Battle of Britain and flying around airfields in the summer of 1940 filled his in meticulously. For those of you lucky enough to have been at the unveiling of his statue on Wednesday last, you will have seen a facsimile of a 1940 page from his logbook in the programme. The journey from the idea first mooted in this column in September 2007, that there should be a proper memorial to him in Trafalgar Square, to the arrival of his likeness on the Fourth Plinth, has taken a little longer than my pilot training, but not much. And as both things show, where there is determination, and a lot of support, it is possible to accomplish what might have seemed impossible.I am sad that I never met Sir Keith Park. But I do know that had I told him that I planned to fly to Newcastle upon Tyne, he would have been very unlikely to reply: “Is that wise?”PS. As well as celebrating my new-found status as a pilot, I am also sending out bottles of Krug to the three winners of my reader competition a few weeks ago: Anthony Robson, Sharifah Amirah and Angela Woodburn. And an honourable mention to Alexandra Wilson (“cost centres are people too”) who prefers alcopops to Krug. Thank you everyone who wrote in.mrsmoneypenny@ft.com

the US.The industry is increasingly confident of overturning the US anomaly of not recognising performance rights for sound recordings used in broadcasts, said John Kennedy, chairman and chief executive of IFPI, the music lobby group.“Broadcasters of course are a powerful group, especially with politicians, but a proper performance right in the US would produce hundred of millions of dollars,” he told the Financial Times.Fran Nevrkla, chairman and chief executive of PPL, the UK collecting society which helped to push for the performance rights bill introduced by Washington last December, said Congress had become more sympathetic.“In this area the US finds itself on the same page as Iraq, Iran, North Korea and the Sudan.”Mr Nevrkla set a target of doubling the number of UK businesses covered by public performance licences within five years.PPL would work with local authorities and scan databases to identify those who were not paying.Factory and office owners had no obligation to admit PPL inspectors to their premises but they had a legal obligation to pay if they used music, he said.“Public performance income [in the UK] is getting towards a £50m mark. I’d like to think over the next few years we could double it.”Similar opportunities worldwide led the IFPI to expect collecting society revenues to increase by at least 10 per cent a year, Mr Kennedy said.He added that he intended to tell a meeting of performance rights societies in London this week that they had “greater opportunities than almost anybody else in the industry.”The latest attempt to dispel the idea that music need not be paid for would be conducted in a less confrontational way than during the industry’s early courtroom pursuits of file-sharers, however.“When dealing with pirates, you don’t need to use kid gloves. [But] these people have to be handled with kid gloves,” Mr Kennedy said."

At the building next door, which serves low-cost airlines, passengers are often forced to line up outdoors.Rival airports such as Vienna are capitalising on Warsaw’s troubles and neighbouring Prague, following its own expansion, hopes to become central Europe’s most important hub.Warsaw’s new terminal, initially due for completion in November 2005, has been postponed several times, most recently to the end of June. Polish Airports (PPL), the state-owned company that runs the airport, has begun charging €55,000 ($74,000, £37,000) a day in penalties to the Polish-Spanish consortium responsible for the €180m project, which includes Spain’s Ferrovial, its Polish subsidiary Budimex, and the Estudio Lamelo architecture company.“The delays have real economic consequences for us,” says Pawel Latacz, PPL’s general director. “Traffic in Warsaw could have grown faster if the terminal had been built on time.”So far the departures level of the new building has failed to pass fire safety inspections, which the consortium blames on changes it was forced to make by PPL. The arrivals level opened late last year.Poland has seen a surge in air travel following its entry to the EU in 2004 and the arrival of low-cost airlines. Now Poles who used to travel across the continent by bus are flying, and Warsaw’s creaking airport infrastructure is unable to keep paceIn 2004, 6m people flew out of Warsaw, which increased to more than 8m in 2006. This year more than 9m are expected in a terminal with an official capacity of 3.5m. The new terminal will increase Warsaw’s capacity to 7m passengers a year, which still will not cater for the numbers who currently jostle their way through the antiquated existing terminal.But other Polish airports are growing even faster, and are offering direct international and transcontinental destinations of their own. Krakow had about 800,000 passengers in 2004; this year it is expected to pass 3m.Many of those passengers are flying directly to hubs such as Frankfurt and Heathrow, avoiding Warsaw. The Lot Polish airline is a member of the Star Alliance grouping, as are Germany’s Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines, which have been content to funnel Polish passengers to their own hubs.“Star Alliance already has hubs in Frankfurt, Munich and Vienna and soon will have Berlin. Warsaw is a bit of a sideshow,” says Adrian Furgalski, a transport analyst with the TOR consultancy.While Warsaw struggles, Prague is doing a booming business. The city’s gleaming airport completed its upgrade in 2006 and served 11.5m passengers last year, about a fifth of whom were transit passengers. Prague is catching up with Vienna, the traditional regional hub, which last year carried 16.8m passengers.“We think we can handle up to 25m passengers,” says Jiri Pos, Prague airport’s director of marketing and airline operations, adding that Prague hopes to draw on potential passengers from southern Poland, Slovakia and other new EU countries. “We have no choice but to position Prague as a hub.”The worry for Warsaw is that it may have delayed its airport so long it will have great difficulty catching up with more aggressive rivals."
14;PPL;PPL Corp;2004-12-14T07:24:05Z;Changing their tune for the Chinese market;;If you were walking around one of Beijing’s shopping malls in October you might have heard The Prodigy’s controversial song “Smack My Bitch Up” blaring out of one particular retailer. What makes this unusual is that China’s Ministry of Culture has banned the track from sale because it considers the lyrics offensive. Some might think this fair. But Cyndi Lauper suffered the same fate when the censors decided her song “I Drove All Night” sent out a potentially dangerous message to motorists. Meanwhile, the Rolling Stones were ordered to remove four songs from the Chinese release of the band’s last compilation album, 40 Licks.Yet copies of all these tracks are available in China if you look hard enough because a staggering 95 per cent of music sales are pirate copies, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In fact, the government’s insistence that any foreign record label must submit for approval a translation of all lyrics is partly blamed for fuelling the illegal trade.China may have the largest music piracy market in the world, valued at around $600m by the IFPI, but it is also the second biggest legitimate music market in Asia, with a retail value of $101.6m.This is a long way behind Japan’s $2.4bn, but as China opens up to foreign investment prior to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, international record companies are eyeing China’s long-term sales potential despite the close attention of the censors.China’s legal music business has seen double-digit growth in each year since its accession to the World Trade Organisation in 2001. This was the year Sony Music established the first Chinese-foreign joint record company in the region, Shanghai Epic Music Entertainment, and now all the other music majors have offices in the country.What makes the major and independent record companies optimistic about the future is that the Chinese government has started to understand the importance of the music industry to the economy. When the copyright and trademark laws were tightened in 2001, the number of raids on pirate operations in the major cities such as the rock and dance capital Beijing and China’s home of classical and jazz, Shanghai, increased significantly.Tougher state regulations relating to copyright and intellectual property are due to be published before the end of December.In preparation for the new laws, the UK royalties collection society PPL (Phonographic Performance Ltd) met the fledgling Chinese equivalent, the China Audio Video Association, a few weeks ago to help set up a system similar to the UK model for collecting performance and broadcast royalties.This move will benefit overseas rights’ owners significantly if the government does crack down harder on the pirates.The UK independent labels that visited China in October under the umbrella of the Association of Independent Music (AIM) realise they cannot expect an early return from any investment they make next year.Sales and royalty revenues from China will remain tiny compared with other parts of the world for some time, while a strict licensing quota system remains in place to limit the number of foreign releases.It means smaller record companies may have to be content with getting their artists’ tracks on compilations rather than trying to compete head-on with the majors for the few hundred album licences awarded by the Chinese government each year.The independents have identified other areas from which their acts could earn revenue from China’s 1.3bn population, of which 300m are now referred to as middle class and have disposable income to spend on music.One possible route will be partnerships with international brands looking to raise profile and sales in China. The idea is that global brands will sponsor tours, ask international artists to endorse their products, and pay synchronisation fees to use tracks in ads. Heineken has already sponsored concerts, club tours and DJ competitions in the big cities and artists have even been known to endorse toilets.The growth in mobile phone penetration in China also offers huge sales potential. According to Nortel Networks (China) the number of Chinese people owning a mobile phone will double to around 500m by 2007. The ringback tones market where customers are charged on their normal telephone bill is a growth area, while the ringtone download business will accelerate slowly as more of the population apply for credit cards.”What we know about China and its piracy problems is that the Chinese love music but they do not put a value on it. If we can bring artists into the country via touring or marketing it will create other benefits such as merchandising sales. At the moment it is all about labels getting a foothold,” says Phil Patterson, British Music Industry Export Promoter for UK Trade and Investment.There is plenty of evidence of labels being proactive. Scottish label P3 Music is close to concluding a label deal it negotiated with state-owned China Records, the country’s biggest music company with a catalogue of more than 370,000 albums. It could mean up to nine of P3’s albums are licensed in the territory next year, including a release from girl group The Penny Dainties who will tour China in January. P3 guitarist Martin Taylor will also be touring in China in October 2005. Meanwhile, Proper Records’ jazz artist Tony Kofi will perform at the 2005 Shanghai International Jazz Festival and Cooking Vinyl will release another five albums through local label Shanghai Audio Visual.”China requires a different business model we must all get used to. Unlike in the West, the Chinese have traditionally been more interested in experiencing music than in ownership. CDs are cheap in China but consumers are prepared to pay more to experience music live, for example,” says P3 managing director James Taylor.Charles Kennedy, managing director at Invisible Hands Music, says the high level of piracy could work in the labels’ favour initially because the priority is to get artists’ music distributed as widely as possible and then find ways to make money.”In China that might mean concert tickets, ringtones and product endorsements that will reach hundreds of millions of consumers so who knows what might happen,” he says.Yet John McLellan, a partner at law firm Haldanes based in Hong Kong, warns labels to be realistic about the potential of the Chinese market. “It can be easy to look at its size and think it will be one long gravy train ride over the next decade. But the sector remains highly regulated and there are also substantial cultural and linguistic barriers to overcome. UK record companies need to know which regulatory hoops they must jump through,” he says.steve.hemsley@talk21.com
