Nevertheless, the Serbian government has repeatedly avowed its determination, and some of the assets coming up for sale should attract international interest.The IMF’s executive board approved the three-year precautionary stand-by arrangement (SBA) on February 23, announcing that the programme had three main aims: fiscal consolidation, strengthening the financial sector, and boosting competitiveness and growth through structural reforms.This from a statement by David Lipton, the Fund’s first deputy managing director:“The Serbian economy faces serious fiscal imbalances and entrenched structural weaknesses, in the context of slower growth and adverse regional spillovers. The authorities’ Fund-supported program offers an opportunity to restore public debt sustainability, rebalance macroeconomic policies, enhance financial sector resilience, and improve competitiveness and medium-term growth potential.”Last year, Serbia posted Europe’s largest consolidated budget deficit, at 6.6 per cent of GDP (the consolidated figure was probably even larger), while debt topped 70 percent, well above a theoretical legal limit of 45 per cent.Serbia’s last IMF deal, a €1bn SBA, was suspended in February 2012 due to fast-and-loose fiscal policy under a previous government; the current administration says that is picking up the pieces.The IMF praised the government’s reforms last year, including to labour and pensions laws, and its ownership of budgetary retrenchment. While some feel that this has not yet been as far-reaching as hoped, the Fund endorsed a target of starting to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2017, and issued the usual calls for “improving the public financial management framework”.Like many countries in the region, Serbia has seen the non-performing loan ratio grow in recent years, and the Fund welcomed the government’s commitment to designing and a policy to address this.It stated the squeeze put on the economy by fiscal tightening could be offset by monetary easing, a path that the central bank has already been taking as inflationary pressures have eased. Exchange-rate flexibility also benefits the country, Lipton added – though the dinar’s weakness has been a concern to some in recent years.Upbeat though the IMF’s comments were, investors will be keen to see a clearer roadmap for the Funds three goals of consolidation, fiscal stabilisation and reform.“The IMF confirming the precautionary deal is a positive in the near-term, especially in offsetting the EUR/RSD upside pressures,” Ivana Kovacic, an analyst at Hypo Alpe Adria, told beyondbrics.“However, we think the IMF will want the sovereign to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. In our view, securing the deal was ‘the easier’ step. The challenge will be to maintain the deal for the next three years and seriously embark on all the needed consolidation measures. In that respect, we are waiting for the IMF’s Article IV consultation release to see all the austerity measures the Fund will want to see.”Significantly, the Fund’s statement emphasises the importance of restructuring state-owned enterprises both to reduce pressure on the budget, and as a structural reform measure. The government has prepared a list of more than 500 companies it aims to privatise, and in November Economy Minister Zeljko Sertic told beyondbrics that the programme was on track and attracting substantial international interest.Kovacic says that this process is “so far not going as smoothly as planned”.“We are sceptical about the sovereign’s plan to finalize the SOEs restructuring in this year, bearing in mind sensitive aspects of it (such as optimising the number of employees) and hence, see risks stemming from this.”Some in Serbia are concerned that the public sector lay-offs likely to result from privatisation and restructuring could lead to protests of the sort that have been seen across South Eastern Europe in recent years. But Milan Parivodic, a former minister in economic portfolios who now acts as a consultant to investors in Serbia says that small-scale demonstrations that have cropped up are unlikely to snowball.Parivodic told beyondbrics that Sertic had reassured him that privatisations would go ahead.“The government as every interest in furthering privatisation in one way or another,” Parivodic said. “Serbia is simply not in the position to prolong this process, it has to be completed, the government is determined to make it happen and I understand that the IMF has recognised this intention by confirming the loan.”Telco Telekom Srbija and pharmaceutical company Galenika are expected to be among the more attractive assets on the block, while Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic has been drumming up Chinese interest in engine and tractor manufacturers. Other assets are expected to be rather less appealing.“There could be interest from European, American, Chinese or Indian investors, but Russia is too consumed with its own turmoil,” Parivodic said. “The upsides are that Serbia offers tariff-free access a huge market of hundreds of millions of people, primarily in the EU, but also Russia, EFTA, and Turkey, as well as regional markets. The skilled labour force is also very important. Risks are mainly from red tape.”Serbs and investors alike are now awaiting the government’s next steps.Back to beyondbrics"
1;SBAC;SBA Communications;2012-12-06T11:37:06Z;Investors to Ukraine: get a grip;;"Ukraine’s government has delayed talks with the International Monetary Fund on a billion-dollar loan programme that bankers say is crucial to shoring up confidence and stabilising state finances, triggering yet more confusion and concern among bondholders and other investors.“At the request of the Ukrainian authorities, the IMF mission scheduled to visit Kiev on December 7-17 to initiate discussions on a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) will be rescheduled to the second half of January,” Max Alier, IMF resident representative to Ukraine, announced on Thursday.Less than a week ago, Ukraine asked the IMF to send in a mission. But now: “The Ukrainian authorities have indicated this will allow participation of the new Cabinet of Ministers, following the resignation of former ministers in early December,” Alier added.With its economy teetering on the verge of its second recession in four years, Ukraine’s government is scrambling to accumulate cash to pay off some $10bn in sovereign external debt maturing next year. At the end of last week, the country appeared to be dashing fast for IMF cash.But then, President Viktor Yanukovich accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov.Investors hoped a new, reform-minded premier and government would follow – one ready to meet key IMF loan conditions that Azarov had rejected, starting the unpopular process of removing unsustainable subsidies on household natural gas.But in the days that followed, Yanukovich said Azarov might return as premier. And his ruling majority in parliament adopted a 2013 budget plan based on overly optimistic growth expectations and a deficit equal to 3.3 per cent of GDP.Then on Wednesday, Moody’s downgraded Ukraine by one notch to B3 from B2, preserving its negative outlook.Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow, described the situation as “a confluence of bad news” that “underscores the precarious macroeconomic situation that Ukraine finds itself in”. He wrote:The key to understanding the rates downgrade is the significant widening of the C/A deficit and the inability to attract enough sustainable (read FDI) inflows on the capital account as evidenced by the dangerous worsening of the broad balance from a balanced position in mid-2011 to excess of USD-7bn by end-Sep. This has heightened fears that Ukraine will find it increasingly difficult to meet coming external obligations in the near term.The Moody’s downgrade may be the last straw to push Ukraine into a more conciliatory stance vis-à-vis the IMF. As we have argued before, a new PM will be easier to build rapport with the IMF as he/she will not be encumbered by previous statements about Ukraine’s lack of desire to implement the requisite measures to meet IMF conditionality.Speaking on condition of anonymity, one western banker on the ground in Kiev expressed nervousness about the increasingly unpredictability of Ukraine’s leadership.“Last Friday morning, we were told there was no IMF mission coming. On Friday evening, we were told that the IMF mission was coming. Now they are not coming until late January. Two weeks ago, there was a billion-dollar LNG deal. Now we see there was no deal.“Then Azarov resigns, but the president says he has a strong chance of returning. All of this is happening as the EU itself keeps wondering which way Ukraine is going. Is it staying on an EU integration path or contemplating a shift east to the customs union? All these unpredictable messages and signals make the market wonder what Ukraine really wants and where it is going. It makes me extremely nervous.”Timothy Ash, head of emerging market research at Standard Bank summed up the mood: “Someone needs to get a grip of things in Kiev, and fast.”But is there a semblance of method to Ukraine’s madness?Olena Bilan, chief economist at Kiev-based investment bank Dragon Capital, said:There is, indeed, no reason for the IMF mission to come before the new Cabinet is formed. The old legislature convened its last meeting today, meaning the PM candidate should be approved by the new parliament, which will start working on Dec. 12. As the markets partially price in new IMF deal, any delays in negotiations with the Fund are not helpful. However, one month delay is not crucial for the government, given no external debt redemptions till Jan. 30, 2013, when the next $0.4bn repayment to the IMF comes due.Related reading:

2;SBAC;SBA Communications;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
