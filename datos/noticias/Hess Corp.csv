0;HES;Hess Corp;2018-03-08T13:32:33Z;Hess signals confidence in oil market with $1bn share buyback;;Hess signalled growing confidence in the outlook for the global oil market on Thursday by announcing plans to buy back $1bn of its shares this year.The US oil producer said the new buyback programme was in addition to the $500m plan announced in late 2017.“With a continued positive outlook for oil prices, a successful asset sale program, and increased visibility on production growth, cash flows and capital requirements for future phases of development on our Guyana asset, we can expand the buyback authorisation without compromising our ability to fund this world-class investment,” said chief executive John Hess.Shares in Hess rose more than 3.2 per cent in pre-market trading on the news.The move by Hess comes on the heels of similar buyback plans from other North America energy producers. Devon Energy, Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resources and Anadarko Petroleum are among those that have announced new share buybacks or enlarged existing programmes amid a continued rebound in oil prices.
1;HES;Hess Corp;2017-12-15T00:53:38Z;Elliott calls for urgent changes at oil group Hess;Activist fund loses patience with US exploration company over poor returns;Elliott Management, the activist fund, has called for an urgent shake-up at Hess, the US oil exploration and production company, arguing for changes that could include replacing the chief executive, share buybacks or a takeover by another group.The fund’s loss of patience with Hess, one of the leading oil producers in the Bakken formation of North Dakota, is the latest sign of investors’ growing concerns about poor returns on investment in the US exploration and production industry.In 2013 Elliott, which owns 6.7 per cent of Hess, fought acampaign to improve shareholder returns, achieving changes including asset sales and cost reductions. John Hess, son of the company’s founder Leon Hess, was forced to give up the role of chairman but stayed on as chief executive.Now Elliott is seeking a further shake-up, and says other shareholders agree that management must change course to improve performance.Hess has responded that its board “unanimously and unequivocally supports the company’s current strategy and John Hess as CEO”.Since Elliott and Hess agreed their truce in May 2013, just hours before an investor vote at the company’s annual meeting, its shares have underperformed the market, weighed down by the oil price slump that began in the summer of 2014. Hess shares have dropped about 37 per cent over the past three years, while the S&P 500 index has risen 63 per cent.John Pike, a senior portfolio manager at Elliott, said the fund was “frustrated by the company’s continuing underperformance”.Shareholders are getting impatient, because the changes needed to remedy Hess’s severe undervaluation are substantial . . .He added: “Shareholders are getting impatient because the changes needed to remedy Hess’s severe undervaluation are substantial and need to be announced without delay.”The fund’s ideas for achieving that objective, as well as replacing Mr Hess, include selling Hess’s assets in Malaysia, buying back shares, cutting the company’s dividend, and soliciting a takeover bid, according to people familiar with Elliott’s thinking.Hess is a partner in ExxonMobil’s Liza field in deep water off the coast of Guyana, which is one of the most exciting new offshore oil provinces to be opened up anywhere in the world in the past few years.That project is scheduled to deliver its first oil in 2020, providing a significant boost to Hess’s finances, creating an opportunity to buy back its shares while they are temporarily undervalued, Elliott believes.Hess said in a statement that while it acknowledged these were “challenging times for the entire industry”, it thought Mr Hess and his team had “done an excellent job” in repositioning the company, by developing Liza, selling $3.4bn worth of assets, cutting costs and returning capital to shareholders.
2;HES;Hess Corp;2017-10-15T04:43:32Z;BlackRock and Vanguard’s climate change efforts are glacial;The engagement excuse on global warming is wearing thin, writes Attracta Mooney;BlackRock, a large investor in companies that rely heavily on fossil fuels, does not seem a likely environmentalist.But one year ago, the world’s largest asset manager issued a stark warning about global warming. “Investors can no longer ignore climate change,” said the fund house, which oversees $6tn in assets.The New York-listed company argued that even if one did not agree with the science, investors could not disregard the “swelling tide of climate-related regulations and technological disruption”. Investors, it said, needed to act to protect their portfolios.Yet just a few months later, BlackRock appeared to forget its own warning. Throughout the year to June 2017, the fund house repeatedly voted against resolutions at annual general meetings that called on companies to provide more clarity about how they might be affected by climate change.According to Proxy Insight, the data provider, BlackRock voted against so-called scenario-planning climate change resolutions, which are typically put forward by shareholders and often not supported by management, at 14 oil and gas companies, including Southern Company, Noble Energy and Hess. It backed the measures at just two, the big oil majors ExxonMobil and Occidental.In most cases, the resolutions asked that companies annually assess how they might be affected by measures to limit temperature rises to 2C, in line with the 2015 Paris agreement.BlackRock is not alone in its inconsistent voting. JPMorgan and Vanguard, which have also warned of the risks posed by climate change, failed to back resolutions at 14 companies, but supported them at two. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-largest fund house, supported resolutions at eight oil and gas companies, abstained at five and voted against at three, according to Proxy Insight.This patchy record makes little sense. If a fund house believes climate change could hurt stocks over the longer term, it seems sensible that investors should demand as much information as possible on these risks at all companies.Investors with inconsistent records typically explain the difference in their voting record as “engagement”. Big investors often speak to management privately during the year, and particularly before AGMs, and will try to use their influence to change company policy behind the scenes.This is BlackRock’s explanation for its voting record. It says it takes “climate change seriously and engages with relevant companies”.“We do vote for shareholder proposals on climate when we think our engagement has not led to the change we seek,” BlackRock told FTfm. “We don’t decide how to vote based solely on our views on the issue under consideration. Our vote reflects our assessment of the company’s response to our engagement in light of the long-term financial impact.”But almost two years after the Paris agreement, the excuse of engagement is wearing thin. Climate change will not just affect a few, it has the ability to alter entire sectors radically. And secret discussions will not drive the sector-wide disclosure that is required.As Carolyn Hayman, who co-chairs Preventable Surprises, a lobby group, says: “We are talking about systemic risk from climate change that will effect the whole economy worldwide. [Investors] have a fiduciary duty to understand this.“A case-by-case approach doesn’t get the sector-wide change that is really needed. No one but the people engaging can know what the impact of engaging is. [This] requires a top-down approach rather than company by company.”The climate change issue is here to stay. Even with the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement, governments show few signs of slowing down their drive to limit global warming — including France and the UK, which will both ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040.Investors will of course continue filing resolutions at a wide variety of companies over climate change. But it is now up to the world’s biggest investors to put their vote where their mouth is. A couple of high-profile protest votes that generate nice headlines is no longer good enough.As Ms Hayman says: “A lot of investors are very concerned and are voting against management in really large numbers [on climate change resolutions]. It’s time for Vanguard and BlackRock to get with the project.”Attracta Mooney is the FT’s investment correspondent
3;HES;Hess Corp;2017-07-23T16:46:51Z;US oil output growth hit by lack of operators and equipment;Number of drilled but uncompleted wells rises sharply;"US oil production growth this year is on course to be significantly lower than government forecasts, as companies struggle to find the operators and equipment they need to complete the wells they have drilled, according to a new energy research firm.The steady rise in shale oil output from the US has weighed on global crude prices but the projections Kayrros, a Paris-based research firm backed by former Schlumberger chief executive Andrew Gould, suggest there may be less oil coming than expected coming on to world markets over the next few months. This would help support oil prices that have already risen about 10 per cent since the Brent benchmark dipped below $45 per barrel last month.The signs of capacity shortages are also good news for oilfield services companies such as Halliburton and Schlumberger, enabling them to raise rates after steep cuts during the industry downturn that began in 2014, but suggest the profitability of US oil and gas producers will remain under pressure.Once a shale well has been drilled it needs hydraulic fracturing or fracking and other procedures to start production. The number of drilled but uncompleted wells, often known as DUCs, in the US main shale oil and gas regions has been rising sharply this year, going from 4,944 last December to 6,031 in June, according to the US government’s Energy Information Administration.Kayross argues that the number will continue to rise, slowing the growth of US oil output. By October, the firm sees onshore US production in the lower 48 states growing by 560,000 barrels per day from the end of last year to 7.09m, compared to the 900,000 b/d increase forecast by the EIA.Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, said: “The fracking industry is taking time to ramp up; there are not enough crews available to complete all the wells that have been drilled.”Activity in the US shale industry has been recovering for more than a year, even though companies have in aggregate been unable to cover their capital expenditures from operating cash flows at present oil and gas prices.The number of wells being drilled in the US has more than doubled, from 2,168 in the second quarter of 2016 to 4,433 in the equivalent period of this year, according to S&P Global PlattsRigData.As the recovery continues, capacity constraints have started to emerge. Brad Handler, an analyst at Jefferies, estimated that if all the wells being drilled in the US were to be brought into production promptly, they would need about 14m horsepower of pump capacity for the fracking to complete them, and the industry actually had only about 12m horsepower of active capacity. He said prices for fracking services had nearly doubled from their lows a year ago, although they were still below their peak in 2014.Patrick Schorn, vice-president for new ventures at Schlumberger, the oilfield services group, said on a call with analysts on Friday that its revenues from US hydraulic fracturing in the second quarter were up 68 per cent from the first quarter, and its capacity was already fully booked well into the fourth quarter.The number of rigs drilling the horizontal wells used for shale oil production last week dropped for a second week in succession, the first such fall since May 2016, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group, in a sign that financial pressures and the decline in crude prices between April and June may have constrained activity.Nevertheless, the larger exploration and production companies including EOG Resources, Hess, Pioneer Natural Resources and Marathon Oil have been saying that their “2017 plans are more or less set at this point”, Paul Sankey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note earlier this month.Some analysts believe that the capacity constraints will ease by the start of next year. Mr Rostand said that DUCs would be available to be brought into production in the future, but their contribution could be offset by a slowdown in activity and declining drilling productivity."
4;HES;Hess Corp;2017-03-08T23:38:31Z;Light dims from energy stocks as glow of higher oil prices fades;With a fall of 6.7 per cent, energy is worst performer of 11 major sectors on S&P 500;Having outperformed the wider US stock market in 2016, energy stocks are no longer feeling the glow of higher oil prices to the same degree as other costs start to offset the benefits.This year the energy sector, which is made up of major oil producers as well as oil servicing companies, is the worst performer of 11 major sectors on the S&P 500. It is down 6.7 per cent compared with a 5.7 per cent rise for the broader index.While oil prices have fallen this year, the declines have been modest. Brent crude is down 3 per cent, while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, has declined 2.8 per cent.Part of the sharper weakness in energy stocks is down to profit-taking by investors on last year’s advance and a rotation into other sectors that have been lifted by the election of Donald Trump as US president, according to Ebele Kemery, portfolio manager and head of energy investing at JPMorgan Asset Management.But energy companies are facing fresh headwinds. In particular, Ms Kemery points to rising service costs — or all the inputs from labour to the sand used for shale that go into producing oil.“Service costs are increasing in part because of the tight labour market,” she said. “During the downturn a lot of people lost jobs, the industry consolidated, and that labour force has moved into other sectors. That has left a labour shortage.”What is more, some oil producers, especially those with lower credit ratings, will have already hedged the price before it began its rebound. That means they have already fixed the price they can sell it, so they don’t feel the benefit of the rise.There are other factors at play beyond crude for energy companies. The price of Nymex April gas futures is down 18 per cent from the start of this year, helping make Southwestern Energy the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 energy sector with a 29 per cent drop. Chesapeake Energy and Hess are also among the worst performers on the benchmark index this year, with declines of 27 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively.“Crude oil is not the only game in town,” said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities. “Natural gas names in particular have been punished. [And] gasoline crack and heating oil crack have been pounded, so refiners have been down.”It is a sharp contrast to last year when the energy sector led the advance on the benchmark index, rising nearly 24 per cent as the price tracked prospects of a global deal to cut supply that eventually arrived in November.Opec and other non-cartel members, including Russia, struck a deal to curb output by 1.6m barrels a day in the first half of this year. That, alongside hopes of softer regulations after Mr Trump’s victory, helped the stocks of energy companies rebound from the steep declines in 2015.
5;HES;Hess Corp;2017-01-25T13:13:01Z;Quarterly losses at Hess widen to near $5bn;;Hess continued to bleed red ink during the fourth quarter, with the US oil and gas explorer posting a $4.89bn net loss as low crude prices force it to cut the value of its assets and pull back on production.The company’s loss for the final three months of last year compares to the loss of $1.82bn in the year ago period. Revenue for the quarter held steady at $1.38bn.Like other energy companies, Hess has struggled in the wake of the collapse in global crude prices. But while some big oil majors have been able to lean on their “downstream” refining business to help stem some of the bleeding from its “upstream” oil exploration and production unit, this has not been the case for Hess.Under pressure from activist shareholder Elliot Management, the company announced plans to exit its refining business in 2013 to focus on what was then the more profitable work of exploring for and extracting oil and gas. It followed up a year later with the sale of its iconic gas station chain to Marathon Petroleum for $2.87bn.Of the near $5bn net loss recorded during the fourth quarter, Hess said a big part of that is related to a $3.75bn “noncash charge to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets.” The company is also taking a $693m impairment charge to its Equus gas project and $145m in “after tax charges”. Excluding these, adjusted net loss came in at $305m, compared to the $396m loss in the year ago period and smaller than the $321m loss the market was expecting.But in a sign that Hess thinks the worst of the oil price slump could be over, the company is increasing its production and exploratory spending for 2017 to $2.25bn. That’s up from the $414m spent in 2016 and the $943m spent in 2015.“We see 2017 as the start of an exciting new chapter of value-driven growth for our company and our shareholders,” said chief executive John Hess.“We are increasing activity in the Bakken, our two offshore developments at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the Gulf of Mexico are on track to come online in 2017 and 2018, and the Liza Field in Guyana is one of the industry’s largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years.”Shares in the company, up 50 per cent over the past 12 months, rose 0.2 per cent in pre-market trading.
6;HES;Hess Corp;2017-01-12T15:35:19Z;Hess shares fall 8% even as it eyes more capital spending in 2017;;Hess shares fell by the most in 11 months on Thursday after the energy company announced it would take more than $4.6bn in charges for the fourth quarter, even as it prepares to nudge up capital and exploratory spending in the coming year.The glimpses of optimism in Hess’s 2017 capital and exploratory budget were not enough to keep investors from selling off its shares on Thursday, with its stock retreating quickly from a modest pre-market gain to shed more than 8 per cent at the start of trading.The company had announced it would take more than $4.6bn in charges in the fourth quarter related to various issues, including its decision to defer further development in the Equus natural gas field off the coast of Australia.Nevertheless, Hess seems to be eyeing slightly bolder action in 2017, with rebounding oil prices spurring energy companies more broadly to start shifting out of survival mode and revive postponed projects.Hess said on Thursday that it had set an exploratory and capital budget of $2.25bn for 2017, up from the $1.9bn actual spend in 2016. Among the projects Hess is eyeing for the coming year include increasing from two to six the number of rigs it has in the US Bakken formation, development activities in Guyana and restarting drilling at the Valhall Field in Norway, according to the company.Those and other planned 2017 activities are forecast to boost production as much as 12 per cent from the beginning until the end of the year, Hess said, with net production for the year expected to average between 300,000 and 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, excluding Libya.Hess chief executive John Hess said the budget “reflects our balanced approach to investing in short-cycle and long-cycle growth options while maintaining our financial flexibility.”While the budget represents a modest increase from last year’s actual spend, it is still significantly less than the $4bn it actually spent on capital and exploratory items in 2015, before oil companies began to implement deep cuts following oil prices’ crash from more than $100 a barrel in 2014.But following an agreement between producer nations both inside and outside the Opec cartel in December, prices have been climbing back steadily, with both Brent crude and the US West Texas Intermediate benchmark trading above $50 a barrel.
7;HES;Hess Corp;2016-10-20T12:04:45Z;Oil producers optimistic that the slump is over;But companies are divided over whether a supply crunch is coming after huge cuts;As several of the world’s top oil executives rolled up at a Mayfair hotel in London this week for an industry summit, Brent crude, their benchmark product, was trading at $52 per barrel — exactly same the level as a year ago.This might not seem like a cause for celebration. But, after the brutal retrenchment since prices collapsed from above $100 per barrel in mid-2014, the near 12-month highs of recent days have added to confidence that the worst is over for oil producers.“We are at the end of a considerable downturn,” said Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister and chairman of Saudi Aramco, the state-controlled oil company, at the annual Oil & Money conference. “The fundamentals are improving and the market is rebalancing.”His comments were echoed in London by executives, traders and investors from across the sector, reflecting the steady rise in optimism since members of Opec, the oil producers’ cartel led by Saudi, reached a provisional agreement last month to curb output. Brent has risen by 15 per cent in the past three weeks and by three-quarters since a 12-year low of less than $30 per barrel in January.There have been tentative signs of the upturn spurring renewed investment. A US explorer called Extraction Oil & Gas last week raised $644m in the biggest energy listing since the oil price crash. Meanwhile, the number of drilling rigs active worldwide — a proxy for exploration — has risen for the past four consecutive months after falling for most of the previous year.Recovery is clearest in the US, where the rig count is up by a quarter since May after declining by three-quarters since 2014. Activity is concentrated in shale oil and gas reserves which, owing to their relatively low costs and high flexibility, are being remobilised faster than conventional resources.It is too soon, however, to declare a wider resurgence of animal spirits in the oil and gas industry. Tom Ellacott, head of corporate research at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy, says the deep investment freeze of the past two years will take longer to thaw beyond the onshore US. “The sector is moving beyond survival into the recovery phase. But companies are still cautious with a focus on capital discipline and cash flow.”The scale of the industry’s contraction has been epic in its proportions. Capital expenditure on exploration and production has fallen from about $700bn in 2014 to $400bn this year and, according to Wood Mac, $1tn of planned E&P work has been cancelled or deferred.The 2.7bn barrels of new reserves discovered last year was the smallest amount for almost 70 years and just a tenth of the long-term average. This year is on course to be even lower.The slump has led some industry leaders to warn of supply shortages in years ahead unless the brakes on spending are loosened. Saudi Arabia says the proposed action by Opec to put a floor under prices will help incentivise more drilling.Wood Mac estimates that 20m barrels a day of new production needs to be developed by 2025 to meet rising demand, and replace existing fields that are in decline. “There’s a crunch coming,” says Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Standard Chartered. “We need a signal to the market that more supply is needed.”Not everyone shares his sense of urgency. Several industry leaders told the London conference that the ability of US shale producers to quickly ramp up production would keep a ceiling on prices. Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said this meant that justifying big investments in conventional exploration would continue to be hard. “Those free-spending days are over,” he said, referring to the era of $100-per-barrel oil.Mr Lance and other executives described a shift away from high-risk, multiyear exploration in far-flung offshore frontiers — instead companies were focused on improving the efficiency of existing operations while looking to add new resources in places where infrastructure is already in place. “In the 1990s and 2000s the industry needed mega projects for growth,” said Mr Lance. “[Shale] oil has changed those economics. Companies are looking for shorter-cycle projects . . . you need the flexibility to throttle up and throttle down.”An example of this shift was BP’s decision last week to drop multibillion-dollar plans for a complex and environmentally contentious new development in the Great Australian Bight — a marine park off the south coast of Australia. Another big BP project called Mad Dog 2 in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to go-ahead, but it is an expansion of an existing field and its estimated cost has been cut from $20bn when first proposed to $9bn today. As Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, said: “Investments are back. But it’s only going to be the very best.”Royal Dutch Shell said offshore exploration could still be competitive provided costs were rigorously controlled. Andy Brown, head of Shell’s upstream business, said the oil price needed for some of the group’s new deepwater projects to be profitable had fallen from $70 per barrel to $45. Savings came from simplification and standardisation of designs and processes, and by driving a harder bargain with suppliers.“The mantra is value over volume,” said Mr Ellacott. “Projects will not get sanctioned unless they meet strict rates of return. We are going to see more activity but mainly in the real sweet spots, like offshore Brazil, where the economics are most attractive.”John Hess, chief executive of Hess Corporation, one of the largest independent US oil companies, said prices would have to reach between $60 and $80 per barrel before a wider resurgence in investment can take root. “If $100 was too high for the world, $50 is too low for the industry. It will have to be somewhere in between.”Weakness in the oil market has been bad for mergers and acquisitions because of the difficulty of reaching agreement on valuations. Buyers have demanded fire sale prices, while sellers have been holding out for better offers.Excluding Royal Dutch Shell’s $50bn takeover of BG Group unveiled last year — the industry’s only true megamerger of the past decade — the number of deals worth over $1bn fell from 46 in 2014 to only 14 in 2015. This was the lowest for over a decade, according to Wood Mackenzie. However, there has been a gradual upturn this year driven by renewed interest in US shale oil and gas.A $1.6bn deal on Tuesday for SM Energy to buy shale acreage in west Texas added to more than $30bn of M&A in US exploration and production in 2016. Half of it has come in the Permian basin, an area of Texas and New Mexico with among the country’s most economically attractive reserves.“Costs have come down so much that people in the productive basins like the Permian can make things work,” says Ian Taylor, chief executive of Vitol, the oil trading company. which sold a Texas crude terminal and pipeline system to Sunoco for $760m last month.Bankers say stabilisation in the oil market could encourage wider revival in M&A by narrowing the price gap between buyers and sellers. Several cash-rich private equity-backed investors are looking for assets in the North Sea and beyond, while some oil majors are under pressure to shed assets to shore up their balance sheets.As for acquisitions by majors, Statoil and ExxonMobil each struck deals worth $2.5bn in July to buy assets in Brazil and Papua New Guinea, respectively.However, executives say that, after a two-year clampdown on capital expenditure, they have plenty of in-house investment options before they go shopping outside for growth. One US executive expresses a preference to buy shale acreage rather than a whole company, saying many groups had significant debts.
8;HES;Hess Corp;2016-07-13T20:34:08Z;Juno Therapeutics surges as drug trial suspension lifted;US equities maintain ground after move into record territory as energy sector slips;Juno Therapeutics shares shot higher on Wednesday after a suspension of its experimental cancer treatment trial was lifted by the US Food and Drug Administration.Last week, the FDA ordered the Seattle-based company to halt the Phase II clinical trial of its drug, JCAR015, after two patient deaths. But Juno said late on Tuesday that the FDA removed the clinical hold on the trial in adult patients with a type of blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and revised the protocol for the treatment.The news spurred shares in Juno higher by 20 per cent to $33.19 at one point, but they later gave up some ground, closing the day 9.5 per cent higher at $30.42. The gains trimmed the share’s year-to-date losses to 30.8 per cent.Juno is among a group of companies developing a new type of cancer therapy, which involves extracting a patient’s white blood cells, modifying them in a laboratory so they can recognise and attack cancer, and then reinjecting them into the patient.“The rapid response from the FDA and the allowance of some flexibility [mid-trial] in the preconditioning regimen could be interpreted as an early signal that if the impressive rates of patient response and improvements in overall survival continue, as they have so far, the first CAR-T therapies . . . could gain approval as early as 2017,” said Jason McCarthy, analyst at Maxim Group.The advance in Juno shares arrived as US stocks struggled to hold on to their gains after the S&P 500 closed in record territory for the first two days of the trading week.At the close, the S&P 500 was little-changed at 2,152.4, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 18,372.1, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3 per cent to 5,005.7.Energy experienced the biggest decline among the S&P’s 10 major sectors, down 0.7 per cent, as an unexpected build in inventories of US gasoline pushed crude prices lower.Chesapeake Energy shares fell 5 per cent to $4.35 — the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 energy sector index. Meanwhile, Hess shares fell 3.5 per cent to $58.02, ConocoPhillips shares dropped 2.1 per cent to $42.87 and Halliburton shares declined 1.8 per cent to $45.21.Elsewhere, shares in Darden Restaurants slipped 0.2 per cent to $62.68 after analysts at Wells Fargo downgraded the company behind Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse to “market perform” from “outperform”.The downgrade was driven by a deterioration in same-store sales and the company’s plans to reinvest its cost savings, marking “a departure from FY16 when cost savings were dropped to the bottom line driving a five-quarter run of approximately 20 per cent EPS upside”, Jeff Farmer, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said.Elsewhere, shares in Host Hotels & Resorts fell 4 per cent to $16.48, after analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “neutral” and lowered their price target by $1 to $15.The cut was motivated in part by the company’s “high exposure to urban and gateway markets [specifically New York City], and therefore adverse supply growth, Airbnb and US dollar impact,” said Joseph Greff, an analyst at JPMorgan. The recent outperformance in Host’s shares compared to its peers and the S&P also prompted the cut from the bank.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
9;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;HES;Hess Corp;2016-06-12T10:22:16Z;Oil majors find virtue in integration;Slump in crude prices highlights benefits in owning upstream and downstream businesses;He was reporting record losses amid a prolonged industry downturn, and facing a big shareholder revolt against his 20 per cent pay rise. But Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, did manage to find one bright spot amid the gloom at the company’s annual meeting.“Not so long ago I used to hear a lot of advice about how we should separate out our downstream business and sell it off,” he told shareholders in April. “I don’t hear that so much any more.”Mr Dudley was reflecting what executives at the largest energy companies have been saying for the past year or so: that this downturn, the worst in 30 years, has vindicated the business model of the “vertically integrated” oil groups. These companies combine the upstream activities of finding and developing oilfields with downstream functions such as refining crude and selling petroleum products.As in many other industries, oil companies have been facing growing pressure to become more focused. However, since the collapse in crude prices began in mid-2014, that pressure has gone into abeyance. Low prices have crushed profits from oil and gas production, but helped refining and chemicals businesses, supporting integrated groups’ earnings.Yet while the questions over the value of integration may have eased off for a while, they are unlikely to have disappeared for good.There are two principal benefits from being an integrated company. One, in the words of Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, is that it “captures the highest value for every molecule that flows through our facilities”.As he explained it to analysts in March, Exxon can adjust its production to serve the most profitable markets.“We react more effectively and rapidly to changes in the business environment,” said Mr Tillerson. “Our global supply organisation utilises sophisticated demand planning and marketing tools that provide insights to achieve the best value for our upstream production.”The second professed benefit of the integrated model has come into focus during the oil slump: that owning both upstream and downstream businesses creates a hedge against a drop in the price of crude.In 2014, Royal Dutch Shell generated $16.5bn in profit from its upstream operations and $6.3bn downstream. The following year, the balance flipped: upstream earnings slumped to just $1.8bn, while downstream profits remained roughly flat, adjusting for one-off items.John Abbott, Shell’s head of downstream, says: “The business is very cyclical. Sometimes value will be in the upstream . . . sometimes it will be in the downstream. I’ve lost count, to be honest, over the last 35 years, how many times that has happened.”Weak oil prices helped refiners last year as crude fell faster than the value of refined products, boosting margins. BP reported average refinery margins of $17 a barrel last year, up 18 per cent compared with 2014.For more than 20 years, both of those putative benefits derived from integration have been challenged.Advocates for break-up accepted downstream profits could provide stability during an oil price slump, but argued the costs of the added complexity outweighed the benefits.They also pointed out physical integration — companies refining their own crude — was dwindling. Frederic Choumert of Roland Berger suggests most large international companies might run only 20 per cent of their production through their own refineries.The financial crisis subdued those break-up calls for a while, but as markets recovered the pressure re-emerged. In 2011, researchers at Oppenheimer argued large US oil groups could raise their valuations 20 per cent by spinning off their refining and marketing operations.A few US companies acted on those recommendations. Marathon Oil spun off its downstream operations as Marathon Petroleum in 2011, and ConocoPhillips did the same with Phillips 66 in 2012.Under pressure from Elliott Associates, an activist investor, Hess sold off its terminals and pulled out of refining in 2013, to focus on production.At first glance, the slump in oil prices since 2014 might seem to have made those moves look rash. In the past two years, Hess shares have dropped by 34 per cent, Conoco’s by 41 per cent and Marathon Oil’s by 61 per cent.But adding in the performance of the spun off refining businesses, the break-ups do not look like big mistakes. The weighted average total shareholder return for Conoco and Phillips 66 since the 2012 split, including dividends, has been 40 per cent. Over the same period. Chevron’s total shareholder return has been 12 per cent and Exxon’s 18 per cent.Mr Choumert argues if oil companies want to remain in upstream and downstream activities, they have to show investors there are real advantages to the model, whether in terms of scale and financial strength, or in physical integration.Some companies have been responding to those concerns. BP has restructured its US downstream operations, selling two refineries, to focus on those that are closely linked to its marketing businesses.Tufan Erginbilgic, BP’s head of downstream, says: “We are trying to create differentiated business models so we can generate differentiated returns . . . Then we are not going to have one good month for the company and another month not good.”Some companies are even expanding their downstream operations. Total is planning to get involved in building more liquefied natural gas terminals and power plants, to drive demand for the gas it produces.None of this, however, means the argument for splitting up vertically integrated companies has gone for good, not least because refining margins have slipped back again this year.Occo Roelofsen, a senior partner at McKinsey, which has published multiple papers in the past advocating break-up, says the argument looks weaker now.“The debate has shifted because large companies have improved their performance and lowered their costs during the downturn more than we thought,” he says.Mr Choumert, however, thinks there will still be pressure for change, especially at smaller integrated companies such as Repsol of Spain.“I would not be surprised if there is a move made on them to try to get them to realign their business.”The arguments over what segments of the oil value chain belong in the same company stretch back more than 150 years.John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil took control of the US oil business in the 1870s by dominating the refining and transport industries, which gave him leverage over the fragmented production companies, but it was not initially a significant producer.Standard subsequently acquired more wells, and by the end of the century accounted for 32 per cent of US crude output, according to Ron Chernow in Titan, his magisterial biography of Rockefeller. Even so, Standard’s position in the upstream industry was always weaker than its grip on refining and transport. At the time of its break-up in 1911, it owned 70 per cent of US refining capacity, but only 14 per cent of its crude productionIn the 1950s and 60s, when the cartel of large western companies known as “the seven sisters” controlled the global market, owning the entire value chain helped them maintain their dominance.In the 1960s and 70s, though, the oil-producing countries of the Middle East and North Africa took control of their industries with a series of nationalisations. Western companies were forced to range further afield in search of reserves, to Alaska, sub-Saharan Africa and central Asia, and as they did so their refineries became increasingly distant from their wells, according to Richard Forrest of AT Kearney.The emergence of a truly liquid global spot market for crude in the 1980s made it less important for companies to lock up supply chains internally to ensure reliable flows of crude. Physical integration — companies processing their own crude in their refineries — went into decline.

It also yanked about $10bn from its market value.LinkedIn generates the bulk of its sales through services that utilise its userbase to provide products that help companies find job candidates and generate business-to-business sales.That is one reason why analysts homed in on LinkedIn’s announcement that it will close its Lead Accelerator business, which it launched only last year.LinkedIn said demand for the product that lets companies target ads to specific audiences was “solid,” but it “required more resources than anticipated to scale”.LinkedIn plans to incorporate the technology into its Sponsored Content unit but may take a $50m hit to revenue this year as part of the plan, it said.Analysts said the move represented a gamble that could pay off by helping LinkedIn focus more closely on businesses that it can grow, but some wondered if LinkedIn was too quick to dismiss a group with substantial potential.“We think it is making a gigantic mistake stepping back on investment in its ad network,” said Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest, in a note to clients.Three Wall Street banks downgraded the stock to hold on Friday.Shares in US oil company Hess fell 12.54 per cent to $38.02 after it priced a stock sale to strengthen its balance sheet amid a slump in crude prices that began nearly 20 months ago.The sale is made up of 25m shares at $39 a piece and 10m depository shares at $50 a share, which could see the company raise about $1.4bn after deducting certain fees.Hess, which last week reported its first annual loss in 13 years, said it will also use the money for its “longer term capital needs”.Hanesbrands was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500, falling more than 15 per cent to $24.96, after the retailer issued a 2016 sales outlook that missed analysts’ expectations.The North Carolina-based company said it expects sales of $5.8bn to $5.9bn in fiscal 2016, below analysts’ forecasts for $6.3bn.That came alongside fourth-quarter profits of $119.2m or 30 cents a share, and sales that declined 7.4 per cent to $1.4bn, also shy of estimates.Shares in Tyson Foods jumped as much as 13.5 per cent to a record high of $58.95 after the US meat processor raised its full-year profit forecast as feed costs declined. They closed 9.9 per cent up.The Arkansas-based company now expects fiscal 2016 earnings in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share, up from $3.50 to $3.65 a share. That topped analysts’ expectations for $3.63 a share.Consumer and technology stocks weighed heavily on the S&P 500. By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.85 per cent to 1,879.91, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.29 per cent to 16,203.49 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.25 per cent to 4,363.43.
12;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Three US shale producers slash capital spending plans;Continental, Hess and Noble react to collapse in crude oil prices;"Three leading US shale oil producers have announced steep cuts in their planned capital spending, as they set their budgets to respond to the collapse in crude prices.Two of them also forecast that their oil and gas production would fall, showing how the financial squeeze on US companies is having a growing impact on the country’s output of crude.Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, controlled by its founder Harold Hamm, said it would cut capital spending by 66 per cent this year to $920m, following a 46 per cent reduction last year.New York-based Hess said it would cut spending by 40 per cent this year, following a 29 per cent cut in 2015. Noble Energy, based in Houston, said it planned a 50 per cent cut in spending for 2016, as it also reduced its quarterly dividend from 18 cents per share to 10 cents.Mr Hamm said Continental’s budget “confirms our intense focus on cash flow neutrality”: ensuring capital spending is covered by cash the business generates so the company does not need to raise additional financing.Greg Hill, chief operating officer of Hess, said it planned to “reduce activity at all of our producing assets” and would “pursue further cost reductions and efficiency gains”.John Hess, chief executive, said the company’s focus would be on “preserving the strength of our balance sheet”.Kenneth Fisher, chief financial officer at Noble, said its capital spending and dividend cuts were ""part of a comprehensive effort to spend within cash flow"" and reduce the company's debts.External financing from debt and equity markets for small and midsized US oil and gas producers slowed sharply in the second half of last year.Continental, Hess and Noble are the first US oil companies to announce budgets following the slump in crude prices this year to about $31 per barrel on Tuesday.The costs of drilling and completing wells in the US has fallen sharply — in some cases by 40 per cent in the past year — but not as fast as oil prices.The slowdown in activity at both Continental and Hess means their production is set to decline.Continental predicted average output of 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, down 5 to 9 per cent from 2015.Hess said production would be 330,000 to 350,000 b/d for 2016, a drop of 7 to 12 per cent from its rate in the first nine months of last year.Noble did not predict a fall in production, but said it expected oil and gas sales to be ""consistent"" with last year's levels at abut 390,000 b/d.The declines mark a sharp reversal from the rapid growth of the US oil industry in recent years.Continental’s production grew by an estimated 24 to 26 per cent last year, the company has said, while Hess’s output for the first nine months of last year was 19 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 2014.US oil production is expected to drop by 1.2m b/d, or 12 per cent, between its peak in April 2015 and the end of 2016.Continental’s net debt was about $7.1bn at the end of September. Noble also had net debt of about $7bn, while Hess’s was $2.95bn.Mr Hess said his company was “well positioned to navigate the current low oil price environment with one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions” among the US independent oil companies.Continental and Hess are among the largest operators in the Bakken formation of North Dakota, one of the centres of the US oil boom of the past seven years, and also have other American shale assets.Hess in addition has offshore oil and gasfields in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, Malaysia and Guyana.Continental said that, as well as cutting spending, it was building up a backlog of “drilled but uncompleted” wells that could be completed and brought into production as oil prices recovered.It expects to have 195 of these “DUCs”, as uncompleted wells are known, in the Bakken formation by the end of the year, up from 135 at the end of 2015."
13;HES;Hess Corp;2015-12-16T19:10:31Z;End of US oil export ban brings only light relief;Domestic producers to compete for foreign markets for first time since 1970s oil embargoes;Washington lawmakers’ agreement to end 40-year-old restrictions on US crude oil exports provides some cheer for beleaguered energy companies as prices sit near their lowest level in seven years.The move will eventually allow domestic producers to compete for customers overseas for the first time since the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970s.But the world should not expect a flood of American oil anytime soon.Energy markets have changed since legislators first took up the cause of US producers suffering extreme price discounts for their crude. What was a domestic glut brought on by soaring shale oil production has spread overseas, with strong output from other countries building up global inventories as well.“You would be selling crude oil from the United States into a globally saturated market,” says Sarah Emerson, principal at ESAI Energy, a research group.That means that the clamour heard for US oil almost two years ago has quieted. West Texas Intermediate crude of the US now sells for about a dollar less than international benchmark Brent, a spread that hardly makes it worthwhile to ship cargoes from Texas to Europe, for example.Congress authorised the export ban in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo led to queues at petrol stations. At the time, crude export restrictions were needed to effect an economic policy that included price controls. But when price controls were abolished, the ban survived.As the US imported ever more crude, the ban for years was irrelevant for energy policy specialists. But as energy companies began to tap shale oil, imports fell sharply. The light, high-quality barrels extracted from regions such as Texas and North Dakota had difficulty finding enthusiastic buyers among oil refineries configured to digest heavier grades.Earlier this year, WTI’s discount to Brent was briefly more than $10 a barrel, prompting shale producers such ConocoPhillips and Continental Resources and their lobbyists to redouble their push to overturn the ban.The ban is porous: crude may be exported to Canada with a licence, for example, and the Obama administration in the past two years has also liberalised trade with Mexico and in an ultralight oil known as condensate. Through these avenues, US oil exports earlier this year rose as high as 600,000 b/d — more than the output of Ecuador, an Opec member.Michael Wojciechowski of consultants Wood Mackenzie says that in near future, allowing crude exports will probably redraw the map of destinations for US crude away from its near neighbours rather than boost overall volumes.“It might actually be a while before you see a net new barrel exported from the United States,” he says. “We are exporting barrels to eastern Canada and Mexico. What’s going to happen in the first instance is an optimisation of those exports.”Shares of US oil and gas exploration and production companies fell 2.4 per cent as WTI futures lurched down 4 per cent to $35.71 a barrel at midday in New York.In the longer term, the congressional agreement could be bad news for US refiners that have enjoyed fat profit margins by processing relatively cheap US crude into petrol and diesel sold at global prices.However, refinery investors seemed unbothered by the deal on Wednesday, with shares of Valero and PBF Energy each up 1 per cent. The legislation includes a tax credit for independent refiners, some of which are disadvantaged by another law that requires coastwise shipments of US crude to sail in more expensive US tankers.Oil producers were buoyant. John Hess, chief executive of Hess, a midsized independent US oil producer, says the decision “would have far reaching benefits for our country”, adding jobs, boosting investment in the US industry, and enhancing global energy security.Many Democrats had initially questioned the need to overturn the ban, raising concerns it would raise petrol prices and potentially increase greenhouse gas emissions as lower prices stimulated more consumption.Environmental groups reacted with fury to the lifting of the ban.Jason Kowalski of 350.org, which campaigns on climate change, calls the decision “political cowardice” and says: “This is a good reminder that, when left to their own devices, politicians will still cave to the power of ExxonMobil and their partners in crime.”For the package to win support from Democrats in Congress and from the Obama administration, it had to include extensions of tax credits for wind and solar power as well. The administration has said it opposes liberalisation of crude exports, but President Barack Obama is not expected to veto the bill on those grounds.US oil output has been in retreat since a peak of 9.6m barrels per day in April as producers slashing drilling campaigns in response to the plunge in crude prices. It is not clear that life without an export ban will do much to stimulate additional production, as the oil industry and environmentalists have argued. Under its reference case, Energy Information Administration economists concluded that allowing unfettered exports would not add any barrels of production by 2025.Jim Burkhard, vice-president of IHS, a consultant, says lifting the export ban would nevertheless embolden producers as they ponder future investment.“For US crude oil producer, that would remove a layer of uncertainty about price,” he says. “It would be a boost to confidence.”Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington
14;HES;Hess Corp;2015-12-09T11:57:30Z;Review of ‘Hess: The Last Oil Baron’;A vivid father and son story spanning eight decades of energy industry upheaval;"The elegiac subtitle of Hess: The Last Oil Baron reflects its authors’ view that no one could ever again have a career like Leon Hess. They make a convincing case.Born in 1914 to immigrant parents in Asbury Park, New Jersey, Leon Hess started out selling heating oil from a second-hand truck at the age of 19, when the US was still in the Great Depression. He became one of America’s most prominent oilmen, doing deals with Muammer Gaddafi and the Shah of Iran, owning a big stake in the New York Jets football team when they achieved their only Super Bowl victory in 1969, and being investigated by the special prosecutor into the Watergate affair because of his support for President Richard Nixon.Hess, the company he built, was an international empire, a “mini-Exxon” encompassing oil wells, storage tanks, refineries, a trading house and fuel stations. He even managed to establish toy trucks with the company’s distinctive green and white logo as much-loved American icons.It is a terrific story, and Tina Davis and Jessica Resnick-Ault, experienced energy reporters now at Bloomberg and Reuters respectively, tell it well.They are stronger on strategy than personality. John Hess, Leon’s only son and chief executive of Hess since 1995, rejected Davis and Resnick-Ault’s request for help, as did the rest of the family, and it shows.Still, there are enough colourful characters and anecdotes to make for an absorbing read. There are some terrific details, such as one of Gadaffi’s officials putting a gun on the table as he negotiated with Hess.Davis and Resnick-Ault also have a nice turn of phrase, particularly on the subject of football. Tom Brady, the quarterback for the New England Patriots, is winningly described as “devastatingly pretty”.For the last three chapters, John Hess takes centre stage. Educated at Phillips Academy Andover, a blue-blooded boarding school, and Harvard twice — first as an undergraduate, then at business school — he was raised in very different circumstances to his father. Leon, who died in 1999, did not go to college because his family could not afford it, and worked in his father’s coal-yard while at school.Davis and Resnick-Ault report that the son sometimes gives his name as “Leon” when ordering coffee in Starbucks, a habit that might intrigue a psychoanalyst.They suggest that John Hess will want to carry on past his 65th birthday — he is now 61 — and that he wants one of his sons eventually to take over. Rumours have been swirling on Wall Street, though, that he might be prepared to accept a bid.When Hess is no longer led by one of Leon Hess’s descendants, it will mark the end of an era. He may not quite have been “the last oil baron”; there are plenty of colourful characters in today’s shale industry, as Gregory Zuckerman’s The Frackers shows.Nevertheless, as Davis and Resnick-Ault point out, there is something remarkable in the way Leon and then John Hess have been involved in many of the most important developments in the oil industry in the past 80 years. Hess gives a vivid and compelling account of the way their company has tracked that changing world.The writer is US industry and energy editor at the FT"

Citrix climbed 7 per cent to $70.39.“Citrix has leading technology franchises in attractive markets but has struggled operationally for years,” it said. “As a result, today Citrix’s operations and product portfolio represent an opportunity for improvement of uniquely significant magnitude.”Elsewhere, Nike gained 1 per cent to $103.88 after it landed a deal to replace Adidas as the exclusive on court uniform and apparel provider for the NBA, cementing the brand’s lock over the sport.Lululemon Athletica fell 1 per cent to $66.07 after the yoga-wear maker said its founder Chip Wilson and his family could sell their entire 14 per cent stake in the business.Shares in Box, the cloud-storage start-up, punched 3 per cent higher to $18.27 following a set of better than expected first-quarter results.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts was up more than 14 per cent to $19.80 after it delivered a 10 per cent jump in earnings on better sales and stronger margins.Overall, US equity markets were higher as investors cheered a rebound in May retail sales.The S&P 500, which had its biggest rally in a month on Wednesday, rose 0.2 per cent to 2,108.86 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 18,039.37.

Adjusted earnings of $1.22 a share also topped consensus forecasts.Digital revenue, or sales from downloaded content as opposed to physical products, climbed 34 per cent and accounted for 49 per cent of total revenue in the quarter. “Over the past 12 months, digital revenues accounted for 50 per cent of total revenues, the first time this milestone has been reached for a 12-month period,” Sean McGowan, an analyst at Needham, said.Monthly active users for its mobile titles averaged more than 160m in the period, up from 155m in its fiscal second quarter. SimCity BuildIt, designed for mobile, which launched in December, has reached 22m downloads to date, ranking among the top five iOS game downloads in more than 100 countries.Time is money.

An example would be this columnist – who is visiting New York – wedging himself and his damp umbrella into the turnstile of the 23rd Street subway stop and causing a tailback. Or Standard Chartered taking a $667m fine for sanctions violations in 2012. This resulted in a monitoring programme that means other banks in New York are more likely to be monitored too.StanChart is the gift that keeps on giving for Ben Lawsky, the ambitious boss of the New York Department of Financial Services. He sent external compliance staff to squat at the bank a couple of years ago as part of a $340m settlement. They spotted surveillance cock-ups which yielded a further $300m payout in August.Emboldened, Mr Lawsky hopes to plant more cuckoos in banking nests. Not just in the wake of misconduct settlements. But for routine investigations too. A slew of banks based in the state would be exposed. They would include Goldman Sachs and the US offshoots of foreign banks such as BNP Paribas. This bon ami of Mr Lawsky paid a $8.9bn settlement for sanctions busting to US watchdogs in July.Banks should not do bad stuff. But this truth does not neutralise criticism of regulatory mission creep. First, adding external monitors to the regiments of compliance staff banks employ would aid their transformation into quasi public utilities. Second, there is an agency problem when one organisation determines the costs borne by another. Banks already pay for external monitors under settlement agreements. They might do so, less palatably, for routine investigations.Third – and most crucially – the presence of external monitors would put a massive damper on the Christmas office party.The City feared its own Financial Conduct Authority might run wild when in 2012 the watchdog won the power to commission investigations paid for by their targets and conducted by professional services firms. After an initial surge, these probes settled to 10-15 a quarter. But it remains undesirable for regulators, who have organisational ambitions as well as supervisory ones, to offload contingent costs on the industries they oversee.Phil off the grillPhil Bentley is inhaling the sweet, fresh breeze of freedom. He has engineered a $3bn deal at Cable & Wireless Communications, the telecoms group he has led for just 10 months. Investors and rivals care a lot – the transaction is of the transformative sort, for good or ill. No one else will give a damn. Least of all, the TV inquisitors who gave Mr Bentley regular grillings when he ran British Gas.Mr Bentley stepped in at CWC after the UK-listed, Caribbean-focused group relocated to Miami. Popular predecessor Tony Rice did not fancy relocating. A witch hunt against bosses at Centrica, owner of British Gas, was one reason for Mr Bentley to flee the country, with the step-up from divisional boss to top dog another.The purchase of privately owned peer Columbus for cash and shares reflects his ambitions for CWC. It also denies territory to Denis O’Brien’s Digicel, the main rival of CWC.But no one gets a bargain in an auction run by JPMorgan. The multiple of trailing earnings to enterprise value is 12.3 times. That compares with 7.4 times for Vodafone and 5 times for CWC, according to S&P CIQ.The company believes the number will be nearer to 10 times when the deal closes next Easter. It is reassuring US cable tycoon John Malone has elected to take shares equivalent to 13 per cent of CWC for his stake in Columbus.Mr Bentley is nevertheless shouldering a big risk that it will prove hard to integrate such a big acquisition. At least he won’t get dragged on to Newsnight to explain himself if it all goes wrong.Failure to launchIt is easy for a big businesses such as Hess to produce promotional toys that please customers. Harder to pit the playthings against such classics as the Rubik’s Cube and win. The toy trucks handed out to chums by the US oil group have thus failed to win admission to the National Toy Hall of Fame.The trucks, which unlike the real thing sometimes launch spaceships, are among the better freebies Lombard has received. Toy diggers handed out by JCB to visitors to its Staffordshire HQ also rate highly.However, 2014 was probably Hess’s last shot at winning the Hall of Fame’s validation. The group will shortly stop selling the toys at its petrol stations.The blow puts the minor inconvenience of oil at $78 a barrel in some context.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
18;HES;Hess Corp;2013-05-16T13:15:16Z;Hess strikes 11th-hour boardroom deal;;"Hess, the US oil group, agreed a compromise over board seats with dissident shareholder Elliott Management just hours before an investor vote at its annual meeting.Under the deal, negotiated overnight, Hess added five new independent directors previously nominated by its board, and three from a slate of five put forward by Elliott.The board also elected a new chairman – Mark Williams, a former head of marketing and refining for Royal Dutch Shell, who was one of the Hess nominees.The agreement resolves one of the most fiercely contested battles for corporate control in the US energy industry, where there has been a rising tide of investor activism in the past year.The board changes are likely to keep Hess on the strategic path it promised in March, including higher dividends, share buybacks, and disposals of its marketing and distribution operations and some overseas assets.Hess shares fell 2.11 per cent to $69.11 by the close of trading.However, Quentin Koffey of Elliott, which holds 4.5 per cent of Hess, said the agreement was an “excellent outcome” for investors. “Hess has terrific assets; it just needed good stewardship,” he said.In total, nine members of Hess’s 14-strong board will be replaced, including one director who joined in March. The change follows a long period of stasis: before Thursday, no independent directors had left the board for more than 10 years.The five Hess nominees, including Mr Williams and John Krenicki, the former chief executive of General Electric’s energy business, were elected to the board by a shareholder vote at Hess’s annual meeting in Houston on Thursday morning.The three Elliott nominees appointed as directors are Rodney Chase, a former deputy chief executive of BP, Harvey Golub, a former chief executive of American Express, and David McManus, a former senior executive at Pioneer Natural Resources and BG Group.Shareholders also voted, as recommended by the company, to give up the “staggered” board, which limited the number of directors that could be changed each year.Hess had proposed Mr Krenicki as a possible chairman, but he would have taken the job only if none of the Elliott nominees had joined the board.Mr Williams replaces John Hess, son of the group’s founder Leon Hess, who is giving up the chairmanship but will remain as chief executive.Elliott said that in preliminary results, more than 60 per cent of the votes not cast by Hess family interests, which control about 10.6 per cent of the shares, had been in favour of its nominees. Its candidates had been backed by Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, the investor advisory firms, as having the greatest relevant experience.However, Elliott said it had agreed to the compromise as a way to bring more new directors on to the board. Mr Koffey said: “This has been a radical reconstruction of the board in an incredibly short time.”Investors and the advisory services had expressed support for a compromise that would bring both Elliott’s and Hess’s nominees on to the board.Under pressure from Elliott, Hess has already made several concessions, including committing to disposing of fields in Indonesia and Thailand, and all of its downstream marketing and distribution businesses.It plans to focus on oil and gas production in a few areas, including the Bakken shale of North Dakota, and the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana and Malaysia."
19;HES;Hess Corp;2013-05-13T18:45:11Z;Hess in compromise move over board battle;;Hess, the US oil group, has offered to bring on to its board two directors nominated by hedge fund Elliott Management as the battle for control of the company enters its final week.In a suggested compromise, Hess said that if its slate of five nominated directors was elected, it would quickly appoint two more board members from the rival list proposed by Elliott, which has been pushing for change at the company.The proposal follows Elliott’s decision to drop a controversial remuneration plan for its slate of five nominees.Elliott described the move as “a PR stunt”, made because Hess was “seeing the writing on the wall”.The battle for Hess, which will come to a head at the company’s annual meeting on Thursday, reflects rising shareholder activism among US investors in general and particularly in the energy industry.Separately on Monday, Transocean, one of the world’s largest offshore drilling contractors, said chairman Michael Talbert planned to step down this year, in another last-minute concession before its annual meeting on Friday. It is under pressure from Carl Icahn, the activist investor who owns 5.6 per cent.The offer from Hess over Elliott’s board nominees follows a U-turn last week, when it offered to strip chief executive John Hess of the chairmanship, replacing him with John Krenicki, a former senior General Electric executive.Both Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, the investor advisory firms, have backed the directors nominated by Elliott.However, they said several shareholders had favoured a compromise bringing in new directors from both sides – an outcome that Hess has now offered, albeit with five of its own nominees joining the board compared to just two of Elliott’s.In a statement, Elliott said: “Shareholders want real change, yet Hess is doing everything they can to avoid it …Hess should accept all five shareholder nominees and replace as many of their incumbent directors with management’s nominees as is reasonable.”Earlier on Monday Elliott, which owns 4.5 per cent of Hess, moved to neutralise one of the main objections to its directors by dropping their planned bonus scheme.It had intended to pay them $30,000 for every percentage point by which Hess shares outperformed its peers by 2016, leading to concerns that the board could be divided because the directors were rewarded differently. The plan had been criticised by Glass Lewis.In a statement, the Elliott nominees described the controversy over their pay as an “ongoing distraction”.They added: “While each of us believes that these arrangements are appropriate and consistent with the performance of our duties as independent directors, each of us has made the decision to waive our right to receive these payments from Elliott.”Meanwhile, Transocean said that if Mr Talbert, its chairman since 2002, was voted back on to the board at the meeting on Friday, he would step down as chairman by November and leave the company no later than next year’s meeting.Mr Talbert, who was chief executive for eight years before becoming chairman, has been criticised by Mr Icahn for presiding over “the destruction of at least $11bn of shareholder value”, most of it resulting from the merger with GlobalSantaFe, another drilling contractor, in 2007.ISS and Glass Lewis had both recommended voting against Mr Talbert’s re-election to the board.Transocean said the company would “promptly” begin a search for a replacement, and would “take into consideration the views of the company’s shareholders” in making an appointment.In another example of increased shareholder activism in energy, investors this month removed Ray Irani, executive chairman of Occidental Petroleum, following concerns over his disagreements with the company’s chief executive.
20;HES;Hess Corp;2013-05-13T09:56:11Z;Hess: the directors’ cut;Incentives aside, if any board needs a fire lit underneath it, it is this laggard oil group’s;Should board members be paid like bounty hunters? That could be the direction corporate governance is heading. Take Hess Corporation, the US oil company with a $25bn market capitalisation. Elliott Associates has offered Hess’s dissident slate of five directors $30,000 for every percentage point the shares outperform a peer index over the next three years. If any board needs a fire lit underneath it, it is Hess’s. Between 2007 and 2012 the board oversaw a total shareholder loss of 46 per cent. After Elliott started making noise, Hess initiated a series of face-saving moves: asset divestitures, fewer cronies on its revised director slate and, most recently, the separation of CEO and chairman roles.What should investors think of this side payment for board members? For one, it could create factions on the board between legacy members and those who are offered up by certain large investors. But at underperforming companies, boards tend to be too chummy with each other and the CEO anyway. These insurgent directors are deemed officially “independent” by the rules regardless of any incentive payment schemes, and they are there precisely to shake up the status quo. Another misgiving is that affiliated board members could be motivated to pursue gimmicks that move the stock in the short term at the expense of long-term value. But, for any insurgent directors to make it on to a board, it is likely the stock has not been appreciating either in the short or long term and that a fresh approach to value creation is needed. Moreover, the terms Elliott has offered its directors are similar to existing incentives to managers.All of which leads to the outcome at this week’s Hess shareholder meeting. It seems most plausible that shareholders will be indifferent to the ivory tower debate over corporate governance best practices and be more intent on who can best oversee the turnround at a laggard.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
21;HES;Hess Corp;2013-05-10T17:46:39Z;Hess to split top jobs under investor pressure;;Hess, the US oil group, has bowed to shareholder pressure and agreed to split its roles of chairman and chief executive, six days before a critical investor vote.Reversing its previous opposition to splitting the jobs, the company’s board said John Hess, the CEO who is the son of the company’s founder Leon Hess, would give up the chairmanship after the annual meeting in Houston on May 16.John Krenicki, the former head of General Electric’s energy business, has agreed to serve as chairman if he and other directors nominated by Hess are elected at that meeting.However, Elliott Management, a hedge fund that owns 4.5 per cent of Hess, has proposed a rival slate of directors, and its nominees have been backed by Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, the investor advisory groups.Hess’s concession over the board follows earlier retreats by the company since Elliott’s stake was revealed in January.It has already agreed to give up its “staggered” board, which limits the number of directors that can be changed this year, and to replace five independent directors with its new nominees, including Mr Krenicki, who have greater experience of the energy industry.Some investors have suggested they would want to see both Hess’s and Elliott’s nominees on the board, but that option is not up for a vote at the meeting. Mr Krenicki has indicated he would not serve as chairman of a board that included directors from both sets of nominees.The battle for control of Hess is a reflection of rising shareholder activism in the US, including a number of attempts to appoint independent chairmen to supervise powerful CEOs.Glass Lewis and ISS have both called for an independent chairman at JPMorgan Chase, a role now held by Jamie Dimon, the bank’s CEO.An attempt to appoint an independent chairman at General Electric, taking the role from Jeff Immelt, the company’s CEO, was backed by 24.7 per cent of the votes cast at its annual meeting last month.At Hess John Mullin, the lead independent director, said in a statement that shareholders had expressed “a desire for better accountability, increased board oversight, and the adoption of best-in-class corporate governance practices”.He added: “We understand our shareholders’ views, and recognise that our corporate governance structure should have been improved sooner.”Elliott said Hess’s move was not a concession, but a reaction to the shareholder vote now under way.It said: “We are excited about the tremendous and continuing support the shareholder nominees are receiving. They will be a great benefit to the Hess board.”After the Hess announcement, ISS repeated its recommendation that investors should back the board nominees proposed by Elliott.In its earlier advice to Hess shareholders, Glass Lewis said that although some of the five new directors nominated by Hess had relevant experience, they were not “clearly superior” to Elliott’s nominees, and given Hess’s record of weak governance and share price underperformance it saw “limited cause to support any nominee forwarded by current management or the board.”Glass Lewis also said it was “strongly opposed” to the remuneration of Elliott’s nominees, who will be paid $30,000 by Elliott for every percentage point that Hess shares outperform its peers by 2016.However, the adviser added: “We ultimately conclude the significant upside potential associated with the election of new, experienced nominees at Hess outweighs our concerns in this case.”
22;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Hess and Elliott Management fight hots up ahead of annual meeting;;The battle for control of Hess has become increasingly acrimonious, with a slate of directors nominated by the US oil group’s board attacking a rival list proposed by Elliott Management, a hedge fund.The five nominees put forward by the Hess board took the unusual step of issuing an open letter, accusing their rivals of having failed to “do their homework” and of not being independent of Elliott, which owns 4.5 per cent of the group’s shares.The letter follows recommendations from Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, the advisory services, that investors should vote in favour of the Elliott nominees and against the board’s slate at Hess’s annual meeting on May 16.Elliott’s five nominees include Harvey Golub, the former chief executive of American Express, and Rodney Chase, a former deputy chief executive of BP.ISS said Hess’s nominees, including John Krenicki, the former chief executive of General Electric’s energy business, and Mark Williams, a former head of refining operations for Royal Dutch Shell, also offered “significant relevant experience”.On balance, however, it argued the Elliott nominees seemed better qualified, citing as an example Mr Chase’s experience compared to that of William Schrader, who held a more junior position as chief operating officer of TNK-BP, BP’s Russian joint venture.Hess shares have underperformed the S&P 500 for many years, fuelling growing discontent among shareholders against the group’s directors, some of whom had family ties to John Hess, the chief executive who is the son of founder Leon Hess.Investors and advisory services have suggested that the ideal might be to bring both Elliott’s and Hess’s new nominees on to the board, but shareholders are not being given that option.In their letter, the Hess nominees said they were independent of the management and owed a duty to all shareholders.They added: “We simply do not believe that Elliott’s nominees can credibly say they are independent of Elliott, a recent shareholder that designed their unusual pay package.”The Elliott directors will be paid $30,000 for each percentage point that Hess’s shares outperform its peers’ over the next three years: a package that could end up paying them substantially more than the remuneration offered to the board’s nominees.The Hess nominees argue that this could encourage short-term decisions, an assertion rejected by Elliott, which says the existing incentives for Hess’s directors and management do not reward performance over longer periods.In their letter, the Hess nominees also backed the management’s plans for the group, saying it was “on the right path” in its plans for disposals to focus the business.Responding to Elliott’s approach in January and Hess’s restructuring plans, the shares have risen 36 per cent in the past six months.However, John Pike of Elliott said: “There could be much more to come in terms of improved performance from Hess. The question is whether the company is in a position to achieve that outperformance, and so far it isn’t. It needs a complete change of culture.”Fadel Gheit, an energy analyst at Oppenheimer, the investment bank, said the battle for Hess had shown some of the most “borderline uncivil behaviour” he had seen in his career.He added that he would advocate support for Hess’s board nominees.“The criticism that the Elliott group made is well-deserved, but Hess has been significantly restructuring itself,” he said.
23;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Hess to sell Russian subsidiary to Lukoil;;Hess, the US oil company, is selling its Russian subsidiary Samara-Nafta to Lukoil for $2.05bn, as it continues to reshape itself under pressure from activist shareholders.The sale was first proposed by the company in November and confirmed in a restructuring plan it set out last month. It intends to use the expected after-tax proceeds of $1.8bn to pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet, but said most of the cash raised from future disposals would be returned to shareholders.The company is still aiming to sell assets including fields in Indonesia and Thailand, its fuel terminals, distribution and retail businesses, and its 50 per cent stake in Hetco, the energy trading firm.Elliott Management, a hedge fund, took a 4 per cent stake in Hess in January and has been pushing for changes including a rationalisation of Hess’s international operations, which were spread across a number of countries, unusual for a company of its size.Hess said in March it planned to concentrate on a handful of core locations, including the Bakken shale of North Dakota, the Gulf of Mexico, and overseas operations in Malaysia and Ghana.So far this year the company has announced or completed disposals in Azerbaijan, the North Sea and Texas, which will raise a total of $3.4bn along with the Samara-Nafta sale.John Hess, the chairman and chief executive, said the asset sale programme was part of a plan to “transform Hess into a more focused, higher growth, lower risk pure play exploration and production company”.Samara-Nafta produces about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and Hess’s 90 per cent stake in the Russian company accounted for about 11 per cent of its total production of 396,000 boe/d in the fourth quarter of last year.Although Hess has been making strategic changes along the lines of the programme proposed by Elliott – saying that the moves were already under way before the hedge fund revealed its stake – Elliott has continued to apply pressure, and has put forward five directors for election at the annual meeting on May 16.Hess has proposed its own slate of new independent directors and has promised an increased dividend.Mr Hess said that following the Samara-Nafta sale, Hess would be able both to fund future growth and to “direct most of the proceeds from additional asset sales to returning capital directly to its shareholders”.Hess shares rose 3 per cent in morning trading in New York to reach $73.67. They have now risen 39 per cent since the start of the year.
24;HES;Hess Corp;2013-03-04T19:21:18Z;Hess plans shake-up to deflect pressure;;Hess has announced a radical restructuring plan, including disposals, an increased dividend and a shake-up of its board, as the oil group’s management seeks to deflect pressure for change from Elliott Management, the hedge fund.Hess plans to offload its fuel stations, oil marketing and energy trading business, it said on Monday, to focus on being a pure oil and gas exploration company.It has also proposed to nominate six new directors, including former senior executives of General Electric, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP, to address concerns that the board was not sufficiently independent from John Hess, the chief executive, and lacked relevant experience.Mr Hess, son of the company’s founder Leon Hess, controls 10.25 per cent of the shares.Elliott revealed in January it controlled 4 per cent of the shares, and called for a break-up of the company, which it said could realise value up to twice Hess’s then market capitalisation. Hess shares rose 3.5 per cent to $68.86 by lunchtime in New York, valuing the group at more than $23bn.Elliott has proposed the election of five new directors to the Hess board, including Harvey Golub, credited with the turnround of American Express in the 1990s, and Rodney Chase, a former deputy chief executive of BP.Relational Investors, a hedge fund which has 3.25 per cent of Hess, said it backed Elliott’s plan.Hess is one of the most active companies in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, the heart of the new US oil boom, but for a long time its shares did not reflect the strength of that position, falling over four years, while, on average, exploration and production companies’ share prices rose strongly.In a letter to shareholders, however, Mr Hess said the shares had risen 34 per cent between July of last year and the day Elliott’s interest in the company was revealed.Speaking to the Financial Times, Mr Hess said the strategy to refocus the company as an exploration and production business, which will have assets in North Dakota, Ohio, Malaysia, Ghana and the Gulf of Mexico, had been set back in 2010.“This is not a response to an activist. It’s a very thought-out and deliberate response that the management has put in place to maximise value for shareholders,” he said.The suggestion from Elliott that the Bakken assets could be spun off would be damaging in terms of tax consequences and the financial strength of the two companies it would create, he added.The new directors proposed by Hess include John Krenicki, the former head of GE’s energy business, and Mark Williams, former head of refining and marketing for Shell.Mr Hess said: “The fact that we were able to attract six world-class leaders shows …how they believe and support the strategy we have.”Hess plans to offload the Hess Energy Trading Company joint venture it founded with two former Goldman Sachs partners in 1997. Hess has lost money in trading in four of the past five years.In other moves intended to increase its appeal to shareholders, the company said it expected production growth from its continuing businesses to average 5-8 per cent per year for five years.It also said it planned a $1 per share annual dividend, to be paid in the third quarter, and would secure authorisation from the board to buy back up to $4bn of stock.Elliott said Hess had adopted parts of the plan it proposed in May, but the restructuring plan fell “dramatically short of what is needed”.Realising greater value from Hess required “truly independent directors that can hold management accountable and ensure they follow through”.Elliott added: “Partial refocusing of the company, partial awakening to the need for capital stewardship, and partial improvement of a minority of directors is a long way away from recouping nearly two decades of destroyed value to shareholders.”The company’s annual meeting has been set for May 16.
25;HES;Hess Corp;2013-02-18T14:38:54Z;Pressure exposes hedge fund within Hess;;A campaign to break up the Hess oil group has exposed for the first time one of the world’s least known – and until recently, most successful – energy trading outfits to outside scrutiny.Hetco, as the trading company is called, was founded in 1997 by two former Goldman Sachs partners, Stephen Hendel and Stephen Semlitz. Known to traders as “the Steves”, their joint venture with Hess has since marched into oil hubs from Houston to Geneva, built a clientele that included the state oil and gas company of Algeria and raised eyebrows with audacious moves in the North Sea crude market.“It is Goldman Sachs, but private,” says an Algerian oil official.Whether Hess Energy Trading Company fits inside its namesake’s business is now the question being raised forcefully by Elliott Management, the New York hedge fund that last month disclosed a 4 per cent stake in Hess and sought five seats on the board.As well as proposing a broader break-up of Hess that would include splitting off its US onshore shale assets from its offshore operations, Elliott argues Hetco is a risky distraction, an in-house hedge fund with no place inside the listed oil company.After earning at least $100m annually in its early years, Hetco has had uneven results this decade, people familiar with the company say. After tax, Hess trading activities have lost money in three of the past four years, with $5m of losses in the first nine months of 2012. The figures include Hetco’s results, as well as Hess’s own trading activities.In 2010, a junior Hetco trader’s heavy losses in heating oil options was the talk of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The company has since recovered from the fiasco while the ex-trader has resurfaced on reality television, people who do business with Hetco say.“What is the strategic purpose of an upstream [exploration and production] company running a hedge fund? Hess should clearly exit this business and focus on its upstream operations,” says Quentin Koffey, an Elliott associate portfolio manager. Hess and Hetco declined to comment.With seven offices around the world, some inside Hess’s own buildings, Hetco is not known to manage outsiders’ money, making it more proprietary trading company than hedge fund. Its website says counterparties include “the largest state-owned enterprises in the world” and indeed, “the most sophisticated hedge funds in the world”. Hess has gross exposure to oil derivatives equivalent to 1.7bn barrels – about three months’ US consumption – from trading “conducted principally” through Hetco, filings show.Hetco competes on a smaller scale with international trading houses such as Vitol, Trafigura and Mercuria and with majors that have trading arms such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell. But the venture also enjoys a distinctive financial guarantee from Hess, an investment-grade credit. “If the thing blew up, Hess’s balance sheet would be on the line,” says a senior executive at a company that trades with Hetco.If Elliott prevails, Hetco faces a hazy future without the backing of a company such as Hess. Its guarantee serves as “phantom equity”, enabling Hetco to enter into long-term trades in markets notorious for volatile price moves and heavy demands on collateral, the executive says. In an analogous case, Morgan Stanley has been in protracted talks to sell part of its commodity-trading business for almost a year.Messrs Hendel and Semlitz launched Hetco after building Goldman Sachs’ J Aron energy trading group. Goldman named each a partner in 1988, the same year as Lloyd Blankfein, now chief executive.The men left Goldman in the mid-1990s amid disagreement over how aggressively the investment bank should pursue energy trading opportunities, people familiar with the history say. Soon after they left, Goldman sold an oil condensate splitter – a type of refining plant – built during their tenures to Koch Industries of the US.The Steves founded Hetco with a third partner named Guy Merison. Hess invested in the launch of the company and still has a 50 per cent voting interest. “The marriage has been based on their being guided loosely by the Hess board . . . so long as they’re profitable,” says a former employee.Mr Hendel, a charismatic lawyer, is known to warn traders away from deals that look even remotely dodgy, former employees say. His interests extend far beyond oil: he recently produced the award-winning Broadway musical “Fela!” about Nigerian singer Fela Kuti.“Over the years I’ve learnt a great deal about how financial markets can help some economies but leave others behind,” Mr Hendel told the New York Times in a 2010 interview about the show.Mr Semlitz is “a numbers guy” who took traders to task when they lost money, a former employee says. “He is absolutely no nonsense.”One of Hetco’s coups came in 2004 when the company signed a contract to help Sonatrach, the Algerian oil and gas company, hedge price risks and expand its customer list to the US and the Asia-Pacific regions. “We went to Hetco because they were the smartest,” says the Algerian oil official.Additional reporting by Javier Blas
26;HES;Hess Corp;2013-01-29T22:52:22Z;Hedge fund calls for break-up of Hess;;A hedge fund has called for a break-up of Hess, the US oil group, saying it would release value worth twice the company’s market capitalisation.Elliott Management revealed on Tuesday that it had taken a 4 per cent stake in Hess, one of the most active participants in the US shale oil boom, and nominated five directors to the board to push for a restructuring. It said Hess’s shares had been underperforming relative to its peers for more than a decade.John Pike of Elliott Management said there had been a failure of corporate governance at Hess, because the board had been “unable and unwilling to challenge management”.He added: “There are real problems at this company, and those problems are masking some terrific assets.”Hess is one of the most geographically diverse US independent oil and gas companies, active in more than 20 countries. It is also one of the leading producers in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, the heart of the US oil boom, but its share price performance has lagged behind far behind other companies active in the region such as Continental Resources.Hess’s shares have fallen by 5 per cent over the past four years, while the average of comparable companies’ shares has risen by 38 per cent.Last year, Hess announced disposals worth $2.4bn, and on Monday said it also planned to sell its 19 oil terminals, but Elliott is pushing for much more radical steps.In a letter and presentation released on Tuesday, it proposed splitting off the US onshore shale assets from the offshore operations and focusing the international business on fewer countries, including the US, Norway and Equatorial Guinea, while disposing of countries where Hess’s performance has been disappointing.The company also has an assortment of assets including a hedge fund, a fuel cell business, and 1,360 petrol stations, which Elliott says should be sold. Broken up in this way, Hess would be worth about $97-$126 per share, compared with a closing price on Tuesday of $68.11.Hess said it would review Elliott’s arguments, but said it was “already undergoing a significant transformation as part of a multiyear strategy to deliver significant value to all Hess shareholders”.It said it did not understand why Elliott had made its move “without any attempt to engage in discussions” with its management.There is a strong family involvement in Hess. John Hess, chairman and chief executive since 1995, is the son of Leon Hess, the company’s founder, who began selling fuel during the Great Depression.Mr Hess owns 10.25 per cent of the company.Quentin Koffey, also of Elliott, said: “This company needs to be run for the 90 per cent of the shareholders.”Hess shares have risen 16 per cent since the news of Elliott’s approach first emerged on Monday morning. Elliott’s proposed directors include Rodney Chase, the former deputy chief executive of BP, and Harvey Golub, the former chief executive of American Express credited with leading the company’s revival.A vote on Elliott’s nominations will be held at Hess’s annual meeting, which is usually held in mid-May.
27;HES;Hess Corp;2013-01-29T18:58:37Z;US gasoline prices peak on refinery news;;US wholesale gasoline prices hit a three-month high after Hess Corporation on Monday said it will next month close a refinery at Port Reading, New Jersey, that supplies gasoline to the New York market.Nymex February RBOB gasoline futures climbed 1.4 per cent on Tuesday to a session high of $2.9741 per gallon shortly before midday in New York, as traders factored in the imminent reduction of supply.Gasoline futures have risen 3.5 per cent since the Hess announcement to the highest level since mid October. The rise in gasoline prices also helped to drive crude oil prices higher. ICE March Brent rose to an intraday peak of $114.49 a barrel, the highest in three months. Nymex March WTI rose to $97.82 a barrel.“The Hess refinery closure, and particularly the short notice, has taken the market by surprise,” said Gareth Lewis-Davies, a commodity strategist at BNP Paribas.The price of European gasoline, which is not traded on exchange, also climbed according to market participants, in anticipation of European refiners meeting some of the shorfall in demand in the north-east region of the US.The closure of the Hess Port Reading refinery is the latest in a string of big oil company announcements of plans to sell or close their refineries in the US East coast. Last year, Delta Air Lines purchased the 185,000 b/d Trainer refinery outside Philadelphia from Phillips 66, the refining business spun off from ConocoPhillips, as it sought to hedge its rising jet fuel costs.Hess has also shut down a big refining centre in the Caribbean, further straining gasoline supplies to the US.Although Hess’s Port Reading refinery produces only about 50,000 barrels a day of gasoline, it is critical for the supply of the New York area and thus has an outsize impact on the energy futures market of the city. The shortfall in gasoline in the New York area is not expected to be met from mid-western refineries, because pipelines flowing from the midwest to the New York area are running at capacity.Gasoline, or products for blending gasoline, could also be shipped to the New York region from refineries on the US Gulf Coast, but imports from Europe may be cheaper, analysts said.Shipments of crude and oil products within the US must be made by US-owned, crewed and flagged ships, increasing transport costs. European refineries produce more gasoline than is consumed on the continent, in part because demand in Europe has shifted towards diesel.The traditional simple measure of gasoline refining margins, known as the RBOB crack spread, has climbed $27 from $25 a barrel since the Hess announcement on Monday.
28;HES;Hess Corp;2013-01-28T20:47:14Z;Hess rows upstream to focus on shale;;"Hess is to sell its oil terminals and shut its refinery to focus on US exploration and production in areas such as North Dakota’s Bakken shale.The US oil and gas company also revealed on Monday that Elliott Associates, the hedge fund, had sent a letter on Friday saying it could take a stake of more than 4 per cent and was considering nominating candidates to the board at this year’s annual meeting.Elliott did not say whether it had yet bought any Hess shares, but said it was seeking regulatory clearance to acquire more beyond any that it might already own, potentially to a value of more than $800m.Based on Hess’s market capitalisation of about $21bn, that implies a stake of about 4 per cent.The sale of Hess’s 19 oil terminals and the closure of its refinery at Port Reading, New Jersey, had been planned before the unexpected approach from Elliott, the company said.The terminals are a relatively low-growth business, and the refinery, on the east coast close to New York, is not well-placed to secure the cheap inland US crude that has helped power a revival in the country’s refining industry in the past year.The refinery lost money in two of the past three years. It is relatively small, which generally makes refineries less efficient, and if it remained open would be forced to invest in additional equipment to comply with new environmental regulations.Hess is one of the most active companies in the Bakken shale, where there has been spectacular growth in production in recent years, but its shares have lagged behind many of its peers.Over the past three years, while shares in Continental Resources, the leading leaseholder and oil producer in the Bakken, more than doubled, shares in Hess were little changed.However, their performance has improved in the past six months, outpacing the oil and gas sector average, as the company has embarked on a disposal and closure programme to focus its operations.John Hess, chief executive, said the terminal sales and refinery closure would complete the group’s “transformation from an integrated oil and gas company to one that is predominantly an exploration and production company”.The company expects the moves to release $1bn of working capital, in addition to the terminal sale proceeds, that can be redeployed in oil and gas exploration and production.The company has already sold assets worth $2.4bn over the past year, including assets in the North Sea and Azerbaijan, and announced the closure of a refining joint venture in the US Virgin Islands.It has also put up for sale a Russian subsidiary and a small package of land in the Eagle Ford shale oilfields of Texas.Hess shares rose 6.45 per cent to $62.70 in afternoon trading in New York,
after the news of the terminal sales and Elliott’s approach."
29;HES;Hess Corp;2012-01-22T19:04:27Z;Monti aims to restore Libya relations;;Silvio Berlusconi courted Libya and Muammer Gaddafi by returning a stolen headless statue of Venus four year ago. Not to be outdone, Mario Monti has followed in his predecessor’s footsteps by returning the marble head of a Roman emperor’s daughter.Relations between Libya and Italy, its most important commercial partner, seem to have been restored by the new Italian prime minister’s weekend visit to Tripoli. Each side is anxious to move on from the close personal ties developed by Italy’s former leader and the former dictator overthrown and killed last October.However, it remained unclear what would happen to the “friendship treaty”, signed by Mr Berlusconi and Mr Gaddafi in 2008, by which Italy pledged to pay $5bn during 25 years in reparations for colonial-era atrocities.“We left it to one side,” Abdel Rahim al-Kib, Libya’s prime minister, said on Saturday after signing a declaration with Mr Monti, who emphasised the importance Italy attaches to north Africa by making Libya his first foreign visit outside Europe since he took office in November.An important bellwether in the relationship is Eni, Italy’s state-controlled oil and gas company which is the largest producer in Libya and Africa as a whole.“We have been in Africa for 60 years – and in dozens of revolutions we never had changes in our oil contracts,” Paolo Scaroni, chief executive of Eni, told the Financial Times on his return from Tripoli.Eni’s combined oil and gas output in Libya is almost back to pre-war levels of 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, after faster-than-expected recoveries by damaged installations, and relations with Libya’s National Oil Company are good. Libyan gas supply to Italy by means of the Greenstream pipeline across the Mediterranean resumed late last year.But Mr Scaroni recognised that Eni’s efforts to remain dominant in Libya were being challenged by a series of competitors gearing up for new licensing rounds that are expected once Libya forms a fresh government at elections in June for a national assembly that has the task of drafting a new constitution.“Everybody is here – the whole list of the world’s oil companies,” Mr Scaroni said, listing “minor” rivals from Russia and China as well as European oil majors who were already present in Libya, as well as late arrivals from the US. France’s Total and Spain’s Repsol YPF are Eni’s closest competitors in terms of current output, while BP of the UK has not yet started the offshore exploration that was interrupted by fallout from its oil-well disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and then Libya’s civil war last year.Eni and the Libyan government are still at work on an agreement that would see Eni spend $380m on social development projects expected to focus on postwar reconstruction. Mr Scaroni expects Tripoli during the next few weeks to finalise its priorities, emphasising that Eni will deliver projects, not cash.The sum of $380m for social and infrastructure projects represents the total of two agreements signed by Eni with Mr Gaddafi’s former regime in 2006 and 2010 that were not implemented, according to Mr Scaroni.Other international oil companies with large operations in Libya are, however, far from reaching their pre-war production levels. Repsol YPF forecast output of about 170,000 barrels a day this quarter from fields that it operates, compared with a pre-war level of 340,000 b/d. Total of France and OMV of Austria are pumping about 60 per cent of their pre-war level.Oil production levels are even lower for US-companies such as ConocoPhillips, Hess and Marathon, which only resumed operations in Libya this month after lengthy repairs to the El Sider oil export terminal.The International Energy Agency, the western countries’ oil watchdog, said Libya pumped 800,000 b/d last month, fewer than the 1m b/d claimed by Libyan authorities, and half the 1.6m b/d level before the war began last February.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London
30;HES;Hess Corp;2012-01-18T18:54:17Z;Oil demand falls for first time since 2009;;Oil demand has fallen for the first time since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, a result of the weakening economy, a mild winter and high crude prices, according to new estimates from the International Energy Agency.The industrialised nations’ watchdog said oil demand dropped by 300,000 barrels a day year-on-year in the final quarter of 2011. While still forecasting overall growth in demand for 2012, the agency revised down its outlook for this year to growth of 1.1m barrels a day, from 1.3m b/d, and said further downgrades were possible. Global oil demand in 2011 was 89.5m b/d.David Fyfe, head of the IEA’s oil industry and markets division, said the drop in demand late last year reflected the mild winter, which was in sharp contrast to the cold winter of 2010-11. But it was still surprising. “It is quite rare” to see an absolute contraction, he said. “We’re flagging that there are clearly downside risks to the global economy and to oil demand.”The price of crude has been relatively stable since last spring, within a range of $100 to $120 a barrel. But it jumped $4-$5 a barrel at the new year as the European Union prepared to impose a ban on Iranian oil imports and Tehran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial conduit for oil exports from the Gulf.The IEA characterised the oil market as finely balanced between fears of supply disruptions due to tensions over Iran and concerns about an economic slowdown that will weaken demand for oil, reflected in a series of recent refinery shutdowns. Markets were, it said, caught between a “rock” – the growing likelihood of a downturn, or even outright recession, in 2012 – and a “hard place” – possible geopolitical turmoil triggered by the west’s face-off with Iran.Brent crude was trading at $110.68 a barrel in afternoon trading, down 85 cents.The agency said demand declined year-on-year in only nine quarters in the last decade – five of them during the 2008-09 financial crisis, and two in the recession of 2000-01. Mr Fyfe said the world could see zero oil demand growth this year if there were further downgrades to global gross domestic product growth estimates.But some analysts said there was no evidence to suggest a sustained decline in demand. “There’s nothing in anyone’s outlook that suggests demand will follow a similar pattern to 2008-09,” said Paul Horsnell, an oil analyst at Barclays Capital, “especially if GDP growth this year comes in at around 3.2 per cent.”Iranian naval assets in the region along with international maritime boundaries, shipping lanes, terminals, pipelines and major oil and gas fieldsOil markets in Europe and Asia, hit badly last year by the loss of Libyan supply, worry that sanctions against Iran will seriously affect the availability of crude. Refiners in Europe, which imports about 600,000 b/d of Iranian crude, are already chasing replacement supplies – a task the IEA acknowledged would be “difficult.”But in the latest symptom of weak demand, a US Virgin Islands refinery jointly owned by New York-listed Hess and Petróleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, will shut down by mid-February.The refinery’s losses of $1.3bn in the past three years were “caused primarily by weakness in demand for refined petroleum products due to the global economic slowdown and the addition of new refining capacity in emerging markets,” the joint venture said Wednesday.The closure of the Virgin Islands refinery – a major supplier of fuels to the US – follows recent shutdowns of European refineries run by Petroplus and LyondellBasell and refineries in the US state of Pennsylvania owned by ConocoPhillips and Sunoco.The Virgin Islands refinery, Hovensa, last year reduced capacity to 350,000 b/d from 500,000 b/d.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York
31;HES;Hess Corp;2011-11-22T21:14:20Z;Exxon’s Kurd contracts questioned;;Iraq stepped up the pressure on ExxonMobil over the US company’s surprise decision to sign exploration contracts with the country’s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan, with the government’s highest energy official declaring they are in breach of the law.Hussain al-Sharistani, Iraq’s deputy prime minister responsible for energy, revealed that Exxon had written to the government about its recent decision. The prime minister’s office and the ministry of oil had written back, spelling out that “contracts will not be recognised unless they are approved by the Iraqi government”.“In this particular case there is a breach of laws and the Iraqi government is considering its actions,” he said at an industry conference in London.Exxon’s decision last month to sign contracts with the Kurdistan Regional Government to explore for oil and gas in six regions has sparked a furious backlash in Baghdad which has always insisted these agreements are illegal.Mr Sharistani said “the position of the US government has been that they were unaware of [the agreement] and if they had been asked, they would have obliged [Exxon] to get approval of the Iraqi government”.People familiar with Exxon’s move told the Financial Times that the company only informed the US government it had signed the contracts after the event.The KRG has signed more than 40 production sharing agreements in recent years, mostly with small independents but more recently also with larger American independents such as Hess and Marathon Oil. Until now, the supermajor oil groups had stopped short of agreeing contracts, fearful of losing ones previously agreed in the south of the country with the federal government.Under a 2009 contract Exxon is leading a consortium developing one of Iraq’s largest oilfields outside Basra in the south, the large West Qurna field. Royal Dutch Shell, which is a partner with Exxon on the West Qurna field and had been negotiating in parallel with the US group to explore in Kurdistan, recently pulled out of the talks amid fears it could jeopardise its investments in the south. Baghdad last week cleared the final hurdle for a $17bn natural gas contract with Shell that had been delayed for several months after it was approved by the council of ministries.With its deal Exxon is wading into a long-running dispute about the validity of the KRG’s contracts which are more lucrative production sharing agreements rather than service ones. A long-awaited hydrocarbon law, which would enable the KRG to increase its exports, has still not been passed. The imminent withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, scheduled by the end of next month, has also increased concerns in some quarters that ethnic concerns could again threaten stability.Mr Sharistani said the government would not open talks with companies that might replace Exxon in the development of the West Qurna field until it had decided on its next move. He said his comments about the legality of the contracts were limited to the oil and gas exploration and production sector only, adding that the federal government encouraged “all companies to invest in all of Iraq” in other industries.Looking ahead at the Opec meeting next month, Mr Sharistani said Iraq did not see the need for a production cut but that there was general concern over the outlook for demand in light of the eurozone crisis.“So far there is no impact on demand for oil. If there is going to be stagnation or decreasing demand, Opec will have to deal with that and adjust its production accordingly,” he said.
32;HES;Hess Corp;2011-11-18T10:54:50Z;Trip report: The future of oil in Kurdistan;The arrival of Exxon signals a step up for the region. Javier Blas considers its outlook;"I have spent the past few days touring the oil-rich semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq, visiting oilfields and interviewing its officials and foreign executives. It is boom time for Kurdistan, which optimists hope could soon produce more oil than some members of Opec. As I am leaving, Kurdistan is celebrating the arrival of ExxonMobil, the first of the so-called supermajors to enter the territory to explore for oil.But the future will not be a simple trajectory.Exploration success. The oil and gas map of Kurdistan five years ago was largely blank. Today, dozens of oilfields dot it as companies discover hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in eight of every ten wells they drill. But drilling is not as easy as it appeared to be a few years ago, due to the complex geology of the region, and budgets are overrunning by more than a third in some cases.Promises, but a tough reality. The Kurdistan Regional Government expects production to reach 1m barrels a day – more than double the output of Ecuador, the smallest member of the Opec oil cartel – by 2015, up from less than 200,000 b/d at present.Yet future production depends on a political agreement between the KRG and the federal government in Baghdad to approve the long-awaited Iraqi petroleum law, which has been delayed since 2007. While an interim agreement allows for limited exports, which could run at 175,000 b/d next year, companies will be reluctant to invest heavily to lift output towards the 1m b/d target until a political agreement allows the passage of the petroleum law. The KRG and Baghdad say that the legal text will be done by the end of 2012, but cynical oil executives in Erbil note that both sides have repeated the same message for the past five years.The arrival of Big Oil: Five years ago only a few small companies ventured into the region, but the nametags at a recent oil and gas conference in Erbil read like a Who’s Who of the industry. The pioneers, including the Oslo-listed DNO that is privately owned by Genel Enerji of Turkey, and London-listed Gulf Keystone are still there, but new entrants are arriving, including large groups such as Hess and Marathon of the US, Repsol YPF of Spain, and OMV of Austria. Exxon has become the first supermajor to sign a contract to explore the region. Oil executives, diplomats and regional officials say other supermajors could soon join the world’s largest oil company.The impact of the arrival of Exxon is unclear. Optimistic oil executives say it could force Baghdad to accept the KRG’s demands to develop its own industry, but others say that could sour relationships between Kurdistan and the federal government, delaying indefinitely the approval of the petroleum law. The arrival of another supermajor – Chevron of the US, Total of France and Eni of Italy are the names frequently mentioned – could give the KRG the upper hand, however.The time for M&A. Most of the territory open for exploration has already been snapped up, so new entrants have just two routes: a so-called farm-in agreement, whereby a company buys a stake in a field or exploratory area in exchange for financing, or buying existing companies. The KRG, which by necessity backed small companies at the very beginning, would now prefer to see a consolidation in the sector that leaves fewer and bigger players.After the arrival of Exxon, the market is valuing the current players at much higher multiples, so expect multibillion dollar deals. Oil executives in Erbil talk in particular about two deals: Gulf Keystone, which could be bought by a supermajor seeking a quick entry; and a potential merger of DNO and Genel Enerji.Turkey is the new friend. Five years ago, Ankara branded some of the most senior KRG officials as terrorists. Today, Turkish diplomats see Iraqi Kurdistan as a source of energy to power the country’s rapid economic growth. Ankara wants to buy natural gas from Kurdistan for power generation. Moreover, Turkey wants to consolidate Ceyhan as the oil port of the eastern Mediterranean. The port is already the end of the Iraq-Turkey Pipeline and the Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Ankara would like to see another oil pipeline – most likely to low-quality Kurdish heavy oil – reaching the port and, potentially, a natural gas pipeline from Kurdistan feeding an LNG plant. Ankara and Erbil even dream that the Iraqi Kurdistan could supply natural gas to the Nabucco pipeline.The Kurdish boom towns. Erbil, the political capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, is entering an oil boom. The city of 1m people, which still lacks a good hospital, has seen the opening of its first luxury hotel – and another three are under construction. Oil executives fly in and out with airlines offering new routes each month. But while money is pouring in, the region has yet to develop services to benefit from it, importing everything from equipment to food. Costs are rising fast too. Housing prices are rocketing and salaries in the oil industry have doubled in the past five years. And with more than 40 companies elbowing for space in Erbil and the region, retaining competent staff is a problem. Local political commentators are already warning that the region – like others in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East – could see the blessing of oil turning into a curse."
33;HES;Hess Corp;2011-11-10T21:30:46Z;Exxon signs Kurd exploration contracts;;ExxonMobil has become the first of the “supermajor” oil companies to venture into Kurdistan, in a controversial move that will be seen as a huge vote of confidence in the semi-autonomous region of Iraq but could spark a backlash in Baghdad.Exxon, the largest international oil company, signed contracts with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) last month to explore for oil and gas in six blocks in the region, according to an adviser to the KRG.“The KRG has for the last few months been in discussions with a number of major oil companies. This resulted in the recent signing by ExxonMobil of contracts to explore in six blocks,” Michael Howard, an adviser to the KRG, told the Financial Times.Iraq’s central government has been informed of the agreements, said another person familiar with the situation. ExxonMobil declined to comment.Independent oil and gas companies, including US players Marathon Oil and Hess, have flocked to Kurdistan in recent years, attracted by its relatively untapped hydrocarbon wealth – the region is estimated to hold 45bn barrels of oil and between 100,000bn-200,000bn cubic feet of gas. Tony Hayward, the former chief executive of BP, recently emerged at the helm of Genel Energy, a Kurdistan-focused player.Until now, however, the world’s supermajors such as Exxon, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, have held back from signing contracts for fear of antagonising Baghdad, which has said it believes the contracts are illegitimate.ExxonMobil’s surprise decision could prompt calls from some political factions for the company to lose its position in Iraq. The company led the first US consortium to re-enter Iraq’s oil industry in more than 30 years in 2009 by agreeing to develop the giant West Qurna field. ExxonMobil is also building a multibillion-dollar water injection system that will be used by other foreign oil companies in diferent oil projects in southern Iraq. Oil companies inject water in the reservoirs to increase pressure and production rates.However, people aware of the agreements said Exxon’s decision to agree contracts with the KRG could prove to be a catalyst for the region. The decision to invest comes just weeks before an end-of- December deadline for the US to withdraw its troops from Iraq.Expectations have been rising that a long-awaited hydrocarbons law – which would involve the sharing of revenues – could be finalised by year’s end . Iraq’s prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and the KRG’s prime minister, Barham Salih, met in Baghdad last month and agreed to either amend a 2007 hydrocarbons law as agreed by all political factions or adopt the 2007 law as is, officials said at the time.Exports from Kurdistan, which had been stymied amid the disagreement, have begun to flow, albeit slowly. At the moment, Kurdistan exports an average of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through Iraq’s state oil marketing board. Under a landmark deal negotiated with Baghdad in February, Kurdistan currently receives half of all revenue from the oil it exports. The deal allows producing companies such as Genel Energy, China’s Sinopec and Norway’s DNO, to recoup their investment costs.
34;HES;Hess Corp;2011-10-05T21:33:16Z;US shale gas bonanza: New wells to draw on;Now the technology exists to extract the reserves, the promise is of an industrial renaissance;"In eastern Ohio, brand-new tractors have been zooming off the dealers’ lots, snapped up by local farmers. Suddenly cash-rich after being showered with bonuses for leasing oil and gas drilling rights on their land, typically worth $1,500-$4,000 an acre, they have been quick to invest their windfalls in new equipment.A few years ago, those same leases would have sold for just $15 per acre. The difference now is that eastern Ohio is at the heart of the region that has become the most exciting area for oil and gas development in North America: the Utica shale.Within the past two years, the industry has woken up to the prospect that the rock layer stretching across the north-east of the continent from Kentucky to Ontario is rich in oil, gas and the “natural gas liquids” such as ethane and propane that are used as feedstock for the chemicals industry. Leading companies – including Chesapeake Energy, ExxonMobil and Hess – have between them spent billions of dollars building land holdings with drilling rights.Estimates of the Utica shale’s reserves are imprecise but Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake chief executive, has said he thinks the region could hold 25bn barrels of oil and gas: almost as much as the entire proved reserves remaining in the North Sea. Chesapeake is already reporting “very strong initial drilling results” from its first Utica wells in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.The implications for long-depressed rust belt US states are momentous. The east Ohio tractor boom is one small harbinger of what many people believe is an impending economic
revolution.For decades, as factory employment declined inexorably and US pre-eminence in manufacturing was eroded, its industry has been looking for a lifeline. Now it may have found one, in the shape of shale gas and oil: resources that were long thought impossible to access commercially but have been unlocked by techniques perfected during the past decade.Many other countries, including China, are also thought to hold large shale gas reserves. Britain was gripped last month by reports of a huge discovery in Lancashire in north-west England. The US, however, is way out in front in terms of knowing how to extract the gas. That knowledge creates a crucial competitive advantage that American companies are determined to exploit, not just in gas and oil extraction but in chemicals, steel and other sectors.By creating fast-growing markets for production equipment and services, and providing cheap energy and raw materials, the shale producers are holding out the promise of an American industrial renaissance. “It’s a phenomenal opportunity,” says Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical, who is a vocal supporter of US manufacturing. “This is a gift that American entrepreneurs, the wildcatters, the oil and gas drillers, have given the country: 100 years of natural gas supply. There’s no country on the planet that wouldn’t love to get that, and then use it.”As with most fairy tales, however, the gift comes with a curse. Plans for using this lavish hydrocarbon endowment are threatened by public disquiet over hydraulic fracturing – “fracking” – the process used to release gas and oil by pumping water and chemicals underground at high pressure. President Barack Obama is broadly supportive of shale; the Republicans generally even more so. Yet if the industry causes any serious pollution, a public backlash could keep those resources trapped underground.At a gloomy time for the US economy, the oil and gas sector is a light that burns brightly. As well as direct employment in exploration and production, which is up by 17,000 over the past year to 177,000, the industry is creating thousands of jobs in its suppliers. In Youngstown in eastern Ohio, for instance, France’s Vallourec is building a $650m plant to make steel tubes for oil and gas wells. For an area that has not fully recovered from the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s, the plant is a blessing unimaginable a few years ago.“When we watch the national news about the state of the US economy being negative, we’re not seeing that here. We’re seeing the optimism,” says Walt Good of the Youngstown/Warren business chamber. “People thought they’d never see an industrial investment of this scale again, and now they see this 1m sq ft plant going up. It really gives heart to the psychology of everyone in the area.”The Pennsylvania-based US Steel is another company investing in Ohio to make tubes for oil and gas wells, committing $100m to a new facility to revitalise a plant that first started production in 1905. As well as benefiting from supplying shale gas producers, it is making growing use of their product as a raw material.John Surma, US Steel chief executive, explained recently how the company has been substituting cheap gas for expensive coal in its blast furnaces, saving tens of millions of dollars a year, and is exploring techniques to yield even bigger savings. “We are thankful”, he said in a speech to industry executives last month, for “the natural gas your revolutionary work is helping to bring to market”.Shale gas is particularly important because it is stranded in US, with no facilities to sell it on world markets, although the country’s first liquefaction plant to enable the gas to be exported is now under development. As a result, gas is much cheaper in North America than in other leading economies. The US price of about $3.60 per million British thermal units compares with about $8 in the UK and $16 in Japan.The cost comparison is even more favourable for US manufacturers of petrochemicals that use gas as a raw material and compete with international rivals using oil-based feedstocks. The US gas price works out at the equivalent of $22 a barrel, about one-fifth of the Brent crude price of more than $100.“Natural gas is to the chemicals industry as flour is to a bakery,” says Cal Dooley, president of the American Chemistry Council, an industry group. “Cheap gas means both international and American companies are now looking at the US as the preferred location for new investment.”Hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” is not a new technique – it was first used in the US in 1947 – but it has been enhanced in the past decade to open up “tight” rock such as shale, from which gas and oil would not flow freely without assistance.Public opposition is focused on the composition of fracking fluid: the mix of water, sand and chemicals pumped into oil and gas reservoirs thousands of feet deep. There is evidence of gas leaking into water reservoirs, leading
to the alarming phenomenon of “flammable water”, which can be ignited when the tap is turned on.Of more serious concern would be contamination of water supplies during injection. There is not yet a confirmed case of this, but opponents say much more research is needed to determine whether it is a risk. There are many instances of fluids being improperly disposed after use.Environmental groups argue that it is particularly worrying that the ingredients of some fluids are not publicly disclosed. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry group, has published a list of typical components,
including salt, food additives, and chemicals used in anti-freeze and cosmetics. Some companies are now disclosing ingredients, or using only chemicals approved for human consumption. But others are reluctant to reveal what they call commercially sensitive intellectual property. Many experts and companies in the sector, however, including Royal Dutch Shell, argue improved disclosure is the only way to restore public trust.The big prize in this competition is ethylene, an essential intermediate product used to make many plastics. Dow said this week that while Middle Eastern ethylene producers had the lowest costs of all, the US was now lower-cost than south-east Asia and well below western Europe or north-east Asia. Those calculations have inspired the company to restart one ethylene plant in Louisiana next year and to build a new one in the US to start operating in 2017.Other companies are reaching similar conclusions. Royal Dutch Shell has said it plans to build an ethylene plant in the Appalachia region, meaning Pennsylvania, Ohio or West Virginia. Other oil and gas groups, including Chevron and ConocoPhillips, are also looking at possible new plants. LyondellBasell, the chemicals company, and Williams, which operates gas pipelines, are looking at adding to their US production capacity.For the first decade of the millennium, high and volatile gas prices made US production uncompetitive relative to producers in emerging economies. Jeffrey Lipton, a former chief executive of Canada’s Nova Chemicals who now spreads the shale gas gospel, says the balance of power has shifted back to North America. Unlike in some industrial sectors, China has no competitive advantage in chemicals, because it is an importer of gas and oil.As the effect of cheaper American raw materials works through the value chain, Mr Dooley says, other manufacturers will also be encouraged back to the US to take advantage. “Even in the auto industry we are starting to see a response,” he says. “There are composite and plastic components presently being made outside the US, because it has been cheaper. That competitive advantage no longer exists. In the future the US will be in a far stronger position to be a supplier to the auto industry.” The ACC estimated in March that a 25 per cent increase in ethane production could create 400,000 jobs.There will be limits to how far the gas-powered industrial comeback can go, however. The importance of raw material and energy costs varies widely between industries, and in some they are only marginally significant. US industry is still struggling with problems of weak demand and a currency that is overvalued relative to China’s renminbi. The ACC’s 400,000 jobs to be created compares with 2m manufacturing jobs – and 6.5m jobs in total – that have been lost in the US over the past four years.Like other resource booms, the shale revolution offers the US a chance to rebuild vital parts of its industrial base. The fear shared by many of the people who hope to profit from it is that the country will not seize that opportunity.As shale gas production has grown during the past decade, and development has migrated north and east from the Barnett Shale in Texas where it began, concerns about possible pollution from fracking have grown. In August, Friends of the Earth and 68 other environmental groups wrote to Mr Obama urging him to “employ any legal means to put a halt to hydraulic fracturing …a highly controversial and dangerous method of ‘natural’ gas exploration”.An audit of the energy system of the US, and assessments of the leading companies and the most powerful policy makers that will shape that futurePeter Voser, Shell chief executive, told the Financial Times recently that he thought the gas industry had been “not clever” in its communications strategy and had “let it go for too long” without responding properly to its critics. An independent advisory panel to the US government warned in August that unless the industry raised its standards, “public opposition will grow, thus putting continued production at risk”.In Pennsylvania, about 100 municipalities have adopted bans or restrictions on fracking, even though the state has approved it.For companies hoping to benefit from shale production, the conclusion is clear: oil and gas producers have to make sure they avoid an incident that could impede the shale industry in the way last year’s Deepwater Horizon disaster hit offshore drilling.“If I was the CEO of one of those companies, I’d have to be absolutely sure that everything we were doing in terms of drilling and other operations was as environmentally effective as possible,” Mr Lipton says. “It’s incumbent on the oil and gas industry to be purer than most people expect
it to be, and to make a real investment not just in communications but in the real practical work that they do.”If the industry does not make sure that its environmental performance is watertight, the possibilities for job creation could vanish on the breeze."
35;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
36;HES;Hess Corp;2011-09-19T19:16:43Z;Lost in the sands;Effort to revive Libya’s oil industry will have global consequences;"The first thing Jamid Ahmad did on returning to the Zelten oilfield was to check on the well known as C-1. The 27-year-old mechanic last saw it in February, when he and fellow workers fled the National Oil Company-owned desert facility 450km south-west of Benghazi in the early days of uprising against Colonel Muammer Gaddafi.Following several months during which the abandoned field was controlled by troops loyal to the dictator, Mr Ahmad found the well partially covered in sand but otherwise apparently intact. “This is not just about oil,” he says, his relief evident as he checks that the valves remain as firmly closed as he left them. “This is about the history of Libya.”The C-1 well commands a special place in Libya’s oil industry. It was the country’s first well to pump oil in commercial quantities when production started in September 1961, with output of 20,000 barrels a day. Fifty years later, almost to the day, a pressure gauge at the top of the well reads little more than zero. But the apparent lack of damage suggests Zelten should be able to restart production soon.The story is different elsewhere. Nearby fields as well as Libya’s main export terminals on the southern Mediterranean shores – all visited by the Financial Times this month – showed visible signs of damage, likely to take months to fix. Even in Zelten, the accommodation complex lies ransacked and electricity remains off, hampering the return of workers.Mr Ahmad himself, having checked his room and found that the Gaddafi army took the few valuables he left behind, went home again. His return is crucial not just for the north Africa nation, for which oil revenues are the only significant source of income. They are also significant for the global economy, as higher Libyan production would push oil prices down; and for an energy industry always in search of fresh crude reserves.The revolution has delivered a big setback for the country’s oil industry. It will take months, if not years, to recover to pre-war levels. But in the medium term, the end of the Gaddafi regime also provides an opportunity. Libya has for years punched below its potential, hampered by lack of investment as its leader diverted funds for other causes and his personal use; sanctions preventing the return of US companies; and an exodus of engineers to other countries in the region. But executives and officials believe the country, which boasts Africa’s largest reserves, could produce much more oil in the next two decades if the new ruling class pursues the right policies. In 1969, the year Gaddafi gained power, Libya produced nearly as much as Saudi Arabia – 3.1m b/d and 3.3m b/d, respectively – a clear sign of its potential.The Libyan revolution has rewritten the who’s who of its oil industry. For years Shokri Ghanem, the Gaddafi-era prime minister who became head of the National Oil Company, controlled all the sector’s levers. But since his defection in May, and the rebels’ victory in Tripoli in August, new figures have taken charge.The most prominent is Ali Tarhouni, the finance, economy and oil minister in waiting. The former economics professor, returning from a long exile, has little experience in the energy industry and insiders say he is likely to relinquish his nominal control to Abdel Rahman bin Yezza in a reshuffle. Ahmed Omar Shakmak – based in the eastern city of Benghazi, previously the rebels’ stronghold – is deputy oil minister and the senior official receiving most visiting industry executives. Two weeks ago, it was Italy’s Eni; last week, Repsol YPF of Spain.Nuri Berruien, newly-elected chairman of the National Oil Company, is the most senior official in charge of producing, refining and exporting the black stuff. The 65-year-old petroleum engineer was about to retire, just before the start of the revolution six months ago, from a senior position at the Arab Gulf Oil Company (Agoco), an NOC subsidiary, but is now busier than ever trying to restart Libya’s oil industry. He, too, is based in Benghazi, although NOC headquarters were in Tripoli before the revolution.Under Ahmed Majbri, the newly- appointed chairman (previously employed in the company’s finance department), Agoco has already started production at Sarir and Messla. Both of the country’s easternmost oilfields fell under rebel control in the early days of the revolution.As a member of the ruling National Transitional Council’s oversight committees for finance, economy and oil, Mustafa el-Huni is another official crucial to the oil industry. Although there are four others on the committee, he is seen to be in charge of oil affairs. He was vice-chairman of the National Oil Company in the 1980s, and observers say he could play a central role in shaping Libya’s long-term energy policy. He has already spoken in favour of splitting the NOC into two or three companies and devoting more attention to the development of the natural gas industry.Libyan oil is far more important for the global economy and the oil industry than appears at first glance. Before the uprising began, it supplied about 1.6m b/d – a mere two per cent of global output, roughly the same as Italy’s consumption, according to the International Energy Agency, the western countries’ oil watchdog. But the headline figure is deceptive. Libya produces a particularly high-quality crude, sought after by western refiners for its low sulphur content, which helps meet strict new environmental rules for petrol and diesel. Precise figures are hard to come by, but industry executives estimate that the country is one of the leading producers of low-sulphur oil, accounting for roughly 10-15 per cent of global output. Moreover, Libya’s proximity to Europe reduces transport costs.As Libyan production dried up, refiners raced to find high-quality alternatives, driving up prices. Brent, which is a global benchmark, surged to a two-year high of $127.02 a barrel in early April. That, in turn, has contributed to higher inflation, which has pushed monetary authorities, including the European Central Bank, to raise interest rates.The disruption to supply caused by the war forced an extraordinary response from Saudi Arabia, which raised its production to nearly 10m b/d, the highest in 30 years. However, Saudi crude is medium-quality oil so, while the kingdom was able to cover the volume lost, it was unable to bridge the quality gap. As the market for high-quality oil continued to tighten, driving up prices, the IEA ordered the release of members’ strategic reserves – only the third time it has done so.Coupled with a slowdown in global oil demand growth, and the effect of the IEA’s mandated release of strategic stocks, the anticipated return of Libya to the oil market is exerting downward pressure on prices. Brent has fallen to $110 a barrel. But hopes could be getting ahead of the reality on the ground. The country is producing only about 160,000 b/d from its easternmost fields, Sarir and Messla, of which only about 100,000 b/d would be exported – less than one-tenth of prewar levels.However, Nuri Berruien, the new chairman of the National Oil Company, says flows could reach the critical 1m b/d level in about six months. And, he adds, “in 15 months we can reach the prewar level of 1.6m b/d”.The pace of the industry’s reconstruction is crucial to the global oil market and, by extension, the global economy. Some of the leading companies rely heavily on Libya – among them, Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, OMV of Austria, Wintershall of Germany, and US-based Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Hess and Marathon. Eni and Repsol, the largest investors in the country, have already sent senior executives to Benghazi, the eastern stronghold of the former rebels, to discuss their return.Yet some of their number say security fears threaten a speedy return. “Safety is paramount to the big international companies and it would take time for them to feel the country is OK,” says Anders Nilsson, Benghazi-based head of Condrill, a Swedish drilling company. Today, while there is a consensus that bringing Libya back on tap will be tough, interviews in Benghazi reveal disagreement among the new oil establishment emerging from the rebel ranks, executives and diplomats about how long that process will take.The most immediate challenge is not war damage but looting. When Gaddafi loyalists fled some of the largest oilfields and terminals, they took all they could: cars, trucks, power generators, pumps and other equipment. Local gangs – and rebels in some cases – took whatever remained. Besides requiring considerable new investment, this has created a further problem: logistics. Oil workers need food and sleeping quarters in often remote desert facilities. They have neither.Then there is the damage that is not immediately visible. Officials may be relieved to see light or no surface damage in fields such as Zelten; but they worry about possible, as yet undetected, problems underground. Oil wells need constant maintenance and, after six months of stoppage, facilities hundreds of meters below the sands, could have suffered lasting damage. “Electrical submersible pumps that sit at the bottom of wells deep underground must be lifted to the surface and cleaned regularly, which is especially important in Libyan wells, given the waxier nature of the crude there,” says Ed Morse of Citigroup. In the worst case scenario, companies would have to redrill the wells, says Yousif Al Gheriani, head of the 17th February Committee for oil and gas, which groups workers in eastern Libya.Another problem is the oil reservoirs themselves, above all in the most mature fields of the Sirte basin, near Col Gaddafi’s home town – still the scene of violent conflict – which had been pumping since the 1960s. To force the crude oil out of the reservoirs, engineers maintain pressure by injecting them with water or natural gas. After six months of stoppage, the first task for the arriving crews will not be to start production but to re-establish pressure.But Libya’s output is almost worthless if it cannot be exported to the global market. And officials are discovering that some of their ports have fared worse than the oilfields. Libya has six main terminals, of which at least two – Es Sider and Marsa el Brega – are heavily damaged.All these factors could slow Libya’s return to the international market. Given time, the country has the potential to rebuild the industry and exceed former production levels. But years of US-imposed sanctions, plus Col Gaddafi’s refusal to invest in the NOC, means it pumps less than African nations with a smaller geological endowment. Officials say the NOC’s old target of increasing production to 2m b/d by about 2015 is no longer on the table.Industry executives say Libya is not as big a prize as Iraq. There, oil companies – from New York-listed ExxonMobil to Chinese state-owned enterprises – have fought hard to win contracts to develop the industry and boost production from about 2.8m b/d to as much as 6m b/d by 2020. But they acknowledge that the African country has the potential to as much as double its production in the next two decades. Ross Cassidy of the Wood Mackenzie consultancy says today’s leadership “may take Libya into a new era where its natural resources are used more effectively for the benefit of the broader population”, seeking investments to achieve its full production potential of about 3m b/d. For that, it would need to open up fully to international companies with the financial and technical expertise to recover more from mature oilfields.The big prize could lie, however, in another hydrocarbon: natural gas. Libya has been slow in developing its gas industry, particularly when compared with neighbouring Algeria. In 1971, it became the second country – after Algeria – to export supercooled liquefied natural gas using tankers. But the development of the industry has been slow – again partly because of US sanctions, but also because of Col Gaddafi’s lack of interest. Exports, nonetheless, have grown significantly in the last few years, since the opening of the Greenstream underwater pipeline to Italy. Still, Libya exported just 349bn cubic feet of natural gas in 2010; the figure for Algeria was more than 2,000bn cu ft. “Gas was fully ignored during the Gaddafi’s years,” says Mustafa el-Huni, the National Transitional Council member in charge of energy affairs. That will now change, he says. Again, international expertise will be required to build – and finance – the costly plants to export the product.However, much of the future of Libya’s hydrocarbon industry will depend on people such as Mr Ahmad. Looking out over the desert at Zelten, opening his arms as if to embrace the dozens of oil wells scattered across a vast landscape of rolling dunes, he says: “Look at this. Gaddafi used to own it. This is now ours. We will work hard for it.”"
37;HES;Hess Corp;2011-09-14T20:52:32Z;Gulf Keystone to fund pipeline via block sale;;Gulf Keystone Petroleum, the oil explorer focused on the Kurdistan region of Iraq, is planning to sell a minority stake in one of its exploration blocks as it pursues feasibility plans to build an export pipeline through Turkey.Todd Kozel, chairman and chief executive of the Aim-traded company, said it remained well funded to continue exploration work across its Shaikan, Sheikh Adi and Ber Bahr fields in northern Iraq. He added that it could expect institutional backing for investment in a pipeline allowing large-scale oil exports to western markets.The company, which ended the six months to June with net cash of $137m (£87m), is examining plans for a pipeline capable of carrying 440,000 barrels a day north from its Shaikan field to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan export pipeline.Mr Kozel declined to put a price on the amount he hoped to raise from its 20 per cent stake in the Akri-Bijeel block, which is majority owned by partner MOL Hungarian Oil & Gas. However, it is believed to be looking for about $300m-$350m.He added that he expected further progress to be made between the semi-autonomous government of the Kurdistan region and Iraq’s central government aimed at agreeing a formula for revenue sharing on exports. A final agreement would remove the political uncertainty facing operators in the area.Rising hopes of a resolution of the dispute over rights to Iraq’s oil wealth have helped continue to attract a number of other operators to the Kurdish region over the past year including Repsol, Hess Corp and Marathon Oil. Vallares, the oil investment vehicle backed by former BP chief executive Tony Hayward and financier Nat Rothschild, is the latest to enter through a planned merger with Turkey’s Genel Energy.A resumption of oil exports from the Kurdistan region of Iraq in February, alongside the agreement of a payment mechanism to foreign oil producers, helped buoy Gulf Keystone’s share price earlier this year. The company said it continued to contest vigorously claims made by Excalibur Ventures, a US-based energy and infrastructure company, which last December filed a court claim against it for nearly a third of its oil assets in Kurdistan.Evolution, the broker, welcomed signs of progress at the company in developing its assets. “Progress has been swift and numbers look very encouraging,” it said. “But the recent rapid rise in the share price suggests much has already been priced in.”The shares, up 37 per cent over the past year, closed down 2¼p at 179¼p, valuing its equity at £1.37bn.
38;HES;Hess Corp;2011-09-06T16:32:36Z;Long road to recovery for seared and twisted pipes;;"Work stopped suddenly at the Es Sider oil terminal.A dust-covered fax dated February 18 sits on the desk of the “oil movement supervisor”, where it was hurriedly left as workers fled Colonel Muammer Gaddafi’s advancing troops. “This is to inform you that the Es Sider lifting programme for the month of March 2011 will be as follows,” the fax states, detailing the arrival dates of tankers chartered by, among others, US companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Amerada Hess.The tankers never docked at the port, a consequence of the Libyan oil industry’s descent into chaos after the revolution against Col Gaddafi began on February 17.Six months later, as the Financial Times toured the heavily damaged facility, a handful of rebel soldiers was guarding the mangled skeletons of melted pipelines, burnt equipment and looted buildings.“When Gaddafi’s forces started to withdraw, they hit the terminal with rocket-propelled grenades,” said Mentham Said, a 37-year-old rebel soldier.Es Sider, and its sister cities of Marsa el-Brega and Ras Lanuf, are at the centre of the Libyan oil industry and are home to the country’s largest refineries and export terminals.The three strategic oil towns lie along a coastal strip that has seen some of the fiercest fighting during the conflict to overthrow Col Gaddafi, changing hands between rebels and regime forces several times.Even today, the front line lies just 75km to the west, where opposition fighters are massing outside Sirte, Col Gaddafi’s birthplace.The combat has left the towns scattered with landmines and scarred with burnt oil tanks, ruptured pipelines and looted residential complexes – all of which will hamper the recovery of the Libyan oil industry over the next year, officials and experts say.The damage is greatest at Es Sider, the largest terminal in Libya and the most crucial to the rebuilding of the oil industry. According to the International Energy Agency, the terminal exported 341,000 b/d last year, more than a quarter of the country’s total sales of 1.27m b/d.At the port, three of 16 crude storage tanks, are still burning and others are damaged, while at the terminal itself the metering station and key pipeline junctions were blown up, with thick steel pipelines ripped open like food cans. The resulting fire reached temperatures that melted metal and concrete.The control room has been looted, as well as many other offices and warehouses. Computers lie on the floor broken; filing cabinets are empty.About 8km to the west, the petrochemical complex of Ras Lanuf fared better.The refinery, the country’s largest, with a capacity of 220,000 b/d, is largely intact, although two large kerosene tanks were burnt down after being hit by shells.Several warehouses were looted, too, and at least one control room was sabotaged.Despite the damage, workers are slowly returning. “I’m dying, waiting for the moment I can start the pumps,” said Anwar Ali, chief supervisor at the refinery.“They made such a nice noise,” he added, as proud of the cogs that power Ras Lanuf as a father would be of his children.Yet Mr Ali acknowledged it would take time for the facility to function again.The refinery has no power supply, and the residential complex that houses employees’ families has been ransacked, with some houses destroyed. Even the interior of the workers’ mosque is riddled with bullet holes. The terminal and small refinery at Marsa el Brega, about 48km east of Ras Lanuf, are also badly damaged from the fighting.But the destruction is less of a concern than the estimated 10,500 mines laid by Col Gaddafi’s troops, Benghazi-based oil officials and security experts say.“Gaddafi had some nasty landmines of Chinese origin which are difficult to detect. It will take time to remove them all,” said a western security expert in Benghazi.The other challenge is to secure the three oil towns fully. Although the rebels retook them more than 10 days ago, their grip is still thin. A brigade of about 200 men has been formed to protect Ras Lanuf with equipment donated by Qatar.But Es Sider and Marsa El Brega remain largely unprotected, with only a few soldiers of the ragtag rebel army standing guard."
39;HES;Hess Corp;2011-09-05T16:07:53Z;Colossal task ahead for Libya’s new oil chief;;Six months ago Nuri Berruien was anticipating his retirement from one of the subsidiaries of Libya’s National Oil Company. But the start of the civil-war put paid to his plans.Now the 65-year old petroleum engineer is busier than ever as the newly appointed chairman of the state-owned NOC.“I have a national duty,” he says at the company’s small offices in Benghazi – for months the rebels’ stronghold. Its Tripoli headquarters are not yet considered safe. “The oil industry before the revolution was operated under the worst bureaucratic and corrupted regime.”Mr Berruien’s task is colossal. Before the war, Libya pumped 1.6m barrels a day of high quality crude oil, sought after by European refiners because of its low sulphur content. Now output has fallen to zero.The fall of Muammer Gaddafi’s regime after 42 years could see Libya producing 100,000-300,000 b/d in the next couple of months, from fields in the east – under rebel control since the start of the civil war – and offshore fields in the Mediterranean. But ramping up output to pre-crisis levels will take more than a year under the most optimistic scenario, Mr Berruien acknowledges.The first task for Mr Berruien and his team is to improve security enough to get thousands of workers, scattered across Libya, back to their jobs in remote areas of the country’s oil-rich desert. Even today, after the fall of Tripoli, skirmishes continue in oil areas in the west, and some oilfields are mined.The workers’ return will also be hampered by extensive looting at desert compounds. Vehicles, for example, have been taken away by gangs or used by Col Gaddafi’s army.“We have started to clear the mines. But it will take time,” says Mr Berruien.Lars Nylin, head of Countermine, a company that specialises in landmines removal and is already in Benghazi, says it could take up to 18 months to clear mines and booby traps laid by Col Gaddafi’s forces around the country’s oil infrastructure.However, Mr Berruien says local staff are willing to live for a while in the desert in precarious tent camps until construction companies can rebuild their compounds and supplies – from air conditioners to television sets – arrive.When workers return, they will need to check more than 2,000 oil wells, some deep in the Sahara desert more than 1,000km from the coastline. Even if the wells appear intact, six months of inactivity could have damaged them. “We know that some of the wells will come back [into production] and others will be dead,” Mr Berruien says.He is particularly worried about the wells with submerged pumps, used in the most mature fields such as those of the Sirte basin, which accounts for two-thirds of the country’s production. “We know many pumps will fail,” he says. In those cases, NOC will have to drill new wells, which will mean waiting until spare parts arrive and, most likely, will require the help of foreign contractors yet to return to Libya.“The next step is to build up production, but that will require foreign oil companies’ support,” he says, referring to previous joint ventures between NOC and companies including Eni of Italy, Repsol of Spain, Total of France, OMV of Austria, Wintershall of Germany, and US-based Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Amereda Hess and Marathon.But simply rehabilitating the oilfields would not put Libya back into the global oil market. Pipelines and oil export terminals are another – and bigger – problem. Col Gaddafi’s forces mined a key pipeline hub connecting some of the country’s biggest oilfields with the terminals of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, the most important. And the oil terminals themselves have suffered, particularly their state-of-the-art control rooms. Mr Berruien says he is confident most of the damage can be repaired, however.Overcoming all the obstacles would return Libya to its prewar level of 1.6m b/d in about 15 months or so.But the big prize lies ahead. Mr Berruien firmly believes that the country, which holds Africa’s largest oil reserves, will be able to find new oilfields and boost its production above that level over the next five years.
40;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Full Libyan oil output could be years away;;Libya could return to the global oil market within weeks after the rebels appeared to be on the brink of victory, but the full resumption of output is months, if not years, away.Libya produced about 1.6m barrels a day of oil before the start of the civil war, but the six-month conflict has reduced the flow to just 50,000 b/d, according to industry estimates.Consultants and industry executives believe the fall of the 41-year-old regime of Muammer Gaddafi could see Libya producing 300,000 b/d during the next three months from fields in the east, which have been under rebel control since the start of the civil war, and the remote south-west desert. But ramping up output to pre-crisis levels would take years under the most benign scenario.“I’m sceptical that Libya will return to its pre-war output until 2013 or well beyond,” says Ben Cahill, an expert on Libya at oil consultants PFC Energy in Washington, echoing a widely held industry’s view.Wood Mackenzie, the oil consultancy, agrees, saying in a report issued last week it would take about 36 months for the country’s crude oil output to recover to pre-crisis levels.The experience in previous oil disruptions, from Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution to Venezuela following the opposition-backed oil strike of 2002-03, indicates that production takes a considerable time to return to normal levels. In Iraq, although the oil infrastructure emerged largely intact from the US-led invasion in 2003, output only returned to its pre-war level in 2008 as the end of the hostilities saw political chaos, widespread looting and attacks on the infrastructure.“Even if Tripoli can be secured by rebel forces, as the second Iraq war demonstrated, how effectively the peace can be policed will be vital to a rapid restart in production,” says Lawrence Eagles, head of oil research at JPMorgan and a former senior official at the International Energy Agency.Executives and consultants fear that divisions among the rebels could lead to similar problems in Libya. Even if the country avoids the political and security pitfalls, geology would be an obstacle in the key Sirte basin, which accounts for about two-thirds of Libya’s oil output. The fields there are mature and, as a result, are likely to require extensive repairs to restore production.Moreover, some oil export terminals, including Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, in the centre of the country, and Melitah, in the west, have been damaged. Oil companies say their vehicles have disappeared from compounds, while high prices for base metals such as copper are encouraging looting by local gangs. Thus, the most likely scenario is a progressive ramp up in output.Shokri Ghanem, the former Libyan oil minister who defected three months ago, said the country cannot start pumping right away due to damage and looting, but could produce up to 400,000 b/d in three to four months. “But to go back to the level they used to produce it may take two years,” he told Platts, the industry publication.But with oil prices above $100 a barrel, the financial incentives to resume full production are so great that the new government, and foreign oil companies, will work extremely hard to accelerate output.The east of the country would be the first to start producing again through the Benghazi-based Arab Arabian Gulf Oil Company. Agoco broke links with the Gaddafi-controlled National Oil Company months ago and could, eventually, pump 440,000 b/d from oil fields in the east including Sarir, Libya’s largest.Agoco briefly exported some oil earlier in the war, but was forced to stop after Gaddafi forces attacked the fields. Since then, the rebel national transitional council has been forming a protection force to allow for repairs. Agoco believes the repairs could be completed in two or three weeks, and using a 500km long pipeline that cuts across the desert of eastern Libya it could restart production soon.The outlook for other areas is more uncertain as oil companies have yet to assess damage to their facilities. Foreign executives have offered upbeat forecasts, saying they could restart production before the end of the year. Among the most bullish is Repsol YPF of Spain, the second-largest foreign oil company in Libya by production, and Wintershall, a subsidiary of BASF of Germany. Miguel Martínez, chief operating officer at Repsol, told analysts last month the company could be pumping within four weeks of the end of the war from its operated fields that produce 350,000 b/d.Eni of Italy could also restore production from the offshore fields relatively quickly too. The area, known as the Pelagian basin, is 100km north of Tripoli in the Mediterranean.The prospects for the central Sirte basin, which has been controlled by Col Gaddafi, is far more sombre. The Gaddafi-loyal National Oil Company has controlled there two important subsidiaries, its wholly owned Sirte Oil, and Waha Oil, a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Hess. Industry consultants say the area has sustained damage, requiring extensive repairs.

In response, broker Fox Davies Capital reiterated its “buy” recommendation. “This is yet another positive technical update from the company. In our valuation, we have assumed 600m barrels of gross recoverable resource and 480m barrels net to Gulf Keystone; the independent estimates support these figures,” it said, also reckoning the explorer could be a takeover target.“There is increasing interest from large independents and international oil companies in Kurdistan’s oil and gas sector as demonstrated by the recent entries by Afren, PetroCeltic, Amerada Hess and Marathon. We believe that with the improving political situation this interest will grow and we would expect that Gulf Keystone with its growing resource base and exploration prospects could become a target for a number of international and national oil companies.”In the same sector, Sound Oil fell 6 per cent to 1.97p after the explorer had a couple of permits withdrawn in Italy, while Dragon Oil, a Turkmenistan-focused explorer, moved up 5.6 per cent to 454¼p after half-year results impressed. “Overall, very strong results. Dragon is making very good progress to further grow production at Cheleken. It is one of the most defensive stocks in the sector, and, in our view, a very strong M&A candidate”, said broker Matrix.Beacon Hill Resources firmed 2.9 per cent to 8.87p having completed a trial to truck coal from its Minas Moatize mine in the Tete region of Mozambique to a local port. “The completion of the first shipments has tested the logistics route to the port as an alternate to the rail infrastructure, and is expected to be capable of hauling 0.5m tonnes per annum if required,” noted the mining team at Collins Stewart.“With a strong foothold in the key emerging coking coal province, we continue to see significant upside in the stock as production slowly ramps up to provide the first coking sales into export market,” Collins Stewart said, reiterating its “buy” recommendation and 19p target price.Medical technology group Axis-Shield, up 0.3 per cent to 463½p, was in focus again after its US bidder, Alere, acquired more stock. Its holding now stands at just over 9 per cent. Alere went hostile with a 460p a share offer last week."
42;HES;Hess Corp;2011-08-08T18:56:25Z;Kurdistan oil hopes rise with new ventures;;"A recent spate of London-listed oil companies entering Kurdistan has boosted hopes of an agreement with Iraq’s central government that could lead to a significant increase in crude exports.Ever since the UK government installed King Faisal as the first ruler of modern Iraq 90 years ago Kurdistan has been touted as the oil province of tomorrow. The industry’s interest is obvious: Kurdistan’s fabled soils hold some 45bn barrels of oil and between 100,000bn-200,000bn cubic feet of gas, according to estimates by Ashti Hawrami, natural resources minister in the Kurdistan regional government (KRG).“There are very few places left in the world with onshore prospects like it,” says Paul Atherton, chief financial officer of FTSE 250 group Heritage Oil. “But first-mover advantage is key.”The semi-autonomous region currently exports an average of 175,000 barrels per day equivalent through Iraq’s state oil marketing board according to the oil ministry, a figure officials project will rise to 200,000 b/d by the end of the year.Under a landmark deal negotiated with Iraq in February, Kurdistan currently receives half of all revenue from the oil it exports, allowing producing companies, such as Turkey’s Genel Energy, China’s Sinopec and Norway’s DNO, to recoup their investment costs.In May the KRG received its first oil payment from Baghdad of $243m, equivalent to 50 per cent of net revenues from the export of more than 5m barrels of oil between the start of February and March 27. But it is hoped Kurdistan will substantially increase exports – to 1m b/d by 2015 – once the long-awaited federal revenue sharing law is finalised, which could guarantee the KRG about 17 per cent of total oil revenue from Iraq.It would also mean oil companies’ contracts with the KRG – currently illegitimate in the eyes of Baghdad – would finally be recognised.According to a person at the KRG oil ministry who asked not to be named, the regional government thinks an agreement could be reached by the end of the year. The February deal is, according to the person, “a confidence-building measure” and Baghdad needs the extra revenue.“We calculate Iraq has lost billions of dollars because of past disagreements about Iraq’s constitutional requirements about oil and gas exports,” the person says, adding companies will be allowed to export at international prices. “The current plan is an interim agreement …we’re focused on business not ideology here.”The recent flurry of interest from London-listed companies suggests political risk is on the wane – and a desire to snap up the region’s low-hanging fruit before its too late is on the increase.London-listed Gulf Keystone Petroleum has been producing small volumes for the local market since October 2010. The company is now in the process of commissioning exports with the KRG targeting 10,000 b/d by the end of the year.In late July, Aim-quoted Petroceltic, along with the US independent Hess, committed itself to a $72m exploration campaign in two oil blocks in Kurdistan, as did Spain’s Repsol.“Kurdistan’s attraction is that it’s highly prospective,” says Brian O’Cathain, chief executive of Petroceltic. “Its one of the few places left where you can see undrilled [prospects] using Google Earth which are full of oil. They’re the type of targets people were drilling in 1910.“The size of new companies gaining entry is getting larger so the prize seemed to be moving away from us,” says Mr O’Cathain. “We didn’t want to miss the opportunity.”On the same day as Petroceltic’s announcement, the FTSE 250 upstream company Afren, hitherto focused on Nigeria, said it would pay Moldova’s Komet Group $418.7m for a 60 per cent stake in the Barda Rash field and $169.5m to the KRG for a 20 per cent stake in the nearby Ain Sifni field.The onshore assets have combined estimated resources of 890m barrels of oil according to the company, which is Afren’s only asset outside Africa.Osman Shahenshah, Afren’s chief executive, says there are certain parallels between Nigeria and Kurdistan that have allowed independent companies to enter the market.“In Nigeria the majors are not participating because they’re selling down; in Kurdistan they’re not participating because they’re in the south.”According to Samuel Ciszuk, a senior Middle East energy analyst at IHS, the main reason why oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil – with big projects in Iraq – have not moved into Kurdistan is in part because of not wanting to antagonise Baghdad.“Most of the ‘de-risking’ of Kurdistan is based on faith in a deal [with Baghdad] will be reached,” he says. “Companies that have gone in now want to take a bet – that if you have a deal on paper the valuation will be completely different.”Last month Vallares, the oil and gas acquisition vehicle set up by Nat Rothschild and former BP chief executive Tony Hayward, was reportedly considering investing in Genel.One of the region’s biggest producers, Genel has interests in seven licences and minority stakes in the Taq Taq and Tawke oilfields which have a combined production of 110,000 b/d.However, with much of the most prospective acreage already owned, many analysts believe Kurdistan could become a hive of merger and acquisition activity as new entrants attempt to gain market access.“The upstream opportunities available in Kurdistan – large onshore undiscovered resources – are diminishing worldwide,” says Phil Corbett, an oil and gas analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. “If you want to go you’ve got to buy companies or farm in to existing concessions, so I think we’ll see a lot of corporate activity going forward.”"
43;HES;Hess Corp;2011-07-27T18:57:25Z;Afren pays $588m for Iraq fields;;Afren, the Africa-focused upstream oil and gas company, has underlined the growing interest from London-listed energy groups in Kurdistan’s oil resources by agreeing to invest $588.2m in two oil fields in the region of northern Iraq.The FTSE-250 company said it would pay Moldova’s Komet Group $418.7m for a 60 per cent stake in the Barda Rash field and $169.5m to Kurdistan’s regional government for a 20 per cent stake in the nearby Ain Sifni field. The onshore assets have combined estimated resources of 890m barrels of oil, according to the company.Galib Virani, associate director, said the deal, which is Afren’s first acquisition outside Africa, represents “a unique opportunity”.“[The deal] would not be here for too much longer… it’s a relationship deal, we’ve got a good relationship with the government [and] an early mover advantage,” he said. “It [fits in] with a skill set we’ve developed in Nigeria and which we’re taking [to Kurdistan].”Afren, which expects to produce 75,000 barrels a day from the Barda Rash field by 2017, said it would fund the deal using a mixture of existing cash and funds raised through a share placement.The company said it had a $200m credit facility from BNP Paribas and VTB Capital. It also intends to make a placing of ordinary shares representing some 8.5 percent of its existing share capital. The placement, whose price is not yet known, will be carried out by Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.Earlier this month Afren cut its full year average production estimate by as much as 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day because of delays at a centrepiece field in Nigeria.The company said it had $320.4m in cash and net debt of $343.9m at the end of June.The acquisition highlights increasing interest from London-listed oil companies in Kurdistan, long considered by the industry as one of the world’s last relatively untapped onshore oil sources. However, exports have been stymied while regional authorities broker a revenue sharing mechanism with Iraq’s central government.Aim-listed Petroceltic announced on Wednesday it had agreed an exploration venture with regard to two oil blocks in Kurdistan with the US oil company Hess.Earlier this month Vallares, the oil and gas acquisition cash shell founded by Nat Rothschild and former BP boss Tony Hayward, was considering investing in Turkey’s Genel Energy, one of Kurdistan’s biggest oil producers.
44;HES;Hess Corp;2011-06-23T20:50:49Z;Energy and financials lead losses on Wall St;;"Energy and financial stocks led the losses in a volatile session on Wall Street as traders continued to digest the downbeat assessment of the US economy given by the Federal Reserve late in the previous session and also worried about a disappointing rise in unemployment claims.The markets tumbled in early trading on these worries, but then managed to rally somewhat towards the end of the session on news reports that European leaders had reached a breakthrough on a Greek austerity plan.Still, the financial sector still saw the sharpest losses in the session, falling 1 per cent as Fifth Third Bancorp fell 2.5 per cent to $12.09 and Bank of New York Mellondeclined 2.3 per cent to $25.44. The KBW banking index was down 1 per cent.Industrial stocks also suffered from a “risk off” trade. Boeing was down 1.2 per cent to $71.25 as the S&P industrial index fell 0.3 per cent.But the worst losses came from the energy sector as oil prices fell hard after an unexpected intervention in the oil markets by the International Energy Agency.The S&P energy index was down 1.1 per cent as Schlumberger fell 0.6 per cent to $83.10 and Chevron lost 1.7 per cent to $99.36.The sell-off in risk assets began late on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered its growth forecast for the US economy and lifted its inflation expectations.The downbeat mood persisted into Thursday’s session, and the S&P 500 was down 1.5 per cent by mid-session.But the markets reversed some of their losses in late trading following a Reuters report that Greece had forged a deal with the EU and IMF on a five-year austerity plan.The S&P 500 then closed only 0.3 per cent lower at 1,283.50.Helping keep the index in negative territory, however, was data from the labour department showing that the number of unemployed Americans filing for jobless benefits rose 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 429,000 last week, which was more than had been expected by economists.Separate data from the commerce department showed that new home sales fell 2.1 per cent in May, though the news was not all bad as the median home sale price rose 2.6 per cent from April.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.5 per cent to 12,053.93. The Nasdaq Composite ended the session up 0.7 per cent to 2,686.82.The Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 7.5 per cent to 29.77.Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, argued that the losses in the session were due to a downturn in sentiment rather than any change in the fundamentals, as the economic data were mixed and the Federal Reserve did not say anything that had not been anticipated.The financial sector actually saw some strong gains in the session, led by Western Digitalwhich jumped 7.1 per cent to $37.01 after a favourable analyst report. Elsewhere, Red Hat gained 3.6 per cent to $45.27 after the software company reported better-than-
expected first-quarter earnings and raised its forecast for the year.Micron Technology was up 3.1 per cent to $8.43 while Nvidiaadded 3 per cent to $16.21. The S&P technology sector was up 0.9 per cent.The healthcare sector saw almost no losses in the session, helped by gains from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer after the companies said their blood thinner Apixaban (Eliquis) had seen some positive trial results. Bristol-Myers was up 5.7 per cent to $29.33 while Pfizer added 1.8 per cent to $20.65.In other news, Rite Aid, the drugstore chain, was up 5.5 per cent to $1.16 after reporting a smaller-than-
expected first-quarter loss driven by a decline in expenses and stronger same-store sales growth.Lennar, the homebuilder, also reported a loss that was better than analysts had expected. Its stock was up 2.3 per cent to $18.51, but it was still 1.8 per cent lower over the year.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, rose 5.3 per cent to $56.93 after its first-quarter earnings beat earnings targets and the company raised its outlook for profit growth this yearConAgra, the maker of Healthy Choice frozen meals, was down 0.2 per cent to $25.37 after its earnings fell short of expectations and investors worried about the effect of higher commodity costs."
45;HES;Hess Corp;2011-05-10T20:49:00Z;US stocks edge higher as global worries ease;;Microsoft lost ground after the software group confirmed that it was buying Skype for $8.5bn while US stocks continued to trend higher following the strong non-farm payrolls report.Shares in the world’s second-largest technology company by market capitalisation were down 0.6 per cent to $25.67 after announcing the deal with Skype.The acquisition is one of the largest by Microsoft and illustrates how the company is attempting to boost its online operations.The last substantial deal was the purchase of Aquantive, an online advertising company, in 2007 for more than $6bn.The move brings the value of worldwide tech-related mergers and acquisitions to $85.5bn, the strongest start to the year for tech M&A since 2000 according to Thomson Reuters.Ebay, the online auction site that still owns 30 per cent of Skype, was up 2.5 per cent to $33.93 in expectation of a windfall.Ebay shares were helped by the fact that the value put on Skype by the acquisition represents a large premium to what Wall Street had been expecting from its planned initial public offering.The news comes as a host of other internet companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Groupon and Twitter are looking for initial public offerings at potentially lofty valuations.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,357.16, with solid economic data showing that US wholesalers had stockpiled goods in March as sales rose strongly helping to lift sentiment on Wall Street.But the wider markets were also bouncing back from losses last week after a string of disappointing economic data called into question the strength of the US economic recovery and sent the S&P 500 down 1.7 per cent.This malaise was largely banished on Friday, however, after a bumper official non-farm payroll figure turned sentiment around, leading to three solid days of gains on the S&P 500.“The jobs data on Friday was off the charts and that good news has been working its way into stock prices this week,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,760.59 while the Nasdaq Composite added 1 per cent to 2,871.89.The gains on Tuesday were broad based but industrial stocks saw some of the strongest improvements as healthy trade data from China pointed to robust global economic growth.United Parcel Service, one of the world’s largest package delivery companies, was up 0.9 per cent to $74.37 while General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.30.The S&P industrial sector was up 0.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the worst performing, weighed by falling oil prices after it was announced late on Monday that margins on US oil contracts would be raised by 25 per cent.The oil price recovered as the session continued but investors remained cautious. Hess Corp declined 0.4 per cent to $79.67 while ExxonMobil lost 0.4 per cent to $70.31.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Dean Food rose 11.5 per cent to $12.24 after the dairy and meat purveyor beat expectations with its first-quarter results and raised its earnings forecast.The company lifted its forecast to 67-75 cents a share from its earlier view of 55-65 cents.It also estimated second-quarter earnings of 15-20 cents, ahead of the 13 cents expected by analysts.But in absolute terms, the food group’s first-quarter profit fell 41 per cent as margins slid, however.The stock is still down more than 30 per cent since the start of 2010.JA Solar Holdings was up 6.2 per cent to $6.48 after reporting a better than expected quarterly profit, although the solar company also said its second-quarter sales would be slowed by a cut in renewable energy subsidies in Italy.Wendy’s-Arby’s rose 4.2 per cent to $5.02 after the fast food group reported strong same-store sales growth in the US.Investors were impressed in spite of the company reporting a loss of $1.4m in the quarter compared with a profit of $3.4m a year earlier as well as lowering its full-year earnings forecast.Sotheby’s, the auction house, lost 6.1 per cent to $43.71 after reporting slimmer-than-expected first-quarter profit.The auctioneer did report an increase in the number of works sold over $1m but competitive pressures to win the consignments resulted in lower commission margins.
46;HES;Hess Corp;2011-04-27T20:56:04Z;US markets cheer Fed decision;;Amazon led the gains on Wall Street after investors responded positively to its first-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets the Nasdaq Composite index hit a 10-year high after the Federal Reserve’s latest statement on monetary policy and the subsequent press briefing by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed.Shares in the world’s largest online retailer jumped 7.9 per cent to $169.63, an all-time high, after the company reported a 38 per cent jump in sales.This increase in revenues, however, was accompanies by a 33 per cent fall in net income for the quarter as new investments in data storage and distribution eclipsed the rise in sales.But investors had already braced themselves for a drop in earnings and some analysts appeared to be convinced by a letter from Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer, justifying the revenue focused strategy.This helped the S&P retail sector add 1.6 per cent and helped boost the Nasdaq Composite up 0.8 per cent to 2,869.88, a 10-year high.The S&P 500 was flat for much of the day, but jumped higher after the statements by Mr Bernanke and the Fed. The benchmark index closed up 0.6 at 1,355.66, a multi-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 per cent at 12,690.96.The Fed held rates steady at 0 to 0.25 per cent but tweaked its statement on growth, reducing its outlook from a “firmer footing” for the recovery to a “moderate” pace of growth. The central bank also said that it would end its $600bn “QE2” quantitative easing programme and Mr Bernanke suggested that the pace of stimulus might slow.Sentiment in the wider markets was also helped by data showing that US durable goods orders had jumped last month, with orders rising 2.5 per cent in March after a revised 0.7 per cent rise in February.In the previous session, the S&P 500 reached its highest level since June 2008, indicating that the markets have now recovered from sharp losses following the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa and the natural disaster in Japan.Much of the recent gains in the S&P have been driven by a strong start to the earnings season. Of the 197 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 77 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said that momentum in the markets would continue to tick higher from here over the year, but there was likely to be more volatility.Boeing’s profits in the first quarter exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock advanced 0.8 per cent to $76.12. The world’s second-biggest aircraft maker by revenue made a net profit of $586m, or 78 cents per share, up from $519m, or 70 cents per share, in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about 72 cents per share.Northrop Grummanreported a 21 per cent rise in earnings, beating estimates, while also raising its full-year guidance. Stock in the defence and aerospace group put on 0.7 per cent to $62.90.Rockwell Automation, the maker of factory automation equipment and software, saw one of the sharpest losses of the session, falling 8.7 per cent to $89.33 after reporting only a modest profit and a small increase to its 2011 earnings forecast.Elsewhere in the sector Parker Hannifin, another industrial supplier, also disappointed with its earnings and the stock declined 5.1 per cent to $93.48.Disappointing earnings reports from ConocoPhillips and National Oilwell Varco weighed on the energy sector.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, reported a 43 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, but missed its production and refining targets, leaving the stock down 1.7 per cent at $79.83.The decline in production was due to civil unrest in Libya, a supply vessel collision with a company platform, natural field decline and the temporary shutdown of the trans-Alaska pipeline system.Elsewhere in the sector, National Oilwell fell 4.6 per cent to $76.88 after the US oilfield equipment maker reported a 4 per cent drop in quarterly profit amid restructuring charges and Libya-related writedowns.
47;HES;Hess Corp;2011-03-21T00:18:15Z;Gulf of Mexico: Companies feel effects of Macondo disaster;;"When US regulators approved in February the first deepwater drilling permit since BP’s Macondo disaster last April, the industry dismissed it as a political gesture aimed at quieting calls from Congress to resume drilling. Unrest in north Africa and the Middle East was pushing up oil prices. And the public was already seeing higher prices at the petrol pump.However, Michael Bromwich, head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, said politics had not been a factor. Noble Energy had simply met all the requirements for a permit.Yet the reality was that Noble did not have to do everything now being required by regulators to get a new permit; it had been drilling when Macondo happened and only needed clearance to finish its job. No permits for new projects have been issued.“The deepwater drilling moratorium has been lifted in name only,” said John Hess, chairman and chief executive of Hess.And the industry does not see rising oil prices changing that.Andy Steinhubl, partner in the Houston office of Bain & Company, the consultancy, notes pressure on regulators to permit new deepwater drilling has been high for some time because of the economic downtown, high unemployment and growing financial pressure on drilling companies from lost work. Seahawk Drilling has already filed for bankruptcy, citing the drilling ban.“The administration has been sticking to their principles. They’re not stalling. There was a lot to work through and they’re working through it,” Mr Steinhubl said. “I don’t see this [north Africa/Middle East] crisis as accelerating that timetable.”Yet the industry is impatient. Companies such as Chevron had been counting on new projects in the gulf to increase production in coming years. And while they are still hopeful, with most companies on standby, oil companies believe they are being held to a much higher standard than any other industry. The constant refrain is that when there is an aircraft crash, the US does not ground all aircraft.Yet the reality is that regulators have come under so much criticism for being what Mr Brom­wich calls a “permitting mill” before Macondo, that they are going to do everything to change that reputation.Companies complain that permit applications are repeatedly kicked back by regulators, who are asking for more information, and that they need a clear template for what is needed. Regulators have yet to come up with one.Mr Bromwich says regulators were working on a number of improvements to strengthen oversight, given that they had simply failed to keep pace with the transformation of the offshore drilling industry as it moved into deeper water.He points out these things take time, noting that UK activity dropped off substantially for two years after the Piper Alpha accident there and almost came to a standstill. “We have a new normal; it’s going to take more time than in the past,” he says.Kurt Hallead, co-head of global energy research at RBC Capital Markets, is among those who sees the Noble permit as a positive sign.“We’re going from a standstill to some movement,” he said. And, despite all the threats to leave the region if the deepwater drilling ban went on too long, the majors remain keen to get back out there. He adds: “The major oil companies view the Gulf of Mexico as a world-class oil-producing region. They have every intent to continue to invest there.”John Parry, principal energy analyst at consultancy IHS, says he expects offshore contract drillers to see increased demand for their newer, more technologically advanced rigs.And competition between operators will surely drop, as smaller companies move to leave the gulf, given the liability of operating there demonstrated by Macondo.These are both attractive reasons for those with deep enough pockets to wait patiently on the sidelines for permit granting to resume.“The US cannot afford to shut down one of its key sources of energy supply,” said Rodolfo Guzman, director at Arthur D Little, the consultancy. “Once the dust settles, and the rules become clear again, most deepwater players will go back.” However, the region will never again see business as usual.Many companies insist that least some of the changes afoot in the US – such as the requirement of adequate spill response systems – should be duplicated around the world the better to safeguard deepwater drilling from Africa to Brazil.Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, says it is working to spread the lessons learnt from the disaster. “We believe we have a responsibility to share our learning with those who can benefit from it – including our competitors, partners, governments, regulators,” he says.He adds: “Indeed, we have been asked by people around the world to explain what we have learnt. BP executives have travelled to Angola, Russia, Australia, Brazil and elsewhere in recent months, bringing our learnings to stakeholders, industry partners, academic and governments.”"
48;HES;Hess Corp;2011-03-20T22:22:53Z;Oil companies fear nationalisation in Libya;;Western oil companies operating in Libya have privately warned that their operations in the country may be nationalised if Colonel Muammer Gaddafi’s regime prevails.Executives, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the rapidly moving situation, believe their companies could be targeted, especially if their home countries are taking part in air strikes against Mr Gaddafi. Allied forces from France, the UK and the US on Saturday unleashed a series of strikes against military targets in Libya.“It is certainly a concern. There are good reserves there,” said one executive at a western oil company with operations in Libya. “We have lost some of our production [because all operations have stopped] but our bigger concern is what will happen to the exploratory work as that gives you a future rather than the immediate impact,” he added.Most of the world’s large international oil companies have producing assets in Libya, including Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, and Italy’s Eni, which is the largest single investor there. Germany’s Winstershall – a unit of BASF – and OMV of Austria are also present.The country is the world’s 12th largest oil exporter, and the escalating violence there has triggered a jump in prices to nearly $120 a barrel. More than half of Libya’s oil was exported to Italy, Germany and France last year.“International oil companies will find themselves in a precarious position in Libya going forwards, with both the government side and the opposition now pressuring IOCs [international oil companies],” Samuel Ciszuk, senior Middle East energy analyst at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note. “Libya’s regime has a history of treating IOCs as extensions of their home governments, which ultimately risks damaging European and US-based companies”.Shokri Ghanem, the chairman of the Libya’s state-run National Oil Corporation, warned on Saturday that western companies, which have repatriated their staff due to the crisis, should send their employees back to work or risk seeing new oil and gas concessions awarded directly to rivals from China, India and Brazil. The three countries have all stayed neutral throughout the conflict and abstained from Thursday’s United Nations Security Council resolution 1973.Mr Ghanem said Libya had no intention of breaking its existing commitments with foreign oil companies already operating in the country but warned that “we do hope they in turn will honour their agreements with us”.“If they do not then we are forced to talk to others,” he added. Libyan production has fallen 75 per cent to 400,000 barrels a day since the withdrawal of employees by western companies and “could reach a halt”, he warned.The UN has widened its economic sanctions against the regime of Mr Gaddafi, including for the first time the oil sector. In addition to the no-fly zone and threat of air strikes, UN resolution 1973 also stipulates freezing the assets of the National Oil Corporation.While Libya’s state-owned National Oil Company controls the majority of the country’s oil production, international oil companies are key for sustaining output through joint ventures. The National Oil Company is also in full control of at least two of its subsidiaries, its wholly owned Sirte Oil, a joint venture with US-based Occidental Petroleum, and Waha Oil, a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Hess.
49;HES;Hess Corp;2011-03-01T19:49:18Z;Cargill faces jump in trading costs;;Cargill has told regulators it expects to register as a swap dealer under new US derivatives rules, a stance that puts in the same bracket as Wall Street banks and threatens to increase its trading costs.The world’s biggest food commodities trader said it “anticipates that it may be required to register as a swap dealer” based on the activities of its risk management divisions, according to comments filed with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The change to swap dealer – the same category as investment banks such as Goldman Sachs – would increase Cargill’s cost of trading as the company would have to hold more capital and add collateral.The CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission have proposed regulating swaps dealers for the first time. The new rules may apply not only to banks but a broader group of traders.Cargill’s stance is at odds with other physical commodity companies.Commodity merchants engaged in swaps trading, including energy companies Royal Dutch Shell and Hess as well as groups of farmers such as the Land O’Lakes dairy co-operative, have by and large resisted being defined as swap dealers.Shell’s US trading units said in a filing that the regulators’ dealer proposal was “overbroad,” potentially causing commodity merchants “to be classified as swap dealers inadvertently”.Cargill’s comments come as lawmakers and some business groups press regulators to ensure that companies using derivatives to hedge genuine business risks – so-called “end users” – do not have to post collateral against swaps.John Parsons, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: “A lot of companies seem to be trying to get the end-user exemption to blanket cover all of their operations. As long as they do some physical activity they would like the other activities that they do to be exempt. That’s dangerous because it creates a loophole.”Operations such as Cargill’s, which include trading bulk commodities and selling derivatives, blur the distinction between end users and dealers. The company’s risk management division offers commodity price swaps to pension plans and hedge funds. It works with companies seeking to hedge against commodity price moves.Cargill said that risk management was a “very small part” of its overall business. The company, which earned $1.5bn in the quarter ending November 30, said commercial companies with swap dealing arms should receive a “limited designation” that would only apply to divisions that deal swaps, not those using swaps to hedge and manage risks of commercial businesses.“These firms have risk management expertise to offer swap counterparties, and because they are not financial firms, they do not present the potential systemic risks of financial firms,” wrote Linda Cutler, Cargill deputy general counsel.Cargill said the new capital rules should apply only to its swap dealing division. The capital should be held by the division’s parent “because there is no feasible method to limit the liability of an entity to the assets associated with a particular division”.
50;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Oil groups draw up plans for swift Libya exit;;The oil sector in Libya was descending into chaos on Monday as the revolt against Muammer Gaddafi called into question the industry’s rush to the oil-rich north African country over the past few years.International companies including BP, Royal Dutch Shell and BASF said they were either cutting production or pulling out staff, while analysts said companies could face long-term problems whether the regime survived or fell.Other companies said their operations were normal for the time being, but oil executives privately said they were implementing emergency plans to withdraw all staff and shut down output.The petroleum sector is a crucial political and economic backdrop to the struggle against Colonel Gaddafi’s 41-year rule. It accounts for almost all Libya’s export earnings and is the main emblem of the leader’s partial detente with the west. John Hamilton, co-author of a report last year entitled Libya’s Energy Future, said: “This is the only show in town. Without the oil companies, they really have nothing.”After the arrival of some European companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, oil companies have flocked more recently to Libya’s 1.7m-barrel-a-day industry – making it the world’s 12th-largest oil exporter – since international sanctions against operating there were lifted in 2004. They did so with the blessing of western politicians such as Tony Blair, former British prime minister, who was present as BP signed a $900m exploration agreement with Libya in 2007.The industry in Libya is now a veritable UN of oil, with companies represented including Brazil’s Petrobras, Gazprom of Russia and a clutch of US businesses, such as ConocoPhillips, Amerada Hess and Marathon. European companies, such as Eni of Italy, Repsol YPF of Spain and Total of France, which arrived ahead of the lifting of sanctions in 2004, are leaders in the country.Despite the promise of Libya’s proximity to European export markets, the industry has not been able to repeat the bonanza of oil discoveries of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The last round of exploration had not returned the promised boom in new discoveries, leaving some companies disappointed. Oil companies have also complained about the increasingly erratic behaviour of Libya’s national oil company – a partner in joint ventures with foreign oil groups – and higher taxes. Executives also complain about a rise in bureaucracy.Now those commercial failures have been exacerbated by worries over the protests – and, in particular, a violent response that Human Rights Watch claims has killed more than 200 people.While Libya’s main oil exploration and production areas are either offshore or in parts of the country away from the main protests in the east, these could yet spread or affect supply lines.Were the regime to fall, analysts say the companies could face uncertainty over the security of contracts, because – unlike in neighbouring energy producers Algeria and Tunisia – Libya’s governance is so personalised in the leader that many state institutions are fragile and would struggle to function independently.Even if the regime reasserts its authority, any reprisals would trigger even more international condemnation of it and those who worked with it.As Claire Spencer, head of the Middle East and north Africa programme at Chatham House, the London-based foreign policy institute, put it: “Even if Gaddafi stays in place now, this is not going to be the last we hear of civil unrest. And if he is forced to retreat, who is going to run the place?”Additional reporting by Ed Crook in New York and Sheila McNulty in Houston
51;HES;Hess Corp;2011-01-31T21:36:15Z;US stocks boosted by Exxon earnings;;"Strong earnings results from ExxonMobil and better-than-expected consumer spending data lifted Wall Street, helping to pare some of the sharp losses seen late last week.The US markets were one of the few around the world unruffled by the continued turmoil in Egypt, bouncing back from the 1.8 per cent losses seen on Friday.This helped the S&P 500 index finish the month 2.3 per cent higher in what was the first January gain for four years and the best January performance since 2006. Investors were bullish due to a healthy earnings season and optimism over the state of the US economic recovery.On Monday, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 1,286.12, led by energy stocks after ExxonMobil posted earnings up 46 per cent thanks to high oil prices.The oil group reported earnings of $9.25bn, or$1.85 a share, in the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.62 per
share. These were the best results since 2008, when the energy group reported a record profit of $14.8bn.“ExxonMobil posted staggering quarterly income,” said David Buik at BGC Partners.The company’s shares were up 2.1 per cent to $80.68, still 25 per cent off its 2008 peak share price despite the price of Brent crude topping $100 a barrel on Monday.The earnings results lifted related stocks, with Hess, another energy group, up 3.2 per cent to $84.12. The S&P energy index jumped up 2.6 per cent to 543.84.Also helping to boost the wider markets were strong consumer spending figures from the commerce department. Data showed consumer spending had grown by 0.7 per cent in December, beating economists’ estimates of 0.5 per cent growth.But the US savings rate edged lower, falling from
5.5 per cent in November
to 5.3 per cent last
month, showing that this extra consumption was partly as a result of people dipping into their savings accounts.In other economic data, the Chicago Purchasing Manager Business Barometer rose by 2 points to
68.8 in December, ahead
of the median forecast of 64.5. This helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average gain 0.6 per cent to 11,891.93, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 2,700.08. The indices were up 2.7 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively over the month.Shares in Massey Energy, the fourth-largest US coal producer, rose 9.8 per cent to $62.86 on news that it was being bought by Alpha Natural Resources, the third-largest coal producer in the US, for about $8.5bn in cash and stock.Under the terms of the deal, Massey shareholders will receive 1.025 Alpha Natural Resources shares plus $10 cash for each share held, valuing Massey at $69.33 a share, or 21 per cent more than its last trading price on Friday. Stocks in Alpha Natural Resources fell 7.2 per cent to $53.73 on the announcement.Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas company, was up 8.1 per cent to $29.53 on news that Cnooc, China’s largest offshore oil andgas producer, is buying a stake in some of their concerns.Cnooc will pay $570m in cash for a 33 per cent stake in Chesapeake oil and gas fields in Wyoming and Colorado. This is the second onshore US deal in four months from Cnooc.Stocks in oil tanker owners lost ground in the session. On Friday, shares in tanker owners had jumped on fears that the protests in Egypt would lead to the Suez Canal, an oil-shipping choke point, being closed down.Investors had speculated that the extra 6,000 miles the oil would have had to be shipped round Africa from the Middle East to Europe and America could have proved lucrative for those doing the transporting.Even so, owner stocks lost much of the ground they had made. Frontline, the world’s largest oil tanker operator, was down 4.4 per cent to $25.93 while Overseas Shipholding Group was down 3.4 per cent to $33.24.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker by sales, was down for most of the session after saying it had discovered a design issue in a recently released support chip for its latest processors, prompting the company to halt some shipments and warn of a revenue shortfall. But the stock closed flat at $21.46.Some of Intel’s rivals gained on the news, with Advanced Micro Devices up 4.5 per cent to $7.83."
52;HES;Hess Corp;2010-12-15T23:58:56Z;BP suffered Azerbaijan leak, says WikiLeaks;;BP suffered a large-scale gas leak at a field in Azerbaijan and had to evacuate all of its platform workers, just 18 months before its Gulf of Mexico oil spill, according to leaked US embassy cables.The UK oil group was lucky to be able to evacuate its 211 workers safely after the incident in September 2008 that led to two fields being shut and production being cut by at least 500,000 barrels a day, according to the WikiLeaks cables published by The Guardian newspaper on Thursday.According to the cables, Bill Schrader, then president of BP Azerbaijan, said the incident was the largest such emergency evacuation in BP’s history. Given the explosive potential, “BP was quite fortunate to have been able to evacuate everyone safely and to prevent any gas ignition,” Mr Schrader is alleged to have told US government interlocutors.BP’s annual report last year referred to a “comprehensive review of the subsurface gas release” having taken place and remedial work being carried out.BP said last night: “We had a gas release in 2008. We shut the platform immediately, safely evacuated all staff, carried out necessary work and then resumed production. BP continues to have a successful and mutually beneficial partnership with the government of Azerbaijan.”The incident was reported by news agencies at the time.The leak happened at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field, Azerbaijan’s largest producing oil field in the Caspian. BP is the operator and largest shareholder in the consortium that also includes Chevron, ExxonMobil and Hess, as well as Norway’s Statoil and Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil group Socar.The UK group is also criticised for allegedly limiting the information it made available about the incident. Another cable alleges: “ACG operator BP has been exceptionally circumspect in disseminating information about the ACG gas leak, both to the public and to its ACG partners. However, after talking with BP and other sources, the embassy has pieced together the …picture.”According to another cable, in January 2009 BP thought that a “bad cement job” was to blame for the gas leak in Azerbaijan.
53;HES;Hess Corp;2010-10-05T21:07:47Z;CFTC’s new rule to limit commodity holdings;;Industry anxiety is rising over the shape of pending limits on commodity trading required by US financial reforms.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is crafting a rule to curtail the size of a trader’s commodity holdings, broadening limits long in place on futures exchanges to the world of privately negotiated derivatives.Lawmakers have directed the main US futures regulator to set trading caps in energy and metals by January and agriculture by April, a short timetable that reflects persistent concern that large speculators made oil, corn, wheat and other commodities soar to record highs in 2008.But major traders, some of whom stand to lose revenue under the new limits, warned on Tuesday at a New York energy forum that a strict set of new rules could damage commodity markets.Companies with multiple trading arms are concerned that regulators will be stingy with limits, allocating a set for their corporate parents rather than sets for each subsidiary.Hess Corp, a US oil company, also owns a stake in an affiliated energy trading partnership called Hess Energy Trading, or Hetco. Charles Cerria, associate general counsel at Hetco, foresaw a “really horrible effect” if regulators allocate one set of limits for both companies.The two are “distinctly different lines of business,” he said at the Futures Industry Association event.The timetable may force the CFTC to set limits on trading without data on the universe of private, over-the-counter derivatives markets. CFTC Commissioner Jill Sommers, sometimes a dissenting voice on the five-member commission, warned last week the agency will not have information needed to propose limits. The Futures Industry Association has called for the CFTC to consider interim limits until it obtains better data.“How they do the math is very important,” Nancy King, Morgan Stanley’s chief risk officer for global commodities, said at Tuesday’s event. She cited the interplay between jet fuel swaps, which are traded outside exchanges, and the heating oil futures contracts often used to hedge these swaps as an instance where calculating limits will be complicated.The push for limits came amid concerns over the the growing size of passive investors in commodity markets, which typically buy and hold a basket of commodities. Some lawmakers have charged these so-called index traders helped drive up energy and food prices.The CFTC has begun publishing data on the size of index investors’ holdings. In August their net long position in commodities fell by 1.7 per cent, while the Dow Jones-UBS spot commodity index fell by 3.5 per cent. Yet index holdings also fell for some individual commodities that rallied in the month, such as corn and cotton.
54;HES;Hess Corp;2010-10-01T23:05:10Z;BP to cut assets in Gulf of Mexico;;BP is looking to reduce the number of operatorships it holds in the Gulf of Mexico as part of a move to cut its capital spending and rebalance its portfolio of assets in the wake of the Macondo oil spill.The UK oil group produces from more than 20 deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico and is the biggest operator in the region, as well as the largest licence holder.Until the accident on April 20, the US was BP’s principal strategic focus but the company faces a challenge to restore its reputation.It plans to raise up to $30bn (£19bn) from asset disposals within the next 18 months and has said it will cut capital spending by about 10 per cent this year to raise funds to help pay for the costs of the spill.Analysts have said it would make sense for BP to realise some of the value of the licences it holds in the Gulf of Mexico and people familiar with the matter confirmed BP was considering reducing the number of operatorships it holds there.Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, told the Financial Times earlier this week that while there might be some asset sales in the US, it would remain an area of strategic focus.BP declined to comment but on Friday confirmed it has relinquished its operatorship at Tubular Bells, a deepwater field discovered in 2003 and about 135km southeast of New Orleans, to Hess, the US company.Hess will pay $40m for an additional 20 per cent stake, raising its holding to 40 per cent.BP will retain a 30 per cent stake.BP had said in March it intended to make a final investment decision on the field later this year.BP is making progress with its asset sales. The company has so far raised almost $10bn, notably from a $7bn sale of onshore gas assets in the US, Canada and Egypt to Apache, the US independent oil and gas group.Apache had been in talks with BP about taking a stake in its Alaskan fields but that deal foundered.BP is considering an alternative plan which would see it transfer the operatorship of the Prudhoe Bay field to one of its existing partners, and then selling a stake.Analysts said Apache and Occidental were potential buyers of the stake.BP has been in talks with TNK-BP, its Russian joint venture, about several asset sales.A formal offer for BP’s assets in Venezuela and Vietnam could come as early as next week.Tony Hayward, who resigned as chief executive of BP after the spill, is joining the board of TNK-BP.BP’s shares rose 3 per cent to 440.9p on Friday.
55;HES;Hess Corp;2010-10-01T20:50:37Z;US stocks edge higher amid mixed data;;US stocks edged higher in choppy trading after strong Chinese factory data boosted energy and materials stocks, but concerns remained about the pace of the US recovery after a report showed a slowing in US manufacturing growth.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,146.24 by the close on Friday but lower by 0.2 per cent for the week, its first weekly loss in five weeks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to close at 10,829.68 and was down 0.3 per cent over the five days. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher ending the day at 2,370.75, losing 0.4 per cent over the week.Before the opening bell, investors were cheered when manufacturing in China rose more than expected in September.But the sentiment was short-lived. Figures showed that US manufacturing had expanded at the lowest pace for 10 months. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell to 54.4 from 56.3 in August in line with expectations but the details disappointed.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said: “The spread between new orders and inventories has finally moved into negative territory (which means the inventory index is higher than orders), suggesting that production should slow somewhat over the next few months as an increasing portion of new orders can be met by drawing down existing inventories.”In a busy day for economic data, other releases were mixed.Among the positive numbers, US consumers were shown to have been spending slightly more than forecast, car sales rose and construction spending had unexpectedly risen. The final reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment was also a little better than expected.But prices barely rose in August, showing that inflation remains subdued,Materials and energy benefited from hopes of rising Chinese demand for metals and oil.The energy sector led the risers, up 1.3 per cent, with Hess Corp adding 3 per cent to $60.92 and Marathon Oil Corp gaining 2.2 per cent to $33.81.The materials sector advanced 1.2 per cent, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold adding 4.4 per cent to $89.13 and iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources rising 4.2 per cent to $66.58.But the effect of the Chinese data on industrials was muted by a couple of ratings downgrades so the S&P 500 industrials index was up only 0.1 per cent.Caterpillar fell 0.6 per cent to $78.22 after its rating was cut from “buy” to “neutral” by analysts at Bank of America. They view the shares, which have risen 15.4 per cent in the past month, as having the strong earnings expected in the next year priced in.Deere & Co also suffered after analysts at JPMorgan Chase reduced it from “overweight” to “neutral”, saying higher pension and research and development costs could weigh on earnings. Wells Fargo also cut its rating on the farm equipment maker. The shares fell 1.7 per cent to $68.57.Elsewhere, HP declined 3.1 per cent to $40.77 after the company named its new chief executive. After the closing bell on Thursday, the technology company announced it was appointing Leo Apotheker, the former chief executive of software maker SAP, to the top job.The choice surprised analysts because Mr Apotheker spent only a year as SAP’s sole chief executive and they had not expected an appointment from outside the US.Also in technology, Google edged lower by a fraction to $525.62 after David Drummond, its chief legal officer, said the search engine operator was increasing staff and trying to win new advertisers in China, in spite of its clash with the authorities over censorship.
56;HES;Hess Corp;2010-08-24T21:24:07Z;Oil groups have little to show from Libya;;BP has a lot riding on its controversial exploration programme off the coast of Libya.The UK oil group, whose reputation is under fire over its Gulf of Mexico oil spill, is preparing to drill a first deep-water well in the Gulf of Sirte in the autumn in what will be one of its biggest-ever exploration commitments, in an offshore area that is the size of Belgium.The company is not alone in targeting the North African country. Most of the world’s oil majors have quietly been tapping into its promise in recent years.ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are all present. The biggest single oil producer is the Waha Oil Company, a joint venture between National Oil Corporation and Conoco-Phillips, Hess and Marathon, according to African Energy, an industry publication.Recent exploration efforts have, however, proved disappointing and have dented the optimism that accompanied the return of international oil companies to Libya after the final lifting of sanctions in 2004.“We are coming up to the end of a five-year period where there has not been a lot of notable exploration success to point to,” said Ross Cassidy, Libya analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the oil consultancy. “Results have been poor when you compare with what was expected and hoped for.”Big oil companies piled into Libya, competing for blocks in four licensing rounds held between 2005 and 2007, lured by the promise of an under-explored country that has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa. So far they have little to show for their huge investments in recent years. Offshore, only Hess reported finding hydrocarbons that can be developed commercially, in its Arous el Bahr well.ExxonMobil has drilled two offshore exploration wells near Libya but with little luck. It has no production in the country and the two wells found no hydrocarbons.“Both wells have provided important technical data about the basins, and we will use the information to plan our remaining evaluation program with the Libyan National Oil Corporation,” ExxonMobil said.Rival Chevron drilled one exploration well in Libya in 2009 on a block acquired during the country’s first exploration licence round in 2005. It, too, did not encounter any hydrocarbons. It relinquished its Block 177 exploration licence in 2009. Chevron said it maintains a representative office in Tripoli and continues to monitor investment opportunities in North Africa, including in Libya.Royal Dutch Shell is assisting in the rejuvenation of a 39-year-old liquefied natural gas plant and exploring for gas onshore. The company is also still working through its drilling commitments in the exploration phase and has so far drilled two wells in the Sirte basin, and has two further wells under way. However, it has so far not announced any discoveries.Eni, the Italian group and the largest foreign operator in North Africa, is not involved in any offshore drilling activity in Libyan waters, but has two offshore fields that have been in production without incident since the 1970s, in waters of less than 200 metres. The company has invested some $50bn in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt in the past 10 years. The area is 35 per cent of Eni’s total production.Companies that still have deep-water drilling plans include Russia’s Gazprom, Petrobras of Brazil and Pertamina of Indonesia.BP plans to drill at least five offshore wells. The company’s operations are under intense scrutiny after the US spill, not least because its first Libyan well is 200 metres deeper than the Macondo well, which ruptured on April 20, killing 11 workers. At the same time, US senators are continuing to investigate links between the company’s lobbying of the UK government for a prisoner-transfer agreement with Libya and the Scottish government’s 2009 release of Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, the Libyan man convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. Nevertheless, industry analysts believe the programmes of BP and Shell are very significant for those companies and for Libya.“This is a fantastically important exploration for Libya,” said John Hamilton, the author of a study on Libya’s energy future for African Energy. “If it works out it will open a whole new future for Libya as a hydrocarbons producer on Europe’s doorstep.”Mr Cassidy added: “It is too early to say that exploration potential in Libya has been downgraded.“Most still believe there is huge potential. The next phase of drilling may live up to expectations.”Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston and Giulia Segreti in Rome
57;HES;Hess Corp;2010-07-28T21:00:03Z;Wall St falls on durable goods data and poor forecasts;;US equities fell on Wednesday after lower-than-expected orders for durable goods, a mixed picture from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book and cautious outlooks from Boeing and ArcelorMittal weighed on market sentiment.The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent at 1,106.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 10,497.88 and the Nasdaq was 1 per cent lower to close at 2,264.56.Before the opening bell, data showing unexpectedly low orders for durable goods added to concerns that economic growth may have slowed in the second quarter. New orders for long-lasting US manufactured goods dropped 1 per cent in June after a revised 0.8 per cent fall in May, making the decline the largest since last August. Analysts had expected orders to rise 1 per cent.But the markets did not fall any further when the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book was released later in the day. The Book, which is a wider survey of business, said that the US economy was growing but that there were signs of a slowdown in some regions over the past two months.The S&P has hovered around its 200-day moving average for a third session in a row. Ray Velazquez, managing director of Mizuho Securities, said that in spite of a better than expected earnings season stocks would trade in a tight range for the next quarter or two. He said concerns about the economy meant investors would pay little attention to a stock’s fundamentals until unemployment came down.Both Boeing and ArcelorMittal beat expectations in the second quarter but were cautious about the rest of the year.Boeing reported a second-quarter net profit of $1.06 per share, beating the forecast of $1.01 per share. But the aircraft manufacturer said its profit outlook was lower than analysts’ consensus. The shares dropped 1.9 per cent to $67.32.US-listed shares in ArcelorMittal fell 2.8 per cent to $31.11 after it was also cautious about its outlook, warning that the combination of slowing growth in China, a seasonal drop in activity and higher raw material costs would push down third-quarter earnings by up to 30 per cent.The world’s biggest steelmaker beat expectations in its second quarter, with net income at $1.7bn, after a loss of $792m for the same quarter of last year.Century Aluminum plummeted 9.3 per cent to $9.57 after it reported lower-than-expected net earnings of $5.1m for the second quarter, which were helped by a gain on forward contracts.Some companies did rise after reporting earnings, with Sprint Nextel nudging up 0.2 per cent to $4.84. The US mobile phone carrier said its net loss had widened to $760m, or 25 cents a share, from $384m, or 13 cents, a year earlier. But fewer monthly bill-paying customers left than analysts had expected.The world’s largest commercial real estate broker, CB Richard Ellis Group, jumped 7.6 per cent to $16.58 after it moved into the black and reported its strongest revenue growth since 2007. It announced earnings of 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of 2 cents per share a year ago.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group , was flat at $54.44. It reported better than expected profit for the quarter and said it would sell its stake in Lukoil, Russia’s largest independent oil company.Shares in CVS Caremark, the largest US provider of prescription drugs, rose 3.1 per cent to $31.54 after the company signed a 12-year contract with Aetna, the health insurer, and in spite of it lowering its forecasts. For the full year, earnings excluding some items will be at least $2.68 a share, compared with an earlier minimum of $2.77.Comcast shares rose 1.2 per cent to $19.56 after it reported a better than expected 6 per cent rise in quarterly revenue. But the cable company’s profit was cut by fees paid as part of its acquisition of NBC Universal, falling to $884m compared with $967m for the same period a year before.In deal news, American Oil & Gas gained 6.3 per cent to $7.11. Hess Corporation will acquire the oil and gas exploration and development company.

The S&P 500 financial sector, which started the day up on positive results from Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, also fell 1.8 per cent after Mr Bernanke spoke. Bank of America fell 2.5 per cent to $13.42 and JPMorgan Chase lost 3.1 per cent to $38.42.Morgan Stanley soared 8 per cent to $27.23 after it announced adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents, beating analysts’ average estimate of 46 cents per share.Wells Fargo rose 1.8 per cent to $26.37 after its second-quarter profit fell less than expected and losses on consumer and commercial loans were lower than in its first quarter. Net income declined 3 per cent to $3.06bn.The S&P 500 energy sector also suffered after crude oil fell following a government report that there had been an unexpected increase in US supplies and the highest rate of refinery operation in almost three years.The sector dropped 1.4 per cent with Hess Corporation, oil company, down 3.8 per cent at $50.89. Coal producer Massey Energy fell 3.1 per cent to $28.42 and Smith International declined 2.5 per cent to $41.17.Utilities companies also declined with power company Constellation Energy Group falling 2.3 per cent to $32.89, NRG losing 2.2 per cent to $22.04 and DTE down 2 per cent at $46.83.Stocks buoyed by positive earnings news earlier in the session remained up. Apple rose 1.8 per cent to $256.53 after it reported after the closing bell on Tuesday. It issued an unusually upbeat revenue forecast, projecting sales of $18bn for the current quarter, higher than analysts’ consensus of $17bn.In the financial sector, BlackRock, the asset manager, fell 2.4 per cent to $145.85 in spite of better than expected results, after clients withdrew money for the second quarter running.Laurence Fink, chief executive, said some clients had had to withdraw money because of concentration issues after it acquired Barclays Global Investors. Second-quarter profit rose 98 per cent. Earnings excluding some items were $2.37 a share.

And the market has become flooded with ageing UK fields.Large decommissioning liabilities, which have to be transferred to buyers when they take control of an asset, have made capital-starved North Sea independents unwilling to make offers for many fields.Richard Slape, analyst at Canaccord Adams, said: “Five years ago you would have sold these assets more easily, but now many of the larger buyers’ strategies have moved on from the North Sea, while at the same time finance has become more difficult to obtain.“The natural buyers of these assets are companies that often do not have strong balance sheets.“There is a host of problems facing small North Sea explorers and, until something is done to fix this, the North Sea will decline faster than it should and it will be a loss to this country.”Endeavour International has begun a strategic review which could see the independent explorer sell its UK operations.Last week Hess, the US oil and gas operator, sold $423m of North Sea gas assets to Scottish & Southern Energy, including an 18 per cent stake in a BP-operated gas pipeline running from the central North Sea to a processing terminal in Teesside.Sumitomo, Japanese trading house, managed to sell a portfolio of North Sea assets to Idemitsu, Japan’s third-largest refiner, for an undisclosed figur in 2009.UK Oil and Gas, the association representing North Sea companies, has warned that Britain’s oil and gas reserves will cover only six years of production at the current rate of investment."
60;HES;Hess Corp;2010-04-02T22:12:20Z;Kraft’s victory set to leave lingering bitter aftertaste;;Poison pills lurk in the sweetest candy. Barely two months after Kraft snaffled UK rival Cadbury, it is choking on parts of its £11.6bn purchase. First, the US food group had to renege on promises to keep the Somerdale plant in Bristol when it transpired that Cadbury had already decanted much of the production abroad. Now it finds its hands in effect tied over Cadbury’s generous pension scheme.Financially, none of this is especially hard to swallow. True, the maker of Oreos and Dairylea cheese is obliged to keep Cadbury’s 30,000 pension scheme members in the style to which they have become accustomed. But there are no nasty rules on what hurdles it can make workers jump through before they get there – thus Kraft’s recipe for squeezing workers out is to make it harder to stay in. Staff who want to continue enjoying cushy perks such as retirement at 60 on the same terms as downing tools at 65 (despite paying five years less of contributions and receiving an extra five years of pay-outs) will now have to agree to basic pay freezes for at least three years and, in some cases, increased contributions.But there is a ‘soft cost’ in terms of erosion of goodwill. Kraft, as a hostile bidder for a company which politicians and others portrayed as part of Britain’s very ether, sought to bank as many Brownie points as it could. Keeping the Somerdale factory, for example, meant keeping jobs in Britain. Instead, it has been left looking a little like the asset stripping hoard of Vikings conjured up by critics. Unions so far are unperturbed, but erecting further barriers to the pension scheme offers another excuse to jibe about heartless pillaging. Kraft won its prize, but victory looks set to leave a lingering bitter aftertaste. More fortuitously, the American’s post-purchase travails may serve a warning to future buyers of UK assets that due diligence should leave no stone unturned.SSE adopts an orphanCommercial legend has it that Bic makes most of its profit from the residue of ink left when its disposable biros are thrown away. In the same way, as the world’s leading oil and gas producers quit the North Sea for more fertile fields, other companies are arriving, hoping to profit from what they leave behind.Scottish and Southern Energy is the latest to see value in the dregs. On Thursday it agreed to buy stakes from Hess of the US in gas fields in three regions of the North Sea. Centrica, owner of British Gas, bought Venture Production, the listed North Sea oil and gas company, last year and has set out to buy more “mature and orphaned” assets there.The Hess assets represent a relatively small foray into “upstream” gas for SSE. At some £277m, this is one of the group’s largest single deals, but pales beside its £6.7bn five-year programme of investment begun in 2008. But the transaction does indicate the differing priorities of the utilities over some of the smaller independents fishing in the gap between Scotland and Norway.Utilities have the edge over most cash-strapped independent exploration and production companies. SSE’s Hess acquisitions will be funded entirely from the balance sheet, whereas many independents struggle to raise finance.That doesn’t make big utilities automatic candidates to buy all the North Sea properties up for sale. Smaller companies such as debt-free Enquest– being spun out of Petrofac – may well compete for similar assets, but they also seek to provide adventurous investors with exploration upside.SSE and Centrica are interested in the P not the E in E&P: they want to use the purchases to hedge against volatility in the wholesale gas market and put their North Sea orphans to work for customers as much as for shareholders.Diversity and apple pieA committee of MPs composed of 13 men and one woman is ill-placed to tell the City to promote more women to the upper echelons. That may explain why the Treasury committee’s report on Women in the City pulls its punches.Formal gender quotas can have dubious side-effects. But former sceptics such as Anne Lauvergeon of Areva have changed their minds on direct action. Even the FT has recommended a 30 per cent voluntary goal for the proportion of female directors. So it’s disappointing that the committee merely urges financial institutions to “broaden their horizons” when searching for new directors. As the report points out, it is in financial companies’ interests to ease women’s paths to the top, if only to avoid wasting talent. But if the financial crisis taught anything, it was that self-interest was not the best regulator.Cadbury: louise.lucas@ft.comandrew.hill@ft.com

62;HES;Hess Corp;2010-04-01T08:22:41Z;SSE pays $423m for Hess North Sea assets;;Scottish and Southern Energy is extending its strategy to include the partial ownership of gas fields by buying $423m (£278m) of North Sea assets currently held by Hess, the US-listed energy group.The UK energy supplier said on Thursday that it was buying Hess’s stakes in gas fields in three regions of the North Sea: the Everest/Lomond area, the Easington Catchment area and the Bacton area.While these “upstream gas” assets form the large majority of the deal, it also includes Hess’s 18 per cent stake in a BP-operated gas pipeline running from the central North Sea to a processing terminal in Teesside.SSE supplies electricity and gas to about 10m customers in the UK but currently does not own any upstream gas or oil assets.It said it was doing the deal to secure gas supplies for its customers and also to fuel its power stations. The upstream assets would act as a form of hedge in reducing its dependence on the fluctuating wholesale gas market, it added.Ian Marchant, SSE chief executive, said in a statement: “This timely acquisition will enable SSE to enter the upstream gas sector in a measured way by buying proven and geographically diverse production assets. These assets will provide a new source of primary fuel and a hedge for our gas generation and supply activities.”In total, SSE is acquiring about 383bn cubic feet of gas and liquid resources in the deal, or 64m barrels of oil equivalent.The acquired assets would initially provide about 8 per cent of its daily gas needs, the company said, adding that further exploration might identify more gas.Centrica, the rival UK energy supplier, bought Venture Production last August in a deal that valued Venture at £1.3bn and expanded Centrica’s upstream gas and oil activities.Shares in SSE rose 5p to £11.06 in early trading on Thursday morning.
63;HES;Hess Corp;2009-11-05T19:42:22Z;Coup de theatre;;It would be a struggle to fit so many stereotypes into one pantomime. There was the crafty Arab, the swashbuckling old Etonian, a supporting cast of unscrupulous English toffs and a chorus of South African guns for hire. The drama would have been incomplete without a ruthless African: Equatorial Guinea’s dictator for 30 years, Teodore Obiang Nguema.Simon Mann, the old Etonian mercenary, walked free this week after a spell in one of Africa’s nastiest prisons. He was sent there after being convicted in an Equatorial Guinean court of plotting in 2004 to oust Mr Obiang. Hopefully his will be the last attempt by foreign mercenaries to impose their will on African soil.Mr Mann’s release, following a presidential pardon, should also remove what at times has been a useful prop for Mr Obiang. For five years, the distraction of what came to be known in the British press as the “Wonga coup” has obscured a sorrier tale unfolding in the Gulf of Guinea: one of inequity, repression and western hypocrisy.Western governments and NGOs are quick to criticise China’s willingness to do business in Africa regardless of the rights record of host regimes. Fewer though draw attention to the ugly complicity of western companies and governments in propping up the likes of Mr Obiang.US multinationals such as ExxonMobil, Amerada Hess and Marathon Oil pump around 380,000 bpd of crude from Equatorial Guinea’s waters. Oil has placed the country’s economy among the fastest growing in the world.Yet the regime has squandered billions. Equatorial Guinea, with a population of barely more than 500,000, remains one of the most unequal societies on earth. Its human rights record is one of the continent’s worst. Among abuses listed by the US State Department, are: unlawful killings by security forces, government-sanctioned kidnappings, systematic torture, judicial corruption and all manner of restrictions on civil liberties.In western accounts of the attempted coup, Mr Obiang’s portrayal conformed to type. The government now wants to burnish a new image, which must be one reason for the superficially magnanimous decision to release Mr Mann and co-conspirators.The failed Wonga coup made headlines thanks to its cast. But there is at least one plot to oust Mr Obiang every year. Rich as it may be in oil, the US and other allies of Equatorial Guinea have little to gain long term in overlooking the regime’s abuses.
64;HES;Hess Corp;2009-05-24T18:35:38Z;Into Africa;;Before the oil came, Equatorial Guinea’s phone book boasted only a few pages. Subscribers were listed by their first names. Cars were a novelty and the tallest buildings in Malabo, the island capital, were gracefully ageing villas dating back to Spanish colonial rule. The airport consisted of a tin shack.Today, a new city is rising on the doorstep of the old. Immaculate tower blocks march past a six-lane highway stretching into the jungle. Smart blue lamp-posts line the pavements. The facade of a bank glows gold in the tropical sun. There are no people yet, but soon “Malabo Two” will be open for business.Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the president who seized power 30 years ago, is spending billions of petrodollars on a construction bonanza aimed at turning his tiny country into a Dubai-style economic hub for the Gulf of Guinea, one of the world’s fastest-growing oil and gas frontiers.Such a feat would be a big turnround for a government that has a reputation as one of Africa’s most flagrant kleptocracies, dominated by a ruling clan that has used arbitrary arrests, beatings and torture to stifle dissent.The outcome will have implications not just for Equatorial Guinea’s 700,000 people, many of whom live in pastel-painted slums without power or running water, but also for a vanguard of European energy companies banking on the country to supply a commodity they desperately need: natural gas.Russia’s invasion of Georgia and its willingness to turn off gas supplies to Ukraine have struck fear into European Union governments dependent on Moscow for a quarter of the bloc’s consumption. As their own gas fields begin to decline, European companies are venturing into increasingly risky territory to diversify their supplies.Equatorial Guinea is a perfect example. In the past few months, Eon, the giant German utility, and Union Fenosa of Spain have signed agreements to back the government’s plan to convert Bioko, the main island and home of the capital, into a significant gas export hub. Equatorial Guinea wants to exploit its own modest deposits and tap vast resources in neighbouring Nigeria, whose 182,000bn cu ft of proven gas reserves are the seventh largest in the world.The experience of US companies that led the development of the oil industry suggests the Europeans will have to tread warily. A Senate investigation into Equatorial Guinea’s dealings with a Washington bank shone a spotlight on payments by oil companies to government officials. Global Witness, the anti-corruption watchdog, has highlighted damaging evidence of high-rolling lifestyles enjoyed by certain members of Mr Obiang’s family. In November, a UN investigator accused the police of systematic use of torture.Such reports alone might be enough to rattle European executives, even without coup plots reminiscent of The Dogs of War, a thriller that Frederick Forsyth, the British writer, set in a fictional version of Equatorial Guinea. Security fears have imbued the government with a sense of paranoia as thick as the mist shrouding the volcano brooding over Malabo.Simon Mann, the former UK special forces officer and an old Etonian, is serving a 34-year sentence in the city for his part in a failed attempt to seize power in 2004. The escapade involved a shadowy cast of financiers, mercenaries and members of the British upper class who believed using force to grab the energy reserves of such a minute country was a viable proposition.As European companies embrace Mr Obiang and his powerful family, they can only hope the rise of Malabo Two is the harbinger of a more benign form of rule that will make it easier to keep their consciences – and reputations – clean. Not everyone is convinced.“These companies are taking a huge reputational risk by coming to Equatorial Guinea,” said Tutu Alicante, executive-director of Equatorial Guinea Justice, a US-based group campaigning for better governance. “The newcomers must make their engagement conditional on greater transparency.”The only former Spanish colony in Sub-Saharan Africa, Equatorial Guinea once counted its wealth in cocoa pods. Following huge offshore finds in the early 1990s, it rapidly evolved into the region’s largest oil exporter after Nigeria and Angola. The economy – on paper at least – recorded some of the fastest growth in the world.Equatorial Guinea already exports up to 3.7m tonnes of liquefied natural gas (gas supercooled for shipping) from a facility opened by Houston-based Marathon Oil in 2007. The government wants to at least double or triple the amount by raising domestic production and striking agreements to export gas from fields in Nigeria and Cameroon.After years of favouring US companies, Mr Obiang (right) has turned to the Europeans to realise this vision, confident they will guarantee a market.Eon has taken a 25 per cent stake in a new “3-G” consortium set up by Sonagas, the state gas company, to build the necessary infrastructure. Galp Energia of Portugal and Gasol, listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market, are also involved. Gas Natural of Spain, which recently upped its stake in Union Fenosa to 95 per cent, is another participant.Uncertainties abound. Nigeria and Cameroon have proved reluctant to augment Equatorial Guinea’s modest gas reserves, estimated to be at least 4,400bn cu ft by the Oil and Gas Journal. Speedboat-riding gunmen operating out of Nigeria’s delta region attacked the presidential palace in Malabo in February, proving that the country’s energy facilities are well within reach of militants who have visited havoc on Nigeria’s oil industry. At Equatorial Guinea’s first gas conference in March, an armoured car – its turret pointed out to sea – guarded the Sofitel where delegates slept. Dietrich Gerstein, Eon’s chief executive officer of LNG, nevertheless told the gathering that Equatorial Guinea was a “cornerstone” of the company’s plans to secure long-term supply.Seated next to him, Gabriel Obiang Lima, the vice-minister of mines, industry and energy – one of the president’s sons – played down allegations of human rights abuses. “I think many times the information that is published about Equatorial Guinea is not founded,” he said. “I don’t want to point out the individuals who are in charge of doing this.”However, a glance at recent history shows how deep the roots of the authoritarian system run. After colonial rule under General Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator, ended in 1968, the country plunged into one of the most miserable – if little known – episodes of modern African history.Life under Francisco Macías Nguema, who took over as president, was as terrifying as it was bizarre. Calling himself the “The Great Sorcerer”, on several documented occasions he ordered the executions of all his mistresses’ former lovers. Catholic priests were forced to recite: “There is no God other than Macías.” Being a journalist was a capital offence. As his administration collapsed, Macías built up a huge collection of human skulls and declaimed lengthy monologues to colleagues he had murdered. Before Mr Obiang staged a coup in 1979 and had him killed, a third of the population is estimated to have died or fled.“As a colony, and under Macías, we had some of the worst dictators in the world,” says Alfredo Okenve of the CEID network, one of the country’s few civil society organisations. “Whatever changes is progress, but the progress has been very slow.”Allegations of graft have proliferated during the oil era. The US Senate investigation into the handling of Equatorial Guinea’s deposits in Riggs Bank in Washington said in 2004 that oil companies may have contributed to corruption by making payments to officials with minimal disclosure. The sums included more than $4m for training students abroad, most of them children or relatives of government figures. The companies argued they had little choice but to do business with the government of the day.Not all investors concurred. In 2005, the Swedish national pension fund said it would not invest in ExxonMobil, Amerada Hess or Marathon because of reported cases of corruption in Equatorial Guinea. Reports abounded of mansions in Malibu and Maryland purchased by Mr Obiang or his circle. The president has always denied any impropriety, saying he personally supervised state accounts to prevent theft.The government points to its vision for transforming Bioko into a gas and maritime centre as evidence it is putting its income to good use. In spite of the drop in oil prices, Chinese labourers dressed in blue overalls and hard hats packed in the back of trucks rumble daily towards construction sites in Malabo Two. The port echoes with the clanking of cranes working on a $4.5bn (€3.2bn, £2.8bn) deepwater project designed to serve the whole Gulf of Guinea. Strolling on the new quay as a freighter unloads cement, Alberto Ndong Obiang Lima, director of ports and another of the president’s sons, says the planned transport hub will generate income even when the oil runs out. “Many people, especially foreigners, say Equatorial Guinea is becoming the Dubai of Central Africa,” he says. “I think it’s true – look at the investments and construction.”Mr Obiang’s familial style of rule certainly gives Equatorial Guinea the feel of an African emirate. Effective opposition is virtually non-existent: in the last elections in 2002 the president won more than 97 per cent of the vote. Little wealth has trickled down. In spite of an average gross domestic product of more than $31,000 a head, almost 80 per cent of people live in poverty. The International Monetary Fund warned in March that spending plans would not meet social needs, a reminder that prestige projects have not always helped Africa’s poor.Perhaps the most critical test will be whether Mr Obiang will tolerate more openness. He has in the past described oil revenues as a “state secret” but has since authorised the government to apply to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a global programme that would subject public accounts to much greater scrutiny.Francisca Tatchouop Belobe, a vice-minister who is co-ordinating the bid for EITI membership, says Equatorial Guinea’s slow progress is a result of a shortage of capacity rather than a lack of political will. “When talking about the country that apparently has so many secrets, you realise we have nothing to hide,” she says.Equatorial Guinea has less than a year before its March deadline to qualify. Success would allow European newcomers to breathe more easily. Should Mr Obiang’s government fail, then they could start facing the kinds of awkward questions that have dogged their American rivals.
65;HES;Hess Corp;2009-02-02T22:51:21Z;Petrobras in talks over $174bn development;;Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company, is in direct talks with governments including Washington and Beijing to help finance the $174bn development of its huge reserves.The partially traded group recently discovered the biggest oil fields in Latin America in the past 30 years and industry leaders, such as Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, believe the waters off Brazil’s south-eastern coast hold oil reserves as big and important as those discovered in the North Sea in the 1970s.José Sergio Gabrielli de Azevedo, Petrobras’s president and chief executive, told the Financial Times that Petrobras had secured almost all of its financing for this year and over the five-year period could finance $120bn from its own cash flow.But that still leaves the company with a large financial hole it will need to plug to realise its goal of increasing current oil and gas production of 2.2m barrels a day to 3.3m b/d by 2013 and to 5.7m barrels a day by 2020.“It’s going to be tough, it’s going to be challenging, but it is not impossible.” he said. “We have had several talks with different countries, not only China, even the US. We think this is going to be an important source of financing for us.”The UAE is also thought to have shown interest.In the US, Mr Gabrielli said Petrobras had held conversations with Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which he said wanted to improve the presence of US companies in Brazil. But he said his conversations in Washington were hampered by the fact there was not one central institution.He said that, in return for help financing the project, Petrobras would guarantee future oil and oil products.“In relation to the US, today we are already a net exporter of petroleum products. This is going to increase,” Mr Gabrielli said.Analysts and other oil company executives agree that securing financing would be one of Petrobras’s two biggest hurdles, considering the credit crisis and the fall in oil prices of more than $100 a barrel in six months. The second hurdle is expected to be the technical challenge of extracting oil trapped under thick layers of salt, far below the ocean’s surface.An executive from a competing oil company with operations in Latin America and the North Sea said: “They have found a North Sea. It took 15 big companies more than a decade to develop that.”But Mr Gabrielli said he believed companies that had not helped find the pre-salt fields would be left out.“Brazil’s regulatory system rewards the companies that took exploration risk.” He noted that these included: BG of the UK, Galp of Portugal, Repsol of Spain, ExxonMobil and Amerada Hess of the US, and Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell. “The ones who didn’t take it [the risk] are not going to be rewarded,” he said.Presenting its business plan for 2009-2013 last week, Petrobras insisted it would push ahead with plans not only to develop its newly discovered fields, but to build three oil refineries, Brazil’s first new refineries for almost 30 years. Mr Gabrielli said Petrobras was unique among big oil companies in having big new fields to develop and a big domestic market.But its plans also involve expanding export sales of value-added refined products rather than crude oil. “To capture [our advantages] we need to build capacity now,” Mr Gabrielli said. “If we don’t build it now we will miss our chance.”Almir Barbosa, financial director, said Petrobras still needed to raise about $8bn to meet investment targets of $28bn this year and $35bn in 2010. He said the company was striving to reduce its financing needs by a cost-cutting programme, involving renegotiations of all projects, especially those still in their early stages.Additional reporting by Jonathan Wheatley in São Paulo
66;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Petrobras to pump $28bn into pre-salt fields;;Petrobras, the Brazilian national oil company, is pushing ahead with plans to invest in Brazil’s newly discovered pre-salt oil deposits in spite of market conditions that have raised doubts over its ability to secure finance.The company’s strategic plan for 2009-2013 – revealed on Friday after months of delays caused by the global credit crisis and volatile oil prices – calls for investment of $174.4bn, a substantial increase on the $112.4bn stated in its 2008-2012 plan.The new total is the first to include investment in the pre-salt fields. Petrobras said it would invest about $28bn in the fields over the period, part of an additional $36.6bn to be spent on exploration and production.Petrobras is in the early stages of exploring the pre-salt fields – discovered in 2007 under several kilometres of sea water, rock and a hard-to-penetrate layer of salt – and has made no estimate of their total size. But state officials have spoken of 100bn barrels to add to Brazil’s proven reserves of 14.4bn barrels of oil and natural gas equivalent.Last week, ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company, said it had found oil in a pre-salt field it operates with Hess, also of the US, and Petrobras. Exxon and Hess each have 40 per cent of the partnership, and Petrobras 20 per cent.Exxon gave no estimate of the size of the find, although analysts say it is likely to be comparable to two other fields evaluated by Petrobras in the same area. One field, Tupi, has estimated reserves of between 5bn and 8bn barrels and the other, Iara, 2bn to 4bn barrels.Petrobras based its 2009-2013 plan on Brent crude at $42 a barrel, with financing needs for this year based on Brent at $37 a barrel. Brent futures for March delivery are currently trading at about $47 a barrel, although the price was as low at $36 last month.Petrobas has set total investment for 2009 at $28.6bn. With Brent at $37, this requires finance of $18.1bn, of which Petrobras has already secured $16.9bn, including $11.9bn from Brazil’s government-owned national development bank.Almir Barbosa, head of investor relations, said Petrobras would need to raise a further $10bn to cover its investments in 2010 and that the extra funds would not come from the national development bank. But he said raising the funds should not be difficult and that the company expected market conditions to improve during this year and next.Petrobras said the plan included “aggressive” targets for production of oil and natural gas, especially from domestic deposits including the pre-salt fields.Production in Brazil is expected to increase from 2.18m barrels per day in 2008 to 3.31m in 2013 and to 5.1m by 2020.Including overseas operations, production would rise from 2.4m barrels last year to 5.73m barrels by 2020, although Petrobras said it would concentrate its investments in domestic rather than overseas operations.

Richard O’Reilly, Standard & Poor’s analyst, maintaining his “hold” recommendation on Dow’s target, said the Kuwait cancellation “calls into question” the planned $78-a-share acquisition.Citigroup warned that the move had “negative implications for [the] industry”, as it was a sign that North American ethylene assets were “less attractive” to Middle East suitors.Nova Chemicals, which Citi analyst PJ Juvekar highlighted as an example of the above, shed 3.3 per cent to $4.36.DuPont was one of the biggest losers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 2 per cent to $24.49.“The biggest worry in the world today is the drying up in credit markets,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities. “It’s ‘when is it going to end?’ type of thinking.”Still, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average finished off their lows, each down 0.4 per cent at 869.42 and 8,483.93, respectively, in holiday-thinned trading. The Nasdaq Composite index closed down 1.3 per cent at 1,510.32.The energy sector provided support as escalating violence in the Middle East prompted a jump in oil prices. It was the only sector to find positive territory, up 1.9 per cent overall, as Israeli war planes continued their attacks on the Gaza Strip for a third day.Hess, Murphy Oil and Baker Hughes were the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500, up 6.5 per cent to $52.25, 6 per cent to $44.24 and 5.3 per cent to $31.18, respectively.Although the materials sector was the worst-performing, off 2.1 per cent, some stocks in the sector enjoyed reasonable gains.Newmont Mining was up 4.8 per cent to $40.70 as gold rallied.Elsewhere, Ford dropped 3.1 per cent to $2.22 on reports that Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor who had invested about $1bn in the motor group, had sold his remaining stake.Real estate investment trusts, which have recently rallied from their lows, were among the biggest losers after SL Green Realty cut its quarterly dividend by more than half to 37.5 cents a share. Its shares tumbled 10.3 per cent to $24.42.Financials finished 1 per cent lower. Some observers said the sector, down 60 per cent overall in 2008, was particularly hard hit by year-end tax loss selling.The higher oil price put retailers under pressure, also pushed down amid concerns over the extent of poor sales performances. Gamestop and JC Penney were the hardest hit, down 5.1 per cent to $21.95 and 4.6 per cent to $17.84, respectively.Analysts continued to debate the outlook for US stocks, set for their worst annual performance since the Great Depression.Todd Salamone, of Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said technical indicators were a sign “that this is not a prudent time to be overly bullish”.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose 1.1 per cent to 43.87 on Monday, which indicated heightened levels of distress. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell by 2.2 per cent to 466.15.“We have seen earnings for the small caps and the mid caps hold up better than the large caps, but it looks as if the fourth quarter might be a turning point,” wrote Merrill Lynch analysts in a small-cap strategy note to clients.The analysts, who forecast a drop of 14.6 per cent in fourth quarter earnings for small-cap stocks, added: “If the numbers come in as anticipated, it would mark the first time since the second quarter [of] 2007 in which the large caps’ earnings held up the best.”
68;HES;Hess Corp;2008-09-10T20:52:23Z;Rally in energy and tech stocks lift Wall Street;;Washington Mutual slid to its lowest level since 1991 on Wednesday as the wider financial sector took scant comfort from Lehman Brothers’ hurried update and failed to recover from the previous session’s heavy losses.The mortgage lender, which has been placed under special regulatory supervision, fell a further 29.7 per cent to $2.32 as the cost of insuring against the risk of its default rose markedly. Earlier this week, Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook on the lender from “stable” to “negative”.Also in focus was American International Group, which fell a further 4.7 per cent to 17.50 after the world’s largest insurer suffered a fall of 19.3 per cent in the previous session on the back of mounting uncertainty over Lehman Brother’s ability to raise capital.Citigroup, which cut its profit forecasts, nevertheless wrote in a note to clients: “Not similar to Lehman – we believe that AIG has plenty of less drastic options in its arsenal …before the impact of a controlling partner is even under consideration.”Investment banks Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch lost 3.7 per cent to 38.92 and 5.9 per cent to $23.30, respectively.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a sector note: “The bank operating environment remains challenging, amid slowing economic growth, contraction of credit and constrained capital.”E-Trade Financial fell 4.4 per cent $3.03 after it said three-year cumulative losses on its home equity loans would be greater than expected.Shares in Lehman Brothers, which disclosed its third-quarter earnings a week early to reassure investors, edged down 1.8 per cent to $7.95, after a 45 per cent fall in Tuesday’s session.On Tuesday, the financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as deepening uncertainty over the investment bank’s ability to strengthen its balance sheet prompted wider concerns over asset sales ahead of banks’ third quarter earnings season.However, a rally in energy and technology stocks helped lift the major indices into positive territory on Wednesday.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,232.04 by the close in New York while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 11,268.92 and the Nasdaq rose 0.9 per cent to 2,228.70.Outside financials, the mood was upbeat. In particular, an update from Fedex helped sentiment.The cargo group said first-quarter profit would exceed its forecasts on the back of lower fuel costs and its shares rose 3.7 per cent to $87.86.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments rose 0.6 per cent to $21.85 on the back of a positive update from the chipmaker that eased concerns over reduced mobile phone demand.Orders this quarter matched its expectations and the company did not cut forecasts. S&P raised its price target from $96 to $105.That gave a boost to technology stocks, which have been hard hit in recent sessions on fears of global growth slowdown.The sector boasted gains of 0.7 per cent while shares of technology bellwether IBM rose 2.61 per cent to $118.04.Research in Motion rose 5.4 per cent to $104.61 after unveiling plans to launch a new “flip” version of its BlackBerry Pearl phone.Yahoo edged up 0.7 per cent at $17.70 even after Sanford C Bernstein cut its price target from $26 to $24.But Google lost 1.1 per cent to $414.16 after Lehman Brothers cut its price target from $620 to $600.Meanwhile, energy stocks rallied following Opec’s decision to lower oil production.Among the top gainers were ExxonMobil, up 2.7 per cent at $75.25, Massey Energy, up 8.2 per cent at $42.10 and Hess, which which stood 7.5 per cent higher at $85.67.US Steel advanced 4.5 per cent to $35.23 after reaching an agreement with the United Steelworkers union.In other news, interdealer broker GFI Group fell 24.5 per cent to $7.26 after merger talks with Tullett Prebon of the UK fell apart as the two were unable to reach acceptable terms.Elsewhere, software maker Salesforce.com and Fastenal rose after the duo were picked to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the S&P 500. Their shares rose 7.7 per cent to $56.09 and 0.8 per cent to $52.58, respectively.
69;HES;Hess Corp;2008-09-05T20:46:51Z;Wall St recovers after late rally in financials;;Wall Street stocks were mixed on Friday after a rally in financials helped soften news that the unemployment rate reached a five-year high in August.Financials were among the biggest casualties of the morning session but climbed strongly, adding 3.2 per cent amid speculation Blackstone Group and KKR, would buy some businesses from Lehman Brothers’ as part of a deal worth around $5bn. Lehman Brothers rose 6.8 per cent to $16.20.Amid the positive momentum, Bank of America overturned early losses. The shares rose 5.3 per cent to $32.23 even though the bank said it was ready to settle federal and state probes into the marketing of auction-rate securities.AIG also put on 5.3 per cent to $22.34 even after Morgan Stanley said the largest US insurer could need to raise $15bn to cushion further housing-related losses.On Friday, the spike in the jobless rate, which has reached 6.1 per cent, conspired with a rise in the home foreclosures to drag markets further into bear market territory.By the close, the S&P 500 was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,242.31. The Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.1 per cent at 2,255.88, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent lower at 11,220.96.The modest recovery on Friday brought to an end a volatile holiday-shortened week during which the the S&P 500 fell 3.2 per cent as fears returned about the health of the global economy. That was the index’s third weekly drop and its biggest loss since February.Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at ChannelCapitalResearch.com, said the unpredictable events of the week had shown investors were “alternating between euphoria and depression”.Selling was widespread, though sectors and companies most exposed to the prospect of a global slowdown were particularly badly hit. Industrials, materials and technology fell 3.9 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively.Among industrials, Terex was a big faller after the maker of construction and mining equipment cut its sales and profits forecast for the year. Its shares fell 23.8 per cent to $38.31 over the week. Caterpillar fell 9.4 per cent to $64.07.In materials, steel stocks were shunned as Goldman Sachs issued a bearish outlook on the sector in a wide-ranging note. US Steel fell 14.6 per cent to $113.61. AK Steel declined 22.8 per cent to $40.63.The technology sector took more blows on Friday after Nokia warned on its market share outlook. Jabil Circuit and Adobe Systems lost 5.4 per cent to $13.31 and 3 per cent to $40.91 respectively.But the sector pared its losses as investors bought back into heavily sold semiconductor stocks, which rose 0.9 per cent.For the week, Dell was among the worst performers, down 6.1 per cent at $20.41, although it clawed back some ground after reports said it was looking to sell some or all of its PC manufacturing plants in a cost-cutting move.Companies in the energy sector also took hits after the oil price lost about 8 per cent over the week. BJ Services and Hess fell 15 per cent to $22.83 and 12.7 per cent to $91.44 respectively.However, that gave respite to battered airlines stocks, such as UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, which rose 10.7 per cent at $12.30.Retailers were shunned after several suffered sluggish sales over the crucial back-to-school period. Abercrombie & Fitch continued its slide yesterday after Citigroup downgraded its recommendation on the stock to “sell”. The shares lost 4.9 per cent to $48.47.Deal news provided one of the few positive developments. SanDisk climbed 29.1 per cent to $17.37 after Samsung Electronics said it was considering a purchase of the memory-card maker.However, Safeway fell 3.9 per cent to $26.15, after Morgan Stanley cut the supermarket chain to “underweight”.

Goldman analysts said share prices were relatively inexpensive while high oil prices might boost earnings.The sector has massively outperformed the broader S&P 500, adding 8.3 per cent compared with a 7.3 per cent decline. ExxonMobil, Conoco-Phillips and Hess added 2.6 per cent to $89.07, 3.3 per cent to $95.24 and 2.9 per cent to $127.47 respectively.Those gains helped markets skim past news of record losses at Lehman Brothers and comments from Fed officials that higher interest rates might be needed to curb inflation.The KBW banking index set new multi-year lows, while the S&P 500 index of financials fell 2.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,361.77 points; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent at 12,280.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,459.46 points.On Friday the Dow Jones suffered its biggest one-day fall since February 2007 as equity markets were hit by surging oil prices and a jump in the unemployment rate that pointed to continued recession-like conditions in the US economy.Some analysts argued that this was an over-reaction and stocks seesawed between gains and losses in afternoon trading.There were bright spots. McDonald’s rose 4.1 per cent to $59.31 after the fast-food chain said it had made gains in May same-store sales due to strong international demand. That did not stop the wider sector from falling 0.1 per cent.New data that showed a surprise rise in pending home sales in April helped improve sentiment. According to the National Association of Realtors, the index of pending home re-sales rose 6.3 per cent to 88.2, the highest level in six months. That too had a limited impact and an index of homebuilding stocks slipped 0.9 per cent.Energy and materials stocks were leading gainers, up 2.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Alcoa rose 7.5 per cent to $42.17 after Barron’s said the aluminium producer could rise markedly in value to $60 a share if it were to become a takeover target, citing a Citigroup analyst. Monsanto rose 2 per cent to $138.45 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 2.2 per cent to $118.26.Banking sector travails curbed those gains. Lehman, the smallest of the leading investment banks, said it lost $2.8bn in the second quarter and that it would raise $6bn in new capital.Fitch, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Lehman, while its peer Moody’s lowered its ratings outlook for the brokerage. Lehman, which has lost more than half its value in the past year, fell 8.7 per cent to $29.48, striking a 52-week lows before recovering slightly. The news hit the financial sector, which is reeling from the protracted fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis.Merrill Lynch fell 3.2 per cent to $37.76, JPMorgan lost 6.4 per cent to $37.51 and
Citigroup slid 2.3 per cent to $19.60. A UBS note suggesting Washington Mutual would suffer $21.7bn in mortgage losses through 2011 crushed the banks’ share price, while earnings downgrades for Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp weighed on their stocks.WaMu slipped 17 per cent to $6.25, Fifth Third Bancorp edged up 0.2 per cent to $16.78 and KeyCorp fell 3.8 per cent to $16.65.In the past few weeks analysts have slashed earnings estimates for the financials sector with the result that according to Thomson Reuters the consensus estimate is for a 45 per cent decline in the second quarter.Technology shares slipped in spite of a positive note on the sector from Lehman.Apple led the fallers, off 2.2 per cent to $181.61 as investors took profits after the company unveiled a new and cheaper iPhone. Google slipped 1.6 per cent to $557.87 while Intel fell 1.8 per cent to $22.49.According to Thomson Reuters, tech is expected to achieve the second-highest earnings growth rate among leading industry sectors in the second quarter of 2008."

An index of financial stocks gave up 1.7 per cent.The drive by financials to raise more capital looks set to continue this week.National City, Ohio’s biggest bank, on Monday confirmed that it would raise $7bn from a consortium led by Corsair Capital after it posted a first-quarter loss.The private equity group will buy shares at a significant discount to Friday’s closing price and the news, as well as a dividend cut, dragged the bank’s stock down 27.3 per cent to $6.06.Colonial BancGroup shares fell, dropping 10.2 per cent to $8.91, after it cut its dividend by half and revealed plans to sell 25m shares to raise capital.National City and Colonial BancGroup join financial institutions such as Citigroup and Wachovia that have been forced to shore up their balance sheets after subprime-related writedowns.The benchmark S&P 500 pared its losses in the late afternoon, but closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,388.17. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,408.04 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 0.2 per cent lower at 12,825.02.Amid the broad market sell-off, the energy and technology sectors continued their strong run of trading.Microsoft and Apple made ground ahead of results due later in the week. Apple shares climbed 4.3 per cent to $168.16 while Microsoft shares added 1.4 per cent to $30.42.Record high oil prices buoyed the energy sector. Hess was the leading gainer, adding 6.8 per cent to $112.41.Coal miners also found momentum after Arch Coal said first-quarter profit more than doubled. Arch shares added 6.5 per cent to $62.18. Its peers, Peabody and Consol Energy, climbed 3.4 per cent to $68.93 and 2.1 per cent to $88.10, respectively.Still, results from oil services companies Halliburton and Weatherford International left investors unimpressed.Halliburton said first-quarter net profit increased 5.8 per cent while Weatherford’s earnings fell but shares in both underperformed. Halliburton edged up 0.1 per cent to $47.46 while Weatherford shares fell 1.3 per cent to $84.41.Pharmaceuticals were in focus after two industry heavyweights reported first-quarter results. Eli Lilly said profit had more than doubled but it still missed analysts’ estimates because of a charge for dropping its inhaled insulin product. Lilly shares slipped 4.7 per cent to $49.60.Meanwhile, Merck said quarterly profit gained 94 per cent, boosted by a $2.2bn payment from AstraZeneca for a partnership on blood pressure drugs and a treatment for Crohn’s disease. Merck shares fell 0.3 per cent to $39.63.Quest Diagnostics was the leading gainer in the healthcare sector after it said net income jumped 32 per cent in the first quarter thanks to the acquisitions. Quest shares climbed 7.7 per cent to $49.12.Toymakers Hasbro and Mattel also reported first-quarter earnings on Monday.Hasbro said profits rose following strong sales of Transformers and Littlest Pet Shop products. Rival Mattel however, revealed its first loss in three years, blaming higher manufacturing costs in China and a slowdown in Barbie sales within the US.Mattel shares sagged 8.2 per cent to $19.99 while Hasbro gained 10 per cent to $34.68.This week, 155 S&P 500 companies and nine components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, including American Express, McDonald’s and ConocoPhillips, report results.
72;HES;Hess Corp;2008-04-15T18:24:27Z;Brazil’s offshore oil;;If you are looking for someone who can move capital markets, try Haroldo Lima, former electric engineer and Brazilian Communist party lawmaker, and, since 2005, director of the ANP, Brazil’s energy regulator. On Monday Mr Lima said 400km offshore from Rio de Janeiro, under a layer of salt, could lie the third largest oil field in the world. His comments added more than $20bn to the market value of the companies involved, including Petrobras, Repsol, Hess and BG Group. The provenance of Mr Lima’s opinion does not appear authoritative. Attempts by the ANP and Petrobras to clear up the confusion have proved singularly ineffective. An optimistic interpretation is that Mr Lima thinks the Sugar Loaf prospect, which covers several licence areas, or “blocks”, could contain an incredible 33bn barrels of oil equivalent of recoverable reserves. Just an off-the-cuff remark by a regulator? Not quite. Petrobras says no new seismic data exist but 33bn boe is far above most third-party estimates – Morgan Stanley, for example, had assumed about 15bn boe. Furthermore, Brazil has recent form: in November, the adjacent Tupi field was found to have 5-8bn boe of recoverable reserves.Apart from Petrobras, which companies might benefit most is debatable. Europe’s Repsol, BG Group and Galp own stakes in blocks on the edge of Sugar Loaf while Exxon and Hess may have better positioning. For Brazil itself, the discovery would be politically important, taking it from the world’s 16th largest to seventh largest country for oil reserves, just behind Russia. It is early days but, with exploratory drilling due by BG in the summer, Hess and Exxon in the second half of the year, and BG again next year, Sugar Loaf’s true size should become clear soon. Investors and Brazilians, as well as the temporarily omnipotent Mr Lima, will hope his comments prove to be right.Post and read comments on this Lex
73;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Activists target oil;;"The archetypal oilman is the “wildcatter”, smelling out opportunities below the surface. Activist fund managers, who also like to think of themselves as mavericks, see a chance to strike it big in the US energy sector. Both Icahn Partners and Jana Partners have recently raised their stakes in the likes of Anadarko Petroleum and Hess Corp; mid-sized oil and gas companies with a market capitalisation each of around $30bn.Commodity prices are one attraction. Oil bobs around $100 a barrel and natural gas costs $9 per thousand cubic feet, but exploration and production (E&P) stocks imply long-term prices closer to $70 and $6 respectively.It seems unlikely activists are just betting on the forward curve, though. One angle may be to force E&P companies to emulate the majors: prioritise free cash flow over investing for growth. Tudor Pickering Holt, an energy-focused bank, calculates that, assuming an average 2008 gas price of $7, 17 of the 23 E&P companies it tracks will outspend their operating cash flow this year. Activists could demand investment be reined in, undeveloped properties sold and mature fields run for cash.One reason for those big budgets is the changing landscape of the US gas sector. The buzz these days is about unconventional resources such as “tight gas”, which, like tar sands in the oil sector, are tricky to exploit and require big upfront investment. Against that, however, they offer long-life reserves that are, crucially, at home rather than in some highly taxed, unwelcoming foreign juristiction.Such big, complex projects ought to be the natural preserve of the majors. That they are not currently reflects decades of focusing on overseas growth. Recent presentations from the likes of ExxonMobil suggest Big Oil may be reconsidering on that front. For the activists, the possibility that the majors might want to buy their way into bigger US gas businesses provides another reason to stake out a position."

However, large-cap technology companies continued to lag amid concerns over growth prospects in the sector.The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent in early trade, but recovered to close up 0.8 per cent at 1,420.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.9 per cent to 12,853.09 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,488.52.Mr Bernanke said the Fed might take “substantive” action on rates, leading traders to believe the Fed could ease by 50 basis points at the end of this month.“What this did is it indicate the Fed is not going to get caught behind the curve,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said.Many traders have already priced in further rate cuts amid the threat of a looming recession. After the Fed chairman’s comments the futures market factored in a 90 per cent chance of a 50bp cut at the end of this month, with at least two further 25bp cuts seen likely.The financial sector rallied further before the close on reports that Countrywide Financial, the struggling mortgage lender, was in advance talks with Bank of America about a possible merger. Countrywide’s shares soared 51.4 per cent to $7.75.The S&P financial sector climbed as much as 6 per cent off its session-low. Big movers included rival mortgage lenders IndyMac Bancorp and Washington Mutual which climbed 23 per cent to $5.78 and 14.8 per cent to $14.16 respectively.E-Trade Financial, the troubled online brokerage, jumped 22.1 per cent to $2.93. Homebuilders also rebounded with the S&P homebuilder index closing 6.2 per cent higher at 305.05.Blackstone made gains after the private equity group agreed to acquire GSO Capital Partners for up to $930m. Blackstone also announced a $500m stock buy-back programme and the shares rose 9.6 per cent to $19.84.Earlier a profit warning at Capital One Financial had unsettled traders. The credit card company cut its full-year profit guidance by more than 20 per cent because of rising loan delinquencies. The shares closed down 1 per cent at $42.92.After the closing bell American Express reported similar problems. The card issuer said it would take a $440m charge for the fourth quarter as more customers have missed payments. It also gave a cautious outlook for 2008. The shares closed 0.3 per cent lower at $48.92, but slid 5 per cent after hours.US airline shares rose sharply on reports that Delta Air Lines is on the verge of merger talks with both Northwest Airlines and UAL, parent of United Airlines. Delta declined to comment.UAL, gained 23.7 per cent to $32.19, Northwest Airlines gained 32 per cent to $15.85 and Delta rose 18.2 per cent to $15.98.Other transport stocks gained as oil prices fell sharply but falling crude prices hurt a broad range of companies in the energy sector. Hess, the oil producer and refiner fell 2.2 per cent to $92.68.Retailers lagged the market after US stores reported an anaemic set of December sales figures, prompting some companies to lower their earnings guidance.Although Wal-Mart, up 3.2 per cent at $48.40, reported solid results and other low-cost chains fared well, niche retailers disappointed as middle-market consumers cut back on discretionary spending.However, analysts were split on the severity of the problems. Banc of America said the numbers did not “look as bad as feared”.Retailers posting significant December same-store sales declines included AnnTaylor Stores, the women’s clothing retailer, and Gap. The shares fell 15.5 per cent to $19.95 and 7.1 per cent to $17.97 respectively.

Retailers lost ground on concerns about the crucial holiday shopping period and homebuilders were volatile after US house prices declined by a record amount.Investors hoping for a “Santa Claus rally” were disappointed with the financial and consumer discretionary sectors bearing the brunt of selling pressure.By the close of trade in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,497.66, having earlier fallen as much as 0.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction higher at 13,551.69 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,724.41, as technology once again outperformed the broader market.The retail sector declined after a report by MasterCard Advisors said consumer spending climbed only 3.6 per cent between Thanksgiving and Christmas, adding to concerns that US consumers, hit by the housing market slump, are shying away from the shops. Excluding petrol and car sales, spending increased only 2.4 per cent.Among the leading fallers were Macy’s and Dillard’s, the department store operators, which fell 3.9 per cent to $25.95 and 5.5 per cent to $19.19 respectively.Shares in Target, the discount retailer, fell 2.5 per cent to $51.16 after it warned that sales may decline this month.The company set guidance for December same-store sales of between a 1 per cent decrease and 1 per cent increase, compared to previous expectations of 3-5 per cent growth.Adrianne Shapira, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said Target’s guidance “stokes the fears of disappointing December sales.”Economic news was dominated by a record decline in US house prices. The average price of single-family homes in 10 metropolitan areas covered by the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index fell 6.7 per cent in October compared with a year earlier.The S&P homebuilder index fell 1.9 per cent after the report was released but recovered later to trade 0.6 per cent higher at 377.61.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Merrill Lynch also fell in early trade before rallying 1.2 per cent to end at $54.54. Meredith Whitney, CIBC World Markets analyst, said she expects the bank to post a $2.70-a-share loss for the fourth quarter, with writedowns reaching up to $7bn.Merrill on Monday said it would receive up to $6.2bn in new capital from Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and Davis Selected Advisers, a money management firm, but the stock fell after Merrill said the stakes were acquired at a sharp discount to the previous closing price. Davis Selected Advisers, also moved shares in MBIA on Wednesday after it disclosed a 6.4 per cent stake in the bond insurer. MBIA’s shares rose 11 per cent to $22.33.There was also good news for investors looking for a pick-up in dealmaking activity after Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, said it planned to buy a 60 per cent stake in Marmon Holdings.Berkshire Hathway will pay $4.5bn for its stake in the family-controlled manufacturing and services group and will acquire the remaining 40 per cent over the next five to six years.Commodity prices rose on Wednesday, providing a boost to energy and mining stocks. Hess, the oil producer and refiner, rose 2.2 per cent to $104.63 while Newmont Mining, the world’s largest gold producer, climbed 1.4 per cent to $49.11.Supply concerns drove the price of crude oil to a one-month high of $96.54 while gold climbed 2 per cent to $824.60 an ounce.Bond prices edged lower on Wednesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury note gained 2 basis points to 3.26 per cent while the 10-year Treasury note yield was up 0.5bp at 4.21 per cent.The dollar was mixed against major currencies early in New York. The US currency lost 0.6 per cent against the euro and fell 0.5 per cent against the Swiss franc but rose slightly against the yen.US stocks rose on Monday after a spate of deal-making helped spur a pre-Christmas rally on Wall Street.The S&P 500 on Monday closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,496.45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 13,549.33, and the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.8 per cent to 2,713.50.

The move marked a rebound from the previous day’s rout which saw the index briefly turn negative for the year and fall more than 10 per cent from its record high in October – a technical “correction” in stock-market parlance.“I think it’s a technical bounce from a very oversold market condition,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist Avalon Partners, said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent to 12,958.44 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6 per cent to 2,580.80.Financials, healthcare and industrials led gains while energy stocks were weakest as the price of crude oil retreated. Hess fell 2.9 per cent to $66.39 while National Oilwell Varco declined 3.4 per cent to $64.61.A $7.5bn investment in Citigroup from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority dominated market chatter on Tuesday, underscoring the bank’s efforts to shore up its overstretched balance sheet.“The move represents part of the solution applying excess global liquidity to buy depressed and or illiquid assets although it does not represent a silver bullet for Citi let alone the heavily damaged financial intermediation pipeline,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Citi’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $30.32 but still underperformed many of the other leading banks, However volatility in the trading of Citi options fell, as risk perception declined.A range of banking and other financial stocks posted much stronger gains as traders went bargain-hunting in the heavily shorted sector. Lehman Brothers rose 4.3 cent to $59.90 while Morgan Stanley gained 3.9 per cent to $49.80.However, MBIA, the bond insurer, fell 7.9 per cent to $30.46 after it said it was winding down a structured investment vehicle.The financial sector of the S&P has fallen 22.4 per cent so far this year and as the largest group on the index its demise has weighed on the broader market.In contrast, consumer staples, considered a recession-proof sector, have risen
10.3 per cent in 2007.Goldman Sachs on Tuesday lowered its ratings on several sectors of the US stock market, including software, automobiles and airlines. Goldman said the chances of a US recession had increased to 40-45 per cent from 30 per cent a few months ago.Goldman also said it expected the Fed funds rate to bottom out at 3 per cent in the next six to nine months, revised from a previous forecast of 4 per cent.The futures market continued to price in a December quarter-point easing, even as Charles Plosser, Philadelphia Federal Reserve president, played down the odds of another cut.In economic news, the Case-Shiller index of home prices fell a record 4.5 per cent nationally in the third quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier.The S&P homebuilder index fell 1.3 per cent to 291.55 after plummeting 7.2 per cent the previous day. Pulte Homes declined 0.9 per cent to $9.08 in spite of reaffirming its fourth-quarter outlook.A gauge of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level for two years. Stocks dipped briefly after the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dropped to 87.3 this month, from a revised 95.2 in October, substantially worse than expected.Semiconductor stocks were broadly higher on Tuesday but shares in Advanced Micro Devices hit a four-year low, falling 1.2 per cent to $10.15, after an analyst downgraded the stock. Intel rose 3 per cent to $25.11 after JPMorgan raised its earnings estimates.In earnings news, Talbots, the clothing retailer, swung to a $9.4m loss in the third quarter but the results were better than anticipated and the shares rose 6.4 per cent to $14.02."
77;HES;Hess Corp;2007-11-06T21:49:24Z;Wall St rebounds amid record oil and gold;;Wall Street shares rebounded on Tuesday as commodity prices hit new highs, providing a boon to energy and materials stocks.Financial stocks recovered some of their recent heavy losses amid lingering concerns about banks’ exposure to credit and mortgage market losses. However some mixed corporate earnings continued to weigh on sentiment.Writedowns from financial companies and disappointing results from energy groups have caused estimates of earnings growth on an annual basis for S&P 500 companies to slip to 6.9 per cent in the fourth quarter from 11.9 per cent, according to Thomson Financial.Blended earnings, including actual and estimated results, for the S&P 500 are down 1.7 per cent for the third quarter, the first drop since 2002.A late rally helped the S&P 500 close 1.2 per cent higher at 1,520.27 points,. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1 per cent at 2,825.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 13,660.94.Energy stocks had the best of the gains after crude oil futures hit $97 a barrel for the first time. The S&P energy index rose 2.7 per cent at 589.04. ExxonMobil gained 3.1 per cent at $90.38 and Chevron rose 2.4 per cent at $90.64. Hess rose 7 per cent at $73.98.Valero Energy, the US’s biggest oil refiner, rose 4.8 per cent to $72.73 in spite of posting a 21 per cent decline in third-quarter profits after gasoline margins fell sharply.Materials stocks rose as precious metals, including gold, silver and platinum, reached fresh heights. The S&P materials index gained 2.5 per cent at 268.17. Alcoa rose 1.8 per cent at $38.57 while Newmont Mining rose 4.1 per cent at $54.50.Financial stocks hit back as investors tentatively put aside worries about potential credit market losses. Citigroup’s disclosure this week that it would make up to $11bn in further mortgage-related writedowns sparked concern that other banks and financial institutions will follow suit.Rumours that banks will have to writedown “level 3 assets” – assets that are so illiquid they are difficult to value – continued to unsettle the market. Goldman Sachs rose 2.2 per cent at $223.16 after it said persistent rumours that it would make mortgage-related writedowns were “still untrue”.Bear Stearns gained 2.1 per cent at $102 and Merrill Lynch rose 0.9 per cent at $56.37. But Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent at $35.08 while Morgan Stanley shed 1.9 per cent at $54.51.The S&P financial index gained 1.7 per cent at 425.46, helped by MasterCard, which soared 7.2 per cent at $199.40 after Deutsche Bank raised its rating to “buy” and set a $250 target.Christopher Flanagan, JPMorgan analyst, said total losses stemming from mortgage linked securities could reach $200bn, against only $30bn-$40bn in losses reported so far.“Banks, brokers, mortgage and monoline insurers will bear the brunt of this loss recognition,” he said. But credit insurers, which have suffered some of the worst share price falls, rallied.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, gained 13.8 per cent at $27.99 after it disputed a Morgan Stanley report that the industry’s losses would worsen.Ambac said Morgan’s estimates “do not accurately reflect the composition of our underlying mortgage portfolio and the structure of our deals”. MBIA, another bond insurer, gained 7.3 per cent at $35.65.Among homebuilders Hovnanian Enterprises fell 0.7 per cent at $10.04 after home deliveries fell 19 per cent in the fourth quarter, while cancellations reached 40 per cent. Beazer Homes suspended its dividend, cut 25 per cent of its staff and took $230m in pre-tax charges. Shares rose 10 per cent at $10.47 after an adviser to union pension funds called for the board to oust Ian McCarthy, chief executive.In technology, Sun Microsystems fell 9.6 per cent to $5.16 after revenues missed analysts’ expectations. Google gained 2.2 per cent at $741.79 after Sanford C Bernstein raised its price target to $850. Microsoft fell 0.9 per cent at $36.41 after it was dropped from a Goldman Sachs buy list.Alibaba.com, the Chinese e-commerce portal, almost tripled in price on its Hong Kong debut.But Yahoo, a 39 per cent stakeholder in Alibaba’s parent, fell 4.6 per cent to $29.93.
78;HES;Hess Corp;2007-05-10T18:18:33Z;Petrofac shows equity flair;;This year Petrofac Resources will submit plans for the West Don and Don Southwest oil fields in the North Sea, decide whether reserves at the Cendor field offshore Malaysia warrant a second development phase, and bring onstream the Chergui field offshore Tunisia.There would be nothing unusual in this if it were not for the fact that Petrofac is primarily an oil industry engineering and services group. Its Resources division was created in 1998 to take equity stakes in selected development projects, the rationale being that it would provide long-term cashflow to a “lumpy” core business and leverage to win more and bigger engineering jobs.Resources has a stake in the Ohanet gas field in Algeria, which is forecast to achieve its defined return late in 2011. Cendor, where it is the operator, came onstream in September. Success in these projects means the division is looking for more fields in Malaysia, in Indonesia and in Norway.Amjad Bseisu, division chief executive, says he is opportunity-short rather than cash-constrained.The link between the North African, Asian and North Sea prospects is that they are marginal to the interests of the big oil groups but can produce a worthwhile return to Petrofac if the group brings to bear its engineering and services expertise.The Resources arm does not simply invest in equity. Its equity stake, typically in the “sweet spot of $50m to $100m”, is accompanied by a low-cost development plan, defined reserves and, preferably, project operatorship.So, at Ohanet, turn-key completion costs came in 20-30 per cent below the competition, says Mr Bseisu. In the North Sea Don fields, Petrofac will take advantage of third-party infrastructure that its runs to reduce costs.In the North Sea, the division is a “scavenger”, one of the new breed of groups that has sought to turn a profit by taking over mature province assets that the big oil companies want to dispose of. In the case of the Don assets, BP found tax advantages in selling to Petrofac.At Cendor, Amerada Hess, the US group, was tied into a development that was too small for it and where three years of the five-year timeframe had expired. But the group did not want to sour relations with partners that included Petronas, Malaysia’s national oil group. Petrofac helped Amerada Hess save face while its partners got their project on time and on the cheap.Petrofac Resources was adopting its preferred role, characterised by Mr Bseisu as a “natural partner of national oil companies”. By marrying up equity with in-house engineering and services, Petrofac Resources can substitute for two or three levels of international oil company involvement.The problem is that development costs have increased even more than oil prices in recent years, while national oil companies are demanding tougher production sharing contract terms that have deterred foreign investors.Mr Bseisu says oil-producer governments need to adopt a model whereby they increase the rent on producing assets – responding to higher oil prices – but lower it for new projects.Though it is upstream projects that have been prominent in Resources’ investments to date, downstream projects are pursued. In June it will learn if it has won a contract to build a 120,000 barrel a day refinery in Tunisia. It has a stake in a Kyrgyz refinery, and Mr Bseisu sees a niche in building refineries to serve markets in the diesel-fuel-poor Mediterranean Basin.Last year its Resources arm accounted for some 20 per cent of Petrofac group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $200m, yet its revenues comprised less than 3.5 per cent of the group total. The division’s contribution to profits will increase this year with Cendor kicking in.The cash inflow is welcome, but the link between equity participation and engineering, procurement and construction participation marks out Petrofac’s approach from models adopted earlier by Schlumberger and Halliburton.Mr Bseisu says Resources has played a transformational role. Winning the Ohanet contract, which had a value of $600m, was a watershed and was enabled by the agreement to take equity. Cendor took Petrofac into offshore project management for the first time.The strategy is not without risk. The group has service contracts with numerous oil groups in the North Sea, while the dominant engineering and construction division must be trusted by potential clients.Andrew Whittock, oil company analyst at Oriel Securities, says that by investing in field developments, Petrofac may sometimes be seen as a potential competitor to its customers. This concern is shared by Tony Alves, analyst at Peel Hunt. Both see this as a limiting factor in the potential growth of the division, which Mr Bseisu would like to expand to account for about a third of group earnings.Mr Whittock says the services and engineering arms are run well enough to have made the progress they have to date without Resources. But Mr Alves is sympathetic to the view that Resources means the group “can provide the critical piece of the jigsaw that no conventional oil company can”.
79;HES;Hess Corp;2007-02-22T22:18:13Z;Sam Laidlaw’s soft-sell approach;;Sam Laidlaw has made a good – if low-key – impression on the City after just over six months as Centrica chief executive.His quiet, calm demeanour contrasts with that of his predecessor, Sir Roy Gardner, who could be prickly with analysts and investors and seemed not to enjoy justifying his group’s actions to the market.“Sam is considerably more investor-friendly than Roy was in his latter years,” said one analyst.Mr Laidlaw, 50, was born into the oil and gas business. His father, Sir Christopher, was chairman of BP in the late 1970s.After Eton and Cambridge, he worked as a solicitor but gravitated towards the oil industry.For most of the 1980s and 1990s, Mr Laidlaw worked for Amerada Hess, the US oil group, having got his foot in the door as an intern for Leon Hess, the group’s legendary founder.Mr Laidlaw built up Amerada’s North Sea operations, then moved to the US as chief operating officer.In 2001, he was hired as chief executive of Enterprise Oil and was instantly on the receiving end of takeover bids from Eni of Italy and Shell. He sold Enterprise to Shell in 2002 and moved back to the US with Chevron as head of business development.He is married with four children. A desire to curtail his family’s travelling encouraged him to return to the UK last year and move downstream in the energy market – to gas supply.He is expected to bring more focus on the upstream gas market to Centrica.One analyst said yesterday that Mr Laidlaw was saying all the right things but people were waiting to see if he could deliver.

The energy group was the laggard and ended 1.7 per cent lower, leaving it down 7.5 per cent for the year.The recent slide in oil prices is potentially good news for consumer spending and a boon for broad stock prices say analysts. But as the fourth-quarter earnings season got under way, investors kept the broad averages trading inside narrow ranges.“The one overwhelming constant since 2003 among investors has been perpetual worry and a lack of confidence,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “Earnings are a concern. But $50 oil is much better for the the vast majority of companies than $80 oil.”Technology shares led the market higher after the broad averages were lower in the morning.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,459.33, helped by gains in semiconductor stocks and Apple, up 4.8 per cent to $97.Apple set a new all-time high of $97.80 in early trade as it built on the surge which followed its unveiling on Tuesday of its new iPhone product.

84;HES;Hess Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
85;HES;Hess Corp;2006-08-18T21:12:06Z;Wall St in week-long rally led by tech;;The Nasdaq Composite index yesterday recorded its best weekly advance in three years, as the main indices were buoyed by a week-long rally that pushed the S&P 500 past the 1,300 level for the first time in more than three months.The technology-led rally was precipitated by weaker than expected readings on consumer and producer price inflation, which investors interpreted as signalling that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates in the short term.The Nasdaq’s gains would have been greater had it not been for bad news from Dell. On Friday, the computer maker reported a 51 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, and announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating it for the past year over accounting issues. The news dented some of the 8 per cent gain it had made on the week but, by the close, Dell was still up 5.2 per cent for the week at $22.16. The stock has dropped 26 per cent this year.Dell’s main rival, Hewlett-Packard, fared even better, climbing 7.5 per cent to $35.52 after it reported third-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. The maker of personal computers and printers also announced a $6bn share buyback and gave bullish earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.HP has risen 24 per cent this year to its highest level since the beginning of 2001.Chipmakers had a strong week, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index gaining 10 per cent, its best week in three years.Microsoft jumped 5.6 per cent to $25.79 on the week after it announced it was increasing its share buyback programme by $16.2bn.PMC-Sierra rose 26.1 per cent to $6.38 after it said it had concluded its stock options investigation and had not found any deliberate misconduct by staff. The company filed a restatement later in the week that adjusted stock-holder equity but did not affect cash flows or income statements for 2003 and later.Advanced Micro Devices was raised from “hold” to “buy” by Citigroup, citing an improved outlook for the computer sector and chances the company would enter into more deals with Dell. AMD shares added 21 per cent to $23.93 for the week.Intel followed the rest of the sector higher, gaining 5.7 per cent to $18.40, while Broadcom leapt 19.9 per cent to $30.00.Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific testing equipment, jumped 16.9 per cent to $31.80 on the week after it reported that profits in the fiscal third quarter had more than doubled thanks to gains from selling assets.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was up 2.8 per cent for the week, and 0.4 per cent, or 4.82 points, on the day at 1,302.30.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent, or 6.34 points, on the day at 2,163.95, to finish the week up 5.2 per cent, its best week since May 2003. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent for the day, up 46.51 points at 11,381.47, a gain of 2.6 per cent for the week.“It’s been a very good week,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach. Today’s [Friday’s] market action was to be expected after the strong gains [earlier in the week]. The pullback today is shallow. The market is still showing signs of strength considering we’re in a very light volume environment.”Oil prices eased over the week, with Nymex crude dropping 4.5 per cent. Hess fell 6.1 per cent to $48.75 and Valero Energy dropped 4.6 per cent to $61.84.Online auctioneer Ebay staged a recovery, adding 12.6 per cent to $27.25. The stock had fallen as low as $22.99 on August 22. It is still down 37 per cent this year.Tobacco companies were boosted late on Thursday when a federal judge said they had lied about the health effects of smoking, but decided not to impose financial penalties. Altria, parent of Philip Morris, gained 3.9 per cent to $83.97.The market viewed Merck’s day in court less positively after a state judge allowed a retrial for a man who blamed his heart attack on the company’s Vioxx drug. Its shares sank 2.7 per cent to $39.52.Organic supermarket Whole Foods soared 13.9 per cent to $53.95 after investment magazine Barron’s said the company was undervalued. The stock was further boosted when JPMorgan raised its rating on the stock from “underweight” to “neutral”.
86;HES;Hess Corp;2006-08-16T20:35:41Z;Wall Street gains as inflation slows down;;Wall Street notched up more gains on Wednesday as investors were cheered by a second round of weaker-than-expected inflation data, that pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average to their highest levels in three months.The five biggest gainers on the S&P 500 for the day were chipmakers. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange’s semiconductor index has risen more than 7 per cent in the past three days.Broadcom leapt 8.9 per cent to $30.38 on news that the International Trade Commission had extended by 50 days an investigation into the alleged infringement of a Broadcom patent by wireless technology group Qualcomm.Qualcomm was not adversely affected, instead jumping 6.7 per cent to $37.83 following bullish comments by Merrill Lynch.Another chipmaker, Xilinx, announced late on Tuesday that it had uncovered no evidence of fraud in its stock options grants. Its shares rose 10 per cent to $22.71.PMC-Sierra gained 9.5 per cent to $6.11 after a Taiwanese company said it would use PMC processors for its internet telephony service.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent, or 9.85 points, at 1,295.43, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.6 per cent, or 34.53 points, at 2,149.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent, or 96.86 points, at 11,327.12.However, Merrill Lynch’s Mary Ann Bartels sounded a cautionary note about recent gains in equity markets.“We continue to believe that while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are positioned for a rally that could carry these indexes to or through their May highs, the technical underpinnings for the rally are weak,” she said.“The possibility exists that the highs for the year and the bull market are in, and that a cyclical correction that could approach 15-20 per cent has begun, with the Nasdaq at risk for a 25-30 per cent pullback.”The only main sector to show weakness was oil, which sank as crude fell to its lowest level in six weeks. Chevron tumbled 1.4 per cent to $65.11, and Hess dropped 2.2 per cent to $49.20.Energy’s one bright spot was coal, which steamed higher after television stock commentator Jim Cramer said the sector was poised for a bounce. Peabody Energy leapt 7.1 per cent to $47.83 and Arch Coal rose 5 per cent to $36.42.Lower oil buoyed transport stocks. United Parcel Service added 4.5 per cent to $72.13, and the S&P airlines index had its best day in a month, with Continental Airlines gaining 6 per cent to $24.50.In spite of data showing a slowdown in new housing starts for July, homebuilders rallied. The stocks were boosted by a fall in 10-year bond yields to four-month lows. Pulte gained 5 per cent to $29.75, while Toll Brothers added 3.9 per cent to $25.49.
87;HES;Hess Corp;2006-07-12T17:42:25Z;Repsol buys BP stake in Gulf of Mexico;;Repsol YPF, the Spanish energy group, on Wednesday made a big bet on oil prices, paying $2.15bn for BP’s stake in the Shenzi field in the US Gulf of Mexico.Derek Butter, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultant, said: “This deal implies a price of $97 a barrel unless substantial further reserves are found.“In comparison, the price Anadarko last month paid for Kerr-McGee, a company with large US Gulf of Mexico assets, implied a future oil price at an average of $40 a barrel.”In his report on the deal, Mr Butter said: “Only time will tell if Repsol-YPF’s view on the upside potential is correct. In the meantime, a new benchmark has been set in a mergers and acquisition market which, fuelled by burgeoning cash flows and limited organic growth opportunities, shows no sign of abating.”BHP Billiton, the Australian mining company which has a 44 per cent stake, operates the field with Amerada Hess. Once Repsol’s deal with BP is complete, Repsol will own a 28 per cent stake.Repsol, Europe’s fifth biggest listed energy group, is desperate to boost its reserves of oil and gas and has been on the prowl for an asset or small US energy company for the past few months.The company’s shares rose nearly 1 per cent on Wednesday.BHP’s engineers estimate they can recover 350m-400m barrels of oil and gas from the Shenzi field. Repsol is counting on that number doubling once drilling in the northern section is complete. This would cut the implied price the group needed to make a robust profit on the deal to $68 a barrel.The field, in hurricane-prone waters 4,300ft deep and about 120 miles from the Louisiana coast, is expected to produce its first oil by the middle of 2009. It will cost $4.4bn to develop over the next nine years and have the capacity to produce up to 100,000 barrels of oil and 50m cu ft of gas a day.“Companies are willing to make desperate investments to book reserves,” said one energy lawyer. “You can’t understate their frantic need.”Repsol was the most frantic of its peers, bankers, oil executives and analysts said.In January, it announced a 25 per cent write-down in proved reserves, or about 1.25bn barrels of oil equivalent, following a reassessment of its operations in Bolivia. The write-down sparked a share sell-off amid concerns of possible legal action by shareholders.Dresdner Kleinwort said in a report on Wednesday said it expected European benchmark oil prices to average $70 a barrel for the next two years, up from other estimates closer to $50 a barrel.The International Energy Agency yesterday said in a report that oil demand would accelerate in 2007-2011 because growth in China and India would more than compensate for the impact high oil prices are having on consumption elsewhere.
88;HES;Hess Corp;2006-06-27T21:04:14Z;Wall Street tumbles ahead of Fed meeting;;Wall Street ended lower on Tuesday as investors awaited the outcome of the two-day meeting of the US Federal Reserve’s rate-setting body, which starts on Wednesday.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent, or 11.36 points, at 1,239.20. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.6 per cent, or 33.42 points, at 2,100.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 per cent, or 120.54 points, at 10,924.74.The falls followed news that consumer confidence in June rose more than expected while sales of existing homes fell slightly less than forecast.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said the data would add pressure for the Federal Reserve to raise rates. “As long as the economy is stronger than expected, it’s an inflation threat,” he said.Univision rose 6.2 per cent to $34.00, after the company’s board agreed to sell the Spanish language broadcaster for $12.3bn in cash to a consortium of investors that includes media executive Haim Saban and several private equity groups.Tribune Group jumped 5.1 per cent to $32.47 after the company said it had completed phase one of its $2bn stock buyback programme.Troubled carmaker General Motors tumbled 6.7 per cent to $25.90, its worst day since December, after the company said overall sales for 2006 were likely to come in below 2005 levels.Chemical maker Dupont fell 2.8 per cent to $40.88. French energy and telecommunications group Vivendi on Tuesday announced it had sold its 1.8 per cent stake in the company.Crude oil rose to settle just below $72 a barrel, giving a fillip to energy stocks. Marathon Oil added 3.8 per cent to $79.81 and Hess Corporation gained 2.8 per cent to $48.20.The rising oil price dented airline stocks. United Airlines dropped 5.5 per cent to $30.12, and US Airways lost 3.2 per cent to $48.04.News that Intel would sell its communications processor business to Marvell Technology to concentrate on its core business dragged down rival Advanced Micro Devices, which fell 1.6 per cent to $24.26. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor index dropped 3.8 per cent.Nasdaq fell 5.5 per cent to $26.64, even as the company’s chief executive said that concerns that companies were choosing to list on foreign rather than domestic exchanges were overstated.Biomet and Zimmer Holdings, the medical products makers, continued to slide following their announcements on Monday that they had received subpoenas from the Department of Justice in relation to an anti-trust investigation. Biomet fell 6 per cent to $31.19 and Zimmer shed 4.9 per cent to $55.80.Reports that Google would test its online payment system this week worried investors in Ebay, which owns the Paypal system. Ebay fell 5 per cent to $28.25.
89;HES;Hess Corp;2006-06-25T17:48:59Z;Anadarko deal heralds beginning of the end;;"Anadarko Petroleum has taken a big bet that oil and gas prices are going to stay at their record highs with the acquisition last week of Kerr-McGee, a smaller rival.In so doing the fifth-largest US oil and gas company contributed a brush stroke to the changing landscape of the mid-sized US energy industry.If 1998 marked the birth of the super major as Exxon merged with Mobil, BP with Amoco and Total with PetroFina, then the past 12 months appear to have
heralded the beginning of the end of the US mid-tier oil companies.“Of the mid-tier US companies, on a two to five-year time scale, are any of these guys going to be left?” said Derek Butter, analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh consultants. He added Marathon, Amerada Hess and Devon were most likely to be the next targets.Anadarko – which has long been eyed by companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, the AngloDutch group, for its gas assets – has perhaps made itself an even more attractive target with last week’s deal.Mergers and acquisitions in the oil sector began to boom again last year, after years of executives arguing that prices were too high. In 2005, worldwide mergers and acquisitions more than doubled to $160bn – the highest level since 1998.Anadarko’s $16.4bn deal is the third big acquisition among the mid-sized US energy companies since last summer. In the second half of last year ConocoPhillips bought Burlington Resources for $36bn and Chevron beat the Chinese in the $20bn battle for Unocal. On a smaller scale, Occidental Petroleum took Vintage for a little more than $4bn that year as well. Meanwhile, across the US’s northern border, Total, of France, bought Canada’s Deer Creek for $1.3bn.A study by Harrison Lovegrove, the UK-based corporate advisers, and John S Herold, the US research firm, found that executives were willing to pay 54 per cent more in North America, betting that high oil and gas prices were here to stay.Part of the reason is desperation and a wad of cash. Big oil companies have had trouble finding new oil and gas reserves through exploration because many of the world’s remaining reserves lie in countries unwilling to open them to foreign investment. In the meantime, however, the $70 oil price has swelled war chests. ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest energy group, has $30bn-$40bn at its disposal.But Exxon and the world’s other huge international oil companies are unable to use that money to buy each other because of regulatory hurdles. Mid-size energy groups without large numbers of petrol stations, pipelines and refineries, often the cause of regulatory scrutiny, are easier targets. Size has made companies such as Devon and Anadarko vulnerable: they are too big for modest drilling success to deliver good growth results, but too small to compete with huge national oil companies or to venture into challenging new terrain.But buying a mid-tier company does not solve some of the most serious challenges that energy companies face. Shortages of equipment, especially drilling rigs, and labour, particularly engineers, have helped push companies’ capital expenditure up 66 per cent since 2002 even though the money is going to producing 30 per cent fewer barrels, analysts at Deutsche Bank calculate.This new reality is showing up in share prices. Oil prices have jumped from $55 to $68 a barrel in the past year, but the share price of Exxon has not budged from $57. “Returns are under steep pressure as taxes and costs spiral higher, and competition in the remaining non-governmental opportunities eats away at remaining returns,” Deutsche Bank said in a recent report.As the cost of the US mid-tier companies rises with each acquisition, the next company to buy one will be placing an even bigger, bolder bet than Anadarko."
90;HES;Hess Corp;2006-01-06T10:31:48Z;BP and Libya in talks over gas project;;BP has entered into negotiations with Libya over a multi-billion dollar natural gas exploration and development deal, as the former pariah state opens up more aggressively to international oil investment.Industry insiders say the BP negotiations are at an early stage and involve a liquefied natural gas project that could supply the North American or European markets. BP confirmed it was in talks with Libya but declined to discuss details.“We are continuing to look for opportunities in Libya and when we have a substantive agreement we hope to be able to announce it,” the company said.Libya’s oil and gas sector was opened up for wider foreign investment after the crisis caused by the 1988 Lockerbie bombing was resolved and UN sanctions lifted. US businesses were also allowed to return to Libya in 2004, after the country agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme.The BP negotiations follow a similar deal struck with Libya by Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group, in May last year. Shell is exploring for gas in the Sirte Basin, where BP held assets before they were nationalised in the 1970s. Under its deal, Shell will also revamp a liquefaction plant in Libya and sell the LNG in the US and Europe.US companies have also been returning to the Libyan market, where they held oil production concessions that had to be surrendered to Libya in 1986 following a US bombing campaign. Conoco-Phillips, Marathon Oil and Amerada Hess last month agreed to pay Libya $1.8bn to reclaim assets in the Oasis Group following months of difficult negotiations.Last month, ExxonMobil signed an agreement with Libya to begin exploring offshore for oil and gas and will shortly begin to gather seismic data in the Cyrenaica Basin. The largest publicly-traded oil company opened an office in Tripoli for the first time in more than two decades. Analysts said any deal with Libya would be positive for BP, which is looking to further expand its LNG business. However, any deal could take many months to come to fruition and the Libyan authorities are understood to be driving a hard bargain.“From a BP perspective, Libya would provide additional supply to their portfolio and could go into some combination of the US, UK, Spain and possibly even Italy in the future,” said Frank Harris, LNG analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultants. BP is proposing to build two new terminals to receive LNG in the US and already has capacity at a terminal at Cove Point, Maryland. However, Mr Harris cautioned that BP and other companies exploring in Libya would have to find large enough gas deposits to feed an LNG plant.
91;HES;Hess Corp;2005-10-20T20:35:10Z;US stocks slide as inflation fears persist;;Wall Street fell sharply on Thursday as worries over rising inflation and interest rates once again hung over the market.A slide in oil and natural gas prices off the back of rising inventories caused a major sell-off in energy stocks, with the Amex oil index slumping 4.7 per cent.Conoco Phillips fell 6.2 per cent to $57.75, Amerada Hess lost 5.3 per cent $112.75, Chevron slid 4.4 per cent to $55.75 and Exxon Mobil gave up 3.3 per cent at $55.26.A wider-ranging sell-off was sparked by the release of the Philadelphia Fed index, which showed both the prices paid by manufacturers’ for materials and the prices received for finished goods rose at their fastest pace for 25 years this month.“We have continued to have Fed speakers talk about interest rates going higher and the prices paid component [of the Philly Fed] was awful, as bad as we have seen since 1980,” said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management.“The last place people had profits was oil shares and we have now seen them pulling out. We are entering the capitulation stage.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 133.03 points, or 1.3 per cent, at 10,281.10, with the wider S&P 500 falling 17.95 points, or 1.5 per cent, at 1,177.81 and the Nasdaq Composite losing 23.13 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 2,068.11.In spite of falling oil prices, the Amex airline index also slumped 5.8 per cent. JetBlue fell 7.6 per cent to $18.05 as Standard & Poor’s cut its credit rating, citing an expected full-year-loss on the back of high energy prices.Denver-based Frontier Airlines dropped 28.6 per cent to $7.68 as rival Southwest Airlines said it would start a service from Denver in 2006.Elsewhere, earnings dominated. Drugs company Pfizer was among blue-chips to disappoint, reporting that third-quarter earnings fell 52 per cent due to acquisition-related charges. Its shares fell 8.6 per cent to $21.90.Online auction site eBay slid 6.8 per cent to $39.15 in spite of reporting a 40 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings. The market was disappointed by eBay’s fourth-quarter earnings forecast, which was dragged lower by acquisition costs.West Pharmaceutical Services was punished by the market for raising third-quarter earnings to 24 cents a share, compared with forecasts of 33 cents, as gross margins fell. The shares lost 14.5 per cent at $23.43.But Coca-Cola rose 0.7 per cent to $42.10 as it beat analyst expectations by posting third-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share. And network equipment maker Juniper Networks firmed 3.6 per cent to $22.79 as third-quarter earnings leapt 72 per cent on strong sales of routers.
92;HES;Hess Corp;2005-10-17T17:11:48Z;Uncertainty as Brazil starts oil licence auction;;"The Brazilian government is hoping to attract the interest of international and domestic oil companies as it begins an auction process for licences to drill for oil and gas, to run until Wednesday.This is the seventh annual round of auctions to open the oil industry to the private sector and the dominance of Petrobras, controlled oil group.However, critics say that under the present government, since 2003, Petrobras has reasserted its grip on the industry and that regulatory uncertainty will deter many potential private investors.The National Petroleum Agency (ANP), runs the auctions, said 114 companies, 24 of them foreign, had registered to take part in the auction. Haroldo Lima, interim director general, said the sale raise more than the R$665.3m (US$295m) raised last year.Some 1,134 licences are on offer, including 697 in areas not yet explored. Many of in areas with potential reserves of natural gas; the others are mostly “mature” areas where the ANP hopes to attract the interest of small to medium-sized, low-cost operators.Foreign companies registered to take part include Amerada Hess, El Paso and Exxon of the US, BG of the UK and Anglo/Dutch group Shell. But other big foreign groups are notable for their absence. Adriano Pires of CGIE, a Rio de Janeiro energy consultancy, blamed the lack of interest on regulatory uncertainty.The ANP’s power to grant licences had been handed to the energy ministry, he said, and its budget cut. “Everybody knows the ANP has been weakened while Petrobras has been strengthened,” he said."
93;HES;Hess Corp;2005-09-19T20:21:56Z;Wall Street lower despite energy gains;;Oil shares on Wall Street were boosted on Monday by another rise in crude prices and news that Norway’s Norsk Hydro plans to takeover Spinnaker Exploration for $2.5bn in cash.Shares in the Houston-based Spinnaker Exploration shares swelled 31.5 per cent to $64.12 by the close on Monday.Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach & Co, described the premium as “hefty” and said more deals could follow, with the sector ripe for consolidation.The jump was part of a broader advance for energy stocks that saw Amerada Hess put on 4.3 per cent to $139.31 after JP Morgan’s Jennifer Rowland upgraded the stock and raised the sector’s earnings target.Marathon Oil rose 1.8 per cent to $69.19, while ConocoPhillips added 1.6 per cent to $70.24. ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded oil company in the world, was up 1.4 per cent to $64.63 and became the fourth company in the S&P 500 index to reach a market capitalisation of more than $400bn. The energy sector now makes up 10 per cent of the S&P 500, for the first time since 1994.Energy stocks were fired up by a rally in crude futures amid concerns about another hurricane hitting the production capacity in the Gulf of Mexico. In late trading, prices for West Texas Intermediate for October delivery rose more than $4 to $67.39 a barrel as Tropical Storm Rita gathered strength and headed for the Gulf.Airline stocks fell amid concerns about the effects of high fuel prices on an industry plagued by cost pressures. The Amex airline index lost 3.4 per cent as AirTran, the low-cost carrier, gave up 5.7 per cent to $10.43. Continental Airlines was 6.3 per cent off at $10.98.Among other stocks in the news, Nike rose 6.4 per cent to $83.45 after its third-quarter profits beat expectations. Strong sales led to a 32 per cent jump in profits in the quarter for the athletic equipment maker.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 10,555.80, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.6 per cent lower at 1,231.13. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,145.21.However, Art Hogan, chief US analyst at Jefferies, also attributed some of the fall to Friday’s 0.8 per cent rise in the Dow off the back of the expiration of September futures and options contracts. He argued that at least half such moves are typically retraced in the following session.Investors also were awaiting the outcome of a keenly watched meeting on Tuesday of the monetary policy body of the US Federal Reserve. The US central bank is widely expected to raise benchmark interest rates by a quarter point to 3.75 per cent.Mr Cardillo believed most market participants were still expecting a quarter-point hike, and argued that the market had now priced in the likelihood of the Fed holding rates at 3.5 per cent.
94;HES;Hess Corp;2005-09-16T08:20:20Z;Statoil says Arctic gas project is $1.1bn over budget;;Statoil came under pressure on Friday after the Norwegian energy group said the development of a new gas project in the Barents sea was running eight months behind schedule and would be NKr7bn ($1.1bn) over budget.Following a review, the oil and gas group and its partners were told that the Snøhvit licence in the Norwegian Arctic would now need NKr58.3bn of investment, NKr7bn more than initially planned. Gas production is expected to start on June 1 2007 and regular deliveries from December 1 the same year.Statoil said it was working on obtaining alternative gas supplies for its customers in Spain and the US, until Snøhvit comes on stream.However, the news was tempered by an announcement by Russia’s Gazprom on Friday that Statoil had been shortlisted, together with Norsk Hydro, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Total of France, to develop its Shtokman gas project in the Barents Sea. The Russian group said the list would be narrowed down to two or three partners in the next few months.Snøhvit is a key project for the energy group, giving it access to the US market, as well as opening up the Barents sea. Statoil’s partners on the project include: Petoro, Total, Gaz de France, Amerada Hess and RWE-Dea.Statoil blamed the overrun on delayed engineering, quality flaws to modules from Europe that then had to be transferred, failure to assess the full scope of the work and extra work at Melkøya, an island outside Hammerfest in northern Norway where the gas will converted to LNG.“The Snøhvit project has struggled with problems from the outset, mainly because the project was not sufficiently mature when it was sanctioned in 2001,” said Helge Lund, chief executive. “The new review of costs and progress has revealed that control of the project has been insufficient and we have not managed to correct the imbalances in the project quickly enough.”Mr Lund admitted that the work remaining at Melkøya was surprisingly large and he had commissioned an independent review, to take place after the project has been completed, to assess what went wrong. However, he said the project would still be profitable.Under the revised plan, the project will affect Statoil’s production in 2007. Statoil has not changed its 2007 targets though it said it would review the situation in the autumn.
95;HES;Hess Corp;2005-04-27T22:44:09Z;Record profits at Conoco on surging oil price;;"Record oil prices pushed ConocoPhillips' net income 80 per cent higher in the first quarter, enabling the US's third-biggest oil and gas company to pay down debt and pledge to spend $3bn over the next four years to increase refining capacity.ConocoPhillips reported profits of $2.9bn, or $4.10 per share, up from $1.6bn, or $2.33, in the year-earlier period, exceeding the average expectation of analysts of $3.29 a share.ConocoPhillips was the first big US oil and gas company to report, setting the stage for equally strong results from ExxonMobil on Thursday and ChevronTexaco on Friday.""A favourable commodity price environment contributed to strong earnings, cash flows and continued debt reduction this quarter,"" said Jim Mulva, ConocoPhillips' chairman and chief executive. He said the company would have fared even better had it not been for costly maintenance in several countries.Nonetheless, profits were strong enough to enable ConocoPhillips to reduce debt by $1bn in the quarter, leaving $14bn, and improve its debt-to-capital ratio from 26 per cent to 23 per cent.ConocoPhillips generated $4.1bn in cash from operations and spent $1.8bn on capital projects and investments, including the purchase of an additional 1.3 per cent of Russia's Lukoil. It also increased its dividend by 24 per cent and continued to buy back shares.Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank considered it an overall good result, but warned that ConocoPhillips was exposed to political risk in Venezuela. However, he added: ""Risk is well priced in a good play on this consistently strong environment.""In the all-important exploration and production segment, ConocoPhillips reported income of $1.8bn, up from $1.3bn last year. It attributed the improved results primarily to higher crude oil prices.Its refining and marketing division reported income of $700m, up from $464m a year earlier. ConocoPhillips attributed the improvement to increased worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower worldwide marketing margins, reduced volumes and higher turnround and utility costs.The Houston-based company said its stake in Lukoil, its high-profile Russian investment, produced first-quarter income of $110m, up from $74m in the previous quarter because of higher prices and ConocoPhillips' increased equity ownership position, which was up to 11.3 per cent.Mr Mulva expects full-year daily production to be about 3 per cent higher than that produced in 2004."
96;HES;Hess Corp;2005-01-31T23:54:10Z;Libyan PM woos big oil companies;;Libya hopes to entice the losers in last week's landmark oil exploration auction back to the bargaining table by offering 40 new permits next month, Shukri Mohamed Ghanem, the Libyan prime minister, said on Monday.ChevronTexaco was the only large listed oil company to emerge with an exploration licence in last week's permit auction, the first since US economic sanctions were lifted last year.Mr Ghanem said executives from the Libya National Oil Corporation were working on the auction of a further 40 licences, expected to be launched in the next two months. “We hope [the major listed oil companies] are all successful next time,” said Mr Ghanem, who was in Vienna attending the policy meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.The opening of Libya's oil and gas sector to greater foreign investment has been swift since the US lifted sanctions last year after Libya paid compensation to the families of those killed in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and a made a commitment to end its development of weapons of mass destruction.Several big international companies including ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch/Shell and Total, which had been operating in Libya during the 18 years of US economic sanctions against the North African country, did not win any licences under the latest auction. New permits were awarded mainly to US companies, with Occidental Petroleum securing nine licences. Mr Ghanem denied any bias towards US companies, particularly Occidental, which along with Amerada Hess formed the quartet of US companies operating in Libya before they quit the country when President Ronald Reagan imposed sanctions in 1986. “Oxy [Occidental] had the best bids, and the company that has the best bid wins,” he said.The prime minister also said the government was close to signing an agreement with Occidental and the Oasis Group consortium, comprising ConocoPhilips, Marathon Oil and Amerada, about the return of the oil production concessions the US oil companies had surrendered when they left Libya in 1986. “We have an agreement in principle, but there are still a few details to iron out, because we still have to work out such things as compensation to Libya for the money we have spent on maintaining these fields for all this time,” Mr Ghanem said.Oasis production peaked in 1969 at over 1m barrels a day, and declined to 400,000 b/d in 1986 when the concessions were taken over by Libya's National Oil Corporation.Libya's rapid opening of its energy sector is in contrast to its neighbour and fellow Opec member Algeria, which proposed a reform of its energy sector in late 2001 that has yet to be turned into law. T he Algiers government says that situation will change this year with the new hydrocarbon bill that goes before parliament this month. Libya produces about 1.5m b/d and hopes to raise this to 2m b/d by the end of the year, rising to 3m b/d by the end of the decade with the help of increased foreign investment.
97;HES;Hess Corp;2004-12-09T21:46:16Z;US groups eye return to Libya oil exploration;;Libya is in the final stages of selecting eligible bidders for an auction of 15 exploration licences that could mark the return of US oil companies to the country, the oil minister said on Thursday.Fathi Hamed Ben Shatwan said ahead of Friday's meeting in Cairo of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries that there were no longer any restrictions on US companies doing business in Libya.“I think most of the sanctions are lifted. There is no problem buying the equipment now,” Mr Ben Shatwan said. The field of potential bidders for the January auction had been narrowed from 120 oil companies to 63, including the large US oil groups ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco.US companies are looking to return to Libya for the first time since President Ronald Reagan imposed sanctions in 1986.The minister also claimed accord had been reached with the Oasis group of oil companies including ConocoPhilips, Marathon and Amerada Hess that operated in Libya before the US embargo. However, he acknowledged Oasis wanted to change some terms.“Before the Americans left they came to us and said ‘we don't want to leave, but we have to, so what can we do about the fields we have'. So we agreed to a standstill agreement, which means everything is frozen until they are ready to come back,” Mr Ben Shatwan said. “Now they want to change terms and we said no.” He said Oasis wanted to increase its share of profit from the joint venture and to extend the duration of 10-year leases agreed under the standstill arrangement. Oasis declined to comment on the talks. However, executives familiar with the negotiations indicated that Oasis might receive offshore exploration licences in partial compensation for improving the infrastructure of the Waha field in northern Libya, where its original interests lie.Analysts estimate that the current production-sharing agreement would generate a profit of less than $2 a barrel, well below the consortium's required rate of return. However, the companies are understood to have overcome the legal hurdle of having to secure permission from Libya's Boycott of Israel Department, a move that would have put them in violation of US law.As a result of the sanctions, the National Oil Company of Libya was unable to buy spare parts for the US equipment used to pump oil at these fields.This resulted in a sharp reduction in oil output from more than 3m barrels a day in the early 1970s to current output of about 1.7m b/d.Mr Ben Shatwan said Libya planned to increase capacity to 2m b/d by the end of next year, and to 3m b/d by the end of 2010. However, such an ambitious expansion programme would put Libya in conflict with its fellow Opec members, as its current production quota is 1.45m b/d. Libya's plans to boost reserves and production are part of its negotiating position with Opec members to increase its share of the quota system.Mr Ben Shatwan said the quota system was “a problem [which] we will have to sort out in the next three to four years.”
98;HES;Hess Corp;2004-10-27T21:27:51Z;US rejects Opec call to free oil reserves;;The US government on Wednesday rejected calls from the president of Opec to release some of its strategic reserves to help reduce oil prices.Purnomo Yusgiantoro, president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and Indonesia's mines and energy minister, said the organisation had asked the White House to use the 670m-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve to “cool” prices at a time when spare production capacity was running at historically low levels.Mr Purnomo said Opec members had also been asked to increase production “to give a signal to the market that we aren't short of supply”.The White House said there had been no discussions about tapping the reserve. President George W Bush has consistently said the SPR will not be used to “manipulate prices”.US oil executives and analysts also insisted that any release would have no effect on prices because refineries were running at capacity, while the reserves themselves are viewed as uncompetitive. “Clearly there is enough crude in the world,” said one analyst.ConocoPhillips, the largest US oil refiner, said US refinery utilisation rose to 93 per cent in the quarter to September 30, while maintenance on infrastructure was above average levels, expected to continue for another three or four weeks.Amerada Hess, which was active in bidding for part of the 30m-barrel release sanctioned by then President Bill Clinton in 2000, also played down the impact of the SPR. John Hess, chairman and chief executive officer, said the group's main supplies from Venezuela and west Africa were more competitive than SPR crude.Mr Purnomo's request marks a departure from Opec's line at the oil cartel's last policy meeting in September, when ministers said the oil market was adequately supplied and there was no supply crisis.The US reported on Wednesday a larger rise than expected in crude oil inventories, which climbed last week by 2.4m barrels to 283.4m barrels, excluding the SPR. But analysts were more focused on the sixth consecutive weekly fall in distillates, used to make products such as heating oil. Reserves were down 500,000 barrels last week, and are now 14.7 per cent below last year.Households and businesses in western industrialised countries will face increases in their heating bills this winter of up to 40 per cent above the last five years' average as prices soar.The last time families faced such a rise was in the 2000-2001 winter and it led to a sharp drop in consumer confidence, depressing retail sales and hitting the Christmas season. Consumer prices also rose sharply.Official data for the European Union and US show retail prices for heating fuels are now up by between 15 and 40 per cent above the same period last year. Analysts said the trend would continue and could worsen over the winter season, which runs from November to March.“We have entered dangerous territory indeed, when all the consumer can do is pray for a mild winter or, failing that, a global economic slowdown,” the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies said.The US Department of Energy forecasts families in the US northeast will pay around $1,220 for heating oil next winter, an increase of 28 per cent above last winter and 51 per cent above the last six-season average. Families in the Midwest, where natural gas is the main heating fuel, will pay $1,000, a 40 per cent increase above the historical average.In the EU, retail prices for heating oil are up 41 per cent on October last year. In Germany, the largest European heating oil market, prices have increased by 46 per cent. This pushed inflation up to 2.1 per cent this month, the highest in nearly three years.Consumers who have postponed rebuilding winter stocks in the hope of lower prices are now proceeding with purchases, adding to price pressure, the International Energy Agency said.With stocks below historic averages, distributors can hardly meet demand. In Europe, the problem has been exacerbated by the surge in diesel demand this summer, as more diesel cars replace petrol vehicles. This has squeezed production of heating oil.“This could limit the market's ability to boost regional heating oil output and meet a potential demand spike, thereby heightening Europe's growing dependence on distillate imports,” the International Energy Agency warned recently.
99;HES;Hess Corp;2004-10-01T20:51:40Z;Wall St finishes on high after lacklustre quarter;;"If this week's action on Wall Street had been a football match, it would have been decided in overtime after a tedious game filled with more agony than ecstasy.Indices managed to finish the week higher, but that did not become apparent until Friday, when the onset of the fourth quarter and an eagerly awaited easing of crude oil prices brought buyers in from the sidelines.By Friday’s close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 1.1 per cent to 10,193.40 to be up 1.5 per cent for the week. The S&P500 index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,131.24, tacking on 1.9 per cent for the week. The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.4 per cent to 1,942.04 - a two-month high - for a weekly gain of 3.3 per cent.Broadly based buying emerged after markets concluded a paltry quarter in which the Dow lost 3.4 per cent, the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 per cent and the Nasdaq gave up 7.4 per cent.Bulls began the week with battered hopes as a renewed rise in oil prices sent the Dow to its first close below 10,000 in almost six weeks. That sounded the death knell to yet another attempted rally and prompted some market watchers to say that investors of all convictions had become too frustrated and exhausted with the markets to care.However, hope springs eternal on Wall Street and a reason to sell one day becomes a reason to buy the next. Thus, by Tuesday energy and mining stocks led the market higher amid calculations that rising energy and metals prices were a sign of high demand and could help companies in those sectors achieve higher profits.Alcoa rose 4.3 per cent on Tuesday and copper mining group Phelps-Dodge rose 4.8 per cent for the session. Meanwhile energy stocks staged a 1.6 per cent rise paced by a 3 per cent advance in Unocal and a 3.6 per cent rise in Amerada Hess.In another reflection that any news can be good news on Wall Street, Thursday's announcement from Merck that it would withdraw from global markets a blockbuster drug was encouraging because damage was limited to Merck stock, which fell 26.8 per cent, sending the sector sub-index of the S&P 500 3.5 per cent lower.However, shares in Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, rose 1.4 per cent in the same session and market activity was described as ""orderly"" outside trading in Merck.Nevertheless, comments about listless markets and a lack of conviction continued throughout the week, market observers attributing the apathy to everything from oil prices to Thursday's presidential debate that had been expected to clarify the positions of the two contenders for the White House in next month's election.In addition, the end of the quarter caused talk of last-minute window-dressing by investment managers trying to improve the structure of their portfolios by shedding laggard stocks and buying outperformers.Throughout the week, the market proved to be one of stocks rather than sectors and broader trends.Orbitz shares on Wednesday surged 31 per cent amid reports Cendant was near a takeover of the fast-growing internet travel site. On the same day Biomira shares rose 35 per cent after federal regulators decided to give fast-track status to the company's application for selling a lung cancer treatment.Airline stocks were again battered by the crude oil spike amid growing concerns about their future with the slow winter months ahead. On Monday Delta Air Lines shares lost 9.5 per cent and Continental lost 5.5 per cent as part of a broad decline in the sector that session. In addition to high fuel costs, the carriers battle languid demand and several of them are under bankruptcy protection.Individual stock action pointed to the downside as well, with Fannie Mae shares losing 4.3 per cent on Thursday after reports that the US justice department had opened an investigation into potential accounting fraud at the government-sponsored housing lender.On a similar note, Tommy Hilfiger shares tumbled 22.9 per cent in the Monday session after the fashion group said it was the subject of a federal inquiry into the commissions it paid a subsidiary."
100;HES;Hess Corp;2004-09-28T20:39:40Z;Wall Street shrugs off $50 crude oil;;"Wall Street on Tuesday displayed its short attention span as stocks rallied undeterred by a crude oil price around $50 per barrel, with traders focused on higher earnings guidance from an industrial equipment maker and the prospect of rising profits from metals and mining companies.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9 per cent at 10,077.40 while the S&P 500 index was 0.6 per cent higher at 1,110.06. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.5 per cent to 1,869.87.William Livesey, senior technical analyst at Cybertrader, said some market indicators had been nearing levels that signalled stocks were oversold and suggested the potential for a rebound. However, he cautioned that one afternoon's action does not make a reliable rally: ""I want to see more upside action before I get excited.""Crude futures closed within a whisker of $50 per barrel amid fears about supply disruptions. While economists point out that oil, in real terms, is far from the highs of the 1970s and early 1980s, equity investors have worried that high energy prices will squeeze corporate profitability and cast a pall on the stock market.However, investors chose to use rising oil prices as a rallying cry to buy oil stocks. The American Stock Exchange oil producers index added 1.6 per cent, paced by a 3 per cent rise to $43.37 in Unocal, alongside Amerada Hess, which added 3.3 per cent to $89.21. Marathon Oil rose 2.6 per cent to $41.52.In addition, a rise in aluminium and other metals prices helped Alcoa shares add 4.3 per cent to $32.70 while copper mining group Phelps-Dodge rose 4.8 per cent to $93.60.Also helping the Dow industrials higher was Caterpillar, which added 3.3 per cent to $76.90, after the leading maker of large-scale industrial equipment raised its full-year revenue outlook citing strong demand.Tuesday's action was greeted with scepticism because a series of rallies year have failed the test of time.In addition to losing steam on a couple of occasions earlier this year, markets have suffered from relatively low volume and market watchers such as Chris Wolfe at JP Morgan Private Bank said there were signs many investors saw the market as fairly valued but had no reason to trade on it.Hugh Whelan, at ING Investment Management, pointed out that implied volatility indices for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ""suggest that the so-called mixed sentiment picture is really a case of investors having low levels of interest and passion about the market …the sideways, slightly downtrending market has simply exhausted both bears and bulls"".Dell Computer shares rose 1.1 per cent to $35.45 after the computer maker said it stood by its previous earnings guidance. The news flew in the face of recent concerns about the outlook for technology spending and tepid demand for new equipment.Hewlett-Packard, whose results and ability to compete with Dell have caused concern, saw its shares ease 0.9 per cent to $18.24.Solectron shares added 2.9 per cent to $5 ahead of the contract manufacturer's quarterly earnings report due after the close.Pepsi Bottling Group shares added 0.3 per cent to $26.68 after the largest bottler of Pepsi soft drinks reported rising quarterly sales and increased its full-year earnings estimates. Pepsico shares rose 0.2 per cent to $48.10.The news contrasted with recent reports from Coca-Cola Enterprises, the leading Coke bottler, whose shares suffered after it said slowing sales would hurt earnings. Yesterday, CCE shares were 0.4 per cent off at $18.96 after Coca-Cola said it would revise a profit-sharing agreement with its largest bottler. Coca-Cola shares inched up 0.9 per cent to $39.99.In the pharmaceuticals sector, the shares of Atherogenics surged 64.1 per cent to $38 after the company said its anti-inflammatory agent produced good results in trials."
