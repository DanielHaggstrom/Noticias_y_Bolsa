0;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US insurer Hartford to buy rival Navigators in $2.1bn deal;Acquisition marks the latest stage in consolidation in specialist insurance market;US insurer The Hartford is to buy smaller rival Navigators in a $2.1bn deal that marks the latest stage in consolidation in the specialist insurance market.The Hartford will pay $70 per share in cash for Nasdaq-listed Navigators, a 19 per cent premium to the 90-day average share price but just under a tenth higher than Tuesday’s closing price.Navigators, which was founded in 1974, offers a range of specialist policies from marine and transport to professional liability and energy.Already this year AIG has bought Validus for $5.6bn and France’s Axa has bought Bermuda-based XL Group for $15bn.Specialist insurers have been under pressure as falling prices and high claims costs from natural catastrophes have hit returns.Christopher Swift, The Hartford’s chief executive, said that the deal “expands our product offerings and geographic reach, and adds tenured and proven underwriting and industry talent while strengthening our value proposition to agents and customers.”He added: “We are optimistic about our combined growth opportunities and expect the acquisition to generate attractive returns.”Both companies are based in the US state of Connecticut, and The Hartford said it expects “modest expense efficiencies”.The Hartford, which will fund the deal from existing resources, expects the acquisition to increase 2020 net income by between $30m and $75m. It said that adding Navigator’s revenues will propel it from number nine in the US commercial insurance market to number seven.It will also give The Hartford a presence at Lloyd’s of London, where Navigators has a syndicate.The deal contains a “go shop” clause, which allows Navigators to spend the next 30 days looking for better offers.The Hartford has been reshaping its business over the past 12 months. In December last year it sold a $100bn book of life insurance business called Talcott to Atlas Merchant Capital, Bob Diamond’s investment vehicle, for $2bn.Redeploying excess capital has been one of its main financial goals for 2018.The Hartford’s shares slipped 4 per cent on news of the latest deal, while Navigators rose 9 per cent to $70.The Hartford was advised by Citigroup and Deutsche Bank. Navigators was advised by Goldman Sachs and Moelis.
1;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2018-05-10T19:53:10Z;Axa Equitable: variable winds;Hard to imagine two worse financial services businesses to be in;It is going to take more than absconding to Tennessee to appeal to US IPO investors. On Thursday, Axa SA listed its US unit, Axa Equitable Holdings, raising $2.75bn in the largest American initial public offering of the year. Regrettably, that was a billion dollars lighter than Axa had initially forecast. Two of Axa Equitable’s largest businesses have sharply fallen out of favour in recent years: active asset management, in the form of its subsidiary AllianceBernstein, and retail life insurance products.AllianceBernstein has responded to the seismic shift towards passive investing by recently deciding to move much of its staff to Nashville. The proceeds of Thursday’s IPO all go to the parent Axa as it looks to fund its $15bn buyout of property and casualty insurer XL Group. Axa has other priorities than its US businesses. And so do American IPO investors it seems.Axa Equitable is one of the largest sellers of variable annuities. These are retirement products that large traditional insurers have been exiting since the financial crisis, due to their relatively high capital requirements and volatility in returns. The likes of Voya and The Hartford got out of this business last year. MetLife spun off its retail business now called Brighthouse Financial. Its shares are down a third since last summer. Variable annuity businesses are increasingly in the hands of private equity and the like. Blackstone and Apollo are willing to apply more aggressive investing techniques to generate returns.On Thursday, Axa Equitable traded down slightly even after sharply discounting its IPO price. Its price to book value is a desultory 0.7, betraying the level of investor unease. Its market capitalisation is just over $10bn and there could be more creative and lucrative ways to unlock the value of both units of Axa Equitable. Axa SA shareholders must wonder, however, if the company could have waited for a more opportune moment for the IPO instead of selling into a deeply sceptical market. A fair question to ponder on the long drive down South.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.

They are backed by equity investments, which can give stock market-like returns, but also offer lifetime guarantees, protecting policyholders against heavy losses.The contracts can be complex and hard for providers to manage. Several companies have closed or scaled back their variable annuities operations after running into difficulties during the financial crisis.The Hartford was one of the insurers hardest hit by the 2008 market crash in part because of its exposure to variable annuities. It received $3.4bn in government bailout funds but went on to repay them. The group stopped selling new variable annuities and created Talcott as a repository for the outstanding policies.The Hartford’s chief executive, Christopher Swift, said: “After a thorough and robust process, we concluded that this transaction is the best path forward. It will complete our exit from the run-off life and annuity businesses and strengthen our focus on growing our market-leading property and casualty, group benefits and mutual funds businesses.”Mr Diamond teamed up with former JC Flowers executive David Schamis to set up Atlas Merchant in 2013 after he had left Barclays. It has completed a string of deals, most recently paying £16m for UK stock broker Panmure Gordon in July this year.Talcott is not its first foray into the insurance world. Last year Atlas Merchant put money into Somerset Reinsurance, a Bermuda-based life reinsurer.As in that deal, Atlas Merchant has teamed up with others to buy Talcott. Its partners on the Talcott deal are TRB Advisors, Pine Brook Capital, Cornell Capital, Global Atlantic and J Safra. The Hartford will also retain a 10 per cent stake in the business.Talcott has been on the block for much of the year but the complex deal has taken time to complete. The $2bn it will receive on the sale comprises $1.4bn cash, as well as a dividend and the stake in the buying company.The Hartford will record a $3.2bn post-tax loss on the deal.JPMorgan advised The Hartford. Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Atlas Merchant.The disposal leaves The Hartford, whose history stretches back to 1810, focused on property casualty insurance and employee benefits.It is the latest dealing involving the number six US insurer by assets. In October, the Connecticut company agreed to pay Aetna, the health insurer, $1.45bn for an employee benefits business.Uncertainty over new “fiduciary” retirement standards have hit new variable annuity sales across the industry. About $105bn worth were sold last year, down from $158bn five years earlier, according to the financial services trade association LIMRA.
3;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2017-12-04T12:45:32Z;Bob Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital inks biggest ever deal;;Ex-Barclays chief Bob Diamond’s private equity group has signed its biggest ever deal, buying a $100bn book of US life insurance business.Atlas Merchant Capital has teamed up with a group of investors including Pine Brook, Cornell Capital, Global Atlantic and J Safra to buy Talcott Resolution, an annuity business, from US insurer The Hartford for just over $2bn.Talcott — which has over 600,000 customers and $100bn of liabilities, mostly in variable annuities — was created as a repository for historic products after The Hartford’s exposure to variable annuities hit it hard during the 2008 market crash, contributing to the need for a $3.4bn government bailout.Contracts for variable annuities can be complex and hard for providers to manage, and several companies — including The Hartford — have closed or scaled back their variable annuity operations after running into difficulties during the financial crisis.Variable annuities are tax-advantaged retirement savings products in the US.

4;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Hartford to buy Aetna’s US group life, disability unit for $1.45bn;;Hartford Financial Services on Monday said it has agreed to pay $1.45bn in cash for Aetna’s arm that provides life and disability insurance in the US.Aetna’s group life and disability insurance unit had premiums of $2bn last year.The acquisition will be funded by dividends from Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries and holding company resources, including the $273m remaining under its share buyback programme.“The transaction provides a unique and accretive opportunity for The Hartford to become the second largest group life and disability insurer, an important business for The Hartford with a stable risk profile, attractive returns and strong long-term growth prospects,” said Hartford CEO Christopher Swift.The deal is also expected to boost Hartford’s digital and technology strategy and expand its distribution. The majority of Aetna Group Insurance employees are expected to be transferred to Hartford.The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in early November and is expected to add to Hartford’s earnings in 2018.
5;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2017-01-03T18:39:45Z;Berkshire takes on $1.5bn asbestos risk from Hartford;Insurers face liability from cancer-causing substance decades after writing policies;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is to take on as much as $1.5bn of asbestos risk from US insurer Hartford Financial Services, the latest sign the cancer-causing substance is still a problem for the sector decades after the policies were written.Exposure to asbestos, whose fibres can cause diseases such as mesothelioma, already ranks among the largest causes of losses for insurers and reinsurers.However, executives are concerned costs will continue to prove higher than expected as improved life expectancy puts insurers on the hook for longer — even though it is decades since the use of asbestos in construction was phased out.Hartford has agreed to pay a premium of $650m for the reinsurance from National Indemnity, a subsidiary of Berkshire. The deal will reduce Hartford’s fourth quarter after-tax profits by $423m.The Hartford transaction follows a series of similar deals struck by Berkshire, which has by far the greatest exposure to asbestos in the sector. Such deals are an important part of its business model.$64bnPaid out by insurance industry in claimsBerkshire reinsured Equitas — the vehicle set up to take on liabilities that nearly brought down the Lloyd’s of London market — as well as the US insurers AIG, Liberty Mutual and CNA Financial.The latest transaction comes a month after the insurance credit rating agency AM Best warned that insurers faced an additional $15bn of losses from asbestos in the coming years.The industry has paid out about $64bn in claims and set aside $21bn in reserve. That would bring the total forecast bill to about $100bn.Beth Bombara, Hartford’s chief financial officer, said the insurer’s asbestos exposure had created “uncertainty for investors and others about the ultimate cost of these policy liabilities”. Most of the policies had been underwritten before 1985, she added. “This agreement reduces uncertainty about potential adverse development.”$21bnHeld in reserve by insurance industry agains future claimsHartford struck a deal last year to sell about $1bn in UK assets — mainly comprising asbestos and environmental policies sold before 1993 — to Catalina.The insurer, which is more than 200 years old, has overhauled its operations in recent years to focus on property-casualty cover, as well as group benefits and mutual funds. It turned to sold a UK variable annuity business to Berkshire in 2013.National Indemnity will provides up to $1.5bn of reinsurance for “adverse net loss reserve development” above estimated net loss reserves of $1.7bn. Hartford will continue to handle the claims.
6;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2016-07-29T14:27:30Z;Hartford tumbles after sharp profits drop;;Shares in Hartford Financial Services fell 11 per cent on Friday after the US insurer’s profits dropped almost half.The fifth largest listed US insurer by assets produced net income of $216m in the second quarter, 48 per cent less than a year ago, reports Alistair Gray in New York.The results from the Hartford, which sells mutual funds as well as property and casualty insurance and group benefit policies, are the latest sign of a squeeze on the industry’s profits. Returns are being hurt by pressure on premium income and rock bottom interest rates, which are reducing returns on insurers’ bond-dominated investment portfolios.“Competition is increasingly aggressive and we continue to feel pressure on investment income due to lower interest rates,” said Christopher Swift, chairman and chief executive.A string of catastrophes in recent months, including wildfires in Canada and US hail storms, have added to the pressure on non-life insurers. Claims from mesothelioma sufferers, and weaker returns from private equity and property investments, also hit the Hartford’s earnings.The Connecticut-based company has a market capitalisation of $15.6bn and employs about 17,400 people.
7;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2013-04-18T16:16:09Z;Banks tap US debt markets as yields drop;;A flurry of bank bonds has hit the US debt capital markets in the past couple of days as the nation’s largest lenders take advantage of a recent decline in benchmark borrowing costs and demand for high-grade securities.Wells Fargo, Hartford Financial Services, First Republic Bank and JPMorgan Chase were some of the latest financial institutions to raise funds, pushing total sales of bank debt to almost $15bn so far this month, according to Dealogic.Volumes are likely to rise by the end of the week as others, including Goldman Sachs and Canada’s Bank of Nova Scotia, were expected to sell debt by the end of Thursday.Tighter spreads, improving balance sheets and steady growth of banks’ loan portfolios were working as “catalysts for increased funding” according to Justin D’Ercole, head of the Americas investment grade syndicate at Barclays.“A series of macro events have come together to contribute to overall better funding conditions for US banks,” he said.Banks and financial groups have been aggressive borrowers so far this year, with total dollar sales approaching the $150bn mark.Large European lenders such as UK’s Standard Chartered and Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo also joined the dollar-sales calendar, but the biggest deal of the year has come from JPMorgan, which offered $6.4bn in three parts in January.A recent drop in US Treasury yields was also contributing to the banks’ rush to lock in funding at lower borrowing costs, analysts said. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note moved back below 1.7 per cent after trading at more than 2 per cent in March.In one deal this week, Wells Fargo completed a $2bn, two-part offering that included $1.15bn of five-year floating-rate notes and an $850m reopening of its 1.5 per cent notes due in 2018. The reopening was sold at lower borrowing costs than when the bank originally placed the notes at the start of the year.For investors, bank debt is appealing as supply is still recovering from a sharp drop in issuance in 2010 and 2011. Mr D’Ercole at Barclays said he expected total sales by investment grade financial institutions to surpass the volume for 2012, when about $300bn in debt was sold.Bank sales were going to account for “a bigger part of the overall issuance calendar in the US than in the past couple of years”, he said.A rally on the securities has sent average yields on the bonds lower. But total returns on the securities at 1.84 per cent in the year so far are still higher than those of average corporate bonds, according to Barclays indices.“Banks’ [bonds] are not nearly as cheap as they were. But because their fundamentals now are better than those of other non-financials, investors are attracted to the sector,” Mr D’Ercole said.
8;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2013-02-10T18:11:47Z;Activists eye new targets in financials;Biggest names in the line of fire;Financial institutions face fresh attention from aggressive activist and hedge fund investors, adding another distraction to a list of troubles that already includes increased regulation and diminished profits.Some of the biggest names in finance are already in the crosshairs.Nelson Peltz, the billionaire co-founder of Trian Fund Management, is agitating for improvement at State Street and the investment bank Lazard, in which he took a stake last year. The investor is also searching for a new chief executive for Legg Mason, the asset manager where he sits on the board.John Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager, last year pressured the Hartford Financial Services Group to sell its life insurance business and refocus on other products.Now a new batch of activist stakes in financial institutions is expected to come to light in the coming months, as annual meetings approach, prompting investors to disclose their stakes with enough time potentially to wage a campaign for board seats.“It has caught some people by surprise,” said Anu Aiyengar, co-head of financial institution M&A at JPMorgan. “Many people thought activists wouldn’t target financial institutions because of regulatory requirements. But this has been a bit of a wake-up call. No sector is immune.”Already this year, Dan Loeb has taken a stake in Morgan Stanley with his Third Point hedge fund. Mr Loeb has taken a passive stance so far, saying he expects the stock to double as margins improve.Mr Loeb’s stance reflects some of the challenges facing activist investors considering stakes in financial institutions. At the World Economic Forum last week Paul Singer, the head of Elliot Associates, the hedge fund, said the unfathomable nature of banks’ public accounts made it impossible to know which were “actually risky or sound”.“It’s very hard for activists to do something at a depository institution because of the regulatory oversight”, said the head of one large activist fund. He said that “90 per cent of the returns come from the company, not the activist”.An adviser to several large financial institutions said that regulators will tend to protect management and boards, making it difficult for activists to install new leadership teams.Despite these challenges, financial institutions are now on the list of companies being considered as targets by activists and aggressive hedge funds.Activists said that beyond asset management and depository banks, there is still a very wide circle of companies connected to finance: for instance McGraw-Hill, owner of the Standard & Poor’s rating agency that was encouraged to split last year by Jana Partners, the activist hedge fund.“Financial institutions don’t make easy targets,” said Bruce Goldfarb of Okapi Partners, a proxy solicitation firm. “They’re highly regulated and have broad shareholder bases. But it doesn’t mean they’re immune from shareholders who have opinions on how to enhance value.”
9;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Sun Life sells US annuities business;;Sun Life Financial has become the latest life assurer to walk away from US annuities, agreeing to sell its business in the country for about $1.35bn in cash to backers of Guggenheim Partners.The sale of the business, which has been hurt by persistently low interest rates, is Sun Life’s first big deal since Dean Connor became chief executive of the Canadian life assurer a year ago.Shareholders in Guggenheim, the privately owned financial services group and asset manager, have set up a new company, called Delaware Life, to buy the Sun Life assets, which guarantees financial returns to policyholders. They are paying 1.2 times book value.Weak investment returns have prompted several US life assurers – including Hartford Financial Services and Genworth – to scale back their annuities operations.Private equity houses and investment managers have been eyeing acquisitions of such assets to boost funds under management and diversify their businesses.Guggenheim, along with other parties including Apollo, has also been holding exclusive talks with the UK insurer Aviva about a deal to buy its US business, people familiar with the matter said.Bankers said a deal may be announced within days.Guggenheim will provide investment management for the Sun Life business. Todd Boehly, president of Guggenheim, said Delaware Life planned to build on the assets’ “impressive platform”.Sun Life said it would use the cash raised from the sale to support its dividend and expand its operations elsewhere – particularly in Asia, where the Toronto-listed company has been considering acquisitions.“This transaction represents a transformational change for Sun Life,” said Mr Connor. “It significantly advances our strategy of reducing Sun Life’s risk profile and earnings volatility.”Sun Life shares fell 3.92 per cent to $26.74 in Toronto. The Canadian group estimated the sale would reduce earnings by about 22 cents a share next year.The disposal of the annuities business, whose net operating income swung from losses of US$461m in the fourth quarter of 2011 to profits of $325m in the first quarter of this year, is subject to regulatory approval.The company still has a back book of life assurance business in the US, which it has deemed “non-core”, as well as an employee benefits business and an asset manager. Sun Life earlier this year called off a prospective sale of its UK arm.Barclays advised the Guggenheim shareholders and Morgan Stanley advised Sun Life, which said it expected to complete the disposal by the end of June.
11;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2012-07-31T23:52:42Z;AIG buys advisory group from Hartford;;American International Group, the insurer bailed out by the US government at the height of the financial crisis, is buying a network of financial advisers from its rival Hartford Financial for up to $90m.The purchase of Woodbury Financial Services, one of AIG’s largest acquisitions since its 2008 bailout, will increase the number of financial advisers at AIG’s life insurance arm, SunAmerica, by more than a quarter from 4,800 to 6,200.It comes amid signs of growing confidence at AIG, which has repaid most of the $182bn in taxpayer support extended in 2008, although the Treasury continues to own a majority stake in the company. AIG has been looking to invest in US mortgages and to gain market share in retirement products such as the variable annuities sold by Woodbury’s advisers.“Adding Woodbury Financial to our Advisor Group network sends a clear message that we are absolutely committed to the independent financial adviser business model,” said Larry Roth, chief executive of Advisor Group, the umbrella business for AIG’s three existing financial adviser networks.Hartford has been looking to sell Woodbury since it bowed to shareholder pressure in March to focus on its property and casualty business. As well as putting Woodbury up for sale, Hartford stopped selling annuities, which provide retirees with an annual income, because of the amount of capital insurers are required to set aside against losses on the products.AIG, which was a relatively small player in retirement products before the financial crisis, has been pushing sales of annuities this year.Joshua Stirling, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein said: “AIG has the good fortune of being able to take market share in retirement products when the legacy providers who dominated the market before the financial crisis are retreating.”“This purchase of Woodbury fits with that strategy, and the purchase price is really not a large amount of money for AIG,” he added.Hartford will receive up to $115m from the deal, including a one-off $25m dividend to be paid by Woodbury before the deal closes and the sale price of up to $90m from AIG. However, AIG could pay as little as $37.5m, depending on the performance of the Woodbury business between now and the close of the deal.The Treasury began unwinding its stake in AIG by selling shares to the public last year, but the US government continues to own more than 60 per cent of the company. Despite the government stake, AIG has been able to make other purchases, including the Japanese insurer Fuji Fire and Marine last year. It has also bought back shares from the Treasury and established a programme to buy back publicly traded shares.
12;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2012-05-31T16:08:15Z;European insurers rethink US strategy;;"They entered the US to offer savings and investment products to the millions of baby boomers approaching retirement.However, after a decades-long effort to break America, some of Europe’s biggest life assurers are rethinking their strategy in the face of regulatory concerns and highly competitive market conditions.“Many came to the US market because it is ‘big’ – which is not necessarily the best reason,” says Spencer Horgan, insurance analyst at Deutsche Bank.The latest sign of a shifting landscape came on Thursday when Swiss Re disposed of its capital-intensive US closed life assurance business for $600m, to Prudential-owned Jackson National Life Insurance, saying it saw “attractive growth potential in the UK and continental Europe”.At least one European insurer, Aviva, has been considering plans to quit the US. Analysts estimate that Aviva USA would fetch only about half the $2bn the FTSE 100 group paid for the business six years ago.Others have been writing substantially less new business in the country. Axa of France wrote €136m of new business in the US last year, down two-thirds since 2007. That compares with a group-wide fall in new business of about a fifth during the same period.Regulation threatens to make life even tougher.The UK’s Prudential has warned that Brussels’ forthcoming capital requirements for EU-based insurers could make it impossible for its American arm to compete with domestic peers.Any retreat by the Europeans would come after an aggressive, often acquisition-led, advance into the world’s biggest insurance market by premiums.The Pru acted early by purchasing Jackson one of the largest US life assurance groups, for £406m in 1986. Since 1995 there have been 22 acquisitions of US insurers by western European companies with a transaction value of more than $1bn, Bloomberg data show. By contrast, US groups have been far less eager to expand in Europe, with only six such deals in the other direction.European insurers are important in the US retirement market: five of the 20 biggest annuity providers in the US by sales are owned by European groups, according to data from Limra, the trade body.Several European insurers garner chunky proportions of sales from the US. For example, the US business of Aegon accounts for 63 per cent of the Dutch group’s capital expenditure. Aegon paid $10.9bn in
1999 for Transamerica.But to underscore the difficulties in the US market, MetLife, the S&P 500 insurer, said last week it would scale back its variable annuities business.Variable annuities are among the potentially most problematic products. They tend to offer minimum guaranteed returns to consumers even though the portfolios can invest in equities as well as in less volatile fixed income securities.“There are quite a lot of guarantee-type products in US life assurance, which are generally tougher than those offered in Europe,” says Toby Langley, analyst at Barclays.In order to meet such guarantees, the insurers involved usually attempt to hedge their exposure to the potentially volatile assets – but they have had mixed success in doing so. Sales of such annuities fell 7 per cent to $36.8bn in the first quarter.Metlife’s shift away from the area follows the decision this year by Hartford Financial Services, another S&P 500 insurer, to sell its variable annuities business.Yet rivals argue the retrenchment by others gives them an opportunity. “We’ve come through the crisis without any issues,” says Mike Wells, chief executive of the Pru’s Jackson. “The flight to quality pushes advisers to us.”“Going into the financial crisis there was a perception by competitors that it was sort of a land race. We held our pricing while there was a price war on the guarantees, and the fees on those guarantees.”But for all the difficulties faced by some operators in the US, its sheer size remains a powerful lure.“For European insurance groups with global aspirations it’s seen as very important that they have a strong position in the US,” says Simon Harris, managing director at Moody’s, the rating agency.Although competition can be more intense than in Europe, the economic backdrop is much healthier than European insurers’ domestic markets.“It’s nice to have some exposure to the US at the moment,” says Kevin Molloy, senior vice-president at Axa’s US business. “The macro situation seems to be improving a little bit faster” than in Europe, he says.Mr Wells of the Pru hails the benefits of transatlantic diversification: “The [business] cycles are different and that gives you much more robust, more balanced earnings. That’s not an immaterial issue.”He says the macro trend of ageing baby boomers, which attracted European insurers to the US in the first place, still holds true, adding: “You get about 8,000 to 10,000 of them a day turning 65 right now.”"
13;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;MetLife shifts focus as fears hit shares;;MetLife is moving into accident and health insurance and scaling back its variable annuities business, as its chief executive warned that perceived risks in its investment portfolio were weighing on the company’s share price.The strategic shift comes after shares in the US insurer fell 30 per cent in the past year after it failed Federal Reserve bank stress tests, and investors weigh the possibility that MetLife will be designated a systemically important financial institution (Sifi), resulting in the setting of higher capital requirements.Steven Kandarian, chief executive, said the company would switch to quarterly from annual dividends as part of plans to return more cash to shareholders, once it sheds its bank charter after completing a sale of its deposit taking business to GE Capital.But Mr Kandarian acknowledged the threat of Sifi designation remains a “looming cloud.”Shares were down 3 per cent to $30.20 shortly before midday in New York, which would be their lowest close this year.Metlife’s move into accident and health insurance comes as US insurers shift their focus away from products such as life assurance, where profits depend on long-term investment returns.In the past quarter MetLife was the second largest seller of variable annuities, among the most potentially problematic life assurance products as they tend to offer minimum guaranteed returns to consumers, although the portfolios invest in securities which can lose value.In order to meet such guarantees, the insurers involved often seek to hedge their exposure, although they have had mixed success in doing so, and are under pressure to hold more capital against future investment losses.Hartford Financial Services announced the sale of its variable annuity business this year. Sales of such annuities in the US fell 7 per cent to $36.8bn in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, according to Limra, the research company.“Across the industry we’re seeing companies try and grow reliable income streams and step back from spread businesses, as low-rates and weak equity ­markets weigh on returns and regulators take a worst-case scenario view of their market exposure,” said Josh Stirling, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein.MetLife also announced plans to cut $600m in costs, to increase emerging markets’ share of earnings to 20 per cent from 14 per cent and to improve its return on equity to between 12 per cent and 14 per cent from 10.3 per cent last year, all by 2016.
14;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2012-04-02T21:06:38Z;Groupon shares sink on revenue revisions;;Shares in Groupon sunk by nearly 17 per cent on Monday as investors reacted to a restatement of revenue figures by the offers website as well as the company’s admission of “material weakness” in its internal controls.Revenues for the largest online offers website by sales were lowered $14.3m to $492.2m, the company said late on Friday after trading. Groupon blamed the revision, which wiped out its operating profits for the final months of last year, on its failure to account properly for the increased likelihood of customers seeking refunds in its newest markets.Analysts were mixed in assessing the impact the restatement would have on its shares, which are trading almost 25 per cent below their initial public offer price of $20.“We do not view the restated financials and internal process weakness as indications of fundamental softening in Groupon’s model, as indicated in the [first quarter 2012] guidance affirmation,” said Doug Anmuth, analyst at JPMorgan.“Instead we believe they reflect Groupon’s dynamic deal mix and the company’s extremely rapid growth in a very short amount of time,” Mr Anmuth added, while reducing his price target for the company’s shares to $22 from $24, but maintaining his “hold” rating.Justin Post, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said Groupon has been his team’s most disappointing call of 2012. “While we remain constructive on the local deals opportunity, and we see this accrual change as an estimation mistake in an evolving hard-to-predict business, it should take several quarters for Groupon to gain investor confidence,” he said, downgrading the company from “buy” to “hold” and lowering its price target from $30 to $20.Shares in Groupon finished down 16.9 per cent to $15.28 and have fallen by more than 26 per cent in the year to date.Avon, the door-to-door cosmetics seller, rose 17.3 per cent to $22.70 as it rejected a $10bn cash bid from Coty, the privately owned fragrance group.Avon rebuffed the latest Coty proposal one hour after the fragrance group made the bid offer public. Avon said the proposal undervalued it and that it was “substantially the same as” an offer made two weeks ago, which it had also rejected.Shares in the cosmetics group are now up by more than 30 per cent in the year to date.After a negative start to the day, the S&P 500 climbed 0.7 per cent to 1,418.90 and reached cyclical highs yet again, as the first session of the second quarter commenced.The benchmark index was buoyed by US manufacturing data that showed growth picked up in March on stronger hiring and production.The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.4 in March from the February reading of 52.4, beating economist estimates of 53. Readings above 50 indicate growth in the sector. Elsewhere, the commerce department said construction spending unexpectedly dropped by the most in seven months despite the unseasonably warm weather.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 13,264.49, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.9 per cent at 3,119.70.Express Scripts, the health benefits manager, climbed 2.4 per cent to $55.50 as the Federal Trade Commission approved its merger with rival Medco Health Solutions. The takeover bid was valued at $29.1bn. If the deal is completed, it would create the biggest manager of prescription-drug benefits for corporate and government clients.Shares in Medco were down 1 per cent to $71.85, having risen nearly 30 per cent in the year to date.Lions Gate Entertainment, producer of the television series Mad Men, fell 4.5 per cent to $13.30 as the company’s latest blockbuster, Hunger Games, dominated box office returns for a second consecutive weekend, grossing $61.1m in ticket sales. The movie has generated more than $250m in the US and Canada in its first 10 days of release.Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, added 3.2 per cent to $618.63 as a report said one analyst at Topeka Capital had set a price target of $1,001 for its shares, with “no end in sight” to its recent gains.Hartford Financial Services Group, the insurance provider, rose 4.1 per cent to $21.95 as the company said it would repurchase $2.43bn worth of securities it sold to Allianz, the German insurer, during the depths of the financial crisis. Under the terms of the deal, Hartford will replace $1.75bn of debt – yielding 10 per cent – it owes to Allianz with lower yielding new debt.Global Payments, a processor of credit and debit card transactions involving brands such as Visa and MasterCard, fell another 3.7 per cent to $45.74 as it updated markets on the security breach of its system. The processing company said on Sunday up to 1.5m card numbers in North America may have been stolen by hackers.Visa and MasterCard, the world’s largest payment processors, were both up however on Monday, gaining 0.8 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively.
15;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2012-04-01T04:25:53Z;US banks seek to benefit from retirement plans;401(k) assets offer reliable income and a way to achieve sustainable growth;"Three of the four largest US banks by market capitalisation are expanding their retirement divisions via acquisition and by hiring staff as part of their post financial crisis efforts to grow income from the sector.Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are bidding to administer corporate pension plans, known as 401(k) plans, through which 50m American employees invest for retirement.The expansion of their retirement divisions, which typically provide low growth but reliable income streams, is part of a shift in the banking industry landscape. Before 2008, large US banks showed little interest in the low margin activity of pension plan administration, including record keeping and legal compliance.“The retirement business is not as sexy as investment banking or derivatives but the paradigm has changed,” says Kevin Crain, head of institutional retirement at Bank of America. “The administration business offers consistent revenue, profitability and growth, which is the order of the day.”The targets of the banks are Fidelity, Vanguard and Aon Hewitt, which between them administer almost 50 per cent of assets held in 401(k) plans, according to Plan Sponsor, which gathers data from industry participants.Banks have been marketing services directly to companies with some success; JPMorgan, for example, has increased 401(k) assets that it administers by 40 per cent since 2008.However, opportunities for the banks to expand by winning new clients are limited. A Deloitte survey last year found that only 12 per cent of companies with 401(k) plans considered a change in their administrator.Wells Fargo, the only bank among the top five plan administrators by assets according to Plan Sponsor, has instead focused on acquisitions. Assets administered by Wells have risen more than 60 per cent since 2008, thanks largely to the purchase of Wachovia.“We are in a privileged position right now among US banks in terms of having the option to make acquisitions and we are actively looking at more targets,” says John Papadopulos, president of Wells’ retirement division.Hartford, the insurance group, recently put its plan administration business, the 19th largest by assets, up for sale and analysts have forecast further industry consolidation.Bank of America, however, is focused on organic growth, according to Mr Crain. It aims to double the $100bn in 401(k) assets it administers by persuading more of its commercial banking clients to give it their retirement plans.Banks also say that administering 401(k) plans increases opportunities to market other products to plan participants. Wells Fargo says more than a third of the money invested in the 401(k) plans it administers is transferred to the bank’s brokerage unit when account holders retire.Retirement savings, which the Investment Company Institute estimates total $17tn in the US, have become particularly attractive to asset managers since the financial crisis, because they tended to remain invested in the market.Investment banks are also looking to manage more retirement assets. Last month Goldman Sachs acquired Dwight Asset Management, a money manager that specialises in “stable value” strategies, popular with retirement savers."
16;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2012-03-23T01:12:11Z;Manufacturing data weigh on US stocks;;Energy stocks suffered their steepest decline in more than three months as the S&P 500 retreated from the 1,400 threshold and fell for a third straight day on poor manufacturing data from China and Europe.The main market’s energy index was down 2 per cent, its worst drop since December 14, as oil prices dipped on Thursday.Coalminers were among the day’s worst performers as the industry continues to face pressure from the shale gas boom. A warmer winter also meant natural gas inventories rose above their five-year average.Consol Energy, which produced 62.6m tons of coal from 12 sites in the US last year, was the worst performing stock on the main market, down 4.5 per cent to $32.94. Alpha Natural Resources, another coalminer, fell 4 per cent to $16.03.A speech by US President Barack Obama in which he said the government would expedite construction on the Keystone XL pipeline did little to inspire confidence in the sector.Cabot Oil & Gas was the second worst performing stock on the main market, down 6.1 per cent to $31.52Overall, the benchmark US index sank 0.7 per cent to 1,392.78, its lowest point in more than a week.The S&P 500 materials sector had its worst day in more than two weeks, falling 1.6 per cent as commodity prices slid on concerns over global growth.US Steel, the integrated steel producer, was the worst performer among materials, falling 5.8 per cent to $29.47.Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan was the next worst, shedding 3.7 per cent to $38.33. Allegheny Technologies, the speciality metals producer, fell 2.7 per cent to $41.58.“What you had was continued speculation on the depths of the Chinese slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the Chinese data,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Both those factors immediately hit materials.”Creeping fears of a slowdown in the world’s second- largest economy also sent Wall Street’s “fear gauge” up to its highest point since March 9.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, rose by as much as 9.6 per ent before finishing the day up 2.9 per cent to 15.27.Insurance companies and regional banks were the worst performing equities among the S&P 500 financials index, which fell 1.4 per cent, relinquishing its position as the top performing sector for the year so far to information technology.The financials index is now up more than 19.9 per cent since the start of the year while the tech index is slightly ahead, having gained 20 per cent.Hartford Financial Services after pressure from John Paulson, the billionaire investor, caused the insurance company to consider the sale of its life assurance business.Shares in the company, which rose on Wednesday after it revised its forecast earnings above analysts’ expectations, were down 3.3 per cent to $21.30.Overall macro growth fears also caused investors to ignore the latest US economic data that showed the number of first-time unemployment claims falling to its lowest level in four years.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6 per cent to 13,046.14.Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, was the third biggest loser on the blue chip-heavy index, falling 2.4 per cent to $106.44. The company’s shares are down more than 6.3 per cent on the week.McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, fell 1 per cent to $95.80 on news that Jim Skinner, chief executive, will retire at the end of June after more than seven years in the top job.The fast-food chain recorded its strongest year-on-year sales last year since 2006 and is looking to expand its worldwide presence by opening another 1,300 stores this year.Federal Express, the package delivery company, was down 3.5 per cent to $92.50 as it reported a lower profit forecast for the current quarter even though revenues surged in the three months to February.The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent to 3,063.32.Zynga, the social media game developer, was a rare gainer, rising 0.3 per cent to $13.76. The game developer said on Wednesday that it would acquire New York-based smartphone application developer, OMGPOP, for $200m.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the index, fell by 0.5 per cent to below $600 at $599.34 after hitting yet another cyclical high on Thursday. Shares in the iPad and iPhone maker are up almost 48 per cent in the year to date.
17;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Hartford mulls disposals after Paulson campaign;;Hartford Financial Services is considering the sale of its life insurance business in response to pressure from billionaire investor John Paulson who has also urged the group split off its prized property and casualty unit from the rest of its operations.The US insurance group will stop selling new annuity products from next month and is “pursuing sales or other strategic alternatives” for individual life insurance, retirement services and its Woodbury brokerage subsidiary. As a result, the company will focus on its property and casualty, group benefits and mutual fund businesses.The potential sales and wind-down follow a month of unusually public campaigning by Mr Paulson, who wants the property and casualty unit to become a standalone company. Paulson & Co, his hedge fund, is the largest owner of Hartford, with an 8.4 per cent stake.Though Hartford’s plan stopped short of a property and casualty spin-off, Liam McGee, chief executive, told analysts: “We appreciate positive dialogue with shareholders …including Paulson & Co. The plan we outlined this morning is the right path.”Mr Paulson had personally addressed Mr McGee during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in February, calling for “something drastic” to improve the company’s share price performance, and has since advocated a split to analysts and other shareholders.On Wednesday, Mr Paulson responded to the proposal, saying: “We do not believe today’s actions will materially increase [property and casualty] investor interest in The Hartford.”He has argued that too few analysts and investors understand complex insurance businesses and as a result have not seen the full value of Hartford’s “best in class” property and casualty unit.Like other insurers, Hartford has been raising rates and generating profits in commercial and consumer property and casualty. Meanwhile, its life and group insurance units are under pressure from historically low interest rates, which make it difficult to earn a spread between its investments and products such as annuities, which promise payouts over time.Hartford shares rose to reach $23 after the initial announcement, but dropped back to $22.02, up 1.4 per cent, by the closing bell following Mr Paulson’s statement. Mr Paulson has estimated that the company’s share price could be worth as much as $32 if split into two pieces.Mr McGee defended the company’s move, arguing that the remaining business would have a return on equity of 12 to 13 per cent, versus a 5 to 6 per cent return on the businesses to be exited. He has previously told Mr Paulson “there were significant costs” to a split.The question of whether life could stand alone was not settled by the rating agencies. Fitch Ratings maintained its A-minus rating on Hartford’s life units, arguing that they remained supported by the parent company until a sale. But Standard & Poor’s lowered its rating to triple-B minus, citing the “standalone credit characteristic” of the life businesses.Timing may be advantageous for any sales. As US interest rates have risen sharply, life insurance stocks have been outperforming. The Dow Jones US life insurance index is up 17.9 per cent year-to-date, versus a 6.4 per cent rise for the property and casualty index.Hartford has retained Goldman Sachs and Greenhill as advisers, according to people familiar with the matter.
18;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2012-03-21T21:29:49Z;US stocks edge down;;US equities fell for a second straight day as new housing data showed that existing home sales slipped in February, even as homebuilders continued to strengthen their first-quarter gains.The S&P 500, which had opened the morning session positively, finished Wednesday’s session down 0.2 per cent to 1,402.89. The benchmark US index lost further ground from its highest close since May 2008 achieved on Monday.Economists expressed concerns about the housing market recovery with the latest data showing existing home sales fell by 0.9 per cent to 4.59m, just below analysts’ expectations .“As with the report for new home sales earlier in the week, the report for existing home sales, which makes up 93.5 per cent of the overall market, held close to the strongest level since May 2010,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economist at Miller Tabak.“However, the level of activity fails to change our view that any recovery is shallow, rising from a low base with conventional monetary policy failing to overcome the significant restraints hampering the housing market.”But the news did not damp momentum on the S&P 500 homebuilders index, which climbed 0.8 per cent on the day and has gained 34 per cent in the year to date.PulteGroup, one of three homebuilders measured by the index, led its rivals and rose 2 per cent to $9.39.Watson Pharmaceuticals, the maker of generic and brand name drugs, was the leading gainer on the main market.A Reuters report said the company was in talks to buy Actavis Group, a Switzerland-based generic drugmaker, for up to €5.5bn. Shares in Watson gained 8.8 per cent to $63.69.Hartford Financial Services was one of the day’s best performing stocks before settling, as it updated first-quarter projected earnings above analysts’ expectations. Shares in the insurance company rose as much as 7.3 per cent, but finished up just 1.2 per cent to $22.02.The S&P 500 financial service index led all major sectors in the morning session before falling 0.4 per cent to be second worst on the day, ahead of the energy index, which was down 1 per cent.Bank of America was near the top of bank stocks and was flirting with the $10 threshold for much of Wednesday. Shares in the bank climbed 0.1 per cent to $9.82. Morgan Stanley was the worst of the major banks, down 1.7 per cent to $20.06.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, was the biggest loser among the energy stocks and fell 5.8 per cent to $45.04 as it warned first-quarter profits would disappoint.The Nasdaq Composite Index was the only major index on the positive side, rising fractionally to 3,075.32.LinkedIn, the online professional networking site, was among the top gainers on the technology-heavy index.Shares in the company 6.5 per cent to $97.89 after receiving an upgrade from “hold” to “buy” by analysts at Goldman Sachs.“Our checks show increasing traction for LinkedIn’s hiring solutions and improving user engagement that, along with emerging products, suggest a steeper slope to the company’s long-term growth,” Goldman Sachs said in a note.“On a more macro level, we believe LinkedIn is one of the companies best positioned to benefit from growth in mobile usage, given its reliance on subscriptions over advertising.”Oracle, the software company, fell 2.3 per cent to $29.41 despite giving the tech sector a boost as it reported a “very solid” third-quarter in the three months to February 29.Analyst reactions to the company’s results were mixed, however.“The fact is that Oracle is not growing particularly rapidly and, despite an extended discussion to the contrary, the firm is facing a tougher group of competitors,” said Richard David, tech analyst at Canaccord. He reiterated his “hold” rating.Meanwhile, Citigroup analysts described the software company as “back on track” and maintained their “buy” rating on its shares.Micron Technologies, the semiconductor manufacturer, gained 2 per cent to $8.74 as reports said the company had made a $1.5bn bid to acquire Elpida Memory, a Japanese chipmaker.Netflix, the online and home delivery video provider, rose 4.4 per cent to $120.10 as it revealed plans to stream a new original series on its site, beginning in 2013.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,124.62. Hewlett-Packard, the computer and printer maker, was the biggest loser on the blue-chip heavy index.Shares in the company, which said it would combine its PC and printer divisions, fell by 2.2 per cent to $23.46.Walt Disney, the entertainment group that said on Tuesday that it would suffer a $200m loss on its latest film John Carter, rose 0.1 per cent to $43.27.Analysts at Nomura added its shares to their conviction buy list, saying: “We believe the focus will now shift to Disney’s core assets, which we believe are poised for above-peer growth.”
19;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Paulson calls for Hartford split;;John Paulson, the billionaire investor, has taken public his efforts to get The Hartford Financial Services Group to split into two companies.The Hartford, like other insurers, has been under pressure in its life insurance business as interest rates hover near zero, making it difficult to generate the income to cover pay-outs on products like annuities. At the same time, it has participated in an industry-wide increase in pricing in its separate property and casualty business to make up for disaster-related losses last year.However, its stock has underperformed peers. Since the beginning of last year, its shares have fallen 25 per cent, underperforming the KBW Insurance index, which is down 6.1 per cent.Mr Paulson, the largest shareholder in The Hartford with an 8.4 per cent stake, published a letter to the company on Tuesday. He blamed its underperformance on the combination of its two businesses. He said it is too complex for analysts to properly value and that most other insurers have chosen to focus on one or the other business.Mr Paulson wrote of the “dramatic increase in shareholder value to be created by a spinoff” after considering options such as the sale of individual businesses, share buy-backs and offerings of minority stakes. He estimated that it would be worth a combined $32 a share, versus its current price of $19.81.He moved to take his considerations public, contrary to his usual behind-the-scenes mode of operation, after receiving an unsatisfactory response from the company during discussionto s late last year, he wrote. Paulson & Company on Tuesday filed a 13-D statement, which allows it speak to analysts and other shareholders, to US regulators.Liam McGee, Hartford chief executive, told Mr Paulson during an earnings call last week that “there were significant costs to surmount” in a split, and that “we do not believe that splitting them in the current environment …will create shareholder value”.He also said the company had “an incredible sense of urgency on looking at all ideas to create shareholder value” and had hired outside financial advisers.The Hartford also issued a statement in response to the latest move: “We welcome [Mr Paulson’s] views and look forward to continued dialogue with him and other shareholders. We are evaluating the company’s strategy and business portfolio with the goal of delivering shareholder value.”The statement said it recognised potential benefits to a separation, but that there were challenges to successfully executing the move.Mr Paulson’s fund has been building a position in The Hartford since 2009. According to the SEC filing, Paulson & Company has 37.5m shares, currently worth $742m and which it paid $928m to acquire.
20;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-11-11T07:49:16Z;Allianz suffers 80% drop in income;;Allianz insisted it was unworried by the political and financial turmoil in Italy as the insurer, Europe’s largest by market capitalisation, suffered from the impact of the eurozone crisis on its bond investments and corporate holdings.The German group – which considers Italy a “second home market”, according to Oliver Bäte, chief financial officer – has some of the biggest sovereign exposure to Italy of any non-Italian financial institution, with government bonds worth €25.6bn at the end of the third quarter, equal to more than 6 per cent of the company’s €413bn fixed income portfolio.“We believe the market situation is completely overblown,” said Mr Bäte on Friday as Allianz announced an 80 per cent drop in third-quarter net income. “We have strong confidence in [Italy] . . that it will be able to recover its situation and regain stability.”Mr Bäte said Allianz was cutting exposure to government bonds “for those countries where we have a critical perspective …This does not apply to Italy.”Allianz reported gross unrealised losses of more than €2.2bn on its Italian debt, which it will carry forward, although the insurer said the net unrealised loss was €385m. Under accounting rules the positions do not have to be booked as writedowns.However Allianz did make non-operating writedowns of €931m in the third quarter including €198m of further writedowns on the group’s holdings of Greek sovereign debt, which are now written down to below 39 per cent of face value.The greater part of the writedowns were due to losses on equity stakes and investments in several European banks– including Germany’s Commerzbank, Italy’s UniCredit and Banco Popular of Spain – as well as China Pacific Insurance Group and The Hartford, a US insurer.Allianz said non-operating losses on these corporate investments were €817m in the quarter. The biggest slice was €347m as a result of ties to Commerzbank, which acquired Dresdner Bank from Allianz in 2008.Altogether Allianz said it suffered investment losses of €2.6bn in the quarter, which hit the operating result of its life and health insurance segment as well as leading to other non-operating losses across its businesses.Group operating profit was down 7 per cent to €1.9bn. Allianz said it remained on target for its goal of an operating profit of between €7.5bn and €8.5bn this year.Operating profits in life and health insurance fell 20 per cent to €520m. Operating profits were down 1 per cent in general “property and casualty” insurance at €1.1bn while profits from asset management grew 3.1 per cent to €537m.Assets under management grew 10 per cent compared with the same period a year ago to €1,592bn.Allianz reported a virtually unchanged group solvency ratio – a measure of capital strength used by insurers – and said shareholders’ equity increased 2.2 per cent during the quarter.Shares rose 5.6 per cent to close at €76.25.
21;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-11-04T23:45:13Z;Investors focus on Europe exposure at US banks;Wall Street’s financial institutions in the crosshairs;Wall Street’s financial institutions were in the crosshairs this week, as broker-dealer MF Global filed for bankruptcy and Jefferies, the investment bank, suffered heavy selling. Against the backdrop of political chaos in Athens, investors were wary of financials with any hint of exposure to eurozone sovereign debt, exacerbating volatility on the S&P 500 once again. Amid the drama, the long-awaited initial public offering of Groupon came off, with a pop: shares were up 30.6 per cent to $26.11 after it debuted on Friday.Shares in MF Global stopped trading on Monday, as the broker-dealer filed for bankruptcy. The company had been weighed down by big bets on European government bonds, and had failed to find a buyer over the weekend.As the week progressed, investor attention turned to Jefferies, after bond research firm Egan-Jones highlighted the bank’s holdings of eurozone debt. Trading in Jefferies’ shares was twice halted on Thursday after the stock tumbled more than 20 per cent. The company insisted it “had no meaningful net exposure to European sovereign debt” because its long exposures are hedged by short positions. The stock rallied somewhat, but still ended the week down 18 per cent to $12.07.But MF Global’s collapse did not cause widespread contagion. Although the financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 5.4 per cent over the week, far worse than any other sector, the catalyst appeared to be a rapidly changing eurozone equation.Morgan Stanley again suffered more than other big banks, falling 13.4 per cent to $16.72, although the investment bank was at pains to emphasise its exposure to eurozone debt is small relative to peers, and manageable. Bank of America was off 11.7 per cent to $6.49 after chief executive Brian Moynihan indicated the bank may offer to swap preferred stock for common equity, diluting existing shareholders.The S&P 500 fell 2.5 per cent to 1,253.23 over the week, for its first weekly drop since September. But that only told part of the story.The week began with a large sell-off on Monday, as enthusiasm for the eurozone bail-out deal agreed the week before evaporated. What was set to be a historic October, became merely a momentous one: the S&P’s 10.7 per cent gain was the best month since 1991, rather than 1974.Then as a Greek referendum on its bail-out package was off, then on, and finally decisively off, the S&P 500 made big moves every day, adding to frustration among US investors.“Its all Europe, Europe, Europe again,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service. “It’s making it kind of ridiculous to trade. We’ve all got Greek fatigue,” he added.The big swings meant the CBOE Vix index of expected volatility in the S&P 500, which had closed below 25 for the first time since early August last Friday, was back above 30 for most of the week, stinging investors who had bet the European deal had put paid to volatility in the medium-term.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2 per cent for the week to 11,983.32 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.9 per cent to 2,686.15.But Lipper data on flows into US mutual and exchange-traded funds suggested some investors remained upbeat. Funds focused on small cap stocks, which investors have shunned in favour of larger companies amid volatility, had their best week of inflows since September 2008.Weak equity markets took their toll on insurers, which generate revenue by investing customer premia. Hartford Financial Services posted no third quarter profit, and said it had released 1,600 staff since the start of 2010. Bailed out insurer American International Group posted a $4.1bn loss, its worst since 2009.Hartford shares were off 11.9 per cent for the week to $17.83. AIG shares were down 9.2 per cent to $23.91, well below the $27.90 level at which the Treasury can sell publicly owned shares and break even.Clothing chain Abercrombie & Fitch plunged 24.2 per cent over the week to $58.21 after quarterly results revealed slowing growth in European same-store sales. US same-store sales, on the other hand, showed strong growth of 22 per cent compared to the third quarter of 2010.“We would be buying on weakness here as we think today is an overreaction,” Stacy Pak, a retail analyst at Barclays Capital, wrote to clients after results came out on Thursday. But the stock fell further on Friday .Luxury retailer Estée Lauder, poster-child for the emerging market consumer driven growth story, surprised with results again. The stock was up 16.3 per cent for the week to $117.94, as quarterly results showed strong sales growth in China, Hong Kong and at airport stores.MEMC Electronic Materials, which manufactures polysilicon, used in the manufacture of solar panels, fell 21.8 per cent to $5.19, after lowering full year and 2012 guidance. Polysilicon prices have fallen this year, amid uncertainty over European government subsidies for solar energy.With the third-quarter reporting season almost complete, the news has been broadly positive, with two-thirds of companies beating estimates. But prospects for 2012 appear to be deteriorating. At the start of earnings season analysts polled by Standard and Poor’s were forecasting earnings at S&P 500 companies to grow by 11.6 per cent next year. That is now down to 8.7 per cent.
22;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-11-03T20:31:43Z;US stocks rally despite Greek insecurity;ECB interest rate cut helps equities climb;Monday’s bankruptcy filing by broker-dealer MF Global continued to reverberate through markets on Thursday. Trading in shares of New York-based investment bank, Jefferies, was halted on two occasions as rapid price falls triggered “circuit breakers”.Research firm Egan-Jones had earlier downgraded Jefferies’ debt, citing the bank’s exposure to eurozone government bonds. Jefferies released a statement saying it, “had no meaningful net exposure to European sovereign debt,” because its long exposures are hedged by short positions.The stock rallied strongly and closed down 2.1 per cent to $12.01 at the close. Investors are barred from shorting the stock until Monday, under current SEC rules, after it fell more than 10 per cent.In the wider market, the European Central Bank’s interest rate cut was enough to settle US investors, even as infighting engulfed the Greek government. The S&P 500 was up 1.9 per cent to 1,261.15. But the move simply underlined US markets’ continued dependence on European news.“Its all Europe, Europe, Europe again,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service. “It’s making it kind of ridiculous to trade as the market just reacts to news.“We’ve all got Greek fatigue,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.8 per cent to 12,044.47 helped by a 3.3 per cent advance for Kraft Foods. The global food and beverage company reported strong earnings growth, as it passed on rising raw food costs to customers, closing the day at $35.78.The Nasdaq Composite index rose 2.2 per cent to 2,697.97.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch tumbled by a fifth after the clothing store chain reported that growth in European same-store sales slowed in the quarter ended October 29, compared with the same period in 2010. Global sales grew 7 per cent year-on-year, helped by a 22 per cent rise in American sales.Shares fell 19.9 per cent to $59.26.Barclays Capital said the European figures were adversely effected by currency movements.“We would be buying [the stock] on weakness here as we think today is an over reaction,” Stacy Pak wrote to clients.Estée Lauder soared 17.9 per cent to $118.92, as fiscal first quarter sales increased almost 50 per cent compared to the same period last year.The company has been a poster-child for the success of high-end retailers exposed to emerging market consumers, and China and Hong Kong again saw strong sales growth.Breakfast cereal maker Kellogg suffered a big fall on Thursday, after the company said it had spent heavily on factory upgrades and supplier monitoring in the last quarter, in response to product recalls and factory shutdowns, which have blighted the company.The $70m quality control spend was partially absorbed into third-quarter earnings, pushing profit down to $290m compared with $338m in the same quarter last year.“The fall in profits has come completely out of the blue,” said Jonathan Feeney, food stocks analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. “I came into the day thinking Kellogg had enough earnings flexibility to take on whatever investment they need.”Shares were down 7.6 per cent to $49.91.Coal miner Alpha Natural Resources surged 13.2 per cent to $27.11, after reporting profits for the quarter ended October 1 of $66.4m, double the figure for the same quarter last year.The average price of coal during the quarter was 51 per cent higher than in the same period last year, because of ongoing supply disruption, after flooding in Australia’s Queensland province.Semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm was up 7.5 per cent to $56.11 after the company forecast higher fiscal 2012 sales than analysts had predicted, due to high demand from smartphone makers.The stock had fallen as much as 5 per cent on the day Apple, one of Qualcomm’s biggest customers, announced an earnings miss in October.MEMC Electronics Materials was off 11.8 per cent to $5.10, after it cut its full-year earnings forecast, blaming weak demand for solar panels. MEMC manufactures polysilicon, the main material used in solar panels. The polysilicon price has tumbled this year, as European governments have cut subsidies for solar energy.Life insurer Hartford Financial Services was off 5.7 per cent to $17.90, after it reported no net profit for the third quarter, as tumbling equity markets wiped out returns on its investments. Hartford said it had cut 1,600 jobs since the start of 2010, in order to reduce costs.
23;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-09-14T20:53:34Z;Residential REIT declines blight Wall Street gains;;Residential real estate investment trusts took a tumble on Wednesday, after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rod Petrik told clients to expect “much more pedestrian” performance, following a strong run so far this year.Residential Reit stocks have strongly outperformed commercial Reits this year. The short duration of residential leases relative to commercial leases, means residential Reits can immediately take advantage of a strengthening rental market, as contracts come up for renewal more often.But, according to Stifel’s research, residential Reit stocks are now over priced, with share prices valuing residential Reit 34 per cent higher than other Reits with similar earnings.AvalonBay Communities fell 2.5 per cent to $130.40. Apartment Investment and Residential fell 0.9 per cent to $26.48 and Equity Residential fell 2.2 per cent to $58.79.Reits have significantly outperformed most other equities this year, as low interest rates have eased financing costs, and made dividends, which Reits are legally obliged to pay, attractive to yield-seeking investors.Bloomberg’s Reits index, which is dominated by commercial property funds rather than residential funds, was up 0.8 per cent Wednesday and is only down 1.7 per cent for the year.The broader S&P 500 index jumped 1.4 per cent, leaving it up 5 per cent for the week.That was despite disappointing retail sales data, which showed consumption stagnated in August.Timothy Speiss, vice-president of EisnerAmper Wealth Planning, said the retail figures were not unexpected and that “markets are pricing in hopes of getting to a master agreement on the European crisis,” where talks between the German, French and Greek governments continued Wednesday.Financials were up 1.2 per cent led by life insurer Hartford Financial Services, up 4.8 per cent at $18.18, and Ameriprise Financial, up 2.1 per cent at $43.80, as Credit Suisse analyst Thomas Gallagher upgraded both companies to to “buy”.Low interest rates and a weak equity market have raised questions about whether life insurers can generate returns on the premiums they take in from customers. But Mr Gallagher told clients, “low interest rates will have only a minor impact” on 2012 earnings.Bank of America rose 0.7 per cent to $7.05, but RBC Capital Markets became one of the first research shops to suggest BofA may offer fair value under $10.Analyst Paul Miller cut his BofA target price from $12 to $8, telling clients, “There seems to be no end in sight for [BofA’s] litigation expenses, and there is little clarity into what the company will look like two to three years down the road.”Most buy-side analysts have “buy” ratings on the stock, which has almost halved in value this year.Reaction to Cisco’s analyst day on Tuesday was mixed. Analysts greeted the company’s restructuring, which involves significant cost-cuts, but were divided on whether it can now deliver sales growth given the weak macroeconomic environment. “Three-year revenue growth rate guidance of 5-7 per cent appears conservative to us especially as year on year comparisons get easier. This new target is well below the recent 12-17 per cent target,” Jason Noland of Baird wrote to clients.But Rod Hall at JPMorgan told clients: “The good news is that [Cisco] has finally reduced its targets to levels that are achievable. The bad news is that those targets boil down to earnings per share growth of just 7-9 per cent.”Cisco’s shares fell 0.1 per cent to $16.33. The stock traded as low as $13.30 in August, and is still down almost 20 per cent for the year.Micron Technology was again among the top performers in the S&P 500, up 5 per cent at $7.20. It has now gained more than 13 per cent this week.Statistical research by JPMorgan suggested Micron, Nvidia, and other semiconductor stocks are in an “accumulation” cycle, with investors piling into the sector as it recovers from an oversell.Nvidia rose 5.2 per cent to $15.28 and the Philadelphia semiconductors index was up 2.6 per cent on Wednesday, and 5 per cent for the week.Cablevision rose 7 per cent to $17.83 on reports of a deal with Time Warner that will allow Cablevision subscribers to watch Turner Networks programming on tablets.Shares in Sears, the department store, rose 6.2 per cent to $58.48 on reports its Kenmore brand may be made available for sale through other outlets.Some investors were cheered by analysis of Tuesday’s sectoral movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Transport stocks outperformed the broader index by almost 3 per cent.“This kind of outperformance by the Transports has happened 177 times over the last 50 years, and the average performance for both the Transports and the Dow in the near term has been very positive,” according to a note from the Bespoke Investment Group.On Wednesday transport stocks in the Dow were up 2 per cent, while the wider index was up 1.3 per cent at 11,246.73. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent at 2,572.55.
24;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-08-30T14:48:26Z;Retail shares buffeted in Irene’s aftermath;;The S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since August 4, despite poor consumer confidence data and a rough day for department stores.Retail stocks were volatile as analysts picked winners and losers from Hurricane Irene.Kohl’s was down 2.2 per cent to $46.63 and JC Penney shares were off 1.8 per cent at $26.97.“We believe the department stores were negatively impacted by the hurricane as consumers stocked up on consumables ahead of the storm, rather than focusing on back-to-school items,” Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, told clients.That also hurt Staples, the stationery retailer, which was down 1.7 per cent to $14.60.But Edward Kelly said drug stores probably experienced heavy traffic in preparation for Hurricane Irene. CVS Caremark was up 0.6 per cent 35.76, although shares in Walgreen and Rite Aid were both flat.Overall, consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 were up 0.4 per cent, outperforming consumer staples stocks by 0.2 per cent in what is normally a sign of heightened expectations for economic growth.But it was hard to discern that much confidence from retail movers, with defensive stock, discount store Family Dollar, the biggest retail riser, up 4.2 per cent at $51.06.Randal Konik, retail analyst at Jefferies, said he was cautious about calling a strong rally in retail.“But it is hard to recommend going short on many [retail] stocks, simply because expectations for the back end of the year have already been downgraded and a lot of bad news priced in.”Overall, the S&P 500 index was up 0.2 per cent at 1,212.89, its third consecutive day of gains rise, ending the day above 1,200 for the second day running.Although stocks have bounced back from lows, previous rallies this month have fallen back after 1,200, and traders were relieved that the latest rally had not shrivelled.“The next stop is whether there is a major breakdown at 1,250. I think there will be major resistance if we get there,” said Paul Zemsky, head of multi-asset strategies at ING.The rally was again based on light trading volumes. Aggregate volume in US markets on Monday was the second lowest this month. Only Monday’s aggregate level had been lower.Monster Worldwide, which operates the job-search site Monster.com, led gainers, jumping 21.5 per cent to $9.91, after SEC filings revealed three executives had exercised options to buy more than 85,000 shares shares between them.The shares were purchased at $8.17, one cent higher than Monday’s closing price. Monster shares had hit a 28-month low of $7.00 on Friday.PulteGroup, the homebuilder, was up 7.1 per cent at $4.95 after better-than-expected house price figures. The Case-Schiller home price index was down only 0.1 per cent month on month in June.Pulte’s share price – an indicator of confidence in the construction sector – had briefly topped $5 for the first time since August 5.Insurers fell as financial stocks in the S&P 500 dropped 0.8 per cent, one of only two sectors to fall on the day. Hartford was off 0.3 per cent to $19.26, a partial correction to a strong rally on Monday, when Hartford had gained 10 per cent on relief that insurance companies would not have to make big pay-outs after Hurricane Irene inflicted less damage than expected.Bank of America shares dropped 3.2 per cent to $8.12. But the stock remains strongly up on the week after the shares rose 8 per cent on Monday on news of the $8.3bn sale of a 5 per cent stake in China Construction Bank.On Tuesday, analysts weighed in positively on the deal. Baird estimated that, when combined with other recent disposals, the CCB sale would increase BofA’s Basel I tier one capital, an important tool regulators use to measure the financial strength of banks, by 50 basis points to 8.75 per cent.Regional bank First Horizon was down 4.1 per cent at $6.99.Alpha Natural Resources was down 2.6 per cent at $34.02. JPMorgan initiated coverage on the coal supplier, giving it a neutral rating. But the stock was also retreating from the $35 mark that it reached yesterday, a level at which the stock has faced resistance all month.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent at 2,576.11, despite shares in NuPathe falling 34.6 per cent to $2.65. At one point, NuPathe stock had lost more than half its value after the company failed to win regulatory approval for the first skin patch to treat migraines. The Food and Drug Administration asked for more information.The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was tracking up 0.2 per cent to 11,559.64, closely following the S&P 500.
25;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-08-29T22:00:36Z;US authorities assess hurricane’s aftermath;;Hurricane Irene left at least 35 people dead and nearly 5.5m businesses and homes without power, as states along the US east coast began the massive clean-up effort.The eastern seaboard of the US from South Carolina to Maine suffered the main brunt of the storm with widespread flooding, power outages and property damage.Although New York City was mainly spared, millions were unable to return to work due to road and rail disruptions. New York subways and buses resumed service on Monday morning but the Long Island Rail Road remained partly closed. The Metro-North Railroad expects to restore limited service in the afternoon.By Monday morning, many analysts had downgraded their forecast losses devised before the hurricane hit. Kinetic Analysis Corp halved their initial estimate of total storm damage from $20bn to less than $10bn.The Consumer Federation of America forecast that wind damage could total $5bn in personal claims, with a further $2bn in claims related to widespread flooding.The Associated Press reported at least 35 deaths in 10 states.Claims may rise in the coming weeks, however, as compiling losses from flooding and wind damage will take some time.After falling at the end of last week, insurance stocks rose on Monday morning, as the extent of damage did not reach anticipated levels.Two insurance companies listed in New York, Hartford Financial Services and Allstate, both saw their share prices rise sharply on Monday.“Claims are starting to come in,” said Dick Leudke, spokesman for State Farm, the largest insurer of cars and homes in the US. “But we’ve learnt not to have expectations. It’s impossible to predict.”But some analysts said that much of the damage would not be covered by private insurance. Robert Hunter, insurance analyst at the Consumer Federation of America said: “A lot is flooding which they don’t cover, and other infrastructure, which the municipalities self-insure for.”“I don’t think impact on insurance industry will be huge, maybe $5bn,” he said.Clean-up efforts were in full force as Irene left a trail of destruction including mass flooding, toppled trees and fallen debris. The US Department of Energy reported that 5.48m customers were without power as of 10am local time on Monday.Utility companies whose transmission lines had been thrashed by the storm fought to restore power to homes on Monday. Meanwhile, oil and gas refineries, such as those operated by ConocoPhillips and Sunoco, have battled to return to normal production patterns.Robert McDonnell, Virginia’s governor, said his state suffered the second-largest power outage ever and warned that electricity might take a week to be restored. Heavy flooding was reported in Vermont, while waters continued to rise in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.Barack Obama, US president, warned on Sunday that recovery efforts would take weeks, saying “this is not over”.“Response and recovery efforts will be an ongoing operation,” he said.Mr Obama declared a federal state of emergency in several states, which means federal funds will cover much of the cost of the disaster clean-up.Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, said on Monday the cost to the state would be high, although it would be alleviated by the federal disaster relief declaration. “It’s my guess costs will be in the tens of millions,” he said to ABC News.Much of the focus as Irene neared the mainland was on its trajectory, which had New York City in its sights, making it the first named storm to hit the nation’s financial capital since 1985.While the majority of Manhattan dodged the most damaging effects of the storm, coastal neighbourhoods in Staten Island and Queens were hit with flooding and power outages.Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor, had come under criticism last year for his handling of the post-Christmas blizzard in New York. He was a much more visible presence this time around. He said on Sunday that he “had made exactly the right call”.“Bloomberg was making up for his failures during the blizzard last year,” said Doug Muzzio, professor of public affairs at the City University of New York. “I think he did it successfully – he was on the television constantly, he directed the city’s response. Overall an ‘A’ for effort, an ‘A’ for performance. He pulled up his grade substantially from the winter semester.”
26;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-08-29T14:16:15Z;Wall Street up on consumer spending data;;The S&P 500 closed above 1,200 for the first time in two weeks as traders seized on better than expected consumer spending figures to propel a broad market rally.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 rose 4.2 per cent, led by insurance groups, which avoided big pay outs after hurricane Irene left New York relatively unscathed. Irene had been downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before it made landfall, and markets opened as usual Monday morning. Hartford Financial Services was up 13 per cent at $19.42. Allstate rose 8.5 per cent to $26.30.Bank of America was up 8.1 per cent at $8.39, after it announced the $8.3bn sale of half of its 10 per cent stake in China Construction Bank. Some analysts had expected the bank to dispose of its entire stake in CCB to raise capital, but analysts were pleased with the price, which represents a premium over the $7.3bn received for 6 per cent of CCB in 2009.“The price seems good to me, and BofA are shrinking their balance sheet and disposing of non-core assets, which is what markets are telling them to do,” said Paul Miller at FBR Capital Markets.The S&P 500 closed up 2.8 per cent at 1,210.08, above the 1,200 barrier at which bears have offered resistance. But trading was lower than on any other day this month, leaving traders cautious about reading too much into the rally.“Technicians will tell you they want the S&P 500 to reach 1,200 on strong volume,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential. “In a rally, more than percentage rises, volume is important.”Media groups dependent on advertising for revenue outperformed the S&P 500. The sector suffered losses last week after Citigroup downgraded several stocks citing expected sluggish growth in consumer spending.Cable company CBS was up 5.6 per cent at $24.47 and Gannett, which owns magazines and newspapers including USA Today, was up 8.1 per cent at $11.56.James Dix at Wedbush said an economic slowdown would not necessarily hurt media companies immediately. “Large companies are not as highly levered as they were in 2008. That gives them some flexibility to keep spending on advertising to gain market share, in the hope that any downturn will be short,” he said.But he said he preferred to hold advertising agency stocks over advertising-dependent media groups.“Advertising agencies have exposure to emerging markets, because companies will still be looking to grow their brands there by deploying marketing budgets. But if you are looking for growth in China, you won’t advertise on CBS.“Margins are also tougher for media groups. Advertising companies can lay off staff in a downturn, but media companies have high fixed costs. They have already invested in their content and need to sell advertising to make a profit.”Advertising agencies had a mixed day. Omnicom Group was up only 2.1 per cent to $40.01. Rival Interpublic Group, a big advertising agency, was up 7.2 per cent at $8.66.Micron Technology, the semiconductor manufacturer, gained 8.6 per cent to close at $6.15.The group has rallied almost 20 per cent since a dramatic fall last Wednesday, when the company warned it would miss revenue expectations because of falling demand for the Dram components it makes for computers.Since then the Dram spot price has unexpectedly risen almost 5 per cent, continuing gains today, despite a report by business research group IHS, which predicted “free-falling prices are in store in the third quarter”.Other semiconductor stocks also gained. Applied Materials was up 3.7 per cent to $11.39.Based on the quarterly earnings reports of the main semiconductor manufacturers, Citigroup analyst Timothy Arcuri estimated orders had fallen 50 per cent to $20bn during the quarter.But Mr Arcuri said current stock prices reflect depressed demand sufficiently, and said the sector may have now troughed.Monsanto shares fell 1.3 per cent on reports that one of its genetically modified corn crops may have developed resistance to pesticides.Zillow rose 5.3 per cent to $33.04, after Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney initiated coverage with a $36 target and recommendation to “buy”. Mr Mahaney cited the company’s first mover status in online property search and the size of the US property market.Citi, which was the main underwriter of Zillow’s IPO, becomes the first major bank to cover the stock.Youku shares were up 7 per cent at $24.95 after the Chinese video-sharing website announced an online distribution agreement for rights to the DreamWorks Animation Kung Fu Panda franchise films in mainland China. The deal marks the first time DWA titles will be made available through an online platform in China.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent at 11,447.49 and the Nasdaq index of tech shares rose 2.5 per cent to 2,542.86 at midday.
27;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-08-03T23:33:32Z;US insurers release mixed results;;"Prudential Financial, the US insurance group, reported increased core profits of $831m for the second quarter on Wednesday as revenues were boosted by two acquisitions and a sharp increase in the value of annuity accounts.Shares in Prudential, the second-biggest insurer after MetLife, rose $0.72, or 1.7 per cent, in after-hours trading to $57.60. The net profit of $831m increased from $798m a year earlier. On an operating basis, earnings per share were $1.71; analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.55 a share.Prudential said its profits for the three months to the end of June were helped by revenue from AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life, both bought in February from AIG, the US insurer, which reports its own earnings on Thursday.“Our organic business growth in US and international markets is bolstered by the expanded distribution opportunities and client base from the Star and Edison businesses we acquired in Japan earlier this year, with business integration on track,” said John Strangfeld, chief executive.The increased core profit excludes Prudential’s “closed block” of legacy business. Including that, profit declined from $1.1bn to $838m.Meanwhile, Hartford Financial, the smaller US insurer, announced a $500m share buy-back programme only a year after repaying government bail-out money. The announcement came after Hartford’s second-quarter results, which were pre-released last month due to charges related to tornadoes that devastated parts of the US earlier this year. Net income at Hartford fell from $76m in the second quarter of 2010 to $24m.Liam McGee, chief executive, said it was “an important action and the next step to ultimately increasing our return on equity and earnings per share”. He said he had consulted regulators before approving the share buy-back and would continue to “prudently” manage capital."
28;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-04-03T22:00:46Z;Financial groups seek to avoid ‘important’ list;;"There is a new parlour game in the geekier circles of Washington’s regulators, academics and lobbyists: who should be on the list of companies deemed so important to the financial system that they must be subject to tighter standards?After financial groups built up risk that threatened to bring down the entire financial system, the Obama administration decided to identify future AIGs and Lehman Brothers and subject them to tougher capital and liquidity standards and closer supervision.As Congress debated the law that became Dodd-Frank, lawmakers wrangled over this systemic risk designation. Some warned it would crystallise the “too big to fail” funding advantage enjoyed by the largest groups by underlining the fact the government considered them crucial. Others said it would instead be a “scarlet letter”, a sign that profits would be hit by the new standards.Nine months after the designation became law, it looks like the scarlet letter brigade has won. Disclosures show a long list of companies and industry trade groups engaging in lobbying efforts – people involved with the talks say they are desperate to prove they do not deserve to be branded.Viral Acharya, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, has developed a daily league table of systemically risky companies, which measures the correlation between a stock market fall and that of an individual company and also takes into account how much debt it has. It is an elegant way of measuring how tightly bound to the broader system a group is and how vulnerable it is to failing.As Mr Acharya points out: “In the end, it wasn’t a regulator who woke up one day and said ‘Listen, we are having a subprime crisis’, it was the market.”Bank of America is top of the list. Like all bank holding companies with more than $50bn in assets, it is automatically designated, but the top 10 also includes four insurance companies: MetLife, which is structured as a bank holding company and is therefore expected to be designated; AIG, which is also expected to be designated even though its supporters say it has shed its risky businesses; Prudential; and Hartford Financial Services.How to treat the latter two businesses shows the difficulties of the designation: they are both large and the NYU-Stern calculations show them to be systemically risky. On the other hand, the insurance industry is arguing that its companies enjoy stable funding and are therefore not susceptible to bank-type “runs” and that unlike AIG, they are not dangerously intertwined with other financial companies.“It’s absolutely the number one outstanding issue that we have,” David Sampson, chief executive of the Property Casualty Insurers Association, told a Chamber of Commerce conference last week. “Clearly it’s fundamentally a size-based threshold … [and] a bank-centric view of how they [regulators] approach their work. You’re not going to have a run on [insurers] … unless everyone in the country crashes their car at the same time.”Mr Acharya notes though that it is very difficult to argue convincingly that there is no systemic risk in insurance. As big buyers of corporate bonds, if they stopped buying in a crisis then corporate America would be forced to turn to credit lines with banks, having knock-on effects for banks’ funds. Mr Acharya’s league table only includes public companies – asset managers, private equity firms and hedge funds that are not on the stock market are therefore exempt.That might not be the case in the real designations. But in 2009, both Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, separately expressed the view that no individual hedge fund was risky enough for inclusion.That might not suit the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The agency has been given powers to wind down a failing systemically important financial group to complement its existing powers to wind down banks. Officials there, in contrast to their counterparts at the Fed and the Treasury, want a longer list because they think the designation, particularly the requirement to draw up a living will, is important to the FDIC’s ability to wind down a future AIG or Lehman Brothers. But the FDIC is only one vote on the council of regulators.Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor, said last week that the initial list should be short and “treating financial firms of all sorts as banks could be both ineffective and inefficient”.Although some lobbyists worry that the council will ultimately opt for broader inclusion for fear of missing a company that later roils markets, the indications so far are that a decisive majority of its members will opt for a smaller list."
29;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2011-03-21T20:55:01Z;Wall St rises as fears over Japan ease;;The telecommunications sector was shaken by news that AT&T will buy T-Mobile USA, while elsewhere on Wall Street sentiment improved as concerns over Japan’s nuclear crisis eased.AT&T announced on Sunday that it was buying T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom for $39bn in a deal that will create the largest wireless carrier in the US. Shares in AT&T were up 1.2 per cent to $28.26.The news sent Sprint Nextel, the No 3 US carrier, tumbling 13.6 per cent to $4.36. Sprint was itself in talks with Deutsche Telekom to merge with T-Mobile, and this surprise deal with AT&T pulled the rug out from underneath it.The telecoms sector as a whole had a mixed reaction to the news. Verizon Communications, the second-largest US telecoms group by revenues, was up 1.7 per cent to $36.46 but Qwest Communications International fell 3.4 per cent to $6.69.

The purchases will be spread out and the pace will be adjusted if needed.“I think the market is struggling with what to make of it,” said Dan Cook, chief executive of IG Markets. “It had it priced in pretty well at $500bn- $1,000bn and between the FOMC and the Federal Reserve of New York, the total is $850bn-$900bn.“I think we could see a good week or two of softness. A healthy retracement would not be a bad thing.”However, Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management, said in the longer term financials, housing and the automotive sectors stood to do well out of the increased liquidity from quantitative easing, and the consumer discretionary sector could rise on hopes for economic growth.The S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,197.96, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 11,1215.13 and the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.3 per cent higher at 2,540.27.The S&P 500 financials index gained 1 per cent, with Bank of America adding 1.1 per cent to $11.52, AIG gaining 3.4 per cent to $43.57 and Morgan Stanley surging 3.2 per cent to $25.40.Before the Federal Reserve’s announcement, investors shrugged off a Republican victory in the midterm elections, widely predicted to buoy markets in the longer term.Analysts at JPMorgan said healthcare, financials and technology stood to benefit most from the Republican victory in the House because reforms of healthcare and finance could be implemented in a more lenient way, and technology could benefit from the extension of the tax cuts of former president George W.

said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.“I’m really looking for some choppy markets for the foreseeable future as we’ve had a bit of a run-up from the end of June and particularly in July. It’s a traders’ market instead of an investors’ market – no one has got a lot of conviction and they’re not holding on to positions.”Markets were shaken further by data released before the bell which showed that the US trade deficit unexpectedly widened 18.8 per cent to $49.9bn in June as imports of consumer goods from China and the rest of the world soared while US exports fell.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent, with eight falling more than 2 per cent.Materials and energy stocks, which were hit by the fall in metals and oil prices when China reported a drop in import growth on Tuesday, continued their decline after more negative data from China showed a slowdown in factory output.The S&P 500 Materials sector fell 3.4 per cent, with aluminium producer Alcoa down 6.1 per cent at $10.66, iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources losing 5 per cent to $58.02 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold falling 4.3 per cent to $70.04.The S&P 500 Energy sector was down 2.9 per cent, with oil companies Exxon falling 1.8 per cent to $60.39, Chevron declining 2.4 per cent to $77.13 and Conoco Phillips sliding 2.4 per cent to $55.51.Industrials were the biggest faller, with the S&P 500 Industrial sector down 3.4 per cent.

34;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

After repaying $3.4bn in funds from the troubled asset relief programme (Tarp), The Hartford recorded a $440m charge against earnings for the quarter, leading to a loss of 42 cents per share.“The company’s first quarter results reflect building momentum, with year-over-year top-line improvements in many businesses,” said Liam McGee, chief executive of The Hartford. “We also benefited from capital market improvements, disciplined underwriting and a continued focus on execution across the organisation”.Since taking the reins of the company seven months ago, Mr McGee has realigned the organisation so that it no longer focuses on individual product groups, but rather on customer groups.“This is not a revolutionary change in the business,” said Mr McGee, who had been head of retail operations at Bank of America before joining the 200-year-old insurance company. “We have taken a product focus and turned it into a customer focus”.Prior to Mr McGee’s arrival, The Hartford ran into financial trouble in its variable annuity business, and through poorly timed real estate investments.“A lot of that’s behind us,” said Mr McGee. “There are some signs that commercial real estate has bottomed out”.

Excluding food and energy, prices rose by 0.1 per cent, as expected.“Even if we see some heat in [US producer prices], the question is whether it can carry through to the core CPI [consumer price index], which would be a problem. That’s not likely soon,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab.She added: “We are not in an inflationary environment.”After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.58 per cent at 1,166.21, an 18-month high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.5 per cent to 10,733.67, rallying for the seventh consecutive day.

FTSE’s life assurance index, down 9 per cent in the previous four days, registered its sharpest rally since November.Bid speculation also played a part in the rally.Aviva led the sector gainers, up 5 per cent to 361½p as speculation revived that it could be vulnerable to a break-up bid led by Resolution.Several names were mooted as potential partners in an approach, including Prudential and general insurers. However, the complexity of any hostile bid led many to doubt the tale.Another theory was that US insurer Hartford Financial Services may try to buy a UK peer. But with Hartford still needing to pay back $3.4bn of state aid, there were again reasons for scepticism.Resolution, which is due to post full-year results on Thursday, closed down 1.3 per cent to 74p.Mixed signals on a possible Greek bail-out left the FTSE 100 up 20.15 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,131.99 after another choppy session.Icap led the blue chip risers, jumping 10.6 per cent to 337p. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock following a profit warning last week, which had sent sent the shares tumbling by 20 per cent.“Investors need to distinguish between cyclical earnings pressures and secular regulatory pressures,” analyst Chris Turner said. “Recent earnings weakness is the former.”British Gas owner Centrica took on 3.1 per cent to 272½p after Morgan Stanley turned positive based on falling wholesale gas prices.Lloyds Banking Group was up 3.7 per cent to 50p, extending a bounce ahead of tomorrow’s pricing on a debt-for-equity swap.Merrill Lynch argued that Lloyds stock has recently been depressed by hedging rather than sovereign debt concerns and expected a rally once the share issue completes. “We think the shares look too cheap and we would buy into the re-weight and the results on the February 26,” it said.Among the fallers, Autonomy fell 5.7 per cent to £15.22 after selling £500m of convertible debt for potential acquisitions.Given persistent concerns that Autonomy has muddied its organic growth figures with acquisitions, several analysts considered the move baffling. They also questioned the logic of Autonomy’s deal to buy a small US reseller as the company’s model is to sell through partners.A fourth straight weekly fall for its flagship fund dragged Man Group lower by 1.3 per cent to 217p. AHL Diversified’s net asset value hit a two-year low after losing 0.2 per cent last week.BHP Billiton led the miners lower after giving a cautious outlook for 2010 and dashing hopes of a new share buy-back programme.BHP lost 1.5 per cent to £18.56½ while Xstrata was down 1.5 per cent to £10.44 and Rio Tinto declined 1.3 per cent to £31.59½.Among the mid-caps, Sports Direct rallied 3.7 per cent to 97p. A Serious Fraud Office report on suspected price-fixing by Sports Direct and JJB is expected today.In-line results from Telecity, the data warehouse company, were eclipsed by talk that its two biggest shareholders, 3i and Oak Hill Capital, planned to sell their remaining stock. The pair hold 16.5 per cent each of Telecity shares. Telecity fell 3.1 per cent to 363p.JD Wetherspoon was up 3.9 per cent to 448p following a report that it is near to agreeing a debt refinancing, with the pub operator said to be paying three times its current rate for the new £500m facility.Dominion Petroleum, an exploration company focused on east and central Africa, jumped 24.4 per cent to 6¼p on rumours of a fundraising and potential disposal.Dominion’s brokers were said to have started preparations for a fundraising to help finance drilling in Uganda, where the group has acreage south of Tullow Oil’s fields that has been estimated to contain about 257m barrels.Ahead of any fundraising, Dominion may sell its licences in Tanzania, dealers said.There was spurious talk that Bluegold, the troubled hedge fund, could be looking to sell its 11.7 per cent stake in Dominion. Dealers dismissed the theory.Desire Petroleum, the Falkland Islands oil explorer, climbed 13.4 per cent to 108p. On Monday, the Ocean Guaridna Drilling rig will arrive at its Liz prospect in the North Falklands basin.Kopane Diamond climbed 23.4 per cent to 11½p on news of discussions that could lead to an offer for the company.The talk in the market was that the offer had been pitched at 22p-a-share in cash and stock and Namalwa Diamonds was tipped as a potential buyer.Xcite Energy, the North Sea oil company, dipped 1.3 per cent to 39p even after it announced two new partners for its Bentley project.Amec will be providing engineering expertise and ADTI will provide a heavy- duty deepwater drilling rig to undertake the drilling and testing of a well.Coalminers were in focus after BHP Billiton’s posted strong results from its coal operations. GCM Resources added 6 per cent to 116p.Confectionery and snacks group Glisten jumped 54.3 per cent to 135p after recommending a 140p-a-share cash offer from management and Raisio, the Finnish food company that makes cholesterol-lowering ingredient Benecol.That news saw shares in rival Zetar move 3.5 per cent higher to 207p.
39;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Hartford swings to $557m profit in Q4;;The Hartford Financial Services Group reported fourth-quarter earnings of $557m late Monday, compared to a loss of $806m for the same period a year earlier, as revenues in its property and casualty division showed improvement.For the year, The Hartford lost $887m, about one third the size of its $2.7bn loss recorded in 2008.The return to profitability in the quarter coincided with the arrival of Liam McGee, former head of retail banking at Bank of America, who was named chief executive of The Hartford in late September.“The Hartford’s fourth-quarter results represent a return to profitability,” said Mr McGee in a statement. “Both life and property and casualty businesses reported net income, and this is the third sequential quarter of improving core earnings.”The company’s property and casualty business had net income of $508m for the quarter, driven largely by gains in the small commercial sector and the middle market. The division earned $291m during the comparable period a year earlier.The company’s life insurance business generated $118m in net income for the quarter, compared with a loss of $807m for the comparable period in 2008.
40;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Wall St lower as earnings come up short;;A disappointing start to the earnings season sent US stocks lower on Tuesday.Shares in Alcoa, the country’s largest aluminium producer, dropped 11.1 per cent to $15.52 after it reported a lower fourth-quarter profit than analysts had forecast.While the group posted higher than expected revenues, it said the extra sales were due to unprofitable metal trades that it was forced to make to satisfy customer purchase agreements.Higher energy bills and a weak US dollar were to blame for the disappointing bottom line, it said.As the first company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to report quarterly results, Alcoa is thought to set the tone for the coming earnings season.The pessimism spread to the wider market and dragged the S&P 500 materials sector down 1.9 per cent.The Vix index, which measures risk aversion and is considered to be Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose for the first time in more than a week. The S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,136.22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 10,627.26 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent lower at 2,282.31.“The consensus is that we are in some sort of recovery but how robust is it going to be?” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers. “Alcoa’s results are a sneak preview of where investors’ attentions are going to lie.”Chevron added to the cautious mood on Wall Street after announcing that its profit from the fourth quarter would be lower than the previous three months due to weaker refining margins.Shares in Chevron, the country’s second-largest energy producer, fell 0.6 per cent to $80.41.Electronic Arts, the world’s second-largest video game publisher, also weighed on the technology sector after slashing its forecast for this year following disappointing holiday sales.Like booksellers, the industry has suffered from a combination of lower consumer spending in the recession and greater competition from digital distributors.Last week, Gamestop, the country’s largest video games retailer, also cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast after disappointing results from the holiday season.Shares in both companies have dropped about 70 per cent over the past two years. Electronic was down 7.8 per cent to $16.85 yesterday while Gamestop added 2.2 per cent to $20.77.Elsewhere, KB Home, the housebuilder that targets first-time buyers, reported its first quarterly profit since 2007.However, the improvement to its bottom line was mainly due to a change in the tax law. Revenue still fell almost 30 per cent during the period, helping to send its shares down 4 per cent to $15.72.The rest of the industry initially followed suit and Pulte Homes, the country’s largest homebuilder, closed 0.6 per cent lower at $10.90 after heavy early losses.Banking stocks also suffered after the Obama administration said it was planning to impose a new levy on the sector to pay for the financial bail-out.Bank of America dropped 3.4 per cent to $16.36 while Citigroup was down 3 per cent at $3.52.However, the S&P 500 financial sector was only down 1.6 per cent due to positive news from the insurance industry.Hartford Financial Services, the insurer that has reported five straight quarterly losses, announced that it would beat analyst estimates for the last quarter due to lower underwriting losses. Its shares jumped 3.4 per cent to $27.12.Supervalu also helped to lift the market, gaining 5.8 per cent to $13.67. The country’s second-largest supermarket chain reported higher than expected quarterly profit and stood by its full-year forecast. The group, which operates about 2,500 stores, said cost-cutting would make up for falling sales.Meanwhile, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea, which operates the A&P supermarket chain, reported third-quarter sales sharply below Wall Street’s consensus estimate.The retailer, whose chief executive quit last October, has been posting losses for the past two years. Its shares tumbled 20.7 per cent to $10.22.
41;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-12-06T11:37:31Z;Internal promotions on the backburner;;The strain placed on financial services companies during the recession seems to be upending conventional wisdom about succession planning.The days when it was almost a given that chief executives groomed and named their successors seem to be gone for now, and may not return until the market regains a greater sense of normality.More and more financial institutions are going outside to find their leaders. It is part of a chief executive’s job to identify potential successors, but sinking assets under management and plummeting stock prices appear to be changing the game when it comes to replacing top executives.“The bottom line is that succession plans are necessary but they have become less relevant,” says Charles O’Neill, president of recruiting company Diversified Management Resources. “The skills that earned an executive a place in the line of succession to the top may not be the ones needed to address the crises financial companies face today.”As a result, the C-suite has come to resemble a revolving door at many financial institutions.Janus Capital Group, an asset manager with $151.8bn (£91bn, €100bn) in assets under management as of September 30, 2009, has been on the prowl for a new chief executive since Gary Black resigned from the post in July.Mr Black clashed with the group’s board over Janus’s future – the board wanted to raise capital and deleverage the company’s balance sheet, while Mr Black was in favour of a merger, according to sources familiar with the situation.Director Tim Armour was named interim chief until the board finds a permanent successor. “We are still in the midst of a CEO search,” Mr Armour said in an earnings call on October 22. “My hope is when we have this call after the first of the year we will be introducing a new CEO to you.”Mr Black’s departure was followed by a senior leadership exodus.Executive consultants say it is no surprise that a shake-up often takes place at the top when a chief executive leaves. The uncertainty created by the boss’s departure, coupled with the disappointment of those who had expectations to rise to the top, often prompt a sudden turnover.Mr Armour blamed the rash of leadership changes on something else.“We’re a target within the industry because we have really super people, and we had two of those three people that were sort of picked up by competitors because they are very talented,” Mr Armour said during the earnings call.When there is a crisis of leadership, companies need to weigh the experience and knowledge of the company’s executive team versus the need to bring in outside talent to address the problems confronting the business, says Mr O’Neill.At The Hartford, Ramani Ayer, who spent his entire career at the company and was chief executive for 12 years, was replaced in October this year by Liam McGee, who came to the insurer from Bank of America, where he had served as president of consumer and small business banking.Drew Woodbury, associate stock analyst at Morningstar, wrote in September this year: “We are mildly surprised that Hartford chose an executive from outside the insurance industry, but we note Mr McGee’s vast experience in the financial sector and his ability to work in a large, complex institution.”When times are good for a company, the new chief executive tends to be an insider because the departing CEO is seen as having earned the right to name a successor, says Ron Bush, a principal at consulting firm Brightwork Partners. In addition, he says, senior managers are considered key contributors to good results. “When the board decides to look outside, the CEO can be blamed for doing a poor job of grooming a successor, the most important job of any CEO under normal circumstances. It’s a completely different scenario when the company is under severe stress or has recently gone through a troubling time,” Mr Bush says.The precipitous drop in The Hartford’s value might have led the board to appoint an outsider. In 2008, the group saw its stock plummet by 79 per cent. The Hartford would not comment on its succession plans.ING, on the other hand, recently promoted the chief executive of ING Investment Management Americas to the post of chief executive of ING Insurance US. The Dutch bank is in the midst of a global reorganisation that could lead to the sale of its insurance operation.ING tries to fill senior jobs internally, says Tom Waldron, executive vice president, human resources and brand ING Americas. The company does occasionally look externally too, to guard against becoming too insular, and for the specific expertise it needs, he adds.Although promoting internal candidates to top posts can raise eyebrows, particularly for companies that have been hurt by the financial crisis, finding an executive whose former employer was immune from the crisis is also a tough proposition, Mr Waldron says.In the midst of a search for external candidates for top posts, Mr Waldron says he has been overly cautious. “I want to make sure I am not hiring somebody who was part of a bigger problem at other financial services institutions,” he says.ING has succession plans in place for about 250 positions. The backup plans for each position are reviewed at least twice a year, Mr Waldron says.Mariana Lemann is a reporter with Ignites.com, a Financial Times publication

43;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-06-15T21:29:09Z;Lincoln reduces its bail-out needs;;Lincoln Financial will draw less than half of the US bail-out money it has approval for after selling a UK life assurance business for more than $300m to Canada’s Sun Life and announcing plans to raise $1.4bn in stock and bond sales.Lincoln expects to draw $950m from the troubled asset relief programme, much less than the $2.5bn in capital injections it was offered.The company is only the second US life assurer to take bail-out cash. The Hartford Financial Group said on Friday it would take its full $3.4bn allowance.Six big US life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries gained approval to receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds in May, after concerns grew about the financial stability of the sector.However, four of these groups turned down the funds after raising capital through other routes – Principal Financial, Prudential Financial, Allstate and Ameriprise Financial.The US life industry has been hard hit by a combination of tumbling stock and bond markets, which have hurt the value of investments, and the high cost of making good on guarantees promised to individual policyholders in variable annuity products.These are long-term savings products where the consumer is able to reap some of the benefit from rising investment values, but is protected against steep declines.Lincoln said on Monday that it intended to pay $1bn of the proceeds of its capital-raising exercise into its principal insurance unit, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, and keep the remaining $1bn for general corporate purposes, including repaying short-term debt.“These actions supplement dividend reductions, cost cuts, and other actions previously taken to strengthen the company’s capital,” Lincoln said.The company will issue $600m of new shares in a public underwritten offering and up to $500m of senior debt.The sale of its Lincoln National UK life insurance operations to Sun Life Financial of Canada has already secured about $320m in its capital raising efforts.Both the Sun Life and Lincoln National operations in the UK are in effect closed books of life assurance business, which means they sell few new policies.However, such businesses can still generate strong cash flows, which has attracted some colourful entrepreneurs to the sector in the UK to buy up such businesses.Sun Life said the deal would increase its UK assets under management by about 60 per cent to £10.6bn ($17.2bn) and add between C$0.08 and C$0.10 to earnings next year.“The combined operation is expected to generate attractive returns and serve to position Sun Life for future growth in one of the world’s largest life insurance markets,” said Donald Stewart, Sun Life chief executive.
44;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-06-15T20:28:46Z;Commodity and consumer groups suffer steep falls on Wall Street;;US stocks dropped sharply on Monday as commodity prices weakened and investors worried about the pace of economic recovery.Commodity stocks surged during the first four sessions of last week, as the price of oil rose and the dollar dropped amid rising fears of inflation.However, they fell back on Friday and continued to give up those gains on Monday. ConocoPhillips lost 2.9 per cent to $43.10 while Schlumberger dropped 2.8 per cent to $58.59.Steelmakers, which were some of last week’s biggest beneficiaries, also dropped sharply. AK Steel gave up 8.1 per cent to $18.32 while US Steel declined 5.7 per cent to $37.10.Commodity producers were hampered by a strengthening dollar, which was boosted when the Russian finance minister said there was “no alternative” to the dollar as a reserve currency.Data showing that manufacturing in the New York area was falling much more than expected during June and that sentiment among homebuilders had dipped exacerbated the falls.These factors added to cautious words over the weekend from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, who warned that discussions about “exit strategies” from stimulus plans might be premature.Mr Strauss-Kahn said: “We haven’t exited the crisis yet.”Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: “Things are so weak we would expect them to continue to improve for quite a few months, but in some cases the improvement is petering out already, which is quite disappointing.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.4 per cent down at 923.72 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 8,612.13 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.3 per cent to 1,816.38 points.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked nearly 10 per cent back over the 30 level. Consumer stocks also suffered. Wal-Mart fell 2.8 per cent to $48.46, hurt by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which said sales growth at the retailer would begin to fall.Although Goldman said investors could move into more discretionary stocks as the recovery continues, others warned that the consumer sector would continue to suffer.“People are starting to realise that even when the economy recovers, certain sectors such as consumer spending are going to remain under pressure,” said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “This is a realisation stage for the markets.”There were negative signs on the amount of loan losses that financial companies still face. Capital One, the credit card lender, said the number of card defaults had risen in May compared with April. Its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $23.40.Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities, warned that Bank of America was experiencing “horrific” loan losses. BofA shares fell 2.8 per cent to $13.33. Also in the sector, shares in Lincoln National dropped after the company became the second large insurer, after Hartford Financial, to say it would take government bail-out money and raise further capital by issuing shares.The company said it would sell up to $900m of new stock, and its shares dropped 10.8 per cent to $15.83 on fears of dilution.Housebuilders were some of the day’s biggest fallers after the homebuilder confidence figures. Centex sank 3 per cent to $8.23 while KB Home, which also suffered a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, dropped 6 per cent to $13.24. There was further bad news for the airline industry after executives at European aircraft maker Airbus warned that output at its European factories could fall by as much as a quarter over the next two years.Shares in Airbus’s US rival Boeing fell 3.7 per cent to $49.52 but shares in other major airlines were worse affected, as research suggested business class flights on Delta Air Lines and American Airlines had halved in price.Delta lost 4.7 per cent to $6.10, while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, gave up 2.6 per cent to $4.43.
45;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-06-12T20:43:55Z;Wall Street rebounds in late trade;;Wall Street stocks erased most of their early losses on Friday, but they failed to break out of the week’s narrow trading range on a day when floor trading in 242 companies, including Exxon Mobil and General Electric, was halted because of a computer problem.Stocks rebounded in late trade as early indications filtered through that Mir Hossein Mousavi, the challenger to President Mahjmoud Ahmedi-Nejad, might be on course to win a majority of the vote.The broad market had been subdued all week, as surging commodities lifted energy and materials stocks, but squeezed the consumer sector.Oil peaked at more than $73 a barrel on Thursday, but then fell back again on Friday. Its movement was matched by that of leading energy producers.Schlumberger rose 8.6 per cent in the first four sessions of the week, but fell 3.1 per cent on Friday to $60.27. ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $44.37.Metal producers also lost some of the week’s gains as the boom in prices for their products slowed. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 3.2 per cent to $58.51. AK Steel, the steel maker that has surged over 13 per cent this week, fell 5.7 per cent to $19.93.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.1 per cent at 946.21, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 8,799.26, pushing the blue chip benchmark into positive territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 0.2 per cent to 1,858.80 points.“We’ve had a really good run up on commodities and there is a certain amount of covering positions ahead of the weekend,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.“Some managers will also be looking to lock in profits before the end of the quarter.”That left the S&P 0.7 per cent ahead of where it closed last week, while the Dow rose 0.4 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent.The market spent the week focused on interest rates and the threat of inflation as climbing commodity prices were further fuelled by a falling dollar and climbing bond yields.Last week’s better-than-expected fall in non-farm payrolls triggered worries that an improving economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year.“Inflation is a serious threat, perhaps not in three to six months, but in 12 to 18 months, and we have been investing in inflation protection assets,” said Charles Zhang, managing partner of Zhang Financial.BlackRock finally confirmed its $13.5bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors on Thursday to create the world’s largest money manager.The impending deal had been widely reported during the week, sending BlackRock’s shares up 5 per cent.The final price was a shade over the $13bn that had been reported, however, which sent BlackRock’s shares down 3.3 per cent at $176.56.The company was also hit by a downgrade in its credit rating from S&P following the deal, which will give it an extra $3bn of debt.Elsewhere in the sector, Hartford Financial, the insurer and financial services company, said it would take $3.4bn in government bail-out money and sell $750m of stock amid what it called a “continued uncertain economic environment”. This sent the company’s shares down 8 per cent to $12.95.In the technology sector, National Semiconductor shares fell after it reported a loss.The microchip maker had better sales than expected, but had to pay $100m in restructuring costs, leading to a worse loss than had been predicted.Its shares dropped 6.1 per cent to $13.59.Other microchip companies suffered. Texas Instruments lost 0.2 per cent to $20.79 while market leader Intel gave up 0.2 per cent to $16.31.
46;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Life assurers to receive bail-out cash;;Life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries will receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds, officials confirmed on Friday, a move experts hope will damp concerns about the financial stability of this sector.Six companies have been approved for capital injections: Hartford Financial Services, Prudential, Allstate, Ameriprise, Lincoln National and Principal Financial, although Ameriprise turned down the money on Friday. Officials said the insurance groups could receive much of the $22bn (£15bn) remaining in the capital purchase programme, part of the wider $700bn troubled asset relief programme, but cautioned that not all the money would necessarily go to them.“This has the potential to be a meaningful, material contribution to capital for certain companies,” said Kevin Ahern, an analyst at Standard and Poor’s, the credit rating agency.The companies eligible for bail-out funds all own or have recently acquired banks. They applied for capital months ago and received approval through the normal process for bank recapitalisation. Nonetheless, the capital injections, which can be used to support their insurance operations as well, come as policymakers are paying increasing attention to risks emanating from the life assurance sector, as well as property and casualty insurers and pension funds.Officials have no specific or immediate cause for concern. But while they think they have a very good handle on risks within the banking system following the stress test of the top 19 US banks, they are less confident that they have identified all the dangers within the insurance and pension industries.Insurance groups are regulated state-by-state by 51 regulators, meaning that federal authorities do not have as good a line of sight into their operations as they do with the biggest banks.Moreover, they operate under actuarial principles that allow them to smooth their operating performance and do not need to mark all their assets to their current market values – practices that make them less vulnerable in the short term to market disruptions but also mean that problems may take longer to come to the surface.Opinions differ on how opaque these groups are. Matt Carroll, a second analyst at S&P, said there was “pretty good visibility in real time on both the asset side and liabilities side”.Nonetheless, a number of policymakers believe that if there is a further relapse in the financial system, it is more likely to be caused by problems at the insurers than at the banks.Many life assurance groups issued a lot of annuities that offered clients the better of a fixed return or a rise in the stock market. Analysts suspect that some of these were imperfectly hedged. Meanwhile, life assurance groups – and other insurers, as well as pension funds – face losses on their portfolios of commercial mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate whole loans and corporate bonds.In a report published in February, S&P said the economic downturn would put “unprecedented stress” on these portfolios. Since then, analysts have become even more concerned about commercial real estate loans in particular.Lower credit ratings and counterparty concerns in turn have raised the cost of financing for life insurers and made it harder for them to raise capital if needed to shore up their finances.The rally in the stock market since its March lows has provided a strong boost to life assurance companies, other insurers and pension funds. But concerns about asset quality remain.Life assurers are historically very stable, with predictable outgoings and a strong cash flow from the sale of new business. However, in theory at least, they could be vulnerable in extremis either to a funding crisis or to a fear-induced rush to cash out policies with surrender values early.Life assurers do not have access to Federal Reserve liquidity, though their banking subsidiaries do.With defined-benefit pension funds, meanwhile, the main danger is that large accumulated losses could create a need for large top-up payments from the sponsoring companies. That would put a drag on profits, in effect forcing an increase in corporate saving that is likely to come at the expense of some investment, sapping growth. Losses on defined contribution plans fall directly on households.In depth: US banks

They failed to recover fully during the rest of the week as moderate gains on Thursday were followed by another dip on Friday.Further worries about consumer activity came on Friday after two leading clothing retailers announced worse results than expected.JC Penney reported profit marginally below consensus estimates and lowered its full-year estimates, saying it expected consumer spending to remain weak. The shares lost 0.4 per cent to $26.54.Designer brand name Abercrombie & Fitch lost ground after posting a steeper than expected first quarter loss. Its shares fell 4.2 per cent to $26.10.Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, bucked the trend, beating analysts’ estimates in spite of falling sales. It raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 7.8 per cent to $22.58.Analysts warned that sales figures gave a more accurate picture of consumer behaviour than surveys on confidence.The economic outlook saw equities markets fall on Friday, on a day of raised volatility, as many investors moved to cover their positions on options, which were about to expire.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.1 per cent to 882.88 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 8,268.64 points.The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed, finding relative strength in technology stocks, which fell during the early part of the week. The index dropped 0.5 per cent to 1,680.14 points, taking it to its first weekly loss in 10. The three main market measures fell between 3.3-5 per cent in the week.Energy stocks were some of the heaviest fallers on the day as the price of oil fell
3 per cent. Chevron lost 2 per cent to $65.88 and ExxonMobil gave up 0.9 per cent to $69.11.Industrial and materials stocks outperformed after figures showed that manufacturing output in New York state is falling at a slower rate than expected.Financial stocks were weak on worries over the economic outlook. This weakness affected insurers even after several companies were approved for bail-out funds from the government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).After early gains, insurers fell during the broader sell-off. Hartford, which has approval for $3.4bn, fell 1 per cent to $14.60, while Lincoln National which may take $2.5bn, lost 0.7 per cent to $16.12.Technology companies have proved stable this year, and have outperformed every other sector.That changed during the week as investors banked profits and shares fell, but the sector held up amid the wider sell-off on Friday, losing 0.1 per cent to 262.15 points."
48;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-05-08T17:14:02Z;Variable annuities in doubt as big provider quits UK;;Fears have been raised over the future of variable annuities after one of the main providers pulled out of the UK market last week.US-owned life company Hartford Life said it would no longer do new business in the UK and it is moving its operations for existing customers to Dublin – a move affecting more than 18,000 policyholders.Anyone with a Hartford policy can transfer their pension to a new provider or stay with the company, which has promised to meet existing guarantees on its products.Variable annuities, also called “third-way” annuities, are viewed as a halfway house between an annuity – which provides a steady income in retirement in return for giving up a pension fund – and income drawdown – where investors keep control of their fund but could lose it all in the stock market.The products are offered in the form of a pension or an investment bond and come with a promise to pay a certain income in retirement – or guarantee a certain fund value – if the stock market falls below a given level.Nigel Callaghan, pensions analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, the adviser, said that anyone whose pension value was under the level guaranteed by Hartford should probably keep the policy.But Hartford’s withdrawal from the UK comes at a bad time for providers of variable annuities. They have struggled in recent months with the increased costs of providing guarantees on their policies.After the losses of last autumn, when the value of investors’ policies slumped below the levels guaranteed, insurers have been forced to pay out more than they had anticipated.This had already led MetLife and Aegon to raise the charges on their products in order to meet the increased costs they face – though the increases apply only to new rather than existing customers.Other major providers including Prudential and Standard Life have delayed launching variable annuities, citing the costs of providing the guarantee given the current market volatility.However, the three remaining providers – Aegon, Lincoln and MetLife – all said they had no plans to withdraw from the UK. MetLife said it had seen sales of its product “grow substantially” this year, with sales to the end of April about six times higher than the same time last year.Lincoln also said sales were up this year compared with a year ago. It added that there were no penalties at any stage for exiting its products.Investors with a MetLife product can turn off their guarantee, when no penalty applies, or encash it completely, when penalties may apply.Aegon’s investment bond can be cashed in at any time free of penalties. It also offers a third- way pension, though if this were transferred to other providers, the policyholder would lose the guarantee on the income.Third-way products were launched only three years ago in the UK with much fanfare, after successful sales in the US and Japan, but the concept has failed to take off with pensioners in this country.Variable annuities have been criticised for being too expensive and too difficult to understand.Independent financial advisers, through whom the products are exclusively sold, have also been wary of recommending them to clients.“One of the downsides of what’s happened in the economy is that people are really shying away from anything they don’t understand,” said Callaghan of Hargreaves Lansdown.“We think in theory they’re a good idea, but with the current crop, the numbers don’t stack up.”Experts said the future of third-way annuities would depend on whether providers could keep costs down.“The third-way product concept is still completely viable – it’s just whether people are happy to pay the costs,” said Andy Sanders, a senior consultant at Watson Wyatt.He said that while the market was still very new, the growth was “significant”. Total premiums from third-way annuities in 2008 amounted to more than £1bn, according to a Watson Wyatt study, though this equated to only 14,000 people actually taking out policies.Helen Turner, sales and marketing director at Lincoln, argued that the market volatility had helped to highlight the benefits that variable annuities could offer.“In the current climate, clients are demanding options at retirement that can potentially help them recover some of the investment losses suffered in recent months,” she said.
49;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-05-03T11:27:06Z;Pensions sector bucks the trend;;"The US defined contribution market has remained a relatively bright spot despite the doom and gloom in the financial services industry.While there have been cutbacks across the board, some asset managers and insurance companies that provide retirement investment products and services have been spared from making the significant cuts to personnel and product offerings that others have been forced to make. In some cases the contrary is occurring.With hopes of reaping the benefits of a market recovery, some firms have been expanding their DC businesses. Sticky retirement assets and the predictability of salary deferrals have turned the segment into a desirable corner of the market, where 401(k) assets may swell to $3.5bn (£2.3bn, €2.6bn) by 2013, according to consultancy Cerulli Associates.In addition, the demise of defined benefit plans has contributed to the transformation of DC plans into the primary retirement savings vehicle for many Americans. In fact, 42 per cent of workers expect an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan to be a major source of income in retirement, according to the 2009 Retirement Confidence Survey released by the Employee Benefit Research Institute.“In the DC space you have participant inertia, where contributions are flowing in,” says Luis Fleites, vice president, director of retirement markets for Financial Research
Corporation.Firms that have injected resources into their retirement businesses range from bundled providers of retirement services to asset managers to insurers. They include AllianceBernstein, Allianz, MFS, The Hartford, John Hancock and Putnam.AllianceBernstein, a firm recognised as a provider of asset management to DB plans, beefed up its DC structure last summer. It launched a DC business unit, currently with 80 members of staff. While the firm has laid off workers in recent months, the DC unit has the same headcount as when it was launched, says Dick Davies, head of product strategy for the firm.The company has been working as well on incorporating guaranteed income features into customised retirement plans, particularly into target-date funds. So far, just a few firms have incorporated annuity-type guaranteed income features into DC products and have met a lukewarm reaction from the marketplace. Providers say that is because of the slow sales cycle in the DC environment, coupled with the widespread perception that annuity-type products are complex and expensive. Whereas most solutions available count on a single insurer providing guarantees, AllianceBernstein aims to offer a multiple insurer product to large plans.Allianz Global Investors has also put a stake in the ground with the launch of a DC sales structure, and the hiring of three new retirement wholesalers. The new DC team is tapping Allianz’s 70 US retail wholesalers to seek out broker-dealers that serve the 401k small- and mid-market.“We are in what I would call the bricks and mortar of building out a dedicated DC practice,” says Andy Wilmot, head of Allianz’s DC business. The new division will function as an expansion of Pimco’s DC practice.MFS also created a DC investment-only business unit last year. The launch of the new business follows the sale of MFS’s record-keeping capabilities – MFS Retirement Services – to The Hartford in December 2007.Although the DC investment-only slice of the market continues to grow, growth has not come without challenges. DC investment-only managers had to readjust revenue expectations after a 23 per cent decline in assets under management in 2008, according to a survey of 17 firms conducted by Sway Research in January.Putnam is also betting on DC. While the shop has axed investment and non-investment positions since last autumn, it has boosted its DC team.Chief executive Bob Reynolds, credited with having a significant role in developing Fidelity’s 401k business, has placed DC front and centre in his turnround plan, since taking the helm at the company last summer.Although several of these recent DC initiatives focus on investment only, Putnam launched a new DC platform in late March. The shop partnered with FASCore, a subsidiary of Power Financial Corp, Putnam’s parent company, to structure the new platform.The Hartford is taking a slightly different approach and has recast its 401k programme to make it more appealing to small providers. The idea is to extend the sales of these plans to employers that have never sponsored a 401k plan before, in addition to small and medium-size plan providers.John Hancock, another insurer that focuses on providing 401k programmes to the small end of the market, recently expanded its capabilities with a 15 per cent increase of its retirement plan services workforce.Firms are likely to continue devoting resources to bolstering their DC business. Indeed, 401k plans have ample room to grow as just over 40 per cent of the non-farm work force is covered by these plans, according to the US Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration.Mariana Lemann is a reporter with Ignites.com, a Financial Times publication"
50;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-05-01T20:44:43Z;Oil rise overcomes Wall St bank uncertainty;;"US stocks edged higher on Friday as the rising oil price overcame uncertainty over banks’ balance sheets and Wall Street completed its seventh week of gains in eight.Chevron gained 1.2 per cent to $66.87 even after re­porting a 64 per cent decline in quarterly profit to its lowest level in five years, missing Wall Street’s expectations in the process.Its larger rival Exxon Mobil also saw gains, a day after it reported worse results than expected. Its shares picked up 2 per cent to $68.01.Meanwhile, Conoco Phillips, which last week beat analysts’ expectations with its first-quarter earnings, rose 3.7 per cent to $42.50.During the week, the market managed to shrug off fears over swine flu, a worse contraction in the US economy than expected and a delay in the results of the government’s stress tests on banks to finish higher.The benchmark S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.5 per cent. This was the Nasdaq’s eighth straight week of gains.But banking stocks finished on a low note after reports said the results of the government’s stress tests would be delayed from Monday until Thursday May 7 as banks debated the results and the government considered the best way to release the information.But Bill Webb, deputy chief investment officer of Gluskin Sheff, said: “I think investors are taking some comfort from the fact that the government has come up with a pragmatic process for the stress tests.”The general uncertainty weighed on confidence, which was also hit
by JPMorgan lowering its earnings forecasts for several institutions. Analysts warned: “We expect credit deterioration to persist, led by rising unemployment and continued sharp declines in home prices.”Bank of America closed down 2.6 per cent at $8.70 while Wells Fargo fell 2 per cent to $19.61.Morgan Stanley jumped, however, after John Mack, the chief executive, denied reports the company was looking to buy a regional bank. Its shares rose 9.2 per cent to $25.82.The markets took extra confidence from figures showing that the decline in manufacturing had slowed during April.The S&P 500 and the Dow both rose 0.5 per cent to 877.52 and 8,212.41, respectively. The Nasdaq gained 0.1 per cent to 1,719.20.Equities were also feeling the fall-out from several disappointing earnings announcements, especially in the financial sector.Mastercard became the second leading credit card company in two days to beat analysts’ estimates with its results. It saw some gains on Thursday after better-than- expected results at Visa lifted the sector as a whole but fell back on Friday as investors worried about falling revenues. Its shares lost 5.8 per cent to $172.90.MetLife, the biggest US life insurer, felt the effect of the recent market falls as performance in its investments dragged it to its first quarterly loss since 2001.Even excluding the investment performance, the company made a smaller profit than Wall Street had expected and its shares fell 7.7 per cent to $27.45.Hartford the insurer and financial services company, also suffered from the stock market crash as it was forced to pay out more on policies protecting customers from losses on investment accounts. This took the company to its third straight quarterly loss and its shares fell 7.9 per cent to $10.56.Aon, the insurance broker, was the third company in the sector to report falling revenues from investments. The company increased profits but fell short of analysts’ predictions and the shares lost 13.8 per cent to $36.38.Mr Webb said: “We have seen a lot of volatility this week but stocks have not moved outside of their recent range. It wouldn’t surprise me if the next few years are like this.”"
51;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-04-09T08:52:31Z;Wall St looks to brush off earnings gloom;;A reported extension of the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp) and a major deal in the homebuilding sector on Wednesday morning managed to ease the gloom on Wall Street on brought by a disappointing beginning to earnings season.Life insurers surged after reports said that the Treasury was ready to extend Tarp, the scheme aimed at recapitalising distressed banks, to banks and thrifts owned by those insurers.Lincoln National leapt 38.5 per cent to $9.54 on the news, while Principal Financial gained 28 per cent to $12.99 and Hartford Financial picked up 25.2 per cent to $10.58.“An injection of capital similar to the banks would provide enough capital for even the most thinly capitalized institutions to weather a prolonged and protracted credit cycle if the S&P 500 does not drop below 600,” wrote Thomas Gallagher at Credit Suisse.Meanwhile Pulte Homes announced it was to buy Centex in a $1.3bn deal that would create the country’s largest homebuilder by sales. The deal, which would be paid for using Pulte stocks, valued Centex's shares at $10.50, a significant premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Centex jumped 27.6 per cent to $9.72, while Pulte fell 4.3 per cent to $10.31.This gave further confidence to the sector after the number of mortgage applications was shown to have risen 4.7 per cent during the week ending April 3 as low interest rates begin to take effect. Lennar benefitted from that strength, gaining 10.9 per cent to $7.91.The benchmark S&P 500 index managed to find moderate gains after two loss-making sessions, rising 0.7 per cent to 821.26 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6 per cent to 7,832.97 points and the Nasdaq Composite index lifted 1.5 per cent to $1,584.31.Alcoa was the first major company to report its first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of $0.59 per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices. This was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell in post-market trade on Tuesday. But it recovered during Wednesday morning’s trade, with many analysts saying the results could have been even worse. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $7.86.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that the disappointing results from Alcoa were unlikely to spook investors. “The company tends to disappoint and is unlikely to move the market,” he wrote.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results. The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by disappointing demand in Europe and Australia over the winter festivities. Its shares lost 3.4 per cent to $11.24.Family Dollar Stores was able to increase its profits in line with expectations as cash-strapped consumers shopped in its budget stores. The company made $0.60 per share, as forecast, but the shares rose after the company said it would make better profits than previously predicted for the fiscal year. They gained 5.8 per cent to $34.55.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, made a profit of $0.55 per share, which was lower than its previous quarter, but far outstripped consensus expectations of $0.44 per share. Its shares picked up 19.2 per cent to $30.41.“It’s not earth shaking, and there is still a lot of uncertainty out there,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “But if we see several companies report in line with expectations, we may see support come into the market.”Mr Cook also said the results for consumer companies were encouraging, even though ABC figures showed that consumer confidence declined during the week ending April 5. “We are seeing consumer spending increase even if incomes are falling. People are still buying,” said Mr Cook.The agricultural company Mosaic reported particularly disappointing results however, although it did not prove a major drag on the equities market as it is not listed on any of the best known market measures. The company made $0.18 per share compared to analysts’ estimates of $0.22 after prices tumbled last year. Its shares lost 1.2 per cent to $42.42.Many analysts are scrambling to lower their estimates on companies before the earnings season gathers pace next week. Wednesday saw Morgan Stanley fall after Oppenheimer slashed its forecast for the company’s first quarter earnings from $0.37 in profits per share to $0.59 in losses. Morgan Stanley’s shares fell 2.5 per cent to $22.73.Energy stocks were the major drag on the index however, as the price of oil continued to fall. Early in New York, oil was trading $0.89 lower at $48.26 per barrel of US crude. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both dropped 0.8 per cent to $68.18 and $67.84 respectively.European stocks were mixed early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 0.1 per cent higher at 761.15 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly down, with the Nikkei 225 average closing 2.7 per cent lower at 8,595.01 points.Bond yields were down. The yield on the two-year Treasury note dropped 1 basis point to 0.899 per cent and that on the ten-year note fell 4bp to 2.858 per cent.The dollar was up against most major currencies except the yen early in New York. It gained 0.5 per cent to $1.3202 against the euro.Gold was trading $0.89 higher at $880.15 per troy ounce.
52;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-04-08T20:22:09Z;US life insurers rally on bailout hopes;;Shares of US life assurance companies surged on Wednesday on hopes the US Treasury would soon approve a number of the sector’s troubled companies for access to government bailout funds.The Treasury is nearing a decision on whether to provide funds to several life assurance companies with bank subsidiaries, and announcements could come in the next week or two.A Treasury spokesman said: “There are a number of life insurers who met the requirements for the capital purchase programme because of their thrift or bank holding company status.”Lincoln National led the sector’s gains on Wednesday, soaring 36.2 per cent in morning trade to $9.39. Principal Financial Group rose 23.15 per cent to $12.50, while Hartford Financial Services rallied 21 per cent to $10.23 and Genworth Financial rose to 12.9 per cent to $2.36. Phoenix rose 15.3 per cent to $1.73. All have bank holding company or savings and loan status, or own a thrift.The decision to open the bailout programme to insurers with bank subsidiaries was made by the Bush administration. The Obama administration has maintained this position.Since then some life insurers that did not have a bank decided to acquire one to become eligible for bailout funds, including Genworth Financial, Hartford Financial and Lincoln National. Seven insurers have announced they have applied for the funds. Officials indicated the total number of applications was less than 10.“These companies are among the hundreds of financial institutions in the [capital purchase programme] pipeline that will be reviewed and funded as appropriate on a rolling basis,” said the Treasury spokesman.While there is a general expectation that the bank subsidiaries of life assurance groups will receive some share of bailout funds, officials cautioned that final decisions on individual applications have not been made. Administration officials said there was no additional allocation of bailout money for life assurers – and any amount given to their banks would come from funds already set aside for banks in general.The Treasury is sticking to its estimate that it will allocate about $218bn under the capital purchase programme inherited from the Bush administration. It has already allocated $198.5bn, but it also expects about $25bn in capital will be returned and could be reallocated to new recipients.The prospect of a near-term injection of Troubled Assets Relief programme capital comes as the sector has suffered from losses related to guarantees on investment products, as well as losses from portfolios that were heavily exposed to the financial sector and equity markets in general.The losses have eroded capital, leading to a string of rating agency downgrades that have made it more difficult for some insurers to raise new money.
53;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-04-08T18:49:21Z;Wall Street stages end-of-day rally;;"An extension of the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) and a large deal in the homebuilding sector sparked a rally in stocks on Wednesday, even as warnings on the health of the economy from the Federal Reserve threatened to erase the gains.Minutes from the latest policy meeting showed Fed economists lowered their gross domestic product estimates for the second half of this year and 2010, saying: “Real GDP [is] expected to flatten out gradually over the second half of this year and then to expand slowly next year”.This initially killed much of the earlier gains, but equities staged a second rally late in the session to bring stocks close to their highs for the day.The rise was led by life assurers, which surged after the Treasury said it would extend the Tarp – the scheme aimed at recapitalising distressed banks – to banks and thrifts owned by those insurers.Lincoln National leapt 32.8 per cent to $9.15, while Principal Financial gained
21.3 per cent to $12.31 and Hartford Financial picked up 13.5 per cent to $9.59.“An injection of capital similar to the banks would provide enough capital for even the most thinly capitalised institutions to weather a prolonged and protracted credit cycle if the S&P 500 does not drop below 600,” wrote Thomas Gallagher at Credit Suisse.Meanwhile, Pulte Homes said it was to buy Centex in a $1.3bn takeover that would create the country’s largest homebuilder by sales. The deal valued Centex’s shares at $10.50, a significant premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Centex jumped 18.9 per cent to $9.06, while Pulte fell 10.5 per cent to $9.64.This gave further confidence to the sector after the number of mortgage applications was shown to have risen 4.7 per cent during the week ending April 3, as low interest rates begin to take effect. Lennar also benefited, gaining 5.1 per cent to $7.49.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent up at 825.16 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6 per cent to 7,837.11 points.The Nasdaq Composite index, up 1.9 per cent to 1,590.66 points, continued to outperform on strength from the technology sector, which some analysts have said will lead the market out of the downturn. Microsoft was the exerted the greatest pull, gaining 2.3 per cent to $19.19.Alcoa was the first leading company to report first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of 59 cents per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices.That was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell before recovering some ground on Wednesday, and closed 3.5 per cent up at $8.06.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results.The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by falling demand in Europe and Australia over the Christmas period. Its shares lost 5.1 per cent to $11.05.Family Dollar Stores was able to increase its profits in line with expectations as cash-strapped consumers shopped in its budget stores. The company made 60 cents per share, as forecast, but the shares rose after it said it would make better profits than previously predicted for the fiscal year. The stock gained 6 per cent to $34.63.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, made a profit of 55 cents per share, which was lower than its previous quarter, but far outstripped consensus expectations of 44 cents per share.

54;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Wall Street rallies despite falling financials;;"US stocks rallied strongly on Thursday to put the benchmark S&P 500 index on course for its biggest monthly gain since 1974.Strength in the cash-rich technology sector, meanwhile, meant the Nasdaq Composite index is now in positive territory for the year.The S&P 500 rose 2.3 per cent to 832.86 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.3 per cent to 7,924.56. The Nasdaq Composite index surged 3.8 per cent to 1,587, putting it 0.6 per cent up for 2009.Technology stocks continued their good performance for the year. Apple gained 3.2 per cent to $109.87 and Hewlett Packard rose 7.1 per cent to $33.20.Paychex, the payroll services company, was the biggest gainer on the index, up 9.6 per cent to $25.88 after it reported better results than expected.This came despite weakness in the banking sector after Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said there would be “new rules of the game” for financial regulation.Confidence in the sector was already fragile after Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Bank of America’s debt and investors took the opportunity to take profits after a month’s strong gains.Bank of America fell 1.6 per cent to $7.58, Citigroup dropped 4.8 per cent to $2.81 and Wells Fargo lost 2.9 per cent to $15.95.“Any time there is any dose of uncertainty addedto the landscape, investors are going to take profits,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at
The Hartford.The market also continued to adjust to Mr Geithner’s plan to clear the banks of their toxic assets, with some analysts warning it might be bad for banks’ shareholders in the long run.“It might save the banks, but that doesn’t mean it will save their shareholders,” he said. “They might be left with something that’s not particularly profitable,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.The banking falls were exacerbated by figures showing that the US economy continues to deteriorate, with the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits hitting record highs.Gross domestic product, meanwhile, fell 6.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the last three months of 2008, although this was better than analysts expected.But banks failed to drag down the market as better- than-expected company results and rising commodity prices counteracted negative economic data.Shares also rallied strongly in the afternoon after a successful auction of seven-year Treasury notes raised hopes the government would be able to fund its stimulus plans.Strong commodities helped industrial companies perform better than any other sector. As metals prices rose, mining companies saw the benefit. Newmont Mining gained 2.3 per cent to $46.90 and Freeport McMoRan picked up 5.9 per cent to $43.05. Caterpillar, which makes mining machinery, rose 6.5 per cent to $30.78.Consumer companies also performed well after positive results showed consumer spending had not collapsed as badly as feared.In the food and drinks sector, Conagra and Dr Pepper Snapple exceeded expectations.Conagra, the frozen food maker, rose 9.2 per cent to $16.99 after it said it expected its consumer foods business, which accounts for the majority of its sales, to improve in the second half of the fiscal year.Dr Pepper Snapple gained 15.2 per cent to $17.87, having made 39 cents in earnings per share excluding certain items.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, provided further evidence that consumer spending remained more resilient than estimated as it reported better revenues and earnings than expected.The company forecast that it would beat analysts’ predictions for its 2010 profits. It was one of the highest risers in the S&P, jumping 12.6 per cent to $37.67.The figures helped lift other consumer companies including Wal-Mart, which rose 2.1 per cent to $52.76.General Motors surged after reports said the company had agreed plans
with 6,000 of its staff who belong to the United Auto Workers union to take buy-out offers. This was more than analysts had expected, and GM’s stock rose 14.1 per cent to $3.41."

Insurers Prudentialand Lincoln National rose 26.5 per cent to $21.11 and 32.7 per cent to $9.70 respectively, while State Street, the asset manager, gained 21.4 per cent to $29.97.“There is a lot more detail in Mr Geithner’s latest plan,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. “Investors believe this plan, at least initially, is the most viable possible one for cleaning up the banks. The most serious problem will be the pricing of assets, but for now, the equities market is relieved just to see some detail.”But Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “This is something that could have ended this much, much earlier, but now it’s just a mild positive.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 7.1 per cent up at 822.92 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.8 per cent to 7,775.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite index gained 6.8 per cent to 1,555.77 points.The last time the S&P gained as much was on the back of a cut in interest rates from the Federal Reserve last year. Financial stocks staged their biggest rally since November.President Barack Obama also helped calm nerves on Wall Street when he sounded less than positive about a bill passed by the House of Representatives on Friday to impose a 90 per cent tax on the bonuses of high earners at bailed-out banks. Mr Obama said the government needed to find ways of reacting “that are both legal, that are constitutional”, fuelling hopes he may veto it if it passes the Senate.“The movement to tax the bonus of Tarp [troubled asset relief programme] players has put a cloud over the financial industry, and risks slowing the recovery of the financial sector and economy,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Energy stocks rose, following the oil price, which reached new highs for the year. Chevrongained 6.9 per cent to $69.15 and Exxon Mobil rose 6.7 per cent to $70.53.Investors also took confidence from better figures on sales of existing homes in February. They had been expected to fall, but rose by 5 per cent on the previous month.Homebuilders were some of the best-performing stocks on the S&P. Lennar rose
20.4 per cent to $9.76, whileKB Homepicked up 15.4 per cent to $12.98.Steel companies helped the industrial sector rise more than most after Citi said macroeconomic conditions pointed to a better future. Citi wrote: “The manufacturing downturn is no longer accelerating at this point, and upside opportunity outweighs downside risk in our opinion.”Nucor, one of the country’s largest steelmakers, rose 7.3 per cent to $40.20, while AK Steel picked up 14.3 per cent to $7.90 and US Steelrose 12 per cent to $22.08.General Electric also boosted the sector after Moody’s cut its rating by two notches, but gave it a stable outlook. Investors
had expected worse and the company’s shares rose 9.3 per cent to $10.43.Intelrose 5.9 per cent to $15.52 after the company said it would overhaul its pay structure, with no rise to executives’ pay.There was also good news for consumer companies as luxury jeweller Tiffany gained 15.5 per cent to $23.37 after its earnings beat analysts’ expectations in spite of a 34 per cent fall in sales in its flagship Manhattan store for the past quarter.Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, also beat expectations, with reduced profits coming from reorganisation costs rather than falling sales. Its shares advanced
9.4 per cent to $26.58."

The market recovered after the benchmark S&P 500 index hit 754 points, just two points away from an 11-year closing low, and the White House sought to reassure the markets that it was committed to a private banking system.Bank of America lost 3.6 per cent on Friday to $3.79 having earlier lost as much as 35.6 per cent, while Citigroup finished off 22.3 per cent to $1.95.After four days of declines the shares of Citi and Bofa had fallen 33.6 per cent and 44.7 per cent, respectively, as shareholders feared the government would take control and wipe out common equity. “Shareholders are taking what little is left on the table,” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global. “A little is better than zero.”Other banks were also hard hit as the S&P financial index passed another grim milestone, dropping to its lowest level since 1994.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, the two biggest banks in the US by market capitalisation, fell 3.4 per cent to $19.90 and 9.2 per cent to $10.91, respectively. That took their losses for the week to 19.5 per cent and 31.6 per cent.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said the market feared nationalisation was “obviously very, very close. The more you see the deterioration in the share price, the closer you get to that possibility.”The S&P and Dow Jones Industrial Average finished off 1.1 per cent at 770.05 points and 1.3 per cent at 7,365.67 points, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,441.23 points.Downbeat results from Lowe’s weighed on consumer sectors.The shares fell 6.6 per cent to $15.86 after the home improvement retailer disclosed a sharp drop in quarterly profit.JC Penney rose 1.2 per cent to $15.10. Although the department store chain beat expectations for the fourth quarter, it forecast a wider-than-expected loss for the current period.For the holiday-shortened week, the S&P lost 6.9 per cent, the Dow 6.1 per cent and the Nasdaq 6.2 per cent.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 16 per cent over the week to 49.3. The sell-off took the S&P 500 2.3 per cent away from an 11-year low, prompting fears among technical analysts that the market could be set for yet more heavy selling were the benchmark index to breach the key technical support level.Insurers came under pressure, off 13.9 per cent overall, after Fitch cut its ratings on the senior unsecured debt of Prudential Financial to BBB and issued a negative outlook.Shares in Prudential lost 30.3 per cent to $18.51.Weighing on the wider market, General Motors and Chrysler said they needed more government support than the $17.4bn already approved.GM shares lost 31.2 per cent to $1.77 while Ford, which has not yet received any bail-out funds, fell 9.7 per cent to $1.58.Homebuilders were also among the biggest losers, off 19.6 per cent overall, after the latest Commerce Department figures showed that US housing starts and permits fell by more than expected in January to the lowest levels on record.The technology sector shed 7.1 per cent overall after Hewlett-Packard’s results, which prompted concerns over the prospects of other computer makers.Shares in HP, a bellwether for the industry, lost 12.7 per cent to $31.24 after the
company missed its first-quarter sales estimates and issued a worse-than-expected forecast for the coming year.Dell shed 8.9 per cent to $8.41 over the week."
57;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-02-19T23:59:23Z;US bank stocks fall to 17-year low;;US banking shares hit their lowest level since 1992 on Thursday as fears mounted that the government would be forced to nationalise a key institution.Further heavy selling of key names – Bank of America and Citigroup were once again among the worst performing, down 14 per cent to $3.93 and 13.8 per cent to $2.51, respectively – helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its lowest level in six years.Shares in several regional banks also sustained heavy losses as the S&P financial index dropped 5.2 per cent to its lowest level since 1995.“Every time someone mentions the word [nationalisation] then investors shiver – and with good reason,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “There’s a lot of angst over what [US Treasury Secretary] Geithner’s going to propose.”Insurers also suffered badly after Fitch cut its ratings on the senior unsecured debt of Prudential Financial to BBB and issued a negative outlook. Shares in Prudential lost 15.9 per cent to $19.02 while Hartford Financial tumbled 24.5 per cent to $7.73.Talk of stake-building helped Principal Financial buck a downward trend for much of the session a day after the insurer said that it was exploring options to raise capital. The shares succumbed late in the day, off 0.4 per cent to $10.51.Relative strength in the energy, consumer and telecoms sectors helped pare the losses in the wider market, which drifted between losses and gains in choppy trading.The S&P 500 closed down 1.2 per cent at 778.94, its fourth consecutive retreat.The S&P slumped this week beneath the psychologically significant 800 level for the first time since November, which has prompted concerns among technical analysts that the benchmark index would test an 11-year low. The S&P index stands only 3.5 per cent away from that bottom.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.2 per cent lower at 7,465.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index 1.7 per cent weaker at 1,442.82.The tech sector shed 3.3 per cent overall in the wake of Hewlett-Packard’s results, which prompted concerns over the prospects of other computer manufacturers.Shares in HP, a bellwether for the industry, lost 7.9 per cent to $31.39 after the group missed its first-quarter sales estimates and issued a worse-than-expected forecast for the coming year.“We think the drivers of the revenue weakness are not isolated to HP but instead a reflection of the macro blues,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan. Dell was one of the worst hit in the fallout, off 6.1 per cent to $8.12.Elsewhere, earnings that were not quite as bad as feared gave bargain hunters at some reasons to return to other sectors.Energy stocks found positive territory after the latest government report showed an unexpected drop in crude inventories.ExxonMobil edged 0.3 per cent higher to $72.16 even though Barclays downgraded its view from “overweight” to “equal weight”.Paul Cheng, analyst, said the stock’s valuation “appears toppy” and said the group may lower its medium term production target at the forthcoming analyst meeting.Telecoms performed relatively well, lifted 1 per cent overall by a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss from Sprint Nextel. The shares leapt 19.9 per cent to $3.25 as the group also said it expected subscriber losses to improve this year.Consumer discretionaries also outperformed. Whole Foods bounced 37.2 per cent to $12.75 as its first-quarter earnings fell less than forecast. “Even with the considerable economic headwind, the company, we believe, is beginning to take the steps to reverse the decline in its operating performance,” wrote analysts at Jefferies, who upgraded their recommendation on the stock to “buy”.Video game shares did well on an upbeat forecast from GameStop, which rallied 7.1 per cent to $26.63.Meanwhile, shares in drugstore Walgreens added 0.7 per cent to $25.83 on the back of well-received results from peer CVS Caremark, which climbed 6.4 per cent to $28.71.Bucking the upward momentum in the consumer sector, however, was Expedia, which lost 7.4 per cent to $7.90 after the online travel agency disclosed worse-than-expected earnings.

The shares dropped 16.4 per cent to $10.13, which Friedman, Billings, Ramsey analyst Scott Valentin said was “driven by misplaced chatter over a debt covenant breach.”Regional banks did badly, down 8.7 per cent overall, while the financial sector shed 9.8 per cent.The consumer staples sector failed to find positive territory in spite of better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Wal-Mart, which were helped by strong sales.The world’s largest retailer was one of only eight stocks in the S&P 500 to find positive territory, up 3.7 per cent to $48.24.Although the best performing of the main sectors, consumer staples nevertheless shed 1.8 per cent overall as all 10 industry groups finished sharply in the red.Meanwhile, investors remained concerned that Washington’s $787bn economic stimulus package – which President Obama signed into law on Tuesday– may not be enough to stave-off a deepening recession.“They don’t think the stimulus, the way it’s been presented, is going to do much to the economy in the short term,” Pran Tiku, president of Peak Financial Management, said of the market’s participants. “They have nothing to hang their hat on.”The S&P closed down 4.6 per cent at 789.17, less than 5 per cent away from an 11-year low hit last autumn. The index began the year more than 20 per cent above that nadir.The Dow finished down 3.8 per cent to 7,552.60 and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 4.2 per cent at 1,470.66. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a measure of anxiety known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 12.9 per cent to 48.5.Concerns over the Obama administration’s ability to support the banking sector had pushed financial shares lower in recent sessions.The industrial sector also came under heavy selling pressure after data from the New York Federal Reserve showed manufacturing production in the state fell to its lowest level of the recession so far.Also weighing on the market, General Motors and Chrysler were expected to make clear that they need more government support than the $17.4bn already approved. GM shares were off 12.8 per cent to $2.18 while Ford, which has not yet received any bail-out funds, fell 4 per cent to $1.69.Commodity stocks also did badly. Freeport-Mcmoran dropped 11.1 per cent to $27.12 while energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil, off 4.4 per cent to $71.28, did badly as oil prices fell sharply.However, Newmont Mining jumped 3.4 per cent to $12.49 as gold prices rallied.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola gave back 2.9 per cent to $42.60 following a reasonable performance last week on the back of well-received results. Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling, its second-biggest bottler, disclosed an unexpected fourth-quarter loss and warned it could not provide a forecast for the year.The US markets were closed in the previous session due to the President’s Day holiday.
59;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2009-02-10T21:53:00Z;Wall Street falls on Geithner announcement;;"Big name banking stocks were among the heaviest losers on Wall Street on Tuesday after Tim Geithner’s much-awaited financial sector rescue proposals failed to instil investors in the stricken sector with confidence.The S&P 500 fell by 2.1 per cent in 10 minutes just before the Treasury secretary set out how the Obama administration would use the remaining financial
sector bail-out fund.The sell-off worsened as Mr Geithner spoke and continued throughout the day. Senate approval of the economic stimulus bill failed to halt the widespread decline, which wiped out much of the previous week’s strong gains.“There was a very long drum roll leading up to this,” said Stephen Wood, senior portfolio strategist at Russell Investments. “It didn’t happen.”Financials led the retreat, hurt by persistent fears of outright nationalisation of key institutions in which equity holders would be wiped out. The sector lost 10.9 per cent overall.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, now the two largest US banks by market capitalisation, fell 9.8 per cent to $24.62, and 14.2 per cent to $16.35, respectively.Bank of America dropped 19.3 per cent to $5.56, while Citigroupdropped 15.2 per cent to $3.35.Regional banks – key winners in the previous session – suffered some of the heaviest losses. Insurers also did particularly badly, off 9.1 per cent overall on concerns of the need for fresh capital raising.Standard & Poor’s and Fitch cut their credit ratings on Hartford Financial Services, which fell 13.2 per cent to $13.05.Lincoln National fell 18.9 per cent to $14.42 after the group reported its first loss in six years and Moody’s warned it may cut its credit ratings.The S&P 500 closed down 4.9 per cent at 827.16, paring the gains since President Obama’s inauguration day to just 2.7 per cent.The benchmark index stands 4.8 per cent below its 50-day moving average and less than 10 cent away from an 11-year low hit last November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 4.6 per cent weaker at 7,888.88 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 4.2 per cent lower at 1,524.73. The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 6.9 per cent to 46.7.Traders had remained reluctant to place bearish bets on banks before the administration unveiled its plans. But all 10 sectors were sharply in the red on Tuesday. Commodity stocks gave the market some support early in the session but finished sharply lower. The material and energy sectors finished off 4.5 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively.Alcoa was one of the highest profile victims outside the financial sector, pushed 10 per cent lower to $7.65 after S&P cut the aluminium producer’s credit rating to the lowest investment grade.Meanwhile, a glut of other downbeat developments once again underscored the extent of the recession and the toll it was taking on US corporations.Food retailers were sold off after Citigroup highlighted the risk of a “modern day price war” and cut its target price on a host of stocks in the sector. Safeway shed 6.4 per cent to $20.50 after Deborah Weinswig, analyst, downgraded her recommendation on the stock to “sell”.Commerce Department data showed US wholesale inventories fell by a record 1.4 per cent in December, twice as much as forecast.Meanwhile, General Motors unveiled proposals to cut 10,000 salaried jobs and impose pay cuts on other workers as part of its restructuring plan. GM shares fell 4.6 per cent to $2.70.Molson Coors lost 7.9 per cent to $37.30 after the brewer disclosed worse-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.Only nine S&P 500 stocks found positive territory. Among them, Qwest jumped 2.4 per cent to $3.45 on well-received results, but the telecoms sector took scant comfort from its figures, off 4.8 per cent overall.Intercontinental-Exchange edged 1.3 per cent lower to $61.44. Investors had looked beyond a 24 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit to focus on a jump in commissions but the shares succumbed late in the session. The sell-off also took in erstwhile defensive consumer stocks such as Procter & Gamble, off 2.8 per cent to $51.45."

It’s leading to a festering of rumours,” she said, adding that this was contributing to the selling pressure.Citigroup lost a further 15.5 per cent to $3.83, just above a nadir ahead of its rescue in November. JPMorgan, which had dropped 17.8 per cent since the turn of the year, fell a further 6.1 per cent to $24.34 even though the 76 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profit to 7 cents a share was not as bad as feared.The losses came after Moody’s Investors Service cut the debt ratings on the bank by one level to Aa3 following the results. The bank posted a profit only as a result of special items.“We’re not through the worst of it yet,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Among the regional lenders to sustain heavy losses, Marshall & Ilsley sank 26 per cent to $7.93 after the bank cut its dividend from 32 cents to 1 cent a share following an unexpected fourth-quarter loss.Bank stocks slid to a 13-year low in the previous session as the wider market suffered from the latest in a series of sharp sell-offs.The wider market recovered some ground in late trade as lower oil prices gave a boost to retailers, which rallied 3.9 per cent.The S&P 500 finished 0.1 per cent higher at 843.73, having earlier slid as much as 3 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 8,212.49 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 1.5 per cent stronger at 1,511.84.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was up 3.4 per cent, above 50 for the first time in a month.Solar stocks rallied on a deal for First Solar to supply panels for Masdar City,
the so-called green city planned in Abu Dhabi, which pushed its shares up 6.9 per cent to $142.58.In technology, Inteladded 1.6 per cent to $13.29 and added a further 1.7 per cent after the market closed following its fourth-quarter results. The bellwether chipmarket disclosed a 90 per cent drop in profit that was broadly in line with expectations that had been lowered last week. All 10 economic sectors spent much of the session in the red as economic data continued to paint a largely bleak picture of the prospects for corporate earnings.All 10 economic sectors spent much of the session in the red as economic data continued to paint a largely bleak picture of the prospects for corporate earnings.Property stocks did badly as figures from RealtyTrac showed foreclosures jumped by 81 per cent last year.

Meanwhile, Labor Department data showed initial claims for unemployment benefits last week rose by 54,000 – more than forecast – to 524,000.Manufacturing in New York contracted for a ninth consecutive month in January. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic index rose from a downwardly revised minus 27.88 in December to a still-weak minus 22.2. A reading below zero indicates a contraction.However, by the close telecoms was the only sector other than financials to still languish in negative territory.Materials was the best performing sector of the day, up 2.9 per cent overall."
61;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-12-05T22:10:41Z;US indices stage last-minute rally;;Spectacular gains among insurers helped Wall Street stocks shrug off dire US employment figures and end a volatile week with a strong rally.Metlife and Prudential jumped 22.5 per cent to $30.76 and 34.7 per cent to $28.52, respectively, ahead of a state insurance regulator meeting this weekend, which could result in more relaxed capital requirements.A UBS note that said regulatory changes could come as soon as next Tuesday also provided support to the sector.Hartford Financial Services topped the leader board in reaction to its well received investor day presentation. The battered stock soared 102.4 per cent to $14.59 after the company said it was well capitalised.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 3.7 per cent at 876.07, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.1 per cent higher at 8,635.42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 4.4 per cent stronger at 1,509.31.The rally – albeit in light volume – came in spite of closely-watched Labor Department payroll figures that were much worse than even the most dire predictions.In reaction to the figures, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped as much as 3.2 per cent earlier in the session to test a weekly low of 815 that had been hit during a heavy sell-off on Monday.But traders appeared to be encouraged when the market failed to break through the key technical level, and the market subsequently rallied into the close.“There’s a lot of things you can use to predict a bottom. One of them is when the market stops reacting adversely to negative news,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.The reaction to the steepest job losses since 1974 was the latest example this week of a rally despite bleak news.Retailers gave bulls a faint glimmer of hope when traders shrugged off the worst monthly sales performance this decade. The S&P Retail index was up 6 cent for the week in spite of the release of November sales figures that were nevertheless not quite as dire as the most pessimistic predictions.Wal-Mart helped the sector with well received sales and shares in the discounter were up 4.2 per cent to $58.21 for the week.Macy’s which disclosed a sharp drop in like-for-like sales, finished the week up 16 per cent at $8.61.Friday’s rally helped the S&P pare its losses for the five-day period to 2.3 per cent, the Dow was down 2.2 per cent and the Nasdaq 1.7 per cent lower.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up 7.8 per cent over the week and at 59.57 it indicated elevated signs of distress. The energy sector led weekly declines as it fell 11.3 per cent on a sharp slide in oil prices.The future of the ailing US car industry was among primary investor concerns as executives returned to Capitol Hill to plead for a $34bn bailout. General Motors finished the week down 22.1 per cent to $4.08 although Ford, which said it expected to at least break even by 2011, was up 1.1 per cent to $2.72.Defensive stocks failed to offer investors a haven – Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble fell 1.9 per cent to $45.98 and 2.7 per cent to $62.63, respectively – but there were bright spots elsewhere.Homebuilders finished the week 19.5 per cent higher amid reports that the Treasury Department was working on a plan to reduce mortgage rates on new home loans.Also helping the sector were data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showing that its measure of mortgage application volumes had jumped the most last week since the index was created in 1990.On Friday, the financial sector rallied 8.6 per cent to lead the gains and took in Goldman Sachs, which jumped 4.7 per figures cent to $70.72 even after Morgan Stanley widened its fourth-quarter loss forecast from $1.09 to $4.45 a share.
62;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-11-25T16:33:48Z;Wall Street dispatch: Thought is needed on rewriting the rules of the game;;"A compressed version of the past 18 months on Wall Street and in Washington might read something like this.Hank Paulson, standing on a stage bearing the US government’s logo, holding large jute sacks: “One at a time please, there are funds for almost everybody …OK, here we go, one for you, JPMorgan; please share that with Bear Stearns”.Jamie Dimon, sheepishly: “$30bn. Thanks, Mr Secretary …I just want to let you know we are only doing this for the greater good of the …”Paulson, interrupting: “Fannie? Freddie? Where have you gone when the country needs you? Oh there you are, hiding behind the government guarantees as usual. Never mind, here is $100bn each, try not to spend it all at once.”He hands over specially designed sacks with few strings attached before continuing: “Right, who’s next ? No, Lehman, not you. I have been telling you to find a partner for months. If I give you money, Mr Moral Hazard, our greatest enemy, will destroy us …Fine, be like that, then. See if I care if you file for bankruptcy.”Paulson’s attention is drawn to the loud breathing of a gaunt figure wasting away in a corner of the room. “What’s that, AIG? You need another sackful of cash? The first one was not enough? All right, give me the first bag back and I will give you this one with $150bn in it. Here we go. “As they exchange bags, Paulson notices there is something wrong with the deal: “Hey, just a second! This bag is almost empty! Oh, never mind …”OK, I do know that this is not how it happened, but you get my point. There has to be a better, less haphazard, way of allocating resources to stricken financial companies, especially when the money is coming from taxpayers’ wallets.Treasury and Federal Reserve officials insist that, given the speed at which some of Wall Street’s finest unravelled, they had little choice but to make up policy as they went along.But the results of the US government’s attempts at improvising its way out of a crisis that was not unexpected (am I right, Mr Greenspan?) are too painful to be ignored.The credit market freeze that followed Lehman’s bankruptcy is by now well known. The two rescues of AIG – a perfect specimen of moral hazard if I ever saw one – have been widely written about.Less analysed has been the fact that these events, and many others, took place within a policy framework that was fundamentally incoherent.Was it right to tell healthier banks such as JPMorgan and Wells Fargo to take federal aid, and subject themselves to executive pay limits and general congressional harassment, simply because less robust rivals wanted to avoid the stigma of a government bail-out.What will be the implications on the funding strategies and business models of companies such as American Express and the insurer Hartford Financial, which have been allowed to become bank-holding companies?And what will happen to the hedge funds and other investors who banked on tapping the government’s $700bn original plan to buy troubled assets, now that the Treasury has transformed it into a pool to buy stakes in banks?These types of questions should be discussed in the legislative bonanza that is certain to follow the crisis.Unfortunately, the debate over the new regulatory framework has so far centred on who will do what, with much speculation over the death of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the granting of wider powers to the Federal Reserve.Before naming the players and their roles, legislators ought to give some thought to the rules of the game, so that the next generation of regulators will not find itself having to shoot in the dark when the next crisis erupts.I do know that each turmoil is different, that financial bubbles do not repeat themselves, and so on. But it would not hurt to lay down some basic principles.Principles that, for example, explain whether equity and/or bond holders stand to suffer when a distressed company is rescued by the governmentThat would clearly lay out the room for manoeuvre the Fed has in bail-outs to avoid a repeat of the Lehman drama, when the monetary authorities lacked both the power and the money to buy the toxic assets needed to facilitate a deal.And, if legislators feel brave, they could even have a stab at defining what a “systemic” institution is, helping investors understand why a regional lender such as Wachovia was saved while Lehman, an international investment bank, was let go.Crafting laws around these issues is no doubt more difficult than taking pot shots at subdued Wall Street types in televised Washington hearings, but the prize is well worth it.No future US Treasury Secretary should be asked to stand around doling out sackfuls of cash without some clear rules."
63;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;US banks rally after rescue deal;;"US stocks extended Friday’s rally on Monday as investors welcomed the rescue package for Citigroup and fear retreated as the market digested more details on President-elect Obama’s economic team.Citigroup shares surged 57.8 per cent to $5.95 in reaction to the US government’s move shortly before midnight on Sunday.As part of its rescue of Citi, the US government entered an agreement to guarantee up to $306bn in problematic assets and inject $20bn in capital to restore confidence in the ailing bank.Fears about the possible collapse of Citigroup sent shares of the bank into freefall last week and they closed on Friday down 87 per cent for the year.News of the aid for Citigroup led to a rally of shares in other banks. Bank of America rose 27.2 per cent to $14.59, while Morgan Stanley leapt 33.13 per cent to $13.38 and Goldman Sachs climbed 26.5 per cent to $65.42 by the close in New York. Morgan and Goldman are being transformed into bank holding companies.The S&P investment banking index was 25.6 per cent higher at 47 while the S&P financials sector was 18.6 per cent up at 153.38.Insurance stocks, which were also hard hit last week, enjoyed a solid rebound. Hartford Financial Services leapt 26.1 per cent to $6.24, while Genworth Financial climbed 88.9 per cent to $1.70 and Lincoln National was up 10.5 per cent to $7.03.All three leading stock market indices posted healthy gains on the back of the Citigroup rescue.The S&P 500 ended up 6.5 per cent to 851.81 points; the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.3 per cent to 1,472.02 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.9 per cent to 8,443.39 points.The Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 11 per cent to 64.70, still indicating high levels of distress but some way down on recent highs of more
than 80.The S&P 500 plunged to an 11½-year low last week before rallying strongly on Friday as details emerged of the likely choices for key positions in President-elect Obama’s administration.Mr Obama confirmed the nomination of Timothy Geithner, chairman of the New York Federal Reserve as Treasury Secretary and several other members of his economic team. Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Citigroup, pointed out the inopportune timing of the transition period given the economic crisis.“While politically understandable, the lack of policy clarity at this critical juncture (including auto industry aid) is leaving equity investors uncertain about many initiatives such as approval for the second tranche of the Tarp [Troubled Asset Relief Programme], the use of Tarp money, the details of a new stimulus package, taxes and national energy strategy.”The auto industry remained in sharp focus with General Motors up
17.3 per cent at $3.59 and Ford up 9.1 per cent at $1.56.“Equity investors remain unwilling to commit new capital in view of attractive high-grade corporate debt options, awful news in housing, declining commodity prices, growing uncertainty about international economies, and widespread losses after making previous investments that proved premature,” said Mr Levkovich. The result was “extraordinary risk aversion”.Several items of economic data are due this week and stock market investors will look for direction from reports on consumer confidence and gross domestic product on Tuesday and Wednesday’s reports on unemployment claims, personal income, new home sales and durable goods.After Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, investors will watch the retail sector on Friday in the traditional kick-off to the holiday shopping season. David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said: “In a normal year, the week of Thanksgiving should be a quiet one on Wall Street. This is not a normal year.”He added that, as the third-quarter earnings season wound down, operating earnings for companies in the S&P had fallen by more than 20 per cent for the fourth consecutive quarter.“Once the economy finally begins to recover, profits should rebound strongly reflecting subdued labour costs and solid productivity gains,” Mr Kelly said."
64;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-30T22:40:47Z;Wall Street shrugs off GDP contraction;;US stocks shrugged off official confirmation that the economy had shrunk as upbeat developments elsewhere gave the market a boost.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose as much as 3.6 per cent in intraday trade after the release of the third-quarter gross domestic product data, which though glum were not quite as bad as some feared.Traders took some comfort from record profits at ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company, the prospect of more global interest rate cuts and a further easing of strain in money markets.Alan Ruskin, of RBS Global Banking & Markets, said the market was “trying to already look beyond a dire quarter four, and at the moment is inclined to give various governments, notably the US, the benefit of the doubt that some of the policy initiatives will work”.The market remained positive although it briefly entered negative territory in volatile midday trading.The S&P finished up 2.6 per cent at 954.09 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.1 per cent higher at 9,180.69. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.5 per cent at 1,698.52.Consumer stocks found positive territory even though the hit to GDP was driven by a 3.1 per cent drop in consumption, which had not declined since 1991. Consumer discretionaries were one of the biggest sectoral winners, up 3.3 per cent, while consumer staples stood 2.5 per cent higher.Hard-hit office retailers put in particularly strong performances after Staples upgraded its guidance for the quarter. Its shares jumped 15.6 per cent to $18.42.OfficeMax and Office Depot rocketed 46.1 per cent to $7.07 and 48.6 per cent to $3.12, respectively.Target, whose shareholder Pershing Square Capital Management is trying to persuade it to spin off the land beneath its stores into a real estate investment trust, gave back the strong gains of earlier in the week, falling 5.7 per cent to $38.39. Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup analyst, said she had “several concerns” about the hedge fund’s proposal, which the bank said could lead to a credit rating downgrade for the discount retailer.Also bucking the positive trend, Avon sank 15.4 per cent to $22.57 after the ­ cosmetics group missed ­forecasts due to particular weakness in North American sales.Colgate-Palmolive rose 7.1 per cent to $64.23 after the toothpaste group posted a slightly higher-than-expected quarterly profit.ExxonMobil’s better-than-expected earnings set another record in corporate profits but still failed to impress Wall Street. The group is planning to cut costs. Although traders welcomed the quarterly figures, the stock was down for much of the session although it recovered to close 0.5 per cent higher at $75.05.“Don’t be fooled,” said Professor Anthony Sabino of St John’s University. “These astronomical numbers were driven by a market frenzy that pushed up oil prices to absurd levels.” Chevron added 4.5 per cent to $74.18 ahead of its earnings on Friday.Elsewhere in the sector, First Solar jumped 24.5 per cent to $144.07 after increased demand for its technology helped the group beat expectations.Telecoms was the worst performing sector for the second session, up 0.8 per cent. Motorola slid 5.3 per cent to $5.17 after the group posted an unexpected third-quarter loss and said that the mobile device business spin off would be delayed.Among a host of insurers to post results after the previous session, Prudential Financial disclosed a quarterly loss and its shares fell 18.1 per cent to $28.87. Hartford Financial Services Group was among the biggest losers on the S&P, down 51.6 per cent to $9.62 on concerns it may need to raise more capital after swinging to a surprisingly large loss. The group said the third quarter was the toughest in its history.In technology, Symantec slid 17.7 per cent to $12.20 after the security software group missed analyst estimates.The media sector received a boost after CBS, which gained 8.1 per cent to $9.43, said it would cut more costs to mitigate against a fall in advertising.Cigna slid 21.5 per cent to $15.58 after the health insurer posted weaker than-expected results and cut its full year outlook.
65;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-30T21:26:05Z;Hartford plunges on big loss;;Shares of Hartford Financial Services Group fell almost 50 per cent on Thursday after the US property and life insurer reported a surprisingly big loss in the third-quarter, heightening concern it may need to raise even more capital.The company reported a loss in the quarter of $2.6bn, mainly on $2.2bn on investment losses and $932m in deferred acquisition costs.Hartford shares dropped as low as $9.05, an all-time low for the stock, and were down 48 per cent to $10.35 after lunchtime on the New York Stock Exchange.On a conference call with analysts, which at times grew tense, Ramani Ayer, the company’s chairman and chief executive officer, said that the quarter had been the most challenging in the Hartford’s 198-year history.One analyst quizzed Mr Ayer about his decision in June to accelerate a $500m share buyback.Mr Ayer’s response on Thursday was blunt. “I honestly missed the degree to which markets have cratered in terms of equity markets, credit spreads widening, all of which happened in an accelerated way in September and October,” he said. “I did not see that.”In a research note entitled “Poor quarter and even worse conference call”, John Nadel, an analyst at Stern Agee, said that a reversal in Hartford’s fortunes would be somewhat dependent on the conditions of Tarp, the government rescue plan which stands for ”troubled asset relief programme”.“We see no other way to put this,” he said. “In our view, Hartford Life’s ability to maintain its ratings is almost entirely outside of management’s control at this point.”Mr Nadel said this ability would depending instead on a hope that equity markets rally, credit markets improve and Tarp is made available by the US Treasury.Meanwhile, the company has moved to strengthen its balance sheet in the past few weeks, negotiating a $2.5bn cash infusion from Allianz, the German insurer.The company said it would cut an undisclosed number of jobs in the fourth quarter in an attempt to trim expenses by $250m by the end of 2009. “With revenues down across the company, particularly in the life businesses, we are taking a hard look at our expense base,” said Thomas Marra, president and chief operating officer.The company said it now expected 2008 earnings to range from $4.30 and $4.50 per share, less than half its estimate in July of $9.20 to $9.50 per share.
66;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-19T19:56:50Z;US managers stand by expansion plans;;US money managers making a push for European assets acknowledge that the current crisis raises new challenges for their plans, but are not scaling back their international goals just yet.US asset manager American Century Investments announced its international expansion earlier this month, while Brown Advisory, an independent Baltimore-based investment advisory firm, opened a London office in February in order to build a European fund range and presence.Groups such as Turner Investment Partners, Delaware Investments, Legg Mason and The Hartford have also ramped up their European businesses.US fund managers are generally taking a long-term view of the crisis, says Jag Alexeyev, senior managing director and head of global research at consultancy Strategic Insight.“Most fund managers are reiterating, especially with regards to Asia, the case for long-term growth,” he says.If US money managers are altering their European strategies, the changes are tending to be of a short-term, tactical nature. Mr Alexeyev says companies are looking harder at how to address their clients’ needs in the next year and how to deal with other immediate issues arising from falling share prices.Vanguard Group, known in America for its low cost index funds, is one US house that expects its European business to weather the storm.“We have offered funds to institutional investors across Europe and the Nordics for a decade, and we believe it is a long-term business that can and has withstood shocks to the financial markets,” Vanguard’s Rebecca Cohen says.”We do not believe this crisis will significantly impact our European business. Our transparent, straightforward funds might be seen as an antidote to less transparent, complex offerings in the marketplace.”Legg Mason is another US-based asset management business standing firm in its efforts abroad. New chief executive Mark Fetting has previously expressed plans to increase international assets under management to more than half of overall business from about one-third previously.“Our strategy doesn’t change in a market environment like this,” says Terry Johnson, managing director of international distribution at Legg Mason Investments, the non-US distribution arm of Legg Mason.The market turmoil could represent an opportunity for Legg Mason’s franchise in European markets, Mr Johnson says, as the assets investors have been taking off the table will eventually create a large pool of capital needing to be reinvested.Mr Johnson points to Legg Mason’s “multi-boutique” structure, where the parent company oversees 10 independent investment managers that run the funds, as one factor putting the business in a strong position.James Charrington, managing director and head of international retail at BlackRock, says the market turmoil is going to impact the ability of US houses to parachute their products and services into Europe.But Mr Charrington does not see US-based BlackRock as such a house, because of its significant presence in Europe. According to Strategic Insight, BlackRock’s BGF Global Allocation Fund is the second-largest Ucits fund as of August, with $18.3bn (£10.6bn, €13.6bn) under management.“I wouldn’t underestimate the scale of the job in front of us,” says Mr Charrington, who cites investor confidence as the biggest casualty in the ongoing crisis.Meanwhile, Hartford Financial Services Group announced this month that German insurer Allianz has agreed to make a $2.5bn capital investment in the US-based company. The Hartford unveiled plans earlier this year to sell variable annuities in Germany starting in the first quarter of 2009.As market volatility continues, the US houses with a fair amount of cash, a vision for the future, and ability to think long-term stand the best chance of riding out the storm, says Ben Poor, director at US-based research firm Cerulli Associates.Marc Hogan is a reporter on Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared
67;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-16T21:04:29Z;Wall Street stocks soar in late trade;;US stocks endured extreme volatility on Thursday and a late-afternoon rally pushed the market sharply higher, led by energy groups even as oil slid below $70 a barrel.The S&P 500 had fallen as much as 1.9 per cent after the release of grim economic data.But, in the last hour of trading, stocks rebounded. Wednesday had seen the worst sell-off since 1987.The benchmark index closed up 4.3 per cent at 946.43, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent at 8,979.26. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 5.5 per cent higher at 1,717.71.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up as much as 17.2 per cent to pass yet another grim milestone, reaching above 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. It finished down 2.9 per cent at 67.25.Stocks were pushed lower by economic data that showed industrial production had endured the worst monthly decline since 1974, and factory activity in parts of the country had crashed to an 18-year low.Consumer stocks were among the winners from the late-afternoon rally as some traders bet that oil’s slide below $70 could offer hard- pressed Americans at least some relief.Macy’s closed up 16.1 per cent at $10.05 having fallen as much as 11.7 per cent. Oil’s slide to an intraday low of $68.57 a barrel, while a symptom of global slowdown could nonetheless put “cash back into people’s pockets”, said Bill Stone, investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.Yet the energy sector, down as much as 8.1 per cent after data showed crude and gasoline inventories rose sharply last week, also rebounded and was up 7.8 per cent by the close.Financials were the laggards of the day, but still up 1.7 per cent, following a raft of heavy writedowns and losses from banks.Citigroup rose as much as 4 per cent but later tumbled to stand 2 per cent lower at $15.90 as investors weighed cost-cutting progress with writedowns of $4.4bn in the securities and banking division and weak revenues from its credit card unit.Merrill Lynch rose 0.6 per cent to $18.35. The bank, which is being taken over by Bank of America, reported a worse-than-expected net loss of $7.5bn, mostly due to write­downs and credit losses on complex debt securities.A host of regional banks also reported losses. Bank of New York Mellon rose 6.3 per cent to $31.08 even after costs to bail out funds hurt by Lehman Brothers’s bankruptcy dented third-quarter profits, which fell more than expected.Huntington and BB&T, which also reported downbeat figures, added 10.2 per cent to $9.48 and gained 3.4 per cent to $33.26, respectively.Insurers endured sharp declines after Fitch warned it may cut ratings on some. Hartford Financial Services dropped 11.9 per cent to $28.86, respectively.The falls came even though the rate at which banks lend to each other, measured by overnight dollar Libor, fell sharply.Elsewhere, airlines managed gains even after Southwest Airlines reported its first quarterly net loss since 1991, as oil slid below $70 a barrel.Southwest climbed 8 per cent to $12.49, while Delta Air Lines advanced 18.8 per cent to $8.64. “The leverage from the plunge in fuel prices is huge,” Credit Suisse said.Peabody Energy was a stand-out winner in the energy sector, up 18.3 per cent to $28.68 on the back of well-received third-quarter figures.Technology was up 4.8 per cent overall. Ebay fell 2.4 per cent to $14.97 after the online retailer forecast its first quarterly sales decline after the bell on Wednesday.Google, IBM and Advanced Micro Devices gained 4.1 per cent to $353.02, 3.7 per cent to $91.52 and 5.4 per cent to $4.12 respectively.After the bell, the trio reported better than expected results and the shares bounced 8.2 per cent, 0.7 per cent and fell 2.9 per cent, respectively, in after- hours trade.Food groups were mixed after Hershey’s results. The chocolate group, which rose 6.9 per cent to $35.24, boosted third-quarter profits but warned of slowing sales growth next year.
68;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US rally follows worst trading week since Depression;;The latest round of vast interventions in the financial system from authorities around the world stoked one of Wall Street’s strongest ever rallies following its worst sell-off since the Depression.Carmakers, oil refiners and health care groups were among the favourites as traders snapped up battered stocks, some of which had slumped to their lowest levels in decades.Morgan Stanley’s long-awaited $9bn investment deal with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial also improved the grim mood. Uncertainty that hung over the deal for days had weighed on the wider market even after both parties insisted it would go ahead. Morgan topped S&P 500 leaderboard, up 85.1 per cent to $17.92, while peer Goldman Sachs climbed 25 per cent to $111.The benchmark index surged 11.6 per cent to 1,003.32 points, ending an eight-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt 11.1 per cent to 9,387.61 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 11.8 per cent to 1,844.25 points.Some observers said it was difficult to draw conclusions from the thinned trading and put much of the gains down to short covering. Bond markets were closed owing to the Columbus Day holiday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 20.4 per cent on Monday, although at 55.65 it continued to indicate signs of severe distress.Among the winners in financials, Citigroup, which last week withdrew from talks to buy parts of Wachovia, rallied 11.6 per cent to $15.75. Wells Fargo also gained, up 7.4 per cent to $30.40, after the Federal Reserve approved its $12.2bn takeover of the embattled investment bank, which jumped 13.6 per cent to $5.85.Sovereign Bank fell 3.4 per cent to $3.68 ever after it emerged Banco Santander of Spain was in talks to acquire one of the nation’s few remaining independent thrifts.Insurers also recovered after being routed in previous sessions. Hartford Financial Services, XL Capital and Prudential Financial climbed 28.1 per cent to $24.63, 36.8 per cent to $7.43 and 38.3 per cent to $49.95, respectively.Fox-Pitt Kelton said XL, which slumped 63.8 per cent last week, might have to consider a “hasty sale”.The energy sector, which lost 22 per cent last week, recovered 18.5 per cent and led the gains on hopes the forthcoming economic slowdown would not be as bad as last week’s brutal sell-off implied.“This is not a Great Depression II,” wrote Merrill Lynch in a note to clients. “Bank failures, evaporation of disposable income, industrial production decl­ines and risk premiums for bonds were significantly worse then versus now.”General Motors, which last week sank to its lowest since 1950, recovered 33.1 per cent to $6.51 on reports that the carmaker had held merger talks with Ford Motor and Chrysler. The former jumped 20.1 per cent to $2.39, also helped by reports that the group was considering selling its controlling stake in Mazda, Japanese counterpart.Telecoms was another big winner, up 9.6 per cent. AT&T rallied 16.3 per cent to $26.07 after the group agreed its first retail distribution arrangements to sell its high-speed internet and video service. Wal-Mart and Circuit City, with which it struck the deals, added 7 per cent to $54.50 and 8.1 per cent to $0.40, respectively.Qwest Communications jumped 25.7 per cent to $2.74 after the phone company reached an agreement with its largest union over a pay dispute.King Pharmaceuticals was among the leading winners in the healthcare sector, which was also hit hard last week in spite of its defensive qualities yet recovered 12.4 per cent on Monday. King jumped 18.6 per cent to $9.26 after the group extended by more than a month the deadline for its $37-a-share takeover bid for Alpharma, which rose 10.4 per cent to $33.80.The cash-rich technology sector also did well, up 12.1 per cent. Apple rose 13.9 per cent to $110.26 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”.Elsewhere, Waste Management added 18 per cent to $30.39 after the trash hauler walked away from its $6.73bn hostile takeover of Republic Services, which rose 8.9 per cent to $24.50.
69;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-10T20:46:59Z;US stocks fall in volatile trading session;;"US stocks ended their second worst week ever with more heavy selling that took the market’s drop since its peak to a level that rivalled the crash of 1929.Few stocks were spared in the sharp weekly decline, as retail investors joined hedge funds and sought to cut their losses amid panic selling.Consumer staples and healthcare – normally defensive havens – lost 15.9 per cent and 18.4 per cent, respectively, over the week. On Friday, Kraft and Procter & Gamble lost as much as 7.7 per cent and 9.8 per cent.Yet after violent swings, the market avoided the capitulation some observers said would encourage a subsequent bounce.Shortly after the open the Dow Jones Industrial Average passed another milestone, diving 8.1 per cent, and falling beneath 8,000 points.Stocks swung between eye-popping losses and, on occasion, positive territory as some investors dipped their toes into financial and technology stocks that had fallen to their lowest level in decades.Having traded within a range of more than 1,000 points, the Dow – which in the previous session suffered its biggest percentage decline since 1987 – closed down 1.5 per cent to 8,451.19 points. The S&P 500 finished 1.2 per cent lower at 899.25, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.3 per cent higher at 1,649.51.That took the S&P’s losses over the week to 18.2 per cent, the Dow’s also to 18.2 per cent and the Nasdaq’s to 15.3 per cent. The S&P 500 has lost 42.6 per cent since its peak a year ago. In 1929, the market fell by 44.6 per cent from its highest level.Traders said that shorting was not in the most part responsible for the heavy losses, in spite of the SEC’s lifting of the ban on Wednesday evening. Rather, a wave of mutual fund redemptions had driven stocks lower over the week.Lori Calvasina, analyst at Citi, said retail investors had “joined the fray following the release of quarterly 401k statements”.On Friday there was not the wave of sharp selling in the last hour of trading, a sign of redemptions, that there had been in other sessions.Financials and energy, each down 22 per cent, led the weekly rout as fears worsened over the health of the banking system and the subsequent damage the turmoil would do the global economy.On Friday, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs sank 22.3 per cent at $9.68 and 12.4 per cent at $88.80, respectively, after Moody’s warned it might cut the long-term debt ratings on the erstwhile investment banks. That took their losses for the week to 59.5 per cent and 30.6 per cent respectively.Insurers were hard hit. Metlife, XL Capital and Hartford Financial fell 28.2 per cent to $30.25, 63.8 per cent to $5.43 and 29.8 per cent to $19.23 over the week. On Friday, credit default swaps on the companies had indicated increased worries of potential default.Wachovia was one of the few gainers on Friday, up 43.1 per cent to $5.15. Citigroup withdrew from talks with Wells Fargo to buy parts of the embattled bank.Citigroup and Wells Fargo edged up 9.1 per cent to $14.11 and 3.9 per cent to $28.31, respectively. The energy sector led the market declines, down 8.1 per cent on mounting fears of global recession. “It’s no longer a global credit crisis,” said Richard Bernstein, strategist at Merrill Lynch. “It’s a global economic crisis.”Chevron and Exxon Mobil shed 9.6 per cent to $57.83; and 8.3 per cent to $62.83 as oil slid below $80 a barrel.In industrials, General Electric bounced 13.1 per cent to $21.50 after reporting third-quarter results in line with previously lowered guidance. Ford followed GM lower and lost 4.3 per cent for the week, to $1.99.Macy’s was the latest retailer to issue grim updates, highlighting the damage the credit crisis had already done to the so-called real economy. It fell 13.4 per cent to $9.92."
70;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-10T18:24:18Z;Concerns over taking the ‘third way’ to retirement;;Holders of pensions that guarantee income or capital, known as “third way” annuities, may now be wondering if their guarantees are worth the paper they are written on.There are two reasons for concern. First, providers of third way annuities in the UK have tended so far to be US life insurers: The Hartford, Lincoln, MetLife and Living Time, which is backed by Alico, a subsidiary of AIG.This raises questions about the safety of assets, given the share price falls of US insurers and the government bailout of AIG.Second, the companies try to meet the guarantees on third way products by buying options and futures, exposing themselves to counterparty risk, which has hit the value and guarantees of structured products in past weeks.On the first point, investors should take reassurance from the fact that even if the US parent company were to fail, all the products are authorised by the UK’s Financial Services Authority. This means that they fall under the compensation scheme for insurance products, which pays the first £2,000 in full and 90 per cent of the remainder of the claim.The second point is more worrying.Insurance companies match their guarantees by buying options or futures, usually on a daily basis, to ensure that their liabilities match their assets.There are two ways they can do this. The company can do it itself by trading instruments in the market, which removes its exposure to counterparty risk but can, says Harish Gohil, senior director in the insurance team at Fitch Ratings, expose it to movements in the markets if it can’t hedge quickly enough.Another route to limit risk is to hedge through exchange traded instruments. “Through an exchange, they remove counterparty risk as their counterparty is the exchange not the investment bank,” notes Gohil.The more common route is to buy off the counter instruments from investment banks, which does expose the insurers to counterparty risk. This exposure is disturbing, and may seem to put the guarantee at risk.But third way annuities differ from structured products in one important way. The guarantee is made on a contractual basis between the insurer and the customer. Thus the insurance company is only exposing itself, and not its customers, to counterparty risk – it would still be obliged to pay them if its hedging techniques were to fail.It would do this out of its own capital reserves which, for many insurance companies, remain substantial.“As long as the insurance company is well capitalised and well run, even if they have a problem and don’t get paid they still have an obligation to the customer as they have their own capital requirements,” says Gohil.Whether an institution is well capitalised may not seem to have much bearing on its safety in the current climate – HBOS and Icelandic bank Kaupthing both insisted they were well capitalised shortly before failing as independent institutions.But insurance companies are not as troubled by short- term liquidity requirements – instead, their liabilities are long term.That said, Gohil says Fitch is looking closely at how to rate insurance companies and whether being well capitalised now counts for as much as it used to.The concern over guarantees is more of an issue if the insurance company providing the product goes bust. In this scenario, the compensation scheme does not cover any guarantees made on products – only the underlying value of the pension fund.So with the high fees paid for guarantees, are they worth it in the current climate? Third way annuities have come under much criticism for charging high fees for their guarantees – in the region of 2 to 3 per cent a year.John Richardson, head of technical planning at Towry Law, says: “The guarantees offered by these types of contracts are only as good as the financial strength of that provider. But financial strength ratings currently offer little security as these institutions face the same counterparty risk as everyone else.”However, Billy Burrows, annuity specialist at WBA, says this should not mean there is not a role for third way products. “At times like this, people will come to realise the benefit of having a guarantee – it’s fairly horrific out there,” he notes.He echoes the advice now being given to banking customers and recommends not putting all of your pension with any one provider.
71;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-10T18:18:57Z;Find your way;;Variable annuities – also called “third way” annuities – offer guarantees on either capital or income or both, while also paying out a regular annuity.The first variable annuities to launch in the UK were from, or backed by, US firms: The Hartford, MetLife, Living Time and Lincoln. But the main UK insurers. including Prudential and Standard Life, are looking at launching their own versions.Most of the products guarantee that a fixed income will be paid as an annuity, regardless of the underlying investment performance, and with the opportunity for some further capital growth.The Living Time product works slightly differently, guaranteeing a return of capital in five years plus fixed-income payouts each year. The risk is that annuity rates would be lower in five years when a client comes to renew the policy.Third way annuities have been criticised for being difficult to understand, but some are more transparent than others, says Harish Gohil at Fitch Ratings. Aegon, for example, recently launched its 5 for Life product in the UK, which promises to pay 5 per cent in income of the initial investment for life regardless of what happens to the value of the initial investment.Gohil says the UK market for third way annuities is still “nascent”. “There’s been a lot of talk in the industry about whether this is the next big thing, especially with the collapse of the with-profits market. The challenge is to educate people about the product. I think it will be a slow burn.”
72;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-09T20:45:02Z;Wall Street stocks sink in late trade;;Wall Street stocks extended their eye-popping run of heavy losses to a seventh session as another another drastic afternoon sell-off pushed some stocks to their lowest level in decades.Traders said a wave of mutual fund redemptions had driven the market to fresh five-year lows as retailer investors took scant comfort from unprecedented intervention in financial markets from the authorities around the globe and sought to cut their losses.General Motors sank to its lowest point since 1950, down 31.1 per cent to $4.76, after the Standard & Poor’s placed the company on credit watch. Ford, whose rating S&P may also cut, dived 21.8 per cent to $2.08. The duo have already reported declining sales and JD Power and Associates warned on Thursday world-wide automotive demand could “collapse”.The market had earlier swung from losses to gains but major indicies dived beneath yet more psychologically significant barriers in heavy selling towards the close.The S&P 500 closed down 7.6 per cent at 990.92. Its longest losing streak in 12 years has taken the index’s decline since the collapse of Lehman Brothers to more than a quarter.“It’s just relentless, day in day out, regardless of the news,” said Steve Sachs, director of trading at Rydex.The Dow Jones Industrial Averages sank 7.3 per cent – its biggest percentage decline since 1987 – at 8,579.19. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 5.5 per cent lower at 1,645.12.Traders said that shorting was not in large part responsible for the heavy losses, in spite of the SEC’s lifting of the ban before the session began.Energy and financials led the declines, each down by more than 11 per cent.Insurance company XL sank 53.8 per cent to $4.01 while Allstate fell 8.2 per cent to $27.50 after losses of more than a fifth in the previous session.Hartford Financial lost 19.1 per cent at $20.11 after UBS slashed its price target from $70 to $26 and on speculation that talks between it and Metlife had fallen through. Metlife, which priced new shares at a discount during the previous session, found positive territory, up 3.7 per cent to $28 after heavy losses on Wednesday.Investors were also examining reports that the US government could take stakes in banks. Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, on Wednesday stressed that rescue legislation allowed the authorities to recapitalise financial institutions.Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley fell 25.9 per cent to $13.32 and 25.9 per cent to $12.45 respectively. Bank of America stood 11.2 per cent lower at $19.63 while JPMorgan rose 2.1 per cent to $40.14.Federal litigation on the dispute between Citigroup and Wells Fargo over the fate of Wachovia was extended by two days. Citigroup lost 10.2 per cent to $12.93 while Wells Fargo sank 14.6 per cent to $27.25. Wachovia dropped 28.9 per cent to $3.60.National City had earlier bucked the downward trend but closed down 3.6 per cent to $2.15 on reports it might sell itself. Energy producers were sold off sharply as oil fell below $85 a barrel on heightened fears of global recession. ExxonMobil lost 11.7 to $68Materials earlier found positive territory but later closed down 6.9 per cent. Steel stocks were hit after Goldman Sachs cut its steel price forecast by 29 per cent, due in part to the slowdown in emerging markets and cut its recommendation on a slew of stocks.Technology had clung onto gains for much of the session, rising as much as 3.3 per cent, but later also succumbed and was down 3.4 per cent by the close.Earlier, relatively positive results from technology bellwether IBM provided a glimmer of hope that corporate earnings may not be as dire as the worst five-day sell-off for stocks since 1987 had implied.IBM, which also reaffirmed its profit forecast, fell 1.7 per cent to $89 after earlier gains.Quest Software jumped 5.1 percent to $11.12 after the group unveiled plans plans for a $400m share buy-back.Elsewhere, Abercrombie & Fitch continued a string of poor performances in the retail sector with a sharp drop in like-for-like sales last month. The shares tumbled 14.8 per cent to $27.69.
73;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-08T13:06:23Z;MetLife profits fall prompts stock sale;;MetLife said it would would raise capital and cut jobs after its earnings fell by up to 48 per cent in the third quarter amid losses from exposure to Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and AIG.The the biggest US life insurer said that it would sell 75m shares in an effort to raise capital to assure investors, and position itself to take advantage of future opportunities. At Tuesday’s closing share prices that would raise $2.8bn. Last week, an analyst at Atlantic Equities predicted MetLife might raise capital to bid for AIG’s assets.The company said it would also cut jobs in an SEC filing.Shares in Metlife dropped 5.1 per cent to $35 in pre-market trading, after falling 16.8 per cent on Tuesday.“MetLife is a well capitalized company with a strong balance sheet and financial strength ratings that are among the highest in the industry…[with the capital raising] we are taking an additional, proactive step to further assure all of our stakeholders that MetLife is financially sound and well positioned to meet our future obligations,” said Robert Henrikson, chairman and chief executive.“At the same time, it will enable us to take advantage of potential opportunities in the market and to continue building shareholder value.”Hartford Financial, the Connecticut- based life and property-casualty insurer, said earlier this week it had raised $2.5bn in capital and would cut its dividend after warning of a big loss.The share prices of many life insurers have been falling sharply on fears over the risks they face from exposure to the troubled debt and stock markets, and would need to raise capital.Metlife said operating earnings were expected to be between $600 and $675m, or 83 cents and 93 cents per share.That compares with operating earnings of $1.16bn or $1.52 per share in the third quarter last year.Income from continuing operations is expected to be between $1.01bn and $1.15bn, or $1.38 to $1.58 per share.MetLife reported falling earnings in its prior two quarters. It said that given the volatile markets, it was withdrawing its earnings guidance for full-year 2008.Revenues of $8.6bn were up 16 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2007.MetLife said it expects realized investment gains, net of income tax, to be between $400 and $475m. That includes $490m in credit related losses, $375m of which stemmed from exposure to Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and AIG. Offsetting those losses was a gain from derivatives of $735m due to the rise in the dollar, and an increase in credit default swap spreads.Metlife said that it expected a decline in investment income, driven by negative hedge fund and private equity returns. Meanwhile the almost 9 per cent decline in the S&P 500 in the quarter is expected to drive results on MetLife’s variable annuity business, a popular long term investment that offers periodic payments to investors.The company sought to calm investors by saying that it had $4bn in excess capital. It said it had $21bn in access to liquidity, up from $14bn in June. Its liquid assets totalled $1.75bn, and none of its long term debt is due until 2011.
74;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-06T20:46:27Z;Wall St plummets to four-year lows;;A sharp sell-off in US equities pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 10,000 as concerns heightened that banking crises would deepen and further hurt the global economy.The Dow’s tumble took it to levels not seen since October 2004 in spite of plans from the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity into the credit and commercial paper markets.“This is unbelievable,” said Thomas Wilson of Brinker Capital, when the S&P 500 had fallen as much as 8.3 per cent. “You’re seeing panic selling. Folks have just had enough and they want to get out.”But stocks rallied from their lows late in the session. Some analysts said hedge fund redemptions – which have driven stocks sharply lower in recent sessions – were less than anticipated. The S&P 500 closed down 3.9 per cent at 1,056.87 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.3 per cent at 1,862.96 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6 per cent to 9,955.50.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, surged as much as 29 per cent above 50 for the first time in its 18-year history. It later eased to stand 14.9 per cent higher at 51.87, still a record.Energy stocks suffered as the price of oil slid below $90 a barrel on fears of a global slowdown. Five energy stocks declined by more than 10 per centThe sector overall fell 3.6 per cent. Among the biggest declines, National Oilwell, Tesoro and Range Resources, lost 10.3 per cent at $37.02, 12.2 per cent at $12.22 and 13 per cent at $29.72, respectively.In materials, which fell 4.4 per cent, Alcoa lost 5.9 per cent to $18.11 after UBS slashed its price target from $46 to $25 ahead of its earnings tomorrow. Monsanto, which also announces its third-quarter earnings this week, lost 9.3 per cent to $75.48.National City was among the biggest losers in financials, slumping 27.1 per cent to $2.56 after Fitch downgraded the Ohio lender’s debt rating.After the market closed, Bank of America announced plans for a $10bn capital raising. In third-quarter earnings released two weeks earlier than planned, the bank reported a 68 per cent drop in net profit and halved its dividend.Down 6.6 per cent to $32.22 at the close, the shares lost another 9.1 per cent in after hours trading.Financials fell as much as 8.7 per cent as money markets remained in paralysis but stood 4.2 per cent lower by the close.Hartford Financial, hard hit in recent sessions, was one of only seven stocks to find positive territory in the S&P 500. The insurer gained 12.8 per cent to $30.90 after it said Allianz would invest $2.5bn.Citigroup, whose bid for Wachovia was last week scuppered by Wells Fargo, fell another 5.1 per cent at $17.41. Yesterday, it filed a lawsuit against the pair. Wachovia was down 6.9 per cent at $5.78 and Wells Fargo was 2.7 per cent to $33.64.The market declines were wide-ranging and took in normally defensive stocks. Wal-Mart slid 3.1 per cent to $57.90 after UBS cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”. The retailer was “unlikely to be immune’’ to a global slowdown. UBS also cut its recommendation on Home Depot, home improvement retailer, which fell 4.2 per cent to $22.82.Elsewhere, Deutsche cut its recommendation on Coca-Cola from “buy” to “hold” due in part to lower global demand. The shares lost 3.1 per cent to $50.92.In industrials, General Electric at one point slid to its lowest level in 11 years ahead of its earnings later in the week, down 0.9 per cent to $21.38 after Barclays Capital analyst Robert Cornell cut his profit forecast.Technology was another key laggard, down 4.0 per cent overall. Google was down 4.1 per cent at $371.21. Ebay fell 5.5 per cent to $17.89 even after the online auctioneer announced plans to cut about 10 per cent of its workforce. The group warned third-quarter revenue would be at the lower end of its previous forecast.The Fed’s move to increase the size of its lending facility was the latest in a series of measures by authorities to shore up confidence in the financial system.With banks across the world affected by the liquidity crisis, there are increasing calls for a co-ordinated response from regulators and central banks. Other measures has so far included a temporary ban on shorting financial stocks. “If you can’t short financials you end up shorting the S&P 500,” said Marc Groz, chief executive of Topos, a hedge fund.
75;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-05T19:49:20Z;Attention turns to German opportunities;;"Asset managers cannot seem to get enough of Germany. At the beginning of last month The Hartford, the 198-year-old US financial services group, announced it would enter the region to sell variable annuities in the first quarter of 2009, while Goldman Sachs Asset Management last week unveiled its own German push.GSAM has poached Fidelity’s Markus Weis to fill the new role of German fund distribution head. The US firm followed this up last week with the appointment of Fortis Investments’ Henning Stein as head of German third-party marketing.Gartmore, meanwhile, has repositioned its German offering with the appointment of Deutsche Bank’s Bettina Hoenigmann as head of business development.These moves come despite the influential Munich-based Ifo index showing that business expectations in Germany are at their worst levels in 15 years, with business confidence at its lowest level in three years.Hypo Real Estate, one of Germany’s biggest lenders, had to be rescued by its peers and the government to avoid a €50bn (£39bn, $69bn) liquidity crisis last week.But Lipper Feri statistics show that, while most European countries suffered heavy mutual fund outflows during the first half of this year, Germany saw inflows.In the three months to the end of June, for example, the country saw positive flows of €8.1bn.The Italian mutual fund industry, meanwhile, saw net outflows of €13.5bn in July while Spanish funds shed €7.3bn in June.“Most of the major markets are in the doldrums,” Bella Caridade-Ferreira, publisher at Lipper Feri, said during the summer. “It’s really only Germany that is speeding ahead.”“Lots of market participants are trying to get a piece of the Germany cake at the moment,” adds Karl-Hermann Hammel at Allianz Global Investors.According to an Ignites Europe poll, 33 per cent of asset managers plan to make moves in Germany with another 33 per cent admitting they are keeping a close eye on the market. The other 33 per cent say the opportunities are overblown.The Hartford disagrees. “Germany’s population is ageing, with one in three people projected to be age 60 or older by 2025, and millions of people leaving the workforce for retirement.“As a result, cheques from the country’s generous public pension system are shrinking and new incentives will soon be available to help Germans shoulder more of their own financial security in retirement.”The company’s own research shows three in four Germans worry about having enough money to enjoy a comfortable retirement, while six in 10 believe they are most responsible for providing their own income in retirement.Only 25 per cent now see the government as being most responsible for their retirement security.Marc Lieberman, president and chief executive of Hartford Life, the group’s European arm, says: “The timing of our entry is ideal because it is expected that variable annuities and other insurance products will become more attractive to German consumers when a new flat rate tax is introduced in 2009.”Those beliefs, he adds, “are expected to prompt many Germans to shift money from traditional savings accounts or cash into equity-oriented investments to generate greater long-term returns as they prepare financially for retirement”.German households have $5,800bn in assets, $2,770bn of which is in cash.Under the new tax changes, to be introduced on January 1 2009, capital gains on shares, bonds, certificates and investment funds in Germany will be taxed at a rate of 25 per cent.With investors seeking to enter the market before the new capital gains tax measures come into force, providers have been looking to pick up business. It is estimated that up to €200bn will be moved from one vehicle to another this year.Murat Ünal, chief executive of Funds@Work, says: “What companies are doing now is moving into fund of funds and similar structures such as super funds, which grant a tax shelter.”“The trades within a fund are not subject to withholding tax so they are moving existing fund-based portfolios into fund of fund
structures.”According to data from the BVI, the German investment manager association, there were 662 funds of funds in Germany at the end of May 2008 with more than €55bn in assets under management. Mr Ünal believes that by the end of the year, the figure could increase to about 900 to 1,000.Chris Newlands is editor of Ignites Europe, a Financial Times publication, where this article first appeared"
76;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-10-01T12:57:56Z;Wall St rallies on hopes of revived bail-out;;US stocks ended their worst month for six years on a positive note on Tuesday, repairing by more than half the damage from the previous session’s historic slump.Equities rebounded from their worst session since Black Monday on hopes that Washington would revive a plan to bail out the banking sector. The rally came even though money markets remained under unprecedented strain – as they have been for the past two weeks – while the latest housing data showed there was little economic respite in sight.Homebuilders, routed in the previous session, recovered slightly. KB Home rose 1.8 per cent to $19.68 while Pulte Homes inched up 0.6 per cent at $13.97.The S&P 500 closed up 5.3 per cent at 1,164.73, albeit in light volume because of a holiday and the end of the quarter. The gain nevertheless left the benchmark down 9.2 per cent during a month in which the American financial sector was drastically reshaped.The Nasdaq Composite Index was 5 per cent higher at 2,082.33, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent at 10,850.66.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 15.6 per cent on Tuesday, although at 39.45 it continued to indicate extremely elevated levels of distress.Investors expect Congress to pass the $700bn troubled asset relief programme in some form later this week.“The market thinks there’s going to be a solution,” Steve Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investments, said. He added, however: “I wouldn’t read too much into this . . . This is an environment in which information is unavailable. Period.”Regional banking stocks were among the biggest winners from a 13.1 per cent rally in financials. National City, which sank 63.3 per cent on Monday, rose 28.7 per cent to $1.75.Sovereign Bancorp rose 69.5 per cent to $3.95 a share. Fox-Pitt Kelton raised its recommendation on the stock from “in-line” to “outperform”.Regions Financial jumped 16.4 per cent to $9.60. Fifth Third, down 43.6 per cent in the previous session, added 30.6 per cent at $11.90.Custodian banks, normally seen as among the safest banking stocks but which sustained heavy losses in the previous session, also rebounded. State Street added 29.3 per cent to $56.88 and Bank of New York Mellon 23 per cent to $32.58.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, rose 8 per cent, just above the level set when the ban was introduced earlier in the month.Hartford Financial Services was a notable outlier from the rally after Fitch warned that the insurer’s exposure to credit markets could result in ratings downgrades. Down 11.7 per cent in the previous session, it fell another 18 per cent on Tuesday to close at $40.99.Technology stocks, among the worst hit in the previous session’s rout, also made modest gains.Microsoft, whose chief executive Steve Ballmer warned that no company was immune to the global financial crisis, climbed 6.7 per cent at $26.69. Intel rose 8.5 per cent to $18.73 after Piper Jaffray upgraded its recommendation on the semiconductor manufacturer from “neutral” to “buy”.Google, which fell below $400 on Monday for the first time in two years, fell another 10.4 per cent at $341.43 after a last-minute slump. Apple, whose 17.9 per cent sell-off was described by Goldman Sachs as “overdone”, recovered 8 per cent to $113.66.The SEC’s plan to release guidance on fair value accounting, which emerged late in the session, also helped sentiment.“Every little indication that the authorities are willing to compromise and accommodate the market is helpful,” said Pran Tiku, president of Peak Financial Management.Automotive stocks, which suffered declines in the previous session even after Congress voted to fund $25bn of government low-interest loans to help the sector, recovered in spite of oil’s near $5-a-barrel rise. General Motors and Ford rose 11.1 per cent to $9.45, and 24.7 per cent to $5.20, respectively.Among the non-financials to benefit, Dr Pepper Snapple – spun off by Cadbury earlier this year – climbed 9.1 per cent to $26.48. It is to replace Wm Wrigley Jr in the S&P index.
77;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-09-24T21:12:56Z;Buffett’s $5bn not enough to lift US equities;;A vote of confidence in the financial system from Warren Buffett failed to lift US stocks into positive territory on Wednesday amid a near seizure in money markets and ongoing uncertainty over the authorities’ proposed bail-out.Equity markets remained jittery in spite of the $5bn investment in Goldman Sachs, from Berkshire Hathaway, Mr Buffett’s investment vehicle. Goldman rose 6.4 per cent to $133.Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at The Hartford, said: “With the backdrop of this drip of negative soundbites [from the congressional hearing] it really was comforting for Warren Buffett to come forward and take a position in the financials.” She added, however, that developments in Washington “overwhelmed” news elsewhere.A jump in money-market interest rates hurt financials as it indicated less trust among lenders. Morgan Stanley, in which Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s largest bank, has agreed to take a 20 per cent stake, lost 11.5 per cent at $24.79 and the cost of protecting its senior debt rose.Citigroup and American Express lost 5.2 per cent at $18.96 and 2 per cent at $37.50, respectively. General Electric fell 1.4 per cent at $24.59 as investors fretted over its financial arm. GE has fallen 12.5 per cent since the upsurge in financing pressures this month.Capital One Financial fell 2.3 per cent at $52.49. Washington Mutual sank 29.4 per cent to $2.26 after Standard & Poor’s cut its credit rating on the savings and loan institution amid fears it will not be able to sell itself.MEMC Electronic Materials jumped 7 per cent to $31 even after the silicon wafer manufacturer cut its third-quarter sales forecast due to Hurricane Ike. RBC Capital upgraded its recommendation, citing an extension of solar tax credits that could help demandLeading indices see-sawed as Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, gave testimony and faced questions from a congressional committee. After a relatively muted session, the S&P 500 closed 0.2 per cent lower at 1,185.88 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent at 10,825.17 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.1 per cent at 2,155.68 points.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 2.8 per cent – surpassing a closing high reached last week that had not been achieved since 2002 – but later stood 1.3 per cent lower at 35.25.Among industrials, HB Fuller lost 3.3 per cent at $22.23 after the speciality chemical group’s earnings met analysts downgraded estimates. Worthington Industries gained 3.2 per cent to $17.11 after the metal processor’s earnings topped analyst forecasts.Renewable energy stocks received a boost after the Senate passed a bill that would extend tax credits for the sector. First Solar and Evergreen Solar rose 5.2 per cent to $221.80 and 7.8 per cent at $6.20, respectively.
78;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-08-10T15:37:58Z;New UK boss for The Hartford;;The Hartford, a US insurer, was on Monday due to name Marc Lieber­man chief executive of European operations and head of its UK life business.His appointment underlines The Hartford’s commitment to the UK, where it has been operating since 2005.“The business has been hugely successful in the UK,” Mr Lieberman said. “It has built up a great position, and I see a lot of potential for further growth.”Starting on Monday, Mr Lieberman replaces Mike Kalen, who returns to the US as senior vice-president of finance. Mr Kalen will stay in Europe until September 1 to help with the transition.Mr Lieberman brings international experience as The Hartford eyes expansion from its regional He was chief executive of ING New Zealand, the country’s largest non-bank financial services company.Before joining ING, Mr Lieberman held executive positions at Constellation, a New York-based finance company, and banking and brokerage group Wachovia.Peter Smyth, executive vice-president of the company’s international markets group, said: “Marc brings an international perspective to the European role which, coupled with his experience of running market-leading businesses, will be invaluable to The Hartford as we continue building our UK business and expanding our operations in a dynamic and growing market.”The Hartford has been one of the pioneers of variable annuities, a US savings product, in the UK. A number of big UK life assurers, such as Aegon and Standard Life are entering, or preparing to enter, this market.Mr Lieberman was not worried by the step up in competition. Customers’ emphasis was moving from accumulating savings for retirement to protecting income once retired, he said.
79;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
80;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-06-06T17:38:47Z;‘Third way’ annuities give more guarantees;;The first “third-way” annuity to protect both capital and income launches this week – and, unlike most other annuity products, it’s being targeted at the younger retirement market.MetLife’s New Retirement Portfolio offers the option of paying a fee to guarantee your capital, or income payouts, after investing – or both.Pension products like this are known as variable, or ‘third-way’, annuities as they offer an alternative to the traditional level or escalating payouts. They are marketed widely in the US and Japan, where The Hartford is the main provider, but have only been offered in the UK in the past two years. However, with a number of big UK names expected to launch this year, including Standard Life and Prudential, the market is expected to grow.The fees for the guarantees on the MetLife product will vary according to the risk profile of the fund selected for the pension. Lower-risk funds such as trackers will have guarantee fees of around 0.6 per cent a year, while higher-risk funds will have fees closer to 2 per cent.The guarantees are more likely to make sense on the lower-risk funds, said Ed Gardner, chief executive officer of UK retirement and savings at MetLife. Those investing smaller parts of their portfolio in higher-risk funds might want to waive the guarantees in pursuit of higher performance.Tom McPhail at Hargreaves Lansdown said the product looked like a “positive step forward” compared with the first wave of products, some of which have costs approaching 4 per cent a year.He pointed out that the passive portfolio option offered by the MetLife product had costs around 1 per cent lower than the actively-managed options, making them, at 2-2.5 per cent a year, “much more likely to be acceptable to investors”.Offering a guarantee on capital is viewed as an attempt to appeal to younger pension savers, who are more likely to be concerned with protecting the value of their funds than protecting a pension income they have not yet started to draw.The MetLife product is available from age 23 – although, with a £50,000 minimum investment required, it is likely to be of more interest to those looking to consolidate an existing pension.Michael Rudge, managing director at The Hartford, which currently guarantees income only on its three third-way annuities, said: “A guarantee on capital is more attractive when you’re accumulating money. We’re more focused on the retirement space.”He said that when the time was right, The Hartford might also look at offering capital guarantees. Unlike MetLife, its fees are charged at a fixed rate and do not depend on the funds selected.
81;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-05-30T18:08:41Z;Third-way products come up slightly pricey;;A new annuity option on the market is the variable, or “third-way”, annuity.This type of annuity will usually be invested in equities to produce a potentially higher income and guarantee that original capital will not be eroded.Some variable annuities are treated as income drawdown products so, on death, remaining funds can be passed down to heirs. Others offer a guarantee that, at the end of a fixed term, the capital will be sufficient to buy a new annuity that will generate the same income.Variable annuities have only existed in the UK for the past two years and only a handful of firms offer them: The Hartford, MetLife, Living Time, Lincoln and Aegon. But many other life insurance companies are planning to join in, meaning that the size of the market is set to soar.However, their costs are controversial. Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown warns that charges can be as high as 4 per cent per year, a “hefty whack” on a product only returning 7 or 8 per cent. Part of the charge comes from the cost of the guarantee: this may apply to capital and income or income only, and may be capped at a certain level, so it is advisable to compare plans before buying.
82;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-05-14T03:43:30Z;Variable annuities carry assurers’ hopes;;British life assurers, under attack from nimbler rivals, are fighting back. Their weapon: a more flexible retirement savings product that has already taken the US and Japan by storm.Life assurers hope that selling these products, known as variable annuities, will take off in the UK too and stem the tide of customers saving for retirement through rival operators, from banks to fund managers.“This is the natural space of insurance companies,” says Mark Laidlaw, finance director of Aegon UK. “It is a reminder of what insurers can do.”After taking off in the US about five years ago, VAs now have about $1,500bn (£769bn) in net assets.Over the past couple of years, US insurers MetLife, Hartford and Lincoln National have begun selling VAs in the UK, while the UK arm of Aegon, the Netherlands-based insurer, introduced a non-pension VA in 2006. But the product has had a low profile until now.With some of Britain’s biggest names, including Aegon, Standard Life and Prudential, preparing to launch VAs, the product is set to hit the mainstream.The UK versions of VAs provide customers with exposure to riskier but higher returning assets, such as equities, but with explicitly priced guarantees, either to protect their capital or provide a minimum level of income.VAs are expected to appeal to those in or approaching retirement. Facing perhaps 20-30 years as pensioners, they need their pension pots to continue to expand, but are also worried about outliving their savings or having them eroded by market movements.But the guaranteed income provided by a VA comes at a cost.Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, the independent financial adviser and broker, says the cost of the guarantees, fund management, administration and the services of an IFA, can be up to 4 per cent.“If you are getting investment growth of 7 per cent, that is a pretty big chunk being taken out,” he says.All the same, some analysts are excited about the scope for VAs. Roman Cizdyn, analyst at Oriel Securities, recently likened the development of the market to the introduction of unit-linked policies in the 1960s, which he described as “the greatest transformation of UK life assurance over recent decades”.He said in a note: “We believe we are about to see a major development in the UK that may not be of the same scale as unit linking, but is likely to introduce a fresh approach in the savings market.”If insurers can provide the guarantees for less than they charge the customer for them, and also hold on to clients’ money for longer, then the products could prove lucrative.Most important of all, the development of VAs gives insurers a chance to reassert their role in the long-term savings market.Life offices tout their ability to provide guarantees, which require complex financial management as well as their core actuarial skills to determine how long people will live.“This is what insurance companies should do, and do well, which is take risk on behalf of the individual,” says Gary Shaughnessy, managing director, retail life and pensions, at Prudential UK. “[We] have been doing this for the last 150 years.”According to Ned Cazalet, the independent life assurance analyst: “Definitely [life assurers] are saying, ‘if we do anything at all we should be there to take the sharp edges off of life for people’.“But it is also the sheer numbers of people entering the retirement zone. This is a big new market.”According to Watson Wyatt, the consultants, the market for converting invested assets, such as pension savings, into income, was worth almost £14bn ($27.2bn) in 2007. This market is expected to more than double to above £30bn a year within five years.Mark Joannes, a senior consultant at Watson Wyatt, estimates that VAs could account for 10-15 per cent of the market, or close to £5bn, within this period.The big challenge will be to sell the products effectively. VAs, with their array of guarantee options and associated charges, could prove baffling to customers and life assurers have been maligned in the past for marketing opaque and expensive products.New entrants to the market will have to overturn the current insipid level of VA sales, says John Lawson, head of pensions policy at Standard Life. “They are not exactly flying off the shelves yet.”
83;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-04-05T04:05:41Z;Crisis of age requires cure;;"When Mark Lachs, an internist who specialises in the care of the elderly, looks into the not-so-distant future, he sees millions of retirees and not enough doctors. “The baby boomers are moving through the belly of the beast and are coming out 65,” he says. “The numbers are just overwhelming; about 7,000 geriatricians for millions of older people.”Every day an estimated 6,000 Americans turn 65. Four years from now, that figure will swell to 10,000 people a day so that by 2030, one in five Americans will be 65 or older. At the same time, geriatrics programmes across the US are shrinking, the number of certified geriatricians is falling relative to the population, physicians are disenrolling from Medicare, and fewer medical students are choosing careers in geriatrics.“We are in a significant crisis – it is no longer looming,” says Lachs, a professor of medicine and a chief of the division of geriatrics and gerontology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University. “The manpower deficit extends from the physician level to the frontline workers and everywhere in between.”The consequences are dire; unless systemic changes are made, the “silver tsunami” of retiring baby boomers will cripple the country’s health systems. Consider this: there are 7,128 board certified geriatricians in the US, or one geriatrician for every 2,546 Americans 75 or older, according to the American Geriatrics Society. By 2030, that ratio is expected to drop to one geriatrician for every 4,254 older Americans.Usually, when public and private resources fail to address a societal problem, philanthropy is the answer. Yet ageing, for the most part, is ignored by foundations and donors. Why think about old people when there are glamorous causes with star-studded fundraisers and celebrity spokespeople? (Think malaria or the plight of refugees in the developing world.)“Ageism is alive and well in our society,” says Corinne Rieder, executive director and treasurer of The John A. Hartford Foundation, the largest private foundation in the US focused exclusively on ageing and health. “We really live in a youth culture. This is also true for medical education.”This age-defying quest is fuelled by best-selling books with titles such as How Not to Look Old and a society that celebrates the virtues of Botox parties and plastic surgery. For many, thinking about old age means confronting uncomfortable topics such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. But as Atul Gawande put it in an article last year in The New Yorker, “people naturally prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude”.Some believe this aversion affects funding decisions. “Older people and ageing are not seen as sexy topics and oftentimes the people on [foundation] boards are ageing and this can be painful to think about. They are in denial themselves,” says Brian Hofland, head of the international ageing programme at The Atlantic Philanthropies, the world’s largest private funder of ageing issues.Yet ageing is a universal issue. Gara LaMarche, Atlantic’s president and chief executive, says any foundation that does not take this into account in its strategies is not seeing the whole picture.“Ageing is not a niche funding area or a special interest group. The number of funders with a primary focus on ageing, like our close friends at The John A. Hartford Foundation, will always be finite, though it too needs to grow,” he told the 2007 annual meeting of Grantmakers in Aging (GIA), a national membership association. “But the number of foundations which ought to be concerned with ageing is almost infinite, for no funder ought to get away, in this day and, well, age, with saying ‘we don’t do ageing’.”A small group of US foundations has embraced funding programmes to prepare for the dramatic ageing of the population.Through their grants, foundations are tackling issues that range from researching and treating elder abuse to changing how society views older people and helping more doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, social workers and other health professionals receive the necessary training.For The Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, a private philanthropy that funds journalism, ageing care, and cardiovascular research, the way to improve the quality of healthcare for elderly people across the US is to strengthen all physicians’ geriatrics training. To help achieve this goal, it provides “geriatric training grants” – of up to $2m each – to medical schools.“We are not in the business of training people to become geriatricians. We are in business of training all physicians, no matter what field they enter, to better care for frail older people, so it includes both faculty and practising physicians,” says Rani Snyder, a senior programme officer for Reynolds.This skills shortage was highlighted in a 2002 report – “Medical Never-Never Land: Ten Reasons Why America is Not Ready for the Coming Age Boom” – by the Alliance for Aging Research, a non-profit advocacy group in Washington, DC. It warned the US would fall far short of the 36,000 geriatricians needed by 2030 “unless effective steps” were taken to train new providers.Six years on, the outlook remains bleak. For academic year 2006-07, 468 first-year fellowships in geriatric medicine were available, and only 253, or 54 per cent, were filled, according to the American Geriatrics Society. For the same year, there were 136 geriatric psychiatry fellowship first-year training slots, and half went unfilled.“The population numbers clearly point to older patients dominating the healthcare delivery in the US and most of the developed world but we have been rather phobic about geriatrics, geriatric medicine and ageing,” says Daniel Perry, executive director of the Alliance for Aging Research.An ageing population is a triumph of medical science, but longevity has downsides that extend far beyond wrinkles. Having enough geriatricians and geropsychiatrists – as well as primary-care doctors trained in caring for the elderly – is one way to ensure that older people have access to a better quality of life.This is because caring for older adults is not simply a matter of treating older versions of middle-aged patients. Many common diseases of adulthood, such as depression, have different characteristics in the elderly than in younger people. And the elderly tend to have multiple problems: the average 75-year-old has three chronic medical conditions and regularly uses about seven prescription drugs, as well as over-the-counter remedies.“The internal medicine is really complicated and really interesting. Rarely is it just heart failure. It could be heart failure plus diabetes, plus depressive disorder, plus cataracts,” says Lachs, who is also director of geriatrics for the NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System.He spends much time encouraging doctors to become geriatricians. But it is difficult; the pay is a lot lower than most other medical specialisations and the field lacks prestige. “Geriatric medicine remains an under-subscribed field for people coming out of medical school,” he says. “Yet if you do anything other than paediatrics you will be seeing mostly older people.”The Hartford Foundation is working to change this. One of its initiatives – centres of excellence in geriatric medicine and training – was designed to address the shortage of geriatric faculty members in US medical schools. The centres are a network of 26 medical schools at which about 70 per cent of the future professors of geriatric medicine receive training. Hartford also funds similar initiatives in nursing and social work.Funding geriatric medicine is just one area where philanthropy can make a big difference. To achieve wider impact, however, ageing needs to move from an orphan to a mainstream issue. More big funders also need to emerge as Atlantic and Reynolds are limited-life foundations, spending themselves out of business.To help raise awareness, GIA, in partnership with Atlantic, has launched EngAGEment, a two-year pilot programme to introduce new community, family and private foundations, as well as corporate grantmakers and wealthy individuals, to philanthropy focused on the many issues facing the elderly.Carol Farquhar, GIA’s executive director, says ageing “is coming into its own” and the organisation’s membership has swelled from fewer than 60 foundations eight years ago to 115 today. Still, this is minuscule considering there are about 70,000 private foundations in the US.“It is important to note that there is a seat for everyone at the table,” Farquhar says. “There are more needs and issues than funding resources. Ageing can be meals on wheels; an elaborate research project; or taking a national model and bringing it to the community for less than the cost of the original grant. There are many opportunities for partnering and collaboration. Ageing is very broad – you can pick your issue and really make an impact.”This is the third in a series of articles examining the orphans of philanthropy"
84;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2008-02-27T21:46:46Z;Wall St stocks seesaw in volatile trading;;US stocks gyrated between positive and negative territory on Wednesday when traders weighed poor economic data and a plan to allow government-chartered mortgage lenders to buy more loans.The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said it would remove the cap on the value of mortgages they could buy, which could boost liquidity in the industry.The plan sparked a rally in financial stocks and homebuilders but fears about the health of the economy damped earlier enthusiasm.Quincy Krosby, chief in-vestment strategist at The Hartford, said: “Mortgages are at the heart of the credit problem. Anything you can do to staunch the deterioration in the housing market is going to be a positive for the markets and for the real economy.”But economic data re-leased earlier showed the housing market and economy worsened in January, and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the US was experiencing a broad-based slowdown.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to close at 12,694.28, while the S&P 500 index slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,380.02. The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.4 per cent to 2,353.78.Still, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pared early losses after the OFHEO news. Fannie, which re-ported a $3.6bn fourth-quarter loss before the opening bell, rose 1.1 per cent to $27.27. Smaller counterpart Freddie fell 0.5 per cent to $25.09. Analysts expect Freddie to show a fourth-quarter loss of about $2.54 a share when it reports on Thursday.Homebuilders were also supported by an upbeat note from Lehman Brothers, which initiated coverage of the industry with a “positive” recommendation.Megan Talbott McGrath, Lehman Brothers analyst, said she expected trends in the sector to improve by the latter half of this year.DR Horton rose 4.1 per cent to $17.10 while Toll Brothers, which earlier reported its biggest quarterly loss in 22 years, added 3.1 per cent to $23.83.Financial stocks held on to their gains: The S&P 500 financials sub-index firmed 0.8 per cent, while an index of investment banks rose 2.1 per cent.Fortunes in the technology, media and telecoms sector were mixed, however.Autodesk tumbled 15.6 per cent to $32.99 after the software maker reported a fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.In contrast, forecast-beating earnings sent electronic components maker Maxwell Technologies 9.7 per cent higher to $10.29.Shares in Microsoft fell 0.4 per cent to $28.26 after European regulators imposed a $1.4bn fine on the company. Analysts said the fine – the largest by the European Union against a single company – represented just a fraction of the software maker’s monthly cash flow.Intel fell 0.4 per cent to $20.77 after JPMorgan cut its 2008 and 2009 profit estimates for the world’s largest chipmaker.Christopher Danely, an analyst at JPMorgan, said his research suggested Intel’s first quarter was trending below expectations because of weaker orders for microprocessors. DreamWorks Animation rose 5 per cent to $25.65. The maker of the Shrek movies reported a fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates on DVD sales from the third film about the ogre.Nortel fell 13.3 per cent to $9.93 after the largest telephone equipment maker in North America said it would cut 2,100 jobs after sales fell.Shares of Netflix jumped 11.8 per cent to $32.43 after the online video-rental service raised its first-quarter and full-year earnings guidance and forecasts for subscriber growth.Cisco Systems rose 3.7 per cent to $24.95 after Wells Fargo added the maker of computer-networking equipment to its “buy” list.Smaller rival Juniper Networks rose 6.5 per cent to $29.29.Apple and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, benefited from positive sentiment towards export-oriented stocks. The falling dollar makes US exports more attractive.Apple rose 3.2 per cent to $122.96, while RIM added 3.5 per cent to $111.50.Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, rose 1.3 per cent to $74.22. Aluminium producer Alcoa rose 1.4 per cent to $30.02. General Motors rose 1 per cent to $24.82.
85;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2007-12-14T21:39:49Z;Wall St unease about credit squeeze remains;;Wall Street stocks hit reverse gear this week after interest rate cuts and a central bank plan to help ease banks’ funding problems failed to convince investors that the worst effects of the credit squeeze were over.The spectre of inflation returned after both producer and consumer prices rose more than expected, threatening to limit the ability of the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates to stave off a recession.Energy and telecoms groups were among the best performers but financials again felt heavy selling pressure amid concerns about earnings as the fourth quarter results season began.The S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,467.95 on Friday and ended the week 2.4 per cent lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent this week to close at 13,339.85 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.6 per cent over the week to 2,635.74.The Russell 2000 small cap index fell 4 per cent to 753.93 on the week, hurt by a rise in volatility. “The mindset of ‘selling into strength’ has come back into this market,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said.After two consecutive weeks of gains, the major indices retreated amid widespread dissatisfaction with measures announced by the Federal Reserve and other central banks designed to help ease liquidity bottlenecks in financial markets.Stocks plunged on Tuesday after the Federal Open Market Committee cut interest rates 25 basis points, less than many investors had hoped. “It made you wonder about their [the Fed’s] sophistication and their ability to predict what the market reaction would be,” Ms Krosby said.Although equities posted a modest recovery the following day on news of a new term auction facility and foreign exchange swap lines, stocks failed to pare most of their losses with inter-bank lending rates remaining stubbornly high.Investors displeased with the Fed’s response were given a further jolt by data that showed a sharp spike in inflationary pressure.An index of consumer prices rose 0.8 per cent last month, its biggest rise in more than two years. Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy inputs, rose 0.3 per cent, more than expected. The CPI data came a day after wholesale prices rose the most in 34 years.The inflation data may restrict the Fed’s ability to deliver the rate cuts the market wants and equities fell after the news.Citigroup had another bad week after Vikram Pandit’s appointment as chief executive failed to boost its flagging share price. Citi was forced to take $49bn in structured investment vehicle assets onto its balance sheet and and the shares fell 10.5 per cent to $30.70 over the week.Lehman Brothers kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season for the big banks but its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $62.24 on the week, in spite of results that beat Wall Street’s estimates.Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bear Stearns report next week. Analysts expect further writedowns in the sector as the value of credit-related assets declines and loan losses increase.Bank of America, down 7.1 per cent at $42.16, Wachovia, 9.6 per cent lower at $39.03, and PNC Financial Services, off 10.2 per cent at $64.81, all made negative noises about current quarter performance. Washington Mutual fell 20.4 per cent to $15.15 on the week after it announced a convertible stock offering to shore up its finances.Investors sought safety in large-cap stocks with strong international sales. AT&T rose 6.9 per cent to $41.14 on the week after the phone company increased its dividend and announced a large share buyback programme.Honeywell put on 2.5 per cent to $59.98 after the diversified manufacturer’s profit guidance pleased traders. 3M guided for double-digit revenue growth next year but the shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $85.93 this week.Microsoft was a standout technology stock rising 2.3 per cent to $35.31 after an analyst at JPMorgan raised his 2008 profit estimates.Retail stocks had a poor week in spite of November sales figures that were twice as high as economists had forecast. Office Depot fell 17.3 per cent to $14.44 after warning of a weak fourth quarter. Costco Wholesale fell 4.7 per cent to $68.49 this week. The S&P retail index declined 7.6 per cent to 410.17 amid fears of a poor Christmas shopping period.The biotechnology sector also had a disappointing week. Biogen Idecfell 21.6 per cent to $58.79 and Celgene lost 12.1 per cent to $50.41. But, BioMarin Pharmaceutical soared 30.2 per cent to $36.44 after it won regulatory approval for a new drug.
86;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2007-11-23T18:47:05Z;Ailing mortage lenders set tone on Wall St;;The bears remained in charge on Wall Street this week when fears about a US economic slowdown and the continuing fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis bled confidence from jittery equity markets.With shoppers hitting the stores after Thanksgiving on Friday, beginning the most important shopping period of the year, US retailers were the focus of worries about a lacklustre holiday season.The Federal Reserve added to the prevailing malaise this week after it gave a downbeat assessment of prospects for US economic growth. “We’ve certainly upped the odds of a recession,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said.The S&P 500 rose 1,7 per cent to 1440.70 on Friday, closing the week on a high note as traders went bargain hunting after recent sharp falls.However the index was down 1.2 per cent for the week, a trading period truncated by the Thanksgiving holiday and a half-day session on Friday.The S&P 500 has remained below its 200-day moving average for 10 consecutive sessions, a bearish indicator, longer than during the initial summer credit squeeze.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.5 per cent on the week at 12,980.88, briefly falling below its mid-August trough before traders bought into weakness.The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5 per cent on the week at 2,596.60. The index has fallen 9.2 per cent from its 52-week high, set on October 31, as technology stocks have struggled to find a footing.Transport stocks, a traditional bellwether of economic sentiment, fared particularly poorly, with crude oil prices rising above $99 a barrel this week.The Dow transport index, down 2.5 per cent at 4,451.07, neared a key bearish indicator, a 20 per cent fall from its high for the year.Among the worst performing stocks this week were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises that provide liquidity to US mortgage markets by buying, securitising and guaranteeing home loans.The declining value of its mortgage-related securities contributed to a $2bn loss at Freddie Mac this week, with the shares falling 35 per cent to $26.47. Freddie warned it will need to raise capital, possibly by slashing its dividend in half, in order to meet regulatory requirements.Fannie Mae, a rival mortgage agency, was down 20.9 per cent to $32.20, amid continuing worries about the way it accounts for loan losses.Concerns that these agencies will be constrained in their ability to provide liquidity to the broader mortgage market hit a range of financial stocks this week.Countrywide Financial sank 20.1 per cent on the week to $9.65 after analysts said the company could be affected if GSEs stopped buying its mortgages in the secondary market.However, the company said rumours that it would seek bankruptcy protection were “absolutely false”.Meanwhile the big banks once again suffered a torrid week, precipitated by a Goldman Sachs analyst note that forecast another $48bn in writedowns by the end of 2008. Citigroup shed 6.8 per cent to $31.70 after the note said Citi could take $22bn in writedowns linked to its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations, $11bn this quarter, and $11bn next year.Homebuilder stocks were also punished amid a deepening malaise in the US real estate market.The S&P homebuilder index was down 14.3 per cent this week at 318.07, declining for six consecutive days before buyers sparked a rebound on Friday.Shares in Pulte Homes shed 25 per cent of their value this week at $9.63.With house prices plummeting, nervous investors are keeping a careful eye on retail sales amid fears that belt-tightening consumers may deliver a poor shopping holiday season.Office Depot fell 8.6 per cent to $17.50 this week after quarterly earnings fell 9 per cent while Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, was down 11 per cent at $22.27 during the period after it cut its full-year outlook. Gap declined 6 per cent to $18.89 after same-store sales fell 5 per cent.However, the retail picture was not universally bleak. Nordstrom rose 9.9 per cent to $35.72 on the week, after the department store’s quarterly earnings beat expectations. Electronics retailer Circuit City soared 19.5 per cent to $6.51 on Friday, 5.9 per cent higher for the week.Elsewhere, General Motors was the Dow’s biggest faller this week, down 7.2 per cent at $27.16.
87;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US insurers lobby over offshore tax breaks;;Some of the US’s biggest insurers are squaring up to giants of the Bermudan reinsurance industry over possible moves to crack down on tax breaks enjoyed by insurers based outside the US.The US insurers, including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, WR Berkley Corp, Hartford, Chubb and Travelers, are lobbying Washington to limit the tax breaks available to insurers that write business in the US, but can lay off risks to subsidiaries in tax-friendly locations.William Berkley, chairman and chief executive of WR Berkley Corporation, told the Senate Finance Committee last month: “If left unchecked, this will cause much more of the US capital base to migrate abroad and ultimately the future of our domestic insurance industry will be threatened.”However, the Bermudan reinsurance market argues the campaign is protectionist and anti-competitive.Insurers headquartered outside the US can legally cut their tax bills by reinsuring a significant proportion of the US risks they write to subsidiaries in locations with low or no corporation tax, such as Bermuda. In effect, they pay less tax on the money they build up to pay future claims.US insurers are concerned that the practice gives non-US headquartered insurers with capital bases in low-tax jurisdictions a competitive advantage.They want legislation to limit the tax benefit to ensure a level playing field.Bermudan insurers, however, say claims that reinsurance arrangements with subsidiaries are used to avoid tax bills are “bogus”.
88;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2007-10-19T21:11:34Z;Wall St down in worst week since July;;Wall Street shares had their worst week since the end of July after weak corporate earnings hit confidence in the outlook for the US economy.On the anniversary of the 1987 market crash, the S&P 500 fell 2.6 per cent at 1,500.63, its biggest one-day fall since the credit-squeeze hit in mid-August. The index was down 3.9 per cent on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.7 per cent on Friday and 4.1 per cent for the week, at 13,521.29.The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.7 per cent on Friday and 2.9 per cent for the week at 2,725.16.Small cap stocks suffered some of the biggest falls. The Russell 2000 index was 5 per cent lower this week at 798.78. All the leading 10 sectors of the S&P 500 were lower this week.Technology groups continued to outperform the market, while financials and consumer discretionary sectors fared worst. Consumer staples performed best – a traditional bellwether of negative economic sentiment. Traders expect continued volatility in share prices. The Chicago Board Options Exchange VIX index rose 28.5 per cent this week to 22.79. “Earnings have been mixed,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said. “The worry is that the US economy has declined more than anticipated.”Bluechip companies led the heavy falls on Friday amid continuing concerns about the outlook for corporate earnings.Caterpillar fell 8.4 per cent at $73.57 on the week after it cut its full-year outlook and warned that a number of industries it serves were in recession.The company added to fears that housing market problems are spreading to other parts of the economy after blaming the weak construction market for a fall in US machinery and engine sales. However, it posted a 21 per cent rise in quarterly profits.3M fell 8.1 per cent on the week at $86.62 on concerns about falling margins on the optical films it sells for LCD television screens. The shares fell even as 3M reported a 7.4 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings and raised its profit outlook for the full year. But revenues missed expectations.Honeywell’s results narrowly missed expectations. The blue chip’s shares were down 5.5 per cent on the week at $58.32.Wachovia capped a bad week for financial stocks as the bank reported a 10 per cent dip in third quarter profit, with results hit by writedowns amid the credit markets turbulence. Shares fell 8.4 per cent this week at $46.40. Citigroup fell 11.5 per cent on the week at $42.36 after it reported a 57 per cent fall in quarterly profit as writedowns linked to subprime mortgages, leveraged loans and fixed-income trading topped $3bn.Bank of America, off 8.6 per cent at $47.57, added to sector woes when it revealed a 32 per cent fall in third-quarter earnings and set aside $2.03bn in credit-loss provisions. Washington Mutual was down 17.4 per cent at $29.09 after its earnings fell 72 per cent in the third quarter. E*Trade Financial, down 21.4 per cent at $10.71, and KeyCorp, 13.1 per cent lower at $28.69, both disappointed investors this week.The S&P financial index declined 7.6 per cent this week at 439.57, while the investment bank index fell 8.7 per cent at 195.86. Technology stocks had mixed fortunes. Google hit a record high but Ebay fell. Credit Suisse raised its price target on Google to $800 after it increased profit 46 per cent and revenues grew 57 per cent in the third quarter. The shares were up 1.1 per cent on the week at $644.71.Intel was up 2.9 per cent at $26.30 after third-quarter profit rose 43 per cent. Revenues rose 15 per cent.

89;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2007-07-26T22:09:03Z;Global Overview: Equities tumble on credit woes;;A global risk aversion trade erupted across markets on Thursday, as the fear that the financial sector faces a credit crunch intensified.“What we’re seeing is a confluence of worries about future leveraged buy-outs, the worsening housing market, consumer demand and rising oil prices,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford financial services group.As global stocks fell sharply and sparked strong buying of government bonds, risky assets in emerging markets suffered harsher declines.”This is not a fundamental credit issue for emerging market countries,” said Gunter Heiland, co-head of emerging market debt at JP Morgan Asset Management. ”People are selling markets that have done well in order to hedge positions or protect profits in other asset classes.”The yen surged as carry trades, where investors have sold low-yielding currencies and used the proceeds to boost risk taking in recent years, were unwound. The volatility of the S&P 500 soared to its highest level since June 2006.Weakness was concentrated in derivative indices that track credit and mortgage debt. The US housing market deteriorated further in June as new home sales fell 6.6 per cent. Traders say speculative investors are being forced to sell risky assets as banks tighten lending standards in the face of deteriorating credit markets.Ciaran O’Hagan, strategist at Societe Generale said: ”Borrowers find it harder to finance their leverage and that is proving now a millstone for all risk-based strategies.”Investors were rattled when another hedge fund in Australia, Absolute Capital Group, suspended withdrawals from two of its funds after forecasting losses on complex financial assets.Banks are struggling to clear a backlog of debt deals that are required to fund this year’s record level of buy-outs. Debt financing for the Chrysler and Alliance Boots buy-outs ran into difficulties earlier this week and investors say the huge pipeline of deals will not ease until the mood in credit stabilises.“Liquidity and sentiment are the worst since 2002,” said Tom Murphy, corporate sector team leader at Ameriprise Financial. He said the speed of the repricing seen in credit valuations and the decline in liquidity has made investors question their overall investment thesis.In both Europe and the US, the cost of buying insurance on the respective credit derivative Crossover indices continued to surge. These widely-watched measures of credit market sentiment have more than doubled since mid-June. The iTraxx Crossover index broke through the psychological 400 level, putting it more than 200 points wider than it was in mid-June. The US CDX Crossover was at 342bp on Thursday and has jumped from140bp in mid June.“The pendulum has shifted in credit,” said Mark Kiesel, portfolio manger at Pimco. Deal activity thrived in an environment of cheap credit and borrowers took down as much as they could, and that has now changed he said.That mood sank US and European stock markets on Thursday.The S&P 500 fell 2.3 per cent, its worst one-day decline since February. The Dow also lost 2.3 per cent.The picture in Europe was no less gloomy. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 2.8 per cent to its lowest level for nearly five months. It was the biggest daily percentage fall since February. In London, the FTSE 100 shed 3.2 per cent, its biggest one-day percentage fall since March 2003.Deepak Agnani at Credit Suisse cautioned: “Conditions in credit markets are likely to get worse before they get better due to further event and headline risks. We expect a weak tone to persist through August.”But some analysts suggested that fears of an equity correction had been overdone.“There are many feared catalysts for a substantive market correction, yet the evidence does not support the likelihood of a sustained downturn,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.Earlier, Asian stocks had come under broad selling pressure. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.9 per cent to a two-month low, South Korean stocks tumbled 2 per cent and Taipei shed 1.8 per cent.But in China, the Shanghai composite index climbed 0.5 per cent to a record high as investors gave a positive response to strong first-half corporate earnings.Turkish stocks fell 4.2 per cent, the RTS index in Russia shed 2.5 per cent and the Bovespa in Brazil was 3.6 per cent lower.Government bonds were sought as safe-haven investments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was down 11 basis points at 4.79 per cent, its lowest since May. The yield on the two-year note plunged 17bp to 4.56 per cent.“We look for the Treasury market to remain well supported, but volatile, in the near-term as the general credit repricing takes place,” said Mr Agnani at Credit Suisse.While a quarter-percentage point rate ease in the Fed funds rate by the end of the year is now largely forecast by interest rate futures, analysts downplayed any potential action by the Federal Reserve.“The Fed will not cut rates until this repricing of risk becomes a systemic problem that impacts the market’s access to liquidity and leverage,” said Jim Caron, co-head of global interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley. He said the Fed would also be reluctant “to cut rates and reward investors who bought products with very little risk premium.”Elsewhere, the yield on the 10-year Bund was 7bp lower at 4.33 per cent and the 10-year gilt yield was 7bp lower at 5.20 per cent.Emerging market debt spreads over Treasuries widened to the highest since June last year. JPMorgan’s index of emerging debt widened 27bp to 223bp.In the currency markets, the Japanese currency rallied strongly and reached a three-month high against the dollar and gained 3.8 per cent against the high-yielding New Zealand dollar - one of the chief beneficiaries of carry.In commodities, oil prices reflected the volatility of other markets. The September West Texas Intermediate future briefly touched an 11-month high above $77 a barrel, and overtook the Brent price for the first time since February. Late in New York, WTI was 93 cents lower at $74.95
90;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2007-06-15T11:56:15Z;US annuity import comes with a caution;;"Variable-rate annuities are the latest investment vehicles to cross the Atlantic with a handful of prominent US insurers now marketing them to pensioners here.AIG, the world’s biggest insurer by market capitalisation, Hartford Life, MetLife, and Lincoln are among the US insurers starting to pitch variable annuities as a product to help Britons stash money away for retirement.But be sure to treat these exports with some suspicion as US securities regulators have criticised them in the past and some advisers claim their high charges mean they may not be as good a deal as they first appear.“I think investors should approach variable annuities with caution,” says Justin Modray, an adviser with Bestinvest.“The combination of high charges and poor investment choice makes it hard to recommend them. If you buy through an adviser who refunds the initial commission the proposition becomes a little more attractive, but I think most investors would be better off in a well-diversified conventional investment portfolio.”In their simplest form, variable annuities are unit-linked savings products, the value of which depends on investments in underlying assets. Like conventional annuities, which pay a pre-set income for life in return for a lump sum, their selling point is that they offer a guaranteed income stream. If you are 60 and hand a provider £100,000, for example, you might get a guaranteed income of 5 per cent or £5,000 a year. If you are older, this income level is likely to be higher. In addition, if the value of your investment increases after all charges, this income level will ratchet up. Even if the value of your pot falls, your level of income is assured, at least until age 75 and in some cases for the rest of your life.At the end of the term, usually when the investor reaches 75, the investor can choose to use the remaining fund to buy an annuity on the open market or stick with the income they are getting, which is guaranteed for the rest of their life. At 75, they can also opt to put their money into an Alternatively Secured Pension (ASP) whereby they draw an income directly from the fund. With a variable annuity, if an investor were to die before age 75, the lump sum would be payable to their heirs less tax of 35 per cent, while taxes on death on ASP funds are far higher.The benefit of variable annuities for investors is the guarantee, which protects income against a possible collapse in markets.“These products allow investors to benefit from a guaranteed income for life without actually buying an annuity,” says Billy Burrows, director at William Burrows Annuities.While variable annuities do not enjoy a strong reputation in the US, the ones available in the UK are slightly different from their Yankee counterparts.In the UK, the goal of variable annuities is to overcome two objections to conventional annuities: the fact that on a single day you lock into rates for the remainder of your life; and you lose access to your capital.A typical example of a variable annuity is Aegon’s ‘5 for Life’ which launched last year. It offers a guaranteed income of at least 5 per cent of the original investment from the age of 60 until age 75. This starting income will vary according to factors such as life expectancy. The 5 per cent is a flat withdrawal from an underlying investment fund and there is a guarantee to continue paying this until death even if the fund runs out.Such an investment can look appealing as it provides a guaranteed annuity-style income, which can rise if fund performance is good while retaining access to capital. The catch is that the hurdles to increasing your income are relatively high. Income will only increase if the fund rises after all costs. Total annual costs on these plans, which include the cost of providing the income guarantee, vary from just under 2 per cent to more than 4 per cent, depending on how the fund is invested and the commission your adviser takes.Without decent underlying fund performance your income will likely fall in real terms because of inflation, say advisers.Some advisers argue that paying additional money for a guaranteed income is not to the investor’s advantage. They also argue that if the investor bought a conventional annuity at outset they would get a much higher starting income. However supporters of variable annuities say that investors still get an income guarantee and that if they get half-decent fund performance their income will rise.Investors do need to keep an eye on costs. Aegon charges about 1 per cent a year to cover the cost of the guarantee, but investors must also pay additional establishment charges to fund initial commissions. With Aegon, initial commissions can be as high as 6.75 per cent.The size of these commissions poses a concern as just three years ago lawyers at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington DC brought charges against financial brokers in the US – who were rewarded with similarly hefty sales commissions – for advising elderly Americans to buy variable annuities even when they were not appropriate."
91;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2007-04-25T20:32:13Z;Global Overview: Dow moves above 13,000;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average breached the 13,000-points level to hit a record high on Wednesday, lifted by continued strong earnings news and better-than-expected US data on business orders.Stocks rallied further after the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book noted modest growth and “generally stable” consumer prices.By the close on Wall Street, the Dow was up 1.05 per cent at 13,089.89 and set a high of 13,107.45 earlier in the day. The Dow has taken 129 trading days to move from the 12,000 level breached on October 18.The speed of the 1,000-point rise pales in comparison with the 24 days it took the Dow to go from 10,000 to 11,000 in April 1999. But the subsequent move to 12,000 took seven-and-a-half years.In spite of the record high, the Dow’s return of 5 per cent this year still lags behind other US benchmarks and international markets.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 5.4 and 5.5 per cent, respectively.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed up 1 per cent at 1,495.42 while the Nasdaq rose 0.9 per cent at 2,547.89.“There is tremendous momentum behind this market,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford financial services group. She said the “wall of worry” for the market had not gone away but the US market was being lifted by a “cocktail of catalysts” including share buy-backs, deal activity, better-than-expected first-quarter results and gains in export earnings for large companies that make up a large part of the Dow.Thomson Financial said the blended first-quarter earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 – consensus forecasts plus reported numbers – had risen to 6.1 per cent. That is almost double the 3.3 per cent blended rate in early April.New orders for US durable goods rose 3.4 per cent in March, well above the 2.4 per cent expected by markets. Core capital goods orders rose 4.7 per cent in March after two months of sharp falls.For the whole of the first quarter, orders slumped 15.3 per cent year-on-year.“With capital spending having fallen in the final three quarters of 2006 and quite possibly again in the first quarter of this year, the bear camp will rationally assert that the trend is down,” said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak.“Armed with today’s data, the bull camp will disagree and assert that a rebound is under way.”On government bond markets, US Treasuries were hit hard by the durable goods report. Losses were pared after the release of data showing that new home sales rose 2.6 per cent in March to 858,000, short of the 890,000 expected by economists, only for the Beige Book to affect sentiment again.By mid-afternoon, the yield on the 10-year bond was up 3 basis points at 4.652 per cent.In Europe, 10-year Bund yields rose 2.5bp to 4.195 per cent as a survey from the Ifo institute on German business sentiment came in stronger than forecast for April, adding to expectations of eurozone interest rate rises. The survey, coupled with continued mergers and acquisitions news, helped lift the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 0.63 per cent to 1,574.01.On currency markets, the Ifo index also spurred the euro to rise to $1.3665 against the dollar, just shy of the record of $1.3670 hit in December 2004.It later slipped, to stand relatively unchanged at $1.3640. Andrew Garthwaite, strategist at Credit Suisse, said the dollar was likely to stabilise against the leading European currencies at current levels.He said it was about 18 per cent undervalued against the euro and 24 per cent below fair value against the pound.Mr Garthwaite said the US futures market appeared too optimistic in discounting rate cuts by year-end and speculators were already very “short” on the dollar.In addition, US financial assets no longer looked expensive relative to global peers and the US non-oil trade deficit was showing signs of stabilising.“We think most of the downside in the dollar from here is likely to be against the Asian currencies,” he said.
92;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2007-02-28T22:56:55Z;The view from the trading room;;"■Douglas Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman & Co: “At this stage we are looking at a one-day event and while markets will probably bounce around over the next week, the US economy is still doing reasonably well and I don’t think this is the end of the bull market.”

■Albert Edwards, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort: “At the core of this correction has been worries over the US economy.“Even the bulls were expecting a 10 per cent correction in the S&P 500. With the way economic data has been unfolding in the US and the risk of a sharp rise on the yen and
an unwinding of the carry trade, we could see that.”

■Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort: “If the Shanghai shenanigans do not reawaken in the global investor a proper sense of the risks they face, the problems in the US asset-backed [securities] market should do so.”

■Quincy Krosby, strategist at The Hartford: “Risk is back as a market factor that needs to be addressed with respect. The US market might bounce …but a lot of the smart money is not rushing back in.”

■Bernd Wuebben, senior fixed income strategist at BNP Paribas: “Many hedge funds – in the fixed-income market – had been waiting and hoping for a repricing of risk. On balance, they were positioned for higher volatility and had sold mortgages.

■Jeremy Whitley, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management: “In mainland China, a lot of money that has rushed in is from inexperienced investors.”Reported by Tony Tassell in London, Michael Mackenzie in New York and Joanna Chung in Hong Kong"
93;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2007-02-09T21:43:44Z;Markets Overview: Global equities hit new highs;;World equity markets reached new highs this week, although there still appeared to be concerns among investors over the outlook for global economic growth, inflation and interest rates.One unsettling factor came from a rise in oil prices as March West Texas Intermediate broke through $60 on Friday for the first time since early January.Analysts said there was also a growing acceptance that corporate earnings growth was poised to decelerate.Although there were no nasty surprises from central bank meetings in the UK and the eurozone, the European Central Bank gave a clear signal that interest rates would go up next month and further increases might be in the pipeline.That upset investors who had hoped the ECB might hint at a lengthy pause in its tightening cycle and prompted the FTSE Eurofirst 300 to retreat from a six-year high set on Wednesday. The index ended the week with a gain of less than 0.3 per cent while eurozone government bonds eased back.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average touched a record high midweek but by mid-afternoon on Friday was down 0.6 per cent over the five-days. The S&P 500 was 0.6 per cent up on the week, after hitting a six-year high, as was the Nasdaq Composite.There were some concerns among US investors about risky mortgage lending, which helped rekindle worries about the US housing market.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford financial services group, said US equities were waiting for a fresh catalyst after the last Federal Reserve policy meeting, at which the US central bank gave a rosy assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation.“Despite still-decent earnings in the fourth quarter, reality is beginning to settle in – earnings growth is slowing,” she said. Andrew Garthwaite, global equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said many people in the markets held the view that economic growth might now turn out to be too strong and inflationary pressures would re-emerge.“To us, it feels as if clients are still climbing a wall of worry, which seems strange to us given that we are, after all, enjoying near perfect economic conditions,” he said.Ian Harwood at Dresdner Kleinwort said a further threat to the “not too hot, not too cold” conjecture for the US economy might be posed by heightened international economic tensions.“One such source at present is the yen’s continued weakness,” he said.“It seems unlikely to us that Japan is going to do anything actively to lift its beleaguered currency.“Recently, however, speculation has grown that the BoJ, having decided not to raise rates further at its last two meetings, will opt to do so later this month,” Mr Harwood said. “We think such action unlikely.”Expectations that this weekend’s meeting of G7 finance ministers might offer the yen some support largely evaporated this week, snuffing out an attempt by the Japanese currency to rally.Hank Paulson, the US Treasury secretary, repeated on Friday that the yen’s value reflected economic fundamentals.Comments by Mr Paulson and Japanese officials have suggested that the yen’s weakness would not feature on this weekend’s G7 agenda.Elsewhere this week, the firmer tone of the oil market helped fuel a steady rise in the gold price, with the metal touching a seven-month high above $665 an ounce on Friday.Asian stocks recorded broad-based gains, with the Australian, Indian and Singapore markets, as well as the MSCI Asia-Pacific index itself, hitting record highs.The Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo fell 0.2 per cent over the week – its first weekly decline since early January.The main focus for the US bond market, in the absence of much in the way of important economic releases, was the Treasury’s quarterly refunding.Auctions of three, 10 and 30-year notes attracted solid demand, supporting a rally in prices.
94;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2006-10-18T21:02:33Z;Dow touches new peak as inflation retreats;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the best-known US stock market benchmark, rose above the key 12,000 level to a new record high in early trade on Wednesday.US shares rose after the opening bell on a batch of largely strong corporate earnings and an initially benign interpretation of some mixed inflation and housing data.This saw the Dow, which contains 30 of the US economy’s largest capitalised stocks, hit a new peak of 12,049.51, some seven and a half years after it first crossed the 11,000 barrier. However, the index later slipped and flirted above and below the 12,000 level amid profit-taking after recent gains.The record was 65 per cent above its post-2000 closing low of 7,286.27, struck on October 9, 2002. The Dow is currently up 11.84 per cent for the year and has rebounded 12.5 per cent from its June low of 10,653.23.Its rise has been described by many analysts as unrepresentative of the broader market. The S&P 500 index remains about 10 per cent below its peak of 1,527.46 set in 2000.The Dow also has attracted criticism for its construction, particularly the fact it is a price average and not weighted by market capitalisation.But Quincy Krosby, strategist at The Hartford financial services group, said: “Some people downplay the significance of the Dow’s move as it is not the index that professional investors really watch but it has big implications.“Buying begets buying. Investors might be encouraged by this and follow the path of least resistance and buy. It might encourage retail investors to put more money back into their home market.”Ms Krosby said the Dow’s rise underlined a shift towards big capitalisation stocks. This reflected not only rising risk aversion but also a desire by domestic investors to gain exposure to the overseas operations of the Dow’s big-cap stocks.The Dow closed at 11,992.68, up 0.36 per cent. The broader S&P 500 index was up 0.1 per cent at 1,365.96, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.3 per cent at 2,337.15, weighed down by falls in Yahoo and education company Apollo Group.The rise in the Dow and S&P came after data showing the US consumer price index dropped by a more-than-expected 0.5 per cent in September. The core rate of inflation rose 0.2 per cent in line with forecasts.Rick MacDonald, economist with Action Economics, said the monthly gain left the core index with a year-on-year gain of 2.9 per cent, the highest level since February 1996. He said this measure showed little sign of abating and would raise concern at the US Federal Reserve’s rate-policy meeting next week.There was also mixed data on the US housing markets for investors to digest. September housing starts rose 5.9 per cent to 1.772m, well above the consensus forecast of 1.64m. But building permits plunged 6.3 per cent to 1.619m, well below the expected 1.71m.“Analysts less bearish on housing than us will doubtless proclaim the starts numbers as evidence that the worst is over, but even a cursory glance at the awful permits numbers should disabuse all but the most incurable optimists of that notion,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.On commodity markets, US oil prices fell by $1.28 to $57.65 ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries on production cuts.
95;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2006-08-23T18:17:34Z;Market Overview: Surprisingly weak US housing figures hit equities and bonds;;More evidence of a slowing US economy in the form of weaker-than-expected housing market data dragged equities lower on Wednesday.The data further fuelled the debate over whether the US is set for a “hard” or “soft” economic landing.The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes and condominiums dropped by 4.1 percent in July from June to a seasonally-adjust-ed annual rate of 6.33m. The rate was the lowest level since January 2004 and well below market expectations of a 1 per cent fall.House prices held up more than some economists feared but rose only 0.9 per cent in July, in the slowest year-on-year price gain since May 1995.There was further negative news from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago which said its gauge of the US economy fell in July, hit by a rise in unemployment and fall in payroll additions. It was the second fall in three months.In reaction, equities on Wall Street reversed early tepid gains to fall into the red. By midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.4 per cent lower, while the S&P 500 index was down 0.4 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent.US bonds weakened in spite of the poor economic news on profit-taking after recent gains.A hawkish speech on inflation by Michael Moskow, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, also damped prices.The yields on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury rose 3 basis points to 4.84 per cent. The dollar initially slipped against the euro after the housing data but then edged back up as traders took a cautious approach ahead of the release of German business confidence figures on Thursday from the Ifo Institute.Quincy Crosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford insurance group, said the housing data supported the US Federal Reserve’s decision to take a pause on raising interest rates. It would also add to the case for the Fed to continue its pause at its next monetary policy meeting in September.“They will definitely want to see what impact it has on consumer spending which, of course, is the big engine of the US economy,” she said.Futures markets were pricing in only a marginal 12 per cent risk of a rate rise by the Fed in September, down from about 18 per cent before the housing data.Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders, said while the data provided clear evidence of the US housing market slowdown, the broad-er impact on the economy was still uncertain.“The link between housing and consumer spending is less clear cut than some suggest,” he said. Mr Wade said the US economy was still likely to face a soft landing.Further clues on the housing market will be provided by US data on new home sales on Thursday. Economists are looking for a 2.7 per cent fall in new home sales to an annual rate of 1.1m in July.In Europe, share prices fell in sympathy with the weak start to Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropped 0.59 per cent to 1352.94.In Asia, shares were broadly flat to slightly weak-er. The Nikkei 225 Average eased 0.1 per cent to 16,163.03.Commodity markets had a weaker day. Prices for Brent crude fell $1.44 to $71.80 a barrel on news of an increase in US gasoline stockpiles.Three-month nickel fell 4 per cent to $28,750 a tonne after it hit a record $29,950 in the previous session. Three-month copper slipped 0.6 per cent to $7,575 a tonne.
96;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2006-03-24T19:38:30Z;Market overview: Fed fixation intensifies;;"A fixation on global equity and bond markets over when the US Federal Reserve will stop its current cycle of monetary policy tightening deepened this week as interest rate expectations swung sharply.The central bank is almost universally expected to announce its fifteenth consecutive 25 basis points rise in its benchmark Fed funds target to 4.75 per cent when its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets on Monday and Tuesday. The decision will be announced on Tuesday.But shifting conjecture over its subsequent plans – how high rates will go – saw markets oscillate strongly this week.“There has been immense volatility in interest rate expectations in the last two weeks,” said Andrew Milligan, head of investment strategy at Standard Life Investments. He added that the volatility had come in spite of little change in economic conditions or signals from the Fed.Quincy Krosby, strategist at The Hartford insurance group, added that investors were overlooking factors such as high oil prices and the US current account deficit to focus almost solely at the moment on where the 10-year US Treasury yield was moving to divine future equity market direction.Optimism last week that the US central bank was close to calling a halt to rate rises initially faded after a speech on Monday by Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, to the Economic Club of New York that was perceived to be mildly hawkish.Mr Bernanke was seen to be positive on the economic outlook and gave little hint that the central bank would soon stop raising rates. He said he did not interpret the narrowing gap between short and long-term rates as “indicating a significant
economic slowdown to come”, saying it might instead reflect investors’ confidence in the economy.A more hawkish view of the rate outlook was given modest reinforcement by news of a rise in core US wholesale prices in February.This set the tone for markets for most of the week as equities and the dollar rallied while Treasuries came under pressure. But expectations shifted once again on Friday on news that sales of new US homes plunged 10.5 per cent in February, the biggest drop in nearly nine years. A slowdown in the housing market was seen as easing pressure on the Fed to raise rates.This saw Treasuries regain losses seen earlier this week.

97;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2005-08-30T20:35:13Z;Stocks lower as Katrina damage is assessed;;Hurricane Katrina depressed Wall Street stocks on Tuesday with retailers and transportation companies suffering most as one of the worst hurricanes to hit the US continued to wreak havoc in the south of the country.The storm knocked the market both by helping to push oil prices to yet another record high and through catastrophic damage to infrastructure in the storm’s path, and therefore to the bottom lines of insurance companies.Nine and a half weeks after oil prices caused consternation by passing the $60 a barrel mark, crude soared past $70 to $70.85, sparking concerns that high energy costs could damage the US economy by slashing corporate profits and finally ending the spending spree of the country’s heavily indebted consumers. Nymex crude futures finished the day up $2.61 at $69.81.Retailers and restaurants dominated the top 10 fallers in the S&P 500 with Staples, the office supply chain, falling 2.9 per cent to $21.85 and Darden Restaurants fell 2.8 per cent to $30.61. Tiffany, the jewellers, fell 2.6 per cent to $33.31. Wal-Mart also fell 1 per cent to $45.19 after announcing that 123 stores had been shut down due to a power cut.Insurers and re-insurers suffered. Shares of American International Group fell 0.4 per cent $59.28 and Hartford Financial Services dropped almost 0.3 per cent to $73.15.The transport sector, another area of the US economy that will see profits squeezed by higher oil prices, was also well down. United Parcel Service was 1.1 per cent down at $70.42 and CSX, a rail freight company, slipped 1.7 per cent to $44.85.The oil price was bad news for long-suffering airlines with Delta Air Lines, the cash strapped carrier widely expected to be the next airline to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, down 5.5 per cent to $1.20. The Amex airline index dipped 3 per cent at 46.75.All of which left the indices lower by the close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.5 per cent at 10,412.82 and the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent at 1,208.41. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,129.76.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said the bears need not despair, however, citing a “longer-term rally”.“That rally is a series of higher-lows. Even the weakest market average remains above its June low. If this decline bottoms out around these levels, it will appear to be just a normal pullback within the context of that ongoing rally.”The news that a measure of consumer confidence showed that Americans’ attitudes about the economy improved in August only gave the most brief of respites to indices. While the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence rose in August the US Commerce Department released a report showing a less than expected decline in factory orders in July.Oil producers continued to benefit from high prices with ConocoPhillips, the largest US refiner, gaining 2.1 per cent to $64.41. Halliburton, the world’s biggest oilfield services company, rose 3.5 per cent to $59.84.After rising, Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile-telephone company, which announced it had agreed to buy an affiliate for $427m, fell 1.3 per cent to $25.25.
98;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2005-07-08T21:03:30Z;Upbeat economic data outweighs a week of drama;;At the end of a shortened, dramatic trading week, shares on Wall Street went out on high after good economic news prevailed over terrorist attacks and surging oil prices.With no trading on Monday because of the Fourth of July holiday, oil prices, spurred on by a vicious hurricane season that threatens the country’s oil supplies, continued to be of major concern on Wall Street.Positive data on unemployment and consumer confidence coupled with some strong figures from the US earning season helped the markets to weather the storm and all three indices rose more than 1 per cent on Friday.Friday’s data showed from the Labor Department showed that US employers added 146,000 jobs in June. This was below Wall Street forecasts, but the unemployment rate fell to its lowest since September 2001, a government report showed. “What we have seen is a tug of war between politics and corporate fundamentals,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.One such corporate fundamental was the gains made by Alcoa, the world’s biggest aluminium maker, that on Friday posted the best quarterly profit in its history. Its shares gained 4.3 per cent on Friday, taking it to $27.20. Over the week it was up 4.1 per cent.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed 1.4 per cent to 10,449.14 and the broader S&P 500 was up 1.2 per cent at 1,211.86. The technology heavy Nasdaq gained 1.8 per cent, taking it to 2,112.88.Since the close of trade last Friday the Dow was up 1.4 per cent, the S&P 1.2 per cent and the Nasdaq 1.8 per cent.The recovery makes for a striking contrast with other recent atrocities that sent markets reeling and showed traders now fully “price in” terrorism. While the markets recovered in one session from the London blast, it took the S&P 500 more than two years to recover to its pre-September 11 levels. It took 14 session to recover from the Madrid blasts.The market was helped in its swift recovery, said Ms Krosby, in part because of the impressive show of resolve by Tony Blair and George Bush and because of strong underlying consumer and economic news.One of the most striking comebacks of the week was by the airline industry, which was badly hit by the double whammy of an oil spike and a terrorist attack but still managed to rally. The Amex Airline index was up 1.8 per cent at 48.03. Delta shares rose by 3.6 per cent on Friday after its share price plummeted in the wake of the news from London. However, it was still down 6 per cent over the week, finishing at $3.50.The tourist sector also made a comeback with the Marriott International hotel group up on last Friday by1.2 per cent at $69.49. The cruise operator Carnival also recovered after Thursday, and ended the week virtually unchanged at $54.74.Ms Quincy said the continued good health of America’s shoppers had also helped to lift markets.“The consumer confidence figures and the good retail sales showed that, despite higher prices at the pump, the US consumer is still alive and well,” he said.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, certainly had a good week with shares up 3.4 per cent at $49.90. The company was helped by an announcement on Thursday that its June same-store sales rose 4.5 per cent, helped by seasonal merchandise such as air conditioners and summer clothes.Shares of Gap were up 5.8 per cent at $20.97 and Target advanced 4.3 per cent, to $56.93.By mid-week, Exxon was among the biggest drags on both the Dow and the S&P 500, falling 1.7 per cent to $59.11 on Wednesday. However, it finished 1.9 per cent up from the previous week at $59.40.The most dramatic gains of the week came from a group of little-known specialist security companies that saw their shares leap on the terrorist news from London.Ipix and Digital Recorders, two companies that make surveillance devices, both saw their share prices jump on the news of the London attacks. Ipix soared 23.7 per cent on the day before finishing the week 2.8 per cent higher at $2.90.

100;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2004-12-07T21:37:53Z;US stocks lower as Fed rate decision looms;;"Wall Street stocks pulled back from a tentative midday rally on Tuesday as investors struggled to find action amid a murky economic outlook and a looming decision on interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to end the day at 10,441.76, while the S&P 500 fell 1.1 per cent to 1,177.14. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7 per cent to 2,114.83.More than 1.5bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange where declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly four to one.The three main US indices slumped even as the oil price fell to a fresh three-month low. Shares have stumbled since Friday, confounding bullish investors' hopes of a sustained rally in the run up to Christmas.Michael Driscoll, block trader at Bear Stearns, said he was still optimistic that this year's post-election rally could continue until the end of the year.Hopes for a renewed bounce have been bolstered by falling oil prices. Oil futures resumed their slide on Tuesday, closing down $1.52 at $41.46, following a rally on Monday that reversed a week of sharp decline.Optimism over oil was kept in check by government figures showing that business productivity in the third quarter had grown more slowly than expected. The US Labor Department said non-farm productivity had grown at a 1.8 per cent annual rate from July to September, a two-year low.In an otherwise slow week for economic news, instability in the Middle East and concerns about oil supplies ahead of a meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday continued to weigh on sentiment.Concerns that Opec might decide to cut oil production were compounded by official US data showing that average oil output by Opec members fell by 400,000 barrels per day in November.Christmas fortunes will hinge in part on next week's meeting of the US Federal Reserve, which must decide whether to raise interest rates amid this month's flurry of sometimes conflicting news about the state of the US economy.Todd Leone, head of listed trading at SG Cowen, said that the dithering on Wall Street was due in part to concerns over interest rates.""We've had a tremendous rally, up almost 700 points from the bottom,"" he said. ""People are really afraid to buy stocks because they are worried about the Fed [raising rates].""Johnson & Johnson fell 2.3 per cent to $60.43 following reports that the healthcare group was in advanced merger talks with Guidant, a leading maker of stents used to combat cardiovascular disease. Shares in Guidant jumped 5.3 per cent to $72.41 on news of the deal, which would strengthen both groups' positions against rival stent makers Medtronic and Boston Scientific. Medtronic fell 0.7 per cent to $48.94, while Boston Scientific shares fell 1.2 per cent to $34.10.Colgate-Palmolive shares rose 8.2 per cent to $50.07 after the consumer products company announced that it would make sweeping workforce cuts and close one third of its factories as part of a restructuring programme.IBM slipped 1.7 per cent to $96.06 amid continuing talks about selling a majority stake in its PC division to Lenovo, the Chinese computer group, for as much as $2bn.Elsewhere in the computer sector, Hewlett-Packard shares fell 1.3 per cent to $21.05 after Carly Fiorina, the chief executive, declined to comment on the company's progress in meeting financial targets.The S&P Insurance index fell 0.8 per cent to 311.91 as investors digested a New York jury's decision to consider the hijacked airliner attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center on September 11 2001 as two separate events. The decision, which came after the close of trading on Monday, means that Larry Silverstein, the ground zero leaseholder, could get twice the payout from his policies.Shares in the St Paul Travelers Companies, the parent company of Travelers Indemnity and Gulf Insurance, two of the nine insurers involved in the decision, fell 1.3 per cent to $36.83, while shares in Hartford Financial Services, the parent of another WTC insurer, fell 0.7 per cent to $65.12.Kroger, the grocer, rose 1.6 per cent to $16.26 as it reported its quarterly earnings, which fell short of analysts' expectations.Sirius Satellite Radio, the satellite radio group, shot up 11.4 per cent to $9.01 on news of a new distribution deal with Toyota.Sirius's rival, XM Satellite Radio, which also has a Toyota deal, rose 1.8 per cent to $38.41."
101;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2004-09-07T18:36:48Z;Wall Street climbs after holiday weekend;;"Wall Street climbed on Tuesday as investors returned in buoyant spirits from the Labor Day holiday in the US, cheered by easing crude oil prices and upbeat corporate news.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 0.8 per cent at 10,341.16, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,121.30. The Nasdaq climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,858.56.The continuing fall in oil prices lifted the market's mood but led the S&P 500 energy sector to one of the session's weakest performances, flat on the day. It was one of just three sectors not firmly in the black.Market participants said a cocktail of other factors helped the day's performance, including relief that the Republican National Convention finished without a terrorist attack, as well as the return of many money managers who had been on holiday in late August.James Dlugosch, editor of the Rational Investor Newsletter, noted that cash positions had been growing through the sleepy summer season.Additionally, after a week of disappointing corporate news, investors were primed to welcome any profits surprises or climbing earnings forecasts.Hovnanian Enterprises rose 9.3 per cent to $38.50 after the luxury homebuilder topped Wall Street's third quarter profits expectations and boosted its forecast for the full fiscal year.Seagate Technology, which makes computer hard drives, rose 3.8 per cent to $12.32 after forecasting quarterly sales and earnings above Wall Street estimates amid stronger demand.Fleetwood Enterprises, maker of mobile homes and recreational vehicles, added 12.4 per cent at $15 after strong sales drove it to a fiscal first quarter profit of $6.7m, double Wall Street's expectations.However, the day also brought disappointment.Shares in US Airways sank 12.8 per cent to $2.05 after leaders of the airline's pilots union snubbed the company's latest contract proposal, denting the company's efforts to avoid a second bankruptcy filing.But the rest of the airline sector received a slight boost from the sliding oil price. Delta Air Lines rose 9.3 per cent to $4.48, AMR, parent of American Airlines added 0.2 per cent at $8.92, Continental Airlines gained 1 per cent to $9.67 and Southwest Airlines rose 1.4 per cent to $14.45.Insurers saw a mild relief rally as damage caused by Hurricane Frances appeared to be less than was feared. The S&P 500 group added 1.2 per cent. Allstate, the insurer and largest property casualty in Florida, rose 1.9 per cent to $47.91. Other insurers with personal lines in Florida include Chubb, up 1.6 per cent to $69.65; Hartford Financial Services Group, up 1.8 per cent to $62.34; and Safeco, up 1.3 per cent to $48.41.Netflix, the mail order video rental service, leapt 7.3 per cent to $15.41 after Newsweek reported the company had struck an agreement with TiVo, the maker of television recorders, to allow Netflix subscribers to download movies over the Internet to their TiVos. TiVo shares rose 14.9 per cent to $5.08.Tech stocks enjoyed a rebound from last week's sharp losses, triggered in part by a disappointing mid-quarter update from bellwether Intel.Cisco rose 1.6 per cent to $19.05, after it was upgraded by CIBC World Markets. The analysts cited a strong growth outlook, predicting “at least” six quarters of outperformance.But not all of Wall Street was so upbeat about techs.

102;HIG;Hartford Financial Services Group;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
