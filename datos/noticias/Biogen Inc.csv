Shares in Roche, whose subsidiary Genentech makes gantenerumab, were flat.Levi Garraway, chief medical officer and head of global product development at Roche, said even though the trial did not reach its goals, it was “the first of its kind and a bold undertaking by all partners involved”.The trial targets the same potential cause of Alzheimer’s — a build-up of amyloid protein plaques in the brain — as a drug that Biogen intends to submit for US regulatory approval soon. Many trials based on the so-called amyloid hypothesis, that clearing these plaques would slow patients decline, have failed.Biogen surprised the market by reviving an abandoned trial last October, adding $10bn to its market value in one day. Its shares fell 0.8 per cent to $335.98 in mid-morning trading on Monday after the announcement.Marc Goodman, an analyst at SVB Leerink Research, said it was wrong to draw conclusions from this trial on the potential efficacy of Biogen’s drug candidate aducanumab. He explained that the Eli Lilly and Roche drug candidates were applied to a different population, only in a small number of patients, and targeting different molecules.

Biogen will now be able to sell Tecfidera, which generated $4.4bn in revenue last year, until the patent expires in 2028. The US Patent Trial and Appeal Board said Mylan had not demonstrated that some claims were patentable. The Boston-based biotech company said that it was pleased with the decision. It added that since it was approved in March 2013, Tecfidera set a “new standard of care” and has been used to treat 415,000 patients. Sales of Tecfidera, which treats the disease of the central nervous system, contributed 30 per cent of Biogen’s revenue last year. The majority of sales were in the US.Mylan said it strongly disagreed with the decision and will pursue all options for appeal. The generic drugmaker is also battling the patent in courts in Virginia and Delaware.Mylan has argued that the patent should be invalidated because the active ingredient in Tecfidera had been known for years.Investors had been nervous that Biogen could lose the dispute. Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore, said in a note published ahead of the decision that many people had been “waiting on the sidelines” until after the judgment to buy into Biogen, which is preparing to file for approval for its potential Alzheimer’s drug. Biogen shares soared in late October when the company said data from trials of aducanumab, the drug candidate for Alzheimer’s, showed it worked in higher doses, despite having shut down the trials after an independent analysis decided it was futile in March. In mid-afternoon trading in New York, shares in Mylan, which is in the process of merging with Pfizer’s generics business Upjohn, were up 2.6 per cent to $22.83. Biogen soared more than 19 per cent to $339. The patent decision comes on the same day as Gilead lost its bid to dispute two patents granted to the US government over the use of Truvada to prevent HIV in a case that has caused waves because of the high price of the drug.The Patent Trial and Appeals Board said Gilead failed to demonstrate it was likely to win the argument to overturn the patents owned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both sides await a decision in another set of patents related to the drug. Gilead said in a statement that it continued to believe all four of the government patents are invalid.Shares in Gilead fell 2.3 per cent to $65.89.

Biogen must convince regulators to trust the data from the two studies, which it had previously abandoned as futile. One of the two — virtually identical — trials, known respectively as Emerge and Engage, was unsuccessful.Samantha Budd Haeberlein, Biogen’s vice-president responsible for late-stage clinical development in Alzheimer’s, made a company presentation at an Alzheimer’s conference in San Diego. She reported that the patients who had received the maximum quantity of the drug, for the full regime of 14 doses, showed a 30 per cent slowing of the decline in the Emerge trial, and a 27 per cent decline in the Engage trial.Chief medical officer Alfred Sandrock asked analysts concerned that approval could be denied to put faith in Biogen’s history of not filing studies that were not ready for regulators.“We don’t file willy-nilly,” he said.Shares in Biogen fluctuated as investors digested the detail from the presentation. The stock closed up 3.4 cent to $299.39.Cognitive decline is measured by surveys asking patients and caregivers about their ability to do daily tasks at home and in the community. Sharon Cohen, a medical director in Toronto who was a principal investigator on the study, said that people who suffer from Alzheimer’s lose themselves “slice by slice”.The community at large fears Alzheimer’s disease and rightly so, because of the loss of autonomy that comes with this disease. So slowing the loss of autonomy is key“The community at large fears Alzheimer’s disease and rightly so, because of the loss of autonomy that comes with this disease. So slowing the loss of autonomy is key,” she said.The final analysis of the studies showed that the results of the trials still diverged when all patients were included.The average patient on the high dose in the Emerge study showed a 22 per cent decline, but patients in the Engage study actually performed slightly worse than the placebo group. Biogen attributed this difference to a change in the study to allow higher doses, which meant that a greater proportion of the Emerge study participants started after the change had already been made.Stephen Salloway, a professor of psychiatry, human behaviour and neurology at Brown University, said the study was an important start — a “biological foothold” for the fight against Alzheimer’s.“It could open an era of precision medicine in Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.Shares in Biogen soared — adding more than $10bn to its market value — in October when the biotech announced that it would seek approval for the Alzheimer’s drug. But the stock did not regain all its losses from March when they abandoned the trials because an independent monitoring committee determined it would be futile to continue.Analysts had significant questions about whether the US Food and Drug Administration is likely to approve a drug on the basis of one successful trial, when the drug candidate had failed in a similar trial. After the presentation, analysts at BTIG and SVB Leerink both said their share price targets were based on a 50 per cent chance of approval.Geoffrey Porges, senior biotechnology analyst at SVB Leerink, said the 50 per cent probability was probably conservative. “This is conceptually close enough to our expectations for the drug’s effect and performance that it likely to be generally endorsed by most non-statistician specialists and physicians,” he said.Earlier this week, Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird, downgraded the stock because of what he called “Alzheimer’s hype”.He suggested that investors were buying shares because of “Fomo” — fear of missing out — but that the “preponderance of data” suggests aducanumab does not provide a clinical benefit.Aducanumab is one of the last remaining drug candidates to be based on the so-called “amyloid hypothesis” that Alzheimer’s is caused by the build-up of sticky plaques in the brain.Initially, Biogen had been cautious about giving higher doses because of a side effect that swelled the brain, known as ARIA-E. The majority of patients did not experience any symptoms. However, the side effects may be a concern for regulators.The more detailed results showed that patients on higher doses were more likely to experience the brain swelling, with just over a third exhibiting the side effect in both studies. Patients with a gene that shows a predisposition for Alzheimer’s — ApoE — were even more likely to have ARIA-E.However, most of these patients did not experience the symptoms, which include headaches and vomiting, and only knew about the temporary side effect because it was picked up on an imaging scan.
3;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2019-10-23T04:00:29Z;Alzheimer’s drug revival gives hope to millions — and investors;Biogen says seeking approval for aducanumab hails ‘turning point’ in fight against disease;The revival of a potential drug to fight Alzheimer’s, whose clinical trials had been declared futile just months ago, proved the value of sticking with the search for treatments for the disease when other pharmaceuticals companies are “running away”, according to the chief executive of its developer, Biogen.By announcing on Tuesday that it would seek regulatory approval after all for its drug aducanumab, the US biotech company gave new hope to millions of patients and caregivers — and its shareholders.Michel Vounatsos, Biogen chief executive, told the Financial Times that the new data analysed since the company halted a patient trial in March marked a “turning point in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease”. But among Alzheimer’s researchers and campaigners, who have lived through decades of dashed hopes, the unmistakable excitement was tempered by a battle-hardened caution. Biogen shares reflected that: having opened almost 40 per cent higher, they closed on Tuesday with a somewhat more modest 26 per cent gain.While the opportunity is huge, so are the hurdles. The theory that Alzheimer’s patients suffer from a build-up of amyloid plaques — hard clumps of protein between nerve cells in the brain — may have found statistical support in a large-scale human trial for the first time, but the full data will not be published until December.Biogen licensed aducanumab in 2007 from Neurimmune, a Swiss company which had found evidence some people benefited from antibodies that cleared away the plaques, and has been working to turn these antibodies into a potential drug ever since.In March a so-called futility analysis of its two late-stage trials for the drug found the benefits did not outweigh the risks. The company abandoned the trials, seemingly adding aducanumab to the list of once-promising Alzheimer’s drugs that have failed in the late stages of testing, leaving the industry with little to show for the billions of dollars spent.Mr Vounatsos said Biogen remained focused on finding treatments for the degenerative condition when other “companies are running away” and called the reversal “a testament to our persistence and pioneering role”.The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said studying a larger data set had shown aducanumab did work if it was taken at higher doses, improving patient cognition and their ability to perform daily tasks such as cleaning and shopping and slowing their clinical decline by 23 per cent compared to a placebo. Crucially, it announced that the US drug regulator was open to it filing for an approval. One of the two trials met its goal. On the study that failed, a subset of patients saw success: those who had taken more of the drug also had their decline slowed. Biogen had at first been cautious about giving higher doses because of a side effect that swelled the brain — but the majority of patients did not experience any symptoms. Paola Barbarino, chief executive of Alzheimer’s Disease International, which represents 100 Alzheimer’s associations and federations around the world, described the announcement as “the most positive piece of news we have had in decades” but warned that it was “quite early stages”. If one company is successful . . . that will create more interest and more pharmacological innovationAnalysts questioned whether the data really would be enough to convince the US Food and Drug Adminstration to approve the drug. Evan Seigerman, an analyst at Credit Suisse, warned investors to beware of “hype” around the prospective Alzheimer’s drug while it remains unclear which patients it works best for or how to decide on the right dose while avoiding side effects. Others were relieved they had not been wrong to be shocked in March. “After months of apologising for getting this story so wrong, we are relieved and not entirely surprised,” said Thomas Shrader, an analyst at BTIG. “Our detailed molecular thesis for aducanumab was that removing ‘junk’ from a patient’s brain should help.”Biogen must have received a “very strong signal” from the FDA to announce that it will seek approval, just a day after its second meeting with the agency, said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at SVB Leerink. “I think the FDA of five to 10 years ago would have thrown this out and said, ‘Go and do another study.’ But the current FDA is fairly patient — and industry-friendly and seems inclined to find a way to approve the drug,” he said.Even if it does win approval, Biogen will have to be careful how it prices the treatment, given insurers and healthcare systems may struggle to pay for it for millions of patients. Mr Vounatsos would not discuss pricing at this stage, but said the disease created half a trillion dollars in direct and indirect costs, indicating how the company will seek to justify its price tag.James Kupiec, chief medical officer of PromisNeurosciences and the former head of Pfizer’s neuroscience unit, said Biogen’s reversal will “revitalise” the work pursuing the hypothesis that amyloid plaque causes the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer’s patients, which many scientists had recently “poo-pooed”.Ms Barbarino agreed it could catalyse investment in the field. “If one company is successful . . . that will create more interest and more pharmacological innovation,” she said. It would also help draw new young researchers, with fresh ideas, to the work. “If all you hear is failure, people are less likely to join the fray,” she said. Few companies had given up entirely on Alzheimer’s research, Ms Barbarino suggested, since many big-name pharma businesses were at least continuing to explore data sets. Shares in smaller, Alzheimer’s-focused biotechs Denali Therapeutics and Alector rose more than 5 per cent on Tuesday.Alison Evans, head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said that scientists should also continue to look beyond the amyloid plaque. “It is really important we explore all avenues,” she said. “We have so much unmet need, we need as many shots on goal as possible.”
4;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2019-10-22T20:13:54Z;Biogen shares soar on plan to seek Alzheimer’s drug approval;Biotech group says new analysis shows benefits of aducanumab when taken at a high dose;Biogen plans to seek approval for an experimental Alzheimer’s drug that could be the first to treat the devastating disease, reversing course after abandoning the treatment earlier this year and sending its shares soaring by more than a quarter. The US biotech company said new analysis of a larger data set from its trial for aducanumab showed the drug had an impact on those suffering from the early stages of the neurological disease when taken at a high dose. Patients that received a high dose “experienced significant benefits on measures of cognition and function such as memory, orientation, and language”, the company said. They were better able to complete tasks such as cleaning and shopping, conducting personal finances and travelling independently. “Today is about hope and opportunity for patients first but also for the shareholders,” said Michel Vounatsos, Biogen’s chief executive. The share price rise — up $58.36 to $281.87 — added more than $10bn to Biogen’s market value.The company’s stock had dropped in March when it and its Japanese partner Eisai said they would halt trials after a futility analysis by an independent monitoring committee indicated the drug was not going to be effective. The end of two late-stage trials was a blow to patients suffering from the debilitating disease, which affects 5.7m people in the US alone. It was also seen as a sign that it was time to abandon the so-called amyloid hypothesis that memory loss is caused by a build-up of sticky plaques in the brain. Mr Vounatsos said Tuesday’s announcement was “truly heartening” in the fight against Alzheimer’s. “This is the result of groundbreaking research and is a testament to Biogen’s steadfast determination to follow the science and do the right thing for patients,” he said. “We are hopeful about the prospect of offering patients the first therapy to reduce the clinical decline of Alzheimer’s disease and the potential implication of these results for similar approaches targeting amyloid beta.”Since the studies were abandoned, more data have become available, with the data set now including 3,285 patients, more than 2,000 of whom took the drug for 18 months. Dr Anton Porsteinsson, director of the University of Rochester Alzheimer’s Disease Care, research and education programme, and principal investigator, said the larger data set was the first time a phase III study — a trial used to win approval for a drug — demonstrated that clearance of the plaque known as amyloid beta can reduce Alzheimer’s patients’ clinical decline. Participants in the trials will now be able to go back on the drug.The company will file for approval with the US Food and Drug Administration in early 2020 and is in talks with regulators in Europe and Japan.The findings could also be positive for other potential drugs that Biogen has in development, including another that targets amyloid plaques and some which try to tackle a build-up of tau protein, which disrupts brain function. It could even affect research and development of drugs in different neurlogical conditions. In third-quarter results released on Tuesday, Biogen’s adjusted earnings per share were $9.17, beating the average analyst estimate of $8.27. Net income was $1.5bn, up 7 per cent year on year. Revenue was $3.6bn in the quarter, higher than the consensus forecast of $3.5bn and up 5 per cent year on year. Shares in Biogen were 30 per cent higher at $289.82 in New York in morning trade. 
5;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2019-07-23T11:11:22Z;Biotech group Biogen boosted by sales of key drugs;Treatments for multiple sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy help Biogen beat forecasts;Biogen, the neuroscience-focused biotech company, raised full-year guidance and beat earnings and revenue expectations, driven by sales of drugs for multiple sclerosis and the serious genetic disease spinal muscular atrophy.The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said it now expects revenue of about $14bn to $14.2bn for the full year, up from its prior guidance of between $13.6bn to $13.8bn. It raised its forecasts for statutory diluted earnings per share to between $29.60 and $30.40, an increase from the previous range of between $26.65 and $27.65.Michel Vounatsos, Biogen’s chief executive, said the company was on track for a “strong year”. He said the company has added four new assets to its pipeline, including two from its March acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics for $877m.In the second quarter, Biogen reported better than expected adjusted earnings per share of $9.15, significantly higher than the average analyst estimate for $7.53.Net income was $1.5bn, 72 per cent higher than the same period last year, when the company spent on several deals including a 10-year pact with Ionis Pharmaceuticals and the acquisition of an asset it hopes could be used to treat schizophrenia from Pfizer.Revenues were $3.6bn in the quarter, compared to the consensus forecast of $3.47bn, and up 8 per cent year-on-year.Biogen’s stock plummeted earlier this year after it shut down a trial for a treatment for Alzheimers, along with its partner Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai. The failure in a key disease area wiped $18bn from its market capitalisation in one day. Shares in Biogen, which are far from fully recovering their losses, rose 1 per cent on Tuesday to $234.48.
6;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2019-04-24T14:53:38Z;Biogen promises to plug pipeline gap after Alzheimer’s failure;Drug company’s chief Michel Vounatsos says it has the cash for share buybacks and M&A;Biogen said it was on the hunt for acquisitions to bolster its pipeline of drugs, as it tries to soothe shareholders disappointed by the failure of its experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s last month. Michel Vounatsos, chief executive, said the neuroscience-focused biotech company had the cash flow and balance sheet to do deals while buying back billions of dollars of shares.“I believe Biogen is set to rebound and I fundamentally believe that we will be back,” he said on a call with analysts to discuss first-quarter earnings. “We can do both buying back and M&A activities.” Shares in Biogen dipped almost 3 per cent in early trading in New York, despite the company beating expectations on earnings and revenue. Biogen has bought back $1.1bn of stock so far this year, part of a $5bn buyback programme. The stock fell 30 per cent in one day after the failure of a trial of an experimental drug for Alzheimer’s developed by Biogen with its Japanese partner Eisai. The companies discontinued two global Phase III trials of aducanumab after an independent monitoring committee found that the drug was not going to prove effective.The decision was a blow to efforts to defeat the disease, which more than 40m patients suffer from worldwide, after many other once-promising drugs had also failed. Biogen said it will examine the results of the failed trial to decide whether to push ahead with other programmes based on the same hypothesis that targeting amyloids — folded proteins in the brain — could treat Alzheimers. Michael Ehlers, executive vice-president of research and development, said it would continue to pursue potential treatments based on targeting another protein, called tau. He said Phase II trials of these alternative drugs showed “good target engagement”, but warned that the work was still “relatively early” and so “remains a risky programme”. As analysts raised concerns about the paucity of new drugs in the pipeline, the company stressed that it has 10 mid- to late-stage trials, from which it expects to publish data by 2020. Meanwhile, sales of Spinraza, the first drug approved for treating spinal muscular atrophy, soared 42 per cent year-on-year as it went on the market in more countries. Its US sales were $223m in the quarter and $295m from overseas. The number of patients receiving it grew about 5 per cent in the US and 24 per cent outside the US, compared with the previous quarter. The drug is now being sold in 40 countries. In February, Biogen received approval in China for Spinraza to treat the most common form of spinal muscular atrophy.Total sales of all Biogen’s drugs were $3.5bn in the three months until the end of March, above the average estimate for $3.4bn and an increase of 11 per cent year-on-year. Sales of a treatment for multiple sclerosis also contributed to the solid sales, as did biosimilars, in particular sales of a generic alternative to Abbvie’s blockbuster Humira in Europe. Biogen reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.98 in the first quarter, higher than the average analyst estimate of $6.84. Net income rose 7.7 per cent to $1.4bn compared the same quarter the year before. Mark Phipps, an analyst at William Blair, said that while growth in the near-term looks good for Spinraza, he is concerned about impending competition.Biogen said it believes Spinraza will be the standard of care for spinal muscular atrophy for years to come, and expanded its estimate of the number of patients suffering from the disease worldwide from about 20,000 to 45,000. 
7;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;What next for Alzheimer’s research after latest drug failure?;Biogen’s aducanumab was last hope of one approach to the disease, but there are others;More than 40m Alzheimer’s patients worldwide suffered a setback this week when Biogen and Eisai dropped trials on an experimental treatment for the disease which leads to the loss of memory and mental functions.The US biotech company and its Japanese partner said on Thursday that aducanumab was not going to be effective, sending shares in Biogen tumbling 29 per cent.Brad Loncar, founder of Loncar Investments, which runs two biotech funds, said this was “a blow” for the hypothesis that has dominated Alzheimer’s research for the past five to 10 years: that you could stop symptoms by clearing the build-up of amyloid plaques in ageing brains that destroy connections between nerve cells.“This is really the final data point that shows we do not really know what is causing this disease and how to make an impact with a pharmaceutical,” he said.The first trial using a similar approach failed over 10 years ago and many including studies by Eli Lilly and Pfizer have failed since. Disappointed, Pfizer pulled out of neuroscience research last year.However, Biogen’s drug looked more promising after a paper published in Nature in 2016 showed that in a small drug, there was “a fairly meaningful stabilisation”, said Dr Adam Boxer, a professor in neurology at the University of California San Francisco.“It is a particularly big setback because there was more hope for this drug than for many of the other recent anti-amyloid therapies for which the trials were stopped,” he said.Biogen and Eisai have not yet released the full results of their trail but experts believe the drug may have been working on the wrong target.Scientists have been chasing ways to remove plaques since they first discovered them in autopsy studies of Alzheimer’s patients. But we now know there are many other indications of Alzheimer’s in the brain including tangles, twisted fibres of a protein called “tau”.Dr Howard Fillit, founding executive director of the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, explained that even though these kind of therapies can clear the plaques — the clear-up does not lead to an improvement in a patient’s progression.There are still some ongoing trials focused on removing plaques. Biogen has one in progress with a different treatment — known as BAN2401 — but analysts predict the company will also abandon it.Two large pharmaceutical companies are conducting trials using the same target, but earlier in the progression of the disease. Both are funded by the US National Institute of Aging. Roche has a five-year study in Colombia looking at people who are genetically predisposed to the disease but have not yet developed symptoms. Eli Lilly is working on a study of people who have normal memory function but when their brains are scanned, show an already elevated level of the amyloid plaques.Dr Heather Snyder, senior director at the Alzheimer’s Association in the US, said she believed it was important that “all avenues are explored”, especially the trials that were looking at people before they even have any symptoms. Just like in heart disease or cancer, they might discover treatments that work earlier — but wouldn’t work later, she said.Yes — but many are at very early stages.There are more than a hundred different drugs being explored and more than half of those are not focused on plaques at all, said Dr Fillit.Researchers are investigating different ways the brain ages such as how it processes glucose and inflammation problems, leading to trials at UK universities looking at repurposing, for example, diabetes and anti-inflammatory drugs.Biotech companies are taking a variety of approaches, with Bay Area start-up Denali Therapuetics exploring anti-inflammation strategies and Alector targeting the brain’s immune system. Arnon Rosenthal, chief executive of Alector, said the company was working on two trials: one of a drug that increases the activity of certain proteins linked to the disease, and another that decreases the activity of other associated proteins.“We found out the common denominator is that the immune system in the brain is not functioning. It is the police force or the national guard that makes sure everything works normally, that the good citizens, the nerve cells, are protected, and the pathological proteins are eliminated,” he said.Public market shareholders were burnt on Thursday as Biogen dropped dramatically and even companies with different approaches to Alzheimer’s fell: Alector was down 2 per cent and Denali Therapeutics dropped 7 per cent.As scientists return to the labs to work on earlier stage prospects, Mr Loncar of Loncar Investments believes that more government and academic funders would have to step up to replace funds from Big Pharma and public market investors, who might now make a different calculation about the likely return on an investment in Alzheimer’s, at least for the time being.There is already significant public funding for research, with the US National Institute of Health spending about $1.9bn a year in 2018, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. There are also many public-private partnerships, including a $250m Dementia Discovery Fund with contributions from the UK government, pharma companies and philanthropists including Bill Gates.The search for an effective treatment may have been pushed back, but with the Alzheimer’s Association forecasting the number of people in the US alone with the disease could triple to 14m by 2050, the need for an effective treatment is only growing — and a wide range of funders eager to help provide it.
8;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Biogen shares slump on Alzheimer’s drug trial failure;Drugmaker loses $18bn from market value after deciding to discontinue trials;US drugmaker Biogen and its Japanese partner Eisai will cease trials of an experimental Alzheimer’s treatment, the companies said on Thursday, dealing another blow to efforts to defeat the disease and sending Biogen shares down more than 29 per cent.The companies said they decided to discontinue the two global Phase III trials of aducanumab after a “futility analysis”, conducted by an independent monitoring committee, indicated the drug was not going to prove effective.The disappointment adds aducanumab to the list of once-promising Alzheimer’s drugs that have failed in the late stages of testing, leaving the industry with little to show for the billions of dollars spent. Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death among adults in the US, affecting an estimated 5.7m people in the US alone.Aducanumab was being tested on Alzheimer’s patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. The Biogen-Eisai statement said the recommendation to stop the studies was not based on safety concerns.“This disappointing news confirms the complexity of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the need to further advance knowledge in neuroscience,” said Michel Vounatsos, Biogen’s chief executive.Biogen shares were down 29 per cent in afternoon trading in New York, wiping off about $18bn from its market capitalisation, which stood at slightly more than $63bn on Wednesday. That sent the stock to its lowest level since mid-2016.The Alzheimer’s treatment was Biogen’s single most significant prospect in a pipeline of new drugs that investors hoped would secure the company’s future as existing products faced intensifying competition. Its multiple sclerosis treatment Tecfidera now has a rival from Genentech, and a muscular dystrophy drug Spinraza is expected soon to have a new rival from PTC Therapeutics. Tom Shrader, biotech analyst at BTIG, cut his rating on Biogen from “buy” to “neutral” as a result of the failure of aducanumab. A stroke drug in Phase III trials is not very exciting, he said, and the rest of the pipeline consists of “novel, high risk” medicines.But, Mr Shrader said, Biogen is “still an aggressive company with a knack for finding new directions”.A favourable performance of aducanumab in mid-stage Phase II studies last year appeared to offer some validation of the so-called amyloid hypothesis. This is the most common explanation for what might cause Alzheimer’s, and proposes that memory loss and other impairments are the result of a build-up of sticky plaques in the brain.The popularity of the hypothesis has fallen in recent years after drugs from Merck & Co, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca, stumbled in final Phase III trials.Jim Kupiec, chief medical officer at ProMIS Neurosciences and the former head of Pfizer’s neuroscience unit, said targeting plaque had now been proven to be the wrong tactic. An alternative approach targeting different proteins in the brain called toxic oligomers is showing great promise, he said, although large-scale human trials are years away.“I’ve been in this piece of business for 15, 20 years or so and I don’t think I’ve ever been more encouraged and optimistic, there is real hope on the horizon for patients that have Alzheimer’s disease,” he said. Analysts took a knife to their Biogen share price targets on Thursday morning. Paul Matteis, co-head of biotech research at investment bank Stifel, forecast the stock could trade in the $200 to $240 range, compared with its previous close of $320.59. Mr Matteis also noted Thursday’s press release made no mention of another Alzheimer’s treatment, BAN2401, the companies had in development, whose future is cloudy. “We think Biogen could potentially pull back on its plans here (and we think that’s what investors would want),” he wrote in a note to clients.

Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

The stock had appreciated by more than 28 per cent since the start of the month, when Biogen and Eisai hailed the trial as a success without giving full results.
11;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Biogen, Eisai Alzheimer’s drug slowed patients’ cognitive decline;;Eisai and Biogen released hotly anticipated results from a trial of their Alzheimer’s drug, which appeared to show the medicine can arrest the rate at which patients lose their brainpower.If replicated in larger trials and subsequently approved by regulators, the medicine, code-named BAN2401, would become the first ever that can slow down the devastating disease.According to the mid-stage study, patients taking the highest dose of their drug declined at a rate that was 30 per cent slower than those on a placebo during the 18-month trial, the companies said.However, the rate of decline was measured on a new and relatively untested scale devised by Eisai, the Japanese pharma company, which was designed to detect changes in the very earliest stages of the disease.On a more traditional scale that measures cognitive decline, known as ADAS-Cog, patients on the highest does declined 47 per cent more slowly than those on the placebo.The drug appeared to have less of an impact on the degree to which Alzheimer’s affected patients’ ability to function in daily life. On a measure known as CDR-SB, which measures things such as whether someone can still drive, patients taking the high dose declined 25 per cent more slowly than those on the placebo — but this result was not “statistically significant”, meaning researchers cannot be sure it was not a fluke.James Hendrix of the Alzheimer’s Association said: “I think this is an important and significant result, but one that will require follow-up in further trials.”The Phase II trial enrolled 850 patients, which is relatively large for a mid-stage study. But just 161 were given the highest dose — a relatively small sample from which to draw firm conclusions — while 247 were on the placebo. The remainder received other lower doses.The companies were due to discuss the results in detail later on Wednesday.
12;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2018-07-06T16:17:23Z;Biogen success offers hope for Alzheimer’s treatment;Shares in biotech group jump after promising results in Phase II trial;"Biogen offered a rare glimmer of hope in the increasingly fruitless field of Alzheimer’s treatment on Friday by saying it intended to take an experimental drug into the final stages of testing following promising results from a clinical trial.The decision sent shares in Biogen up 18 per cent at the open in New York, adding about $10bn to its market valuation, after the US biotech company and its partner, Japan’s Eisai, said the medicine had performed favourably in a mid-stage “Phase II” study. The positive results offered some validation of the “amyloid hypothesis” — the most common explanation for what causes Alzheimer’s — which posits that the build-up of sticky plaques in the brain causes memory loss and other impairments. The amyloid hypothesis has fallen in popularity in recent years after a string of high-profile failures from companies including Merck & Co, Eli Lilly, and AstraZeneca. Big Pharma has tested several drugs that target the beta amyloid plaques, but all of them have ended up flunking the final Phase III trials. “Our next step is to talk to regulatory authorities to determine the best path forward, but our goal is to deliver potentially the first therapy to alter the course of Alzheimer’s disease,” Alfred Sandrock, chief medical officer at Biogen, said in an interview. 15 yearsSince a new drug for Alzheimer’s was launchedAsked whether the companies planned to test the medicine in a final round of trials, known as Phase III, Dr Sandrock replied: “Depending on how those discussions go, this is the drug to do that; we’d like to move it forward as rapidly as possible.”It has been 15 years since a new drug for Alzheimer’s was launched, reflecting one of the longest and most expensive losing streaks for the industry. The medicines approved so far can only ameliorate symptoms rather than slowing the disease down. But the sector continues to plough billions of dollars into finding a medicine that can arrest the illness, tempted by the economics of a product that could help the roughly 44m sufferers worldwide.Biogen and Eisai said that patients taking the highest dose of their medicine, codenamed BAN-2401, lost their cognitive abilities more slowly than those taking a placebo, according to a final analysis conducted after 18 months. The drug also cleared the sticky plaque-like substance known as beta amyloid from patients’ brains, they said. “These are promising results but stay tuned since this is just Phase II,” said Eric Siemers, a neuroscience researcher who used to work at Eli Lilly. “But even trends for a drug targeting [amyloid] is of interest. The amyloid hypothesis wins a round.” Biogen is already testing an amyloid-clearing drug known as aducanumab in Phase III trials with results due in 2020. Some analysts interpreted the success of BAN-2401 as a positive omen for those studies. “This reads very good and investors’ odds going into aducanumab Phase III may likely go up,” said Umer Raffat, a pharma analyst at Evercore ISI. However, the companies did not report the full results from the trial, which will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting, and some analysts pointed out potential flaws. For example, it was not clear how many of the patients on the roughly 856-person trial had been given the high dose. And the study used an unusual, novel scale to measure how quickly people lost their brainpower rather than more conventional methods. “There is very little detail about other more validated cognitive measures in the joint press release and we find no reason to believe this either proves or disproves the amyloid hypothesis,” said Geoff Porges, a pharma analyst at Leerink.Others were perturbed by the fact that an earlier analysis of the trial — which was conducted after 12 months — did not show that the drug conferred a benefit. Dr Sandrock said that the earlier analysis had been done using experimental Bayesian statistical methods, which estimated the probability of success without the full test data. The final Phase II assessment was based on the full results, which included cognitive tests and brain scans. "
13;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Biogen, Eisai say Alzheimer’s drug succeeds in mid-stage trial;;Biogen and Eisai have notched a rare success in the notoriously difficult field of Alzheimer’s research, announcing that one of their experimental drugs had succeeded in a mid-stage clinical trial. In a Phase II study of the medicine, code-named BAN2401, the cognitive abilities of patients on a very high dose of the drug declined more slowly than those taking a placebo, Biogen said, without providing full results.The full results of the trial, which concluded after 18 months, will be released at a future medical meeting. The drug, which is being developed with Eisai, the Japanese pharmaceuticals group, is being tested in patients with the earliest stage of Alzheimer’s, known as mild cognitive impairment. The companies said that brain scans of patients showed that the drug had also managed to reduce the amount of beta amyloid in the brain. Some scientists say that the sticky plaque-like substance is to blame for Alzheimer’s, although that hypothesis has taken a hit in recent years as a slew of drug trials targeting beta amyloid failed. The companies did not give details on their plans for Phase III trials — the final stage of testing before a medicine is approved. Many Alzheimer’s drugs appeared to be promising during Phase II studies but went on to fail in Phase III. “The prospect of being able to offer meaningful disease-modifying therapies to individuals suffering from this terrible disease is both exciting and humbling,” said Dr Alfred Sandrock, executive vice-president and chief medical officer at Biogen.He added: “These BAN2401 18-month data offer important insights in the investigation of potential treatment options for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and underscores that neurodegenerative diseases may not be as intractable as they once seemed.”
14;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2018-02-28T13:29:06Z;Patent payout boosts Danish growth to strongest in 11 years;Large flows have recently also skewed GDP statistics for Ireland and Iceland;"Denmark has recorded its strongest economic growth in more than a decade in 2017. Sort of.

The Nordic kingdom was one of several EU countries to report solid growth figures on Wednesday, as the rebound in the eurozone lifted neighbouring countries through healthy growth in trade. But Denmark’s data received an extra boost thanks to a single payment from US biotech Biogen that was so big it skewed the picture for the entire economy.Gross domestic product increased 2.1 per cent for the year overall, the country’s best performance since 2006. Jan Størup Nielsen, chief analyst at Nordea, said the country is now “running at full capacity” for the first time in 10 years, and said the solid performance “will likely continue in 2018”.However, Statistics Denmark said the figure would have been 0.4 percentage points lower if it had excluded an overseas payment for the use of a Danish-owned patent in the first quarter.The payment was counted as a service export for the purpose of preliminary calculations, meaning it contributes to the GDP calculation, but the stats agency said “there is not yet enough information” to determine how the payment will eventually be classified, meaning the 2.1 per cent figure could be cut.Statistics Denmark did not provide any further details on which companies were involved with the payment. However, most of Denmark’s most valuable patents are held by pharmaceuticals companies and several economists pointed to a payment made to Danish group Forward Pharma last January.Nasdaq-listed Forward received a $1.25bn payment from US biotech Biogen as part of a dispute over patents for multiple sclerosis treatments. Forward chief executive Claus Bo Svendsen said the data showed “a nice time-wise correlation with our deal with Biogen”. He added that “we are still in a position to possibly receive further payments under the settlement and license agreement with Biogen, pending a favourable outcome of certain patent litigation. This would further contribute positively to the Danish GDP in future years”.Mr Størup Nielsen said the complication “emphasises the difficulties in using the GDP numbers to evaluate the underlying activity in a small open economy like the Danish where one-off effects can cause large volatility in the data”.The large fluctuations echo similar patterns in Ireland, another small open economy home to many multinational firms. Ireland’s statistics office has had to develop an alternative indicator to try to show underlying economic performance without being skewed by industries such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft leasing. Iceland, meanwhile, technically fell into a recession last year due to a surge in imports in official GDP data, despite the fact the country’s real economy was booming.Elsewhere on Wednesday, Sweden also reported a pick-up in fourth-quarter growth, with the year on year figure climbing from 2.9 per cent to 3.3 per cent. Growth was boosted by strong exports, but the overall figure was slightly below central bank forecasts, and ING economist Jonas Goltermann said there were signs the domestic economy “is slowing down”.Poland also confirmed 2017 was its strongest year of growth for six years, though the rate slowed in the fourth quarter."

The typical forecast was $5.46 and $3.08bn.The company said it expected to generate adjusted EPS of between $24.20 and $25.20 this year on revenues of between $12.7bn and $13bn.While the 2018 earnings forecast was in line with Wall Street expectations, the revenue prediction was more bullish than analysts had expected.Shares in the group added 3.6 per cent in premarket trading in New York.
16;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2018-01-04T05:15:27Z;Cost of Viagra soars as hundreds of drug prices rise in US;Pfizer among those risking backlash with new year increases on many medicines;Drugmakers have imposed price rises of several times the rate of inflation on more than a thousand products in the US, a New Year move that risks a political backlash at a time of intense scrutiny on healthcare costs.Pfizer, the largest standalone drugmaker in the US, raised the average wholesale price of 148 drugs by a mean average of 8.8 per cent, according to data seen by the Financial Times.The list included several of its best-known medicines such as Viagra, the erectile dysfunction treatment, and Lyrica for nerve pain.Other large drugmakers, including Allergan, GlaxoSmithKline, Gilead, Shire, Biogen, Teva, Baxter and Viiv also increased the US list prices of their medicines on January 1, according to the data.For the most part, drugmakers held the increases at less than 10 per cent, but they still tracked well ahead of inflation, currently 2.2 per cent in the US.Some pharmaceutical groups implemented much larger increases. Hikma, the London-listed drugmaker, raised the price of several strengths of morphine — which was first marketed in the 1800s — by between 75 and 90 per cent, taking a 25-pack of vials from $30 to $58.Rx Savings Solutions, which makes software to help people lower the cost of prescription medicines, said it had recorded price increases on more than 1,300 products on the first day of the year.“If GM raised the price of their trucks by four times the rate of inflation for multiple years, they wouldn’t sell any trucks,” said Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings. “The inelastic market of pharmaceuticals continues to be stretched to new levels.”The decision by pharmaceutical groups to raise the price of so many products is a gamble given the intense focus on drug costs in the US, the world’s largest and most profitable healthcare market.The issue has been at the forefront of public debate since the presidential campaign, when Hillary Clinton targeted Martin Shkreli, the disgraced biotech entrepreneur, for raising an Aids and cancer medicine by 5,000 per cent.President Donald Trump has also criticised the industry since winning election, accusing it of “getting away with murder” by charging high prices.David Mitchell, a campaigner from Patients For Affordable Drugs, said it made little sense to focus only on “outliers” such as Shkreli given that successive years of above-inflation increases on thousands of common drugs were a bigger contributor to higher costs.“The Shkrelis are emblematic of what’s going on across the whole system. When everyone applies these hikes across virtually every drug, it adds up to a hell of a lot more,” he said.For some of Pfizer’s medicines, the latest increase is the third in the space of a year and come after it hoisted 91 of its drugs in June.A 100mg capsule of Lyrica, for nerve pain, has gone from $7.59 at the start of last year to $9.81 following three successive increases, a jump of 29 per cent.A 100mg tablet of Viagra went from $57.94 to $80.82 over the same period — an increase of 39 per cent — although a generic version of the medicine has been available since December.A spokesperson for Pfizer said the company “takes a measured and responsible approach to pricing” and that the list price of the majority of its medicines “remains unchanged” following the latest round of increases.The company said it operated assistance programmes for patients struggling to afford their medicines. It declined to say whether it planned to implement further price increases in June, as it did last year.Drugmakers argue that list prices do not reflect the actual amount they end up collecting from health insurers, employers and the government, because they often have to offer large rebates to secure reimbursement.For example, Pfizer said at the end of the third quarter — before the most recent increase — the “weighted average net selling price” of all its drugs in the US was up 3 per cent over the previous year. However, that figure includes large discounts given to military veterans and low income individuals.Join the FT’s deputy editor Roula Khalaf for a panel discussion on the future of Alzheimer’s on January 18 in LondonList prices are still important because they are often used to calculate the amount that patients must personally pay “out of pocket”. Rising list prices coupled with less generous insurance plans have caused patient costs to climb considerably in recent years.Allergan said it had implemented an average list price increase of 7.3 per cent, which it said was “consistent with our single-digit commitment”, and that it would not increase prices on the affected medicines again this year. It said that following rebates and discounts it expected its net price increase to be between 2 and 3 per cent.Hikma attributed its morphine price increases to “marketing shortages” that had prompted it to “reallocate manufacturing capacity” and said it had not raised the price of the affected products in more than four years.

Revenue growth was driven by strength in multiple sclerosis revenues, which increased 5 per cent year on year.Analysts’ average revenue estimate for the second quarter had been $2.81bn.

18;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Biogen clocks biggest one-day drop since June on analyst downgrades;;Biogen shares led the declines on the S&P 500 on Thursday and are poised for their steepest one-day drop in nine months after analysts at Morgan Stanley and Leerink downgraded the stock.Shares in the US biotech group finished the day 4.7 per cent lower at $278.96 after analysts at Morgan Stanley lowered their rating on the stock to “equal-weight” from “overweight” and lowered their price target to $305 from $309. Meanwhile, analysts at Leerink cut the stock to “market perform” from “outperform” and lowered the price target to $300 from $305.That left Biogen with 19 “buy” ratings, 10 “hold” ratings and 1 “sell” rating, according to Bloomberg data.Leerink’s Geoffrey Porges soured on the stock citing a slower than expected ramp for Spinraza — a first-of-its-kind drug for spinal muscular atrophy, that received regulatory approval in December — and a lack of near-term catalysts to boost the stock. He also lowered Biogen’s revenue forecast for 2017 by 1 per cent and by between “2-3 per cent in later years”.Mr Porges, said:What was previously mostly opportunity for Biogen’s stock (trial results, new product launch, takeout potential) has now shifted to risk, with significant competitors approaching for Biogen’s critical (multiple sclerosis) franchise, slower than expected near term adoption of Spinraza, and at least two more years until results emerge from the company’s Alzheimer’s disease program.The likelihood of significant M&A interest in the company also seems diminished given new management appointments, completion of the spin out, some resistance to Spinraza’s launch and lower confidence in beta amyloid intervention for Alzheimer’s disease.Meanwhile, Matthew Harrison at Morgan Stanley said the move “is not a downside call, but a timing call”, following a recent advance in the company’s shares after it spun off its hemophilia business, Bioverativ, earlier this year.He added that Spinraza’s success could be offset by Roche’s competing multiple sclerosis product, Ocrevus, though he did concede that “market share losses to Ocrevus are buffered by a 13.5-24% royalty Biogen receives on US sales”.Biogen shares are up nearly 7 per cent so far this year after falling 7.4 per cent in 2016.
19;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2017-02-15T16:15:04Z;Merck’s drug failure deals further blow to Alzheimer’s theory;Latest medicine to flunk late-stage trial raises questions over ‘amyloid hypothesis’;Merck’s most senior scientist said it was “too early” to reject the main theory of what causes Alzheimer’s disease after the company’s drug became the latest medicine to flunk a late-stage clinical study.An independent committee of scientists monitoring the Phase III trial of more than 2,200 patients halted the study after concluding there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect,” dealing another blow to the amyloid hypothesis.Pharma companies have spent billions of dollars trying to develop drugs based on the amyloid hypothesis, which holds that a protein known as beta-amyloid builds up and forms sticky plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s sufferers.But their quest has resulted in a string of high-profile failures and there has been no new drug approved in more than a decade, prompting some scientists to question whether beta-amyloid is a symptom of the disease rather than the root cause.Merck’s drug, Verubecestat, is a so-called beta secretase inhibitor, which is designed to block an enzyme that makes a protein needed for amyloid production.Dr Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s research and development chief, said it was “too early to say” what the results meant for the theory underpinning Alzheimer’s, pointing out that the drug had been tested in mild to moderate patients who had suffered a great deal of damage to their brains.“I don’t think it tells us too much about the amyloid hypothesis,” he said. “What it does tell us is that a potent beta-secretase inhibitor that can reduce the enzyme dramatically does not provide benefit once there is significant cognitive impairment.”“It was the most difficult task and unfortunately we did not meet it,” he added.Merck is continuing to study its drug in patients with a very mild form of the disease known as prodromal Alzheimer’s and expects to publish results from a late-stage clinical trial in early 2019.The failure of the Verubecestat trial comes just months after Eli Lilly announced that one of its experimental medicines, Solanezumab, had flunked a late-stage trial of patients with mild Alzheimer’s.Last month Lilly said it had also halted a large prodromal study of Solanezumab, which targets the plaque itself rather than the beta-secretase enzyme.Some scientists say the failure of Merck’s trial shows that pharma companies are on the wrong track in pursuing amyloid and need to now investigate whether something else could be causing the illness, which affects more than 40m people worldwide.“All of these Alzheimer’s drugs fail for the same reason,” said Dr Amit Roy of Foveal, an independent research group. “We do not understand the science of what causes Alzheimer’s, and instead look at things associated with the disease in the hope that modifying them with drugs will modify the illness.”Dr Roy added: “Until drugmakers can do more than describing what changes happen in Alzheimer’s and prove that a certain mechanism actually causes the disease, these drugs will keep failing — the underlying science is too immature.”Several other companies are pressing ahead with drugs designed to reduce the build-up of amyloid plaques, most notably Biogen, the biotech group, which is trialling its medicine in late-stage trials.The next company to report late-stage trial data for an Alzheimer’s drug is Axovant, a small biotech company developing a medicine designed to deliver a short-term boost to the cognition of patients. The company expects to publish headline results from the study in the third quarter of this year.

The stock closed down 0.61 per cent at $287.77.“Modest effect size for sola, including limited plaque changes, support case that adu — with its more direct mechanism and far better symptom/plaque improvements in prior studies — has greater likelihood of getting over line in ph. III,” said analysts at Jefferies.The view was echoed by strategists at Mizuho, who said: “Overall, we believe today’s Eli Lilly results are positive for Biogen.”Biogen’s gains outpaced the wider biotech sector earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Biotech index was up 0.4 per cent, bouncing back from the sell-off sparked by president-elect Donald Trump’s comments this week about bringing down drug prices.Elsewhere, shares in upscale furniture retailer Restoration Hardware were hit after it took the axe to its full-year sales and earnings forecasts amid a 90 per cent collapse in third-quarter profits.The purveyor of $5,000 dining tables saw its shares tumble more than 18 per cent to $31.92 as the latest results suggest that the company’s plan to introduce a membership-based programme has failed to take off.Casino stocks, meanwhile, rebounded after the Monetary Authority of Macau said it had not reduced the daily limit on ATM withdrawals in the former Portuguese colony.Shares in gaming operators had been hit hard on Thursday after the South China Morning Post reported that Macau was limiting the amount of money that people could withdraw from China UnionPay, China’s sole clearing house for bank card transactions, to 5,000 patacas — half the previous limit. Macau, which is the only part of China where gambling is legal, has just emerged from a two-year downturn and the report had spooked investors about another hit to gaming revenues.However, on Friday the authority said it was limiting pet transaction withdrawals to 5,000 patacas (about $625) but that the daily withdrawal limit would stay at 10,000 patacas.That in turn sent shares in Wynn Resorts 1.28 per cent higher to $91.88, Las Vegas Sands climbed 1.23 per cent to $55.34, Melco Crown Entertainment rose 0.95 per cent to $17.03 while MGM Resorts rose 2.16 per cent to $29.27.In the wider market, the animal spirits unleashed by Mr Trump’s surprise victory continued to propel Wall Street to fresh record highs. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 all notched new all-time highs on Friday.The Dow, up 0.72 per cent at 19,756.85, is close to the 20,000 milestone.“Dow 20K is not only likely by the end of the year, it is also seeming to be increasingly probable,” said Bradford McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. “The only thing that could change the trend is a massive change in sentiment, and with the economic news continuing to surprise to the upside, that does not look likely.”

After her death, he reported that her brain contained a “peculiar severe disease process of the cerebral cortex”.Few grasped the importance of the neurological plaques and tangles described by Alois Alzheimer, who died long before his name became popularly attached to the disease he identified in 1906. Sadly, more than a century later, and with a major clinical trial of a dementia drug ending in failure, the neurodegenerative disease that he discovered seems no less mysterious.This is frightening for a world in which there are predicted to be 131.5m people living with dementia by 2050. Dementia refers to a group of neurological symptoms, such as memory loss and cognitive decline, which can have different underlying causes; Alzheimer’s is a leading cause, accounting for about three out of five dementia cases. The 2015 World Alzheimer Report, collated by organisations across the globe, estimates that dementia will be a trillion-dollar disease by 2018.That is why scientists have been hunting a cure for Alzheimer’s, or at least a therapy to delay its onset. There is an existing class of drugs, cholinesterase inhibitors, that can improve symptoms but they work only in some patients and, after periods of improvement, symptoms can worsen.Last year, rumours began swirling around an experimental compound called solanezumab. The drug was designed to target and dissolve amyloid plaques, which are sticky accumulations of misfolded protein often found post-mortem in the brains of Alzheimer’s sufferers, and thought to be toxic to neurons. An early trial of “sola” showed modest success with a subset of patients who had mild symptoms; Eli Lilly designed a new, larger trial with more than 2,000 patients.It is this larger trial that flopped. The patients on sola fared no better, in terms of cognitive decline, than patients on a placebo. Lilly has announced it will not seek regulatory approval for it as a treatment for mild Alzheimer’s.Lilly’s stock value fell and the ripples were felt elsewhere; market watchers upped the risk rating for Biogen, which is also testing a plaque-busting drug.If ever a post-mortem on Alzheimer’s research were needed, it is now. And, with hindsight, the failure of sola begins to look predictable. Firstly, the link between amyloid plaques and Alzheimer’s is one of correlation rather than causation. Because the two are seen together, an assumption has arisen that the plaques cause the disease — something that has never been definitively proved. This is why Peter Roberts, emeritus professor of pharmacology at Bristol University, said he wasn’t at all surprised at sola’s failure. In fact, he pronounced his scepticism well before the larger trial began.Secondly, Lilly built up its hopes — and ramped up its trials — on the basis of slender promises. In early tests, the drug was only marginally effective in delaying cognitive decline, and only in a limited subset of patients. Its hopes of spinning pharmaceutical gold from such initially thin pickings now look expensively misplaced. A promising pipeline, which narrowed with successive trials, gave rise to tunnel vision.Scientists must now reconsider their basic understanding of Alzheimer’s. As well as the plaques, affected brains also contain tangles of another protein, called tau. The plaques have long been given star billing; perhaps the spotlight will now turn on untangling tau. Or is there another factor lurking unseen behind both the plaques and tangles, with these tangible hallmarks simply throwing everyone off the scent?The fact remains, though, that Alzheimer’s is an old disease about which we have few new ideas. The overwhelming majority of trials for Alzheimer’s drugs conducted over the past decade have ended in failure. A new class of drugs known as BACE inhibitors might offer hope; rather than breaking down plaques, they prevent their accumulation. Lilly and Astra Zeneca are partnering on one example codenamed AZD3293. Another Lilly inhibitor, though, has already been abandoned because of liver toxicity.It may seem a luxury to live long enough to worry about dementia but, as those in low and middle income countries are living longer, that dubious privilege will spread. A disease that raised barely a murmur when it was first reported 110 years ago by Dr Alzheimer is on the brink of becoming an unstoppable global epidemic.The writer is a science commentator"
22;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2016-08-31T17:08:39Z;Biogen predicts preventive drug for Alzheimer’s disease;People with signs of ‘amyloid plaques’ on the brain could be treated before they develop symptoms;A senior scientist at Biogen, the large US biotech group, has predicted that potential Alzheimer’s victims will be treated long before they develop symptoms, much as millions of people without heart problems are prescribed cholesterol-lowering statins.Dr Al Sandrock said that outwardly healthy individuals could be treated with drugs designed to clear the brain of the “amyloid plaques” thought to cause the disease, which can start building up more than two decades before people experience memory loss or a decline in their thinking and reasoning skills.“One day you can imagine treating patients with no symptoms if they have amyloid plaques on the brain,” Dr Sandrock said. “We do that with cholesterol where people don’t have cardiovascular disease.”Dr Sandrock made the comments on a call with journalists to discuss the publication of a study of aducanumab, an experimental Alzheimer’s medicine being developed by Biogen, which is being tested in large, late-stage clinical trials.The article, published in Nature, the respected scientific journal, reported the findings from a smaller study of the drug in 166 patients, which showed that the medicine was able to clear significant amounts of amyloid plaque from the brain, especially at higher doses.The journal reproduced brain scan images that showed patients who were given the highest dose of the medicine, 10 milligrams for every kilogramme of body weight, were virtually free of the sticky plaques after a year of treatment.“The effect size of this drug on amyloid removal is unprecedented,” said Dr Roger Nitsche, president and founder of Neurimmune, a Swiss biotech group that discovered the medicine by cloning the memory cells of people aged 90 and over who had “super cognitive function”.Neurimmune entered a commercial partnership with Biogen to develop the drug in 2007.The trial was not designed to assess whether aducanumab could slow down a patient’s rate of cognitive decline, although there were signs that those on the highest dose of the drug stabilised after six months of treatment.Those findings needed to be confirmed by the larger trials, said Neurimmune and Biogen.However, the study also found that patients on the highest dose of the drug were much more likely to experience side-effects, especially a condition known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or Aria, which can result in dangerous swelling on the brain.Almost half of patients on the 10mg dose experienced Aria and almost a third had to discontinue treatment following an “adverse event”.Biogen has since started enrolling patients in two large “Phase III” studies and Dr Sandrock said that the company was hoping to find a dosage that was both highly effective and safe. “We are looking for the sweet spot, where the benefit to risk profile is optimal,” he said.He also suggested that the company might be able to predict which patients were more likely to experience Aria by testing them for a particular genetic trait, known as APOE type 4.Dr Sandrock said that it would be a “few more years” before the company published data from its larger trials, in part because it had embarked on the laborious process of putting all participants through a PET brain scan to ensure that they have amyloid plaques on the brain.Some scientists believe that the reason such a large number of Alzheimer’s trials have failed is in part because patients with other types of dementia are being incorrectly diagnosed and enrolled into studies.Eli Lilly, the US drugmaker, is due to publish data later this year from a large study of its drug, Solanezumab, which is also designed to slow down Alzheimer’s by clearing the brain of amyloid plaques.If the study is successful and leads to regulatory approval, Solanezumab would become the first ever “disease modifying” drug that can halt the progression of the disease. All existing medicines are palliative treatments that try to address the symptoms but do little to tackle the underlying illness itself.

The life expectancy in Type 1 SMA is less than two years without respiratory support.SMA occurs after the deletion or defect of the SMN1 gene causes the body not to produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Nusinersen, a so-called antisense drug, works by changing the way a separate but “nearly identical” gene is interpreted within cells, with the aim of prompting them to produce more SMN protein, Biogen said.There is presently no approved treatment for SMA, according to Biogen.Following the trial, Biogen said it exercised an option to develop and commercialise the drug globally, and paid Ionis a $75m licence fee. It would initiate filings with global regulators seeking approval for the drug “in coming months”, it added.Biogen shares jumped 4.1 per cent on Monday to $301.83, helping the group essentially shed its year-to-date loss. Ionis, a far smaller biotech, surged 30.2 per cent to $38.01.Elsewhere, energy stocks were in the red as the price of crude oil skidded.West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, was down 2.2 per cent to $40.68 a barrel. International standard Brent was down by roughly the same margin to $42.63 a barrel. Both markers fell into a bear market last week.The S&P 500 energy sector was the worst performer on the benchmark index, sliding 3.3 per cent. Among the decliners was Murphy Oil, an exploration and production group, which dropped 6.6 per cent to $25.63, and oil major ExxonMobil, which fell 3.5 per cent to $85.86.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,170.84, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1 per cent to 18,404.51 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 per cent to 5,184.20.
24;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Amgen on the hunt for potential deal of up to $10bn;Companies with drugs already in clinical testing are being evaluated;Amgen, one of the four largest US biotech groups, is on the hunt for potential acquisitions, according to people familiar with the situation, as it prepares to end its self-imposed exile from the boom in pharmaceuticals mergers and acquisitions.More than $850bn of healthcare deals have been announced since the start of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters, but Amgen has so far stayed on the sidelines, eschewing large or medium-sized transactions.Instead, it has focused its efforts on buying or licensing a handful of unproven drugs that are in early-stage testing and typically command much smaller price tags.However, a person familiar with the company’s thinking said it had recently “opened the aperture” and was now evaluating companies worth up to $10bn, with drugs that have been proven in clinical testing and are almost ready to bring to market.Companies that have recently completed similar acquisitions include Celgene, another biotech group, which paid $7.2bn for cancer specialist Receptos, and Alexion, which spent $8.4 on Synageva, a rare diseases specialist.Amgen, which ended last week with an equity value of $121bn, has also been seen as a potential target and has been linked to Allergan, the drugmaker that is in talks about combining with Pfizer.One investor who recently held meetings with Amgen’s management team said the company had contacted shareholders in the past few weeks to get “everybody prepared” for an acquisition.Amgen declined to comment.Amgen’s last major acquisition was Onyx, which it bought in 2013 for roughly $10bn, primarily to secure the rights to its cancer drug Kyprolis.$121bnAmgen’s market value on FridayInvestors initially turned sour on the Onyx deal amid lacklustre sales of the medicine, but many shareholders revised their opinion this year, after the US drugs watchdog approved Kyprolis for use in a cocktail of medicines to treat patients with cancer of the plasma cells.The decision by the Food and Drug Administration paves the way for a big jump in sales, according to analysts.“They’re taking a lot of comfort from the Onyx acquisition,” the investor said.Amgen would probably finance an acquisition by raising debt, according to the person familiar with the company’s thinking.Although the company’s balance sheet has $30bn of debt it also has roughly the same amount in cash, with the vast majority trapped offshore. Repatriating cash to the US to fund a deal would incur a hefty tax bill.Amgen, founded in 1980, is one of the four cornerstone groups of the US biotech sector, along with Celgene, Gilead and Biogen, and is credited with developing some of the first successful “biologic” drugs.It is now facing competition to some of its top-selling products from a new generation of “biosimilar” copycat medicines. Earlier this year, the FDA approved the first ever biosimilar version of Neupogen, an Amgen medicine that had sales of $1.16bn last year.Last year, Dan Loeb, the activist investor, acquired a stake in Amgen through his Third Point vehicle and pushed for cost-cutting and a potential break-up of the company. Subsequently, the group said it would make roughly $1.5bn of cuts.However, Amgen has fiercely resisted any attempt to split in two, and Mr Loeb has, for now, dropped the idea.
25;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Biogen shares rise on job cuts;US pharma group to shed 11% of workforce and pledges $250m of savings a year in restructure;Shares in Biogen, the US pharmaceuticals group, rose 4 per cent on Wednesday after it said it would cut 11 per cent of its workforce amid slowing sales of its blockbuster drug for multiple sclerosis.The Massachusetts-based biotech group said it would axe about 800 jobs and halt development on some of the drugs in its pipeline in an attempt to save about $250m a year.“The decision to reduce the company’s workforce was extremely difficult, but we believe these actions are necessary to fulfil our mission of bringing important new medicines to patients,” said George Scangos, chief executive.Mr Scangos said the savings from the job losses would be reinvested in “several high-quality programmes” that are in late-stage clinical trials, or about to enter them.In July, Biogen warned that sales of Tecfidera, its top-selling medicine, would be lower than expected because fewer patients were switching to the drug. Sales have been rising at 6-8 per cent each quarter compared with its previous forecast of growth of between 14 and 16 per cent.Tecfidera generated revenues of $937m in the third quarter compared with $883m in the previous three months, an increase of about 6 per cent.Biogen announced the job cuts as it unveiled third-quarter numbers that beat expectations, with earnings of $4.48 per share on revenues of $2.8bn, compared with the typical analyst forecast for EPS of $3.77 on sales of $2.6bn.“Biogen reported relatively good news given very low expectations,” said Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital, although he noted that higher sales were largely due to an increase in the amount of Tysabri [another MS drug] being stocked by pharmacies rather than a jump in patient prescriptions.Shares in the company, which had fallen about 19 per cent this year, added as much as 8.9 per cent in morning trade in New York.The company has suffered in recent months amid fears that a string of failures in its pipeline of risky drugs and slower sales of Tecfidera will stunt growth. Its shares have been the worst-performing among the big four biotechs— a grouping that also includes Gilead, Amgen and Celgene.Research is part of ‘global fightback’ against diseases such as Alzheimer’sRead moreBiogen said it had terminated a large, late-stage study of Tecfidera in patients suffering from a type of MS known as “secondary progressive” because the drug did not work, and that it would also halt the development of a drug for a type of kidney inflammation.It is, however, pushing ahead with the most risky drug in its pipeline — a new medicine for Alzheimer’s known as Aducanumab — which showed some promise in early trials despite fears over patient safety. On Wednesday it said it had started enrolling patients in a large Phase 3 clinical trial.Alzheimer’s drugs have a high chance of failing in Phase 3 trials and no new treatment has been approved for more than a decade, although any medicine that does get the green light from regulators would be guaranteed blockbuster sales.
26;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2015-10-06T11:00:13Z;Axovant seeks first new approval for an Alzheimer’s drug in a decade;Group aims to win green light for first treatment for the disease since 2003;A company that completed the largest ever biotech listing earlier this year has started testing its Alzheimer’s medicine in a large, late-stage clinical trial, as it seeks to win the first drug approval in more than a decade for the debilitating form of dementia.Axovant on Tuesday said researchers had begun a so-called Phase III trial of the drug, codenamed RVT-101, which will be tested on 1,150 patients with a mild to moderate form of the disease in combination with Aricept, another Alzheimer’s medicine.The company expects the first set of results to be published in 2017 and, if successful, the drug could be approved the following year by the US Food and Drug Administration, making it the first medicine to be given approval for Alzheimer’s since 2003.A drug for Alzheimer’s would probably attain blockbuster status because of the 44m patients who desperately need more effective treatment options, with some analysts predicting peak annual sales well in excess of $1bn for such a medicine.Several other companies, including Eli Lilly and Biogen, are also racing to develop treatments for the disease, although the risk of failure is high given the large proportion of Alzheimer’s drugs that do not make it through large late-stage trials.Axovant raised $315m and briefly secured a market valuation of almost $3bn when it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in June. However, shares in the company, which was founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, a 29-year-old former hedge fund manager, have since tumbled almost 60 per cent amid fears of a bubble in biotech stocks.The flotation generated controversy because Axovant acquired the rights to its prospective Alzheimer’s drug for an upfront payment of just $5m to GlaxoSmithKline, which shelved the compound five years ago after it failed four clinical trials involving more than 1,800 patients.Some investors and doctors have interpreted Glaxo’s decision to drop the drug as a sign that it has lost confidence in the compound, although supporters of the medicine say it fell victim to cost-cutting. In addition to the $5m upfront fee, GSK will be paid a royalty worth 12.5 per cent of sales if the drug is approved.The fourth and final trial conducted by GSK, which was published in 2010, did show some benefit to patients: those taking the drug alongside Aricept experienced an improvement in cognition for about 12 weeks before the disease continued to progress, a small improvement but one that would probably lead to approval if replicated in a larger study.Prosthetic gives hope to Alzheimer’s sufferers and wounded soldiers who cannot remember recent pastRead moreHowever, the medicine failed to hit another so-called endpoint, which measured its impact on a patient’s “function” — their ability to conduct simple tasks such as bathing, clothing and feeding themselves. Axovant thinks GSK picked the wrong scale for assessing function and is using a different measurement for its Phase III trial.The FDA has granted the company a so-called special protocol assessment or SPA — an agreement that if the clinical trial is conducted as designed and proves to be successful then the results would be sufficient to pave the way for approval.Mr Ramaswamy said on Monday that the company was planning use the proceeds from its June IPO to acquire other drugs to help build Axovant into a “dementia solutions company”.“We raised significantly more capital that planned to pursue other clinical-stage assets,” he said. “Our goal is to continue to build the pipeline to fight all aspects of disease for all forms of dementia.”Mr Ramaswamy believes there are other drugs such as the GSK compound that have been shelved by their owners despite showing promise in clinical trials.In an interview with the FT this month, Mr Ramaswamy said: “This is about resuscitating, reviving and advancing drugs that are already proven but that have not got over the finish line — and there’s no better space for that than dementia.”
27;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2015-09-22T08:29:42Z;How US biotech valuations got stretched;Hillary Clinton comments on ‘price-gouging’ hit the sector — but it was already vulnerable;After a stunning rise, US biotechnology shares have had the air taken out of them.After suffering its second biggest decline of the year on Monday, the Nasdaq biotech index slid a further 1.7 per cent on Tuesday, after Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, promised to take on “outrageous” price-gouging in the industry.The comment, sparked after a report highlighted how privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals had raised the price of a 62-year-old drug by more than 5,000 per cent, unnerved investors who had sent the combined market valuation of companies within the Nasdaq biotech index to more than $1tn for the first time earlier this year.Of the 144 companies on the Nasdaq biotech index, shares of 137 groups have fallen over the past two days, including drops of more than 15 per cent by Bluebird Bio, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Horizon Pharma, ImmunoGen and Retrophin.The index’s valuation has sunk more than $150bn from its peak as investors shift out of US stocks and the Federal Reserve readies to raise interest rates. That has added acute pressure to the Russell 2000 biotech index — home to younger, less-established small-cap biotech groups — whose valuations are dependent on future cash flows and a continued wave of merger and acquisition activity.Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s chief investment strategist, said valuations had become “aggressive, particularly in the small-cap space” after a sustained six-year rally.“Whenever you have aggressive valuations, any sniff that [the sector] may not be able to deliver — and today we had concerns about pricing power — you’ll have an outsize reaction,” he said.Valuations have been a concern for investors in US equities this year, who have broadly preferred European and Japanese stocks as central banks there continue to ease.The Nasdaq biotech index trades at 41.86 times forward earnings, down from a peak of 55.76 earlier this year but a substantial premium to other parts of the US stock market, according to FactSet. In contrast, S&P 500 healthcare companies — including blue-chips such as Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Pfizer and UnitedHealth — trade at 16.75 times expected earnings over the next 12 months.“While healthcare in general is reasonably priced, biotech valuations are stretched,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said. “It’s hard to put a p/e on a dream.”Those valuations have been supported by an expanding drug pipeline and a surge in deals. Some 747 mergers and acquisitions have been announced in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries worth nearly $300bn since the year began, up 46 per cent from the same point in 2014, according to data from Dealogic.Analysts with Citi warned that political rhetoric would intensify, which they argued could “impact the assessment of potential acquisition targets” by blue-chip pharmaceutical groups seeking growth through M&A.Against a backdrop of slow economic expansion, boards of US companies have often decided to buy faster growing companies instead of investing in research and development. The prospect of strong earnings and sales growth, often linked to successful medical trials, has appealed to investors after two consecutive quarters of sales declines by the S&P 500.Earnings for healthcare companies within the S&P 500 are forecast to rise 13 per cent from a year earlier in 2015, faster than any other sector, according to S&P Capital IQ.The potential for blockbuster new drugs has also enticed investors. Analysts with Barclays note that roughly a dozen biotechs have key catalysts before year end, including data from trials undertaken by Gilead, Biogen Idec, Neurocrine Biosciences and Alexion Pharmaceuticals.Gilead has epitomised how a novel medical treatment can catapult a company’s share price and valuation. Sales at the company, known for its $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pills, have more than tripled over the past four years, while its market valuation has soared from $29bn to $155bn.Despite the recent declines, the Nasdaq biotech index remains 10.4 per cent above where it started the year, outpacing the 0.4 per cent advance by the overall Nasdaq Composite. Shares of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Sarepta Therapeutics, Exelixis and Prothena Corp have all climbed more than 100 per cent.Biotechs have also seen strong demand for new issuance. Some 94 companies have come to market, raising a total of $8.5bn year-to-date, Dealogic data shows. The figure is tracking ahead of the record $11.6bn raised in 2010, when 77 companies floated. Of the 39 debuts in the US, share prices have advanced 24 per cent on average.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

Sales rose 30 per cent to $285.6m.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast a loss of 10 cents a share, on sales of $283m. Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported a profit of 5 cents a share, ahead of forecasts for 2 cents.Pandora said mobile revenue had risen 37 per cent to $229.7mA user interface and algorithm update this year had improved song recommendation, said Stephen Ju, an analyst at Credit Suisse. This had led to “less song skipping and therefore generated fewer unmonetised listening hours”, he said.The number of active listeners rose 4 per cent year on year to 79.4m, and total listener hours increased 5 per cent to 5.3bn.Pandora issued a full-year sales forecast in the range of $1.18bn to $1.19bn, ahead of estimates for $1.17bn.Shares of Pandora, which have fallen 39 per cent in the past year, rose 15 per cent to $15.96 on Friday.Starbucks rose 1.3 per cent to $57.29 after adjusted second-quarter earnings topped Wall Street estimates.Profits for the quarter rose to $626.7m, or 41 cents a share, from $512.6, or 34 cents, a year ago. Revenues jumped to $4.9bn from $4.32bn. Adjusting for one-time items, profits of 42 cents a share topped estimates for earnings of 41 cents.Howard Schultz, longstanding chief executive, has been pushing the chain beyond selling coffee and trying to make it easier for people to order drinks from their homes or offices on their mobile phones.Slowing sales of Tecfidera, a multiple sclerosis drug, prompted Biogen to lower its full-year forecasts, sending the shares 22.1 per cent lower to $300.03.The company, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said Tecfidera sales had risen 26 per cent from a year ago to $883m in the second quarter, shy of estimates of $909m.“Tecfidera, which is now the most prescribed oral MS therapy globally, is experiencing moderated patient growth following rapid initial uptake,” said George Scangos, chief executive.Tecfidera was Biogen’s second largest-selling drug last year and the company expects full-year earnings in the range of $15.50 to $15.95 a share, lower than its previous forecast for $16.60 to $17.Revenue growth is projected in the range of 6 to 8 per cent, lower than its previous forecast for 14 to 16 per cent.With the news came better than expected second-quarter profits and sales that were just shy of analyst estimates.The disappointing outlook from Biogen weighed on the Nasdaq Biotech index, which was 4 per cent lower.The S&P 500 declined 1.1 per cent to 2,079.65, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.9 per cent to 17,568.53, and the Nasdaq Composite sold off 1.1 per cent to 5,088.63.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

That is what US biotech Celgene will pay for Receptos, which will have a drug on the market in three years or so — if clinical trials go perfectly.Receptos’ Ozanimod is a pill for multiple sclerosis and other diseases. MS pills from Novartis and Biogen Idec have combined sales that will pass $6bn this year, and Ozanimod appears (at this early date) to have fewer side-effects than either. If sales hit $5bn a year, the present value of the drug’s profits (before patent expiry in 2029) will comfortably surpass $7.2bn — at a discount rate of, say, 10 per cent.But Celgene’s value rose by (another) $10bn on news of the deal. It appears the market is using a lower discount rate. It may be right. Treasury yields are very low. Inflation, it seems, is never coming back. So future growth is worth almost as much as cash today. On this view, Celgene underpaid, and another bidder for Receptos, more in step with the new paradigm, may well come along.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
30;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Biosimilar drugs: spot the difference;The market’s view on the impact of biosimilars is sanguine, but this may be wrong;"Big pharma groups crushed by patent expirations in the first decade of this century spent the second rushing into biotech. Biotech medicines — proteins grown from live cells — had effectively infinite patents. There was no regulatory route to market for copies of drugs with expired patents. In the US, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 set up a path. And finally, last month, the US authorities approved a biosimilar of Amgen’s Neupogen, a drug with more than $1bn in annual sales.There are still hard questions for regulators, health insurers and doctors. The drugs are complex; the original and the biosimilar are not identical. It is not perfectly clear if the differences matter. So should biosimilars of the same drug from different manufacturers have different names? Should pharmacies fill prescriptions for the original with its biosimilar? If a biosimilar is approved for one condition treated by the original, does the approval cover the other conditions, too?Given these ambiguities — and the fact that biosimilars are tricky and expensive to become approved and to produce — the market has been sanguine about the impact of biosimilar competition on originators’ profits. Shares in groups reliant on biomedicines with patents near expiry (AbbVie and Roche, say) appear unperturbed.This relaxed view may be mistaken. Big companies with lots of biotech experience — Amgen, Pfizer, Biogen Idec — are committing piles of capital to biosimilars. In Europe (where these have been taking hold, slowly, since 2007) a biosimilar for Merck’s blockbuster Remicade is starting to hit sales hard. Biosimilars will grow gradually, but the issue is less about market share than how a cheap alternative affects the original’s price.There is much work ahead. And originator companies will fight hard. But if the biosimilars work perfectly well (so far, they seem to) the economic pressure on all health systems will probably carry the day, in time. Liberum, a rare research house that takes biosimilars seriously, thinks these will keep Roche’s margins flat for the next five years. Consensus calls for a big margin expansion.

Including currency changes, however, reported orders climbed 2 per cent.For the three months to the end of February Nike reported profits of $791m, or 89 cents per share, compared with $682m, or 75 cents a share. Sales climbed 7 per cent to $7.5bn.Analysts on Wall Street expected the athletic apparel and footwear maker to report earnings of 84 cents a share, on sales of $7.6bn.Sales in the US — which accounted for 47 per cent of revenues last year — rose 6 per cent from a year earlier to $3.3bn. Future sales orders for the region advanced 15 per cent, ahead of expectations for an 11.5 per cent rise.Dollar strength hurt the results, however, as Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Oregon, said the value of its sales in Europe would have increased 21 per cent, rather than the 10 per cent it reported, had it not been for the dollar’s rise against the euro.“We are encouraged to see Nike deliver more than 14 per cent earnings before interest and tax growth in its core Nike brand business in the face of significant currency headwinds, choppy consumer trends in key markets (Brazil, China, Japan, eastern Europe) and the sustained period of strength in North America, where the brand is most mature,” said Lindsay Drucker Mann, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.Shares of Nike, which have climbed 29 per cent in the past year, gained 3.7 per cent to $101.98.Biogen was the best performer on the benchmark S&P 500, after a study showed that its Alzheimer’s drug, Aducanumab, slowed a patient’s cognitive decline with a statistically significant reduction in the build-up of amyloid plaque, believed to play a key role in the development of symptoms.Shares in Biogen, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, climbed nearly 10 per cent to $475.98.Tiffany shares fell 4 per cent to $82.93, after the luxury retailer said it expected a 30 per cent decline in first-quarter net earnings and “a more modest decline in the second quarter”.The warning accompanied fourth-quarter profits that topped forecasts. Tiffany reported earnings of $196.2m, or $1.51 a share, on sales of $1.29bn. Wall Street had estimated earnings of $1.50 a share on sales of $1.3bn.“Longer term, we believe Tiffany’s growth prospects are favourable given its dominant position in the global luxury category and global diversification,” said Randall J Konik, an analyst at Jefferies. “However, there will probably be some volatility in fundamental performance in the near term due to global economic uncertainty and a strong US dollar.”US stocks rallied as the dollar weakened and the Nasdaq Composite approached a record closing high.The S&P 500 gained 0.9 per cent to 2,108.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9 per cent to 18,127.65, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7 per cent to 5,026.42.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
32;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2015-03-20T16:33:50Z;Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug shows early promise;US biotech group’s shares rise 7% after experimental treatment slows rate of cognitive decline;An experimental Alzheimer’s drug being developed by a US biotech group has offered hope that scientists may be closer to a breakthrough for the devastating disease, after early trials showed the treatment slowed the rate of cognitive decline.Biogen’s Aducanumab is one of several drugs under development by big pharmaceutical groups that aim to reduce so-called “amyloid plaque”, a sticky build up in the brain that many believe is responsible for Alzheimer’s.A year-long study of 166 patients with a mild form of the disease showed that Biogen’s drug significantly reduced the build-up of plaque and delayed the onset of cognitive decline, according to data published on Friday at a medical conference in Nice, France.Shares in Biogen, which have risen about 28 per cent so far this year in anticipation of the data, jumped by 7 per cent in New York trading, while other companies with similar drugs also gained, including Eli Lilly, up 2.4 per cent, and Sanofi, which added 1.6 per cent. Biogen’s market value has risen by $45bn to nearly $110bn in a little over a year.However, analysts and physicians voiced concerns over the drug’s safety, with a quarter of patients on the highest dose discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects, including swelling on the brain.Drug companies have trialled similar drugs for years with disappointing results, but the industry has pressed ahead because the commercial opportunity is huge: there are more than 25m Alzheimer’s sufferers globally and 5m in the US, the vast majority of whom do not respond to existing treatments.Biogen and its partner Neurimmune developed the drug by cloning the memory cells of people in their 90s who had “super cognitive function” despite their age, as well as people who had Alzheimer’s that was progressing at an unusually slow rate.“The surprising part was to have a cognitive impact in such a small trial. It makes it kind of unique,” Al Sandrock, Biogen’s chief medical officer, said in an interview.“Most people are very positive about the data. It is a long time since we’ve seen positive results of this type in a trial for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Thomas Wisniewski, neurology professor at New York University’s School of Medicine, who was at the conference in Nice. “Some investigators in the audience were quite ecstatic.”Vamil Divan, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said the results had “hit the ball out of the park”, while Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said “the magnitude of the efficacy improvements was really striking”.Industry members have put successive failures in this area down to poorly-designed clinical trials. They think some of the patients might have been suffering from dementia rather than Alzheimer’s, or that the disease was too far progressed for the drugs to have an impact.For its trial, Biogen only accepted patients with either “prodromal” or “mild” Alzheimer’s — the very earliest stages of the disease. “There is a whole field of thinking that the plaque builds up 15-20 years before first symptoms, so it is important not to wait too late,” said Dr Sandrock.Biogen also pre-scanned patients to make sure they had amyloid plaque on their brains, and rejected a lot of candidates who had been diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer’s, but may have been suffering from other forms of dementia.The aim of this study was to test if the drug was safe for use. The drug wasn’t devoid of side effects, most notably swelling in the brain, but it appears this can be managed with lower dosesInvestigators tested patients’ cognitive impairment after a year on the drug using a 30 point questionnaire known as the mini-mental state examination. Scores for the placebo group worsened by an average of 3.14 points, compared with 0.58 points for patients on the highest 10mg dose of the drug.Patients were also assessed using another test, known as the clinical dementia rating. Scores for those on the highest dose of the drug worsened by 0.59 points over the year, compared with 2.04 points for those on the placebo. Biogen also showed a less marked improvement at lower doses, while data for patients on a 6mg dose is still to come.However, there were big concerns about safety, especially for those patients on the highest doses, 41 per cent of which developed brain abnormalities that showed up on MRI scans. Investigators decided to stop treating a quarter of patients on the 10mg dose for this reason.Dr Sandrock said the adverse effects were “monitorable”, although some analysts and physicians felt the company was playing down the risks. “The investigators were dismissing this as not significant and manageable, but clinicians would not view it that way,” said Dr Wisniewski.Much will depend on the pending results for patients on the 6mg dose, which Biogen hopes will find an acceptable balance between safety and efficacy. The company will now design a late-stage clinical trial and begin enrolling patients this year.James Pickett, head of research at the UK Alzheimer’s Society, noted that some drugs that had shown early promise failed in late-stage trials.“This was a small, early-stage trial and a larger trial is needed to confirm whether this drug will help people with the disease. The aim of this study was to test if the drug was safe for use. The drug wasn’t devoid of side effects, most notably swelling in the brain, but it appears this can be managed with lower doses.”
33;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2015-03-17T00:16:28Z;Dementia research boosted by $100m venture capital fund;Venture capital fund backed by UK ministers and drug companies;Research into dementia is to be boosted by a $100m venture capital fund backed by the UK government and several of the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals companies.Plans for the fund, the first of its kind, will be announced on Tuesday by Jeremy Hunt, the UK’s health secretary, at an international meeting in Geneva aimed at strengthening global efforts to tackle one of the world’s most pressing health challenges.US investment bank JPMorgan will help set up the fund, with GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Biogen Idec among the companies committing money alongside the UK government.The fund will invest in early-stage research into Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia in an attempt to unlock the secrets of a condition that has defied efforts to find an effective treatment.Mr Hunt’s announcement will highlight the leadership role adopted by the UK since David Cameron, prime minister, made tackling dementia a priority of the country’s presidency of the Group of Eight advanced nations in 2013.This week’s meeting of health ministers in Geneva is intended in part to ensure that the UK-led push is continued through the World Health Organisation, regardless of the outcome of May’s UK general election.Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer of US-based J&J, praised the “tremendous role” played by the UK in promoting dementia research and acknowledged that there was “some concern” in the global health community about what would happen if there was a change of government. But he said “a very strong international network” was being developed to ensure that progress was sustained.Tuesday’s announcement of the new venture fund comes a month after Mr Cameron revealed plans for an international dementia institute to be established in England as part of £300m of government investment to research the memory-wasting disease.About 35m people worldwide suffer from dementia and the number is forecast to triple by 2050 as the population ages.Just three new drugs for the condition have reached market in the past 15 years and these only alleviate symptoms rather than slow the disease’s progress.Patrick Vallance, president of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, said the venture fund was a good way to spread risk and share expertise after the loss of billions of dollars by drug companies in many failed trials.He added that dementia was different to some other public health challenges, such as the need for new antibiotics to overcome antimicrobial resistance, where there was a lack of economic incentive for research.“Nobody doubts that if you find an effective medicine for dementia it will be very profitable,” Mr Vallance said. “The difficulty is finding out how to do that. This is not so much a market failure as a scientific challenge.”Details of the fund were still being thrashed out on Monday but people familiar with the plans said the UK government would invest about £15m ($22m) in the fund, while GSK, Britain’s biggest drugmaker, would inject $25m.An expert panel will identify promising projects to back and the participating companies will provide advice as well as financing via the fund. Alzheimer’s Research UK, the charity, would also be involved.Any returns will initially be reinvested but the fund could produce a profit for investors in the long term if any of its research proves successful.
34;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Big pharmaceuticals groups faces biosimilars challenge;Drugs pipeline improves but report finds biological treatments are beginning to face competition;Global pharmaceuticals companies have seen an improvement in their drugs pipelines but the industry is facing a fresh challenge as the first generation of blockbuster biological drugs begins to face competition.Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly have the strongest late-stage pipelines relative to existing revenues, while AstraZeneca has shown the greatest improvement over the past two years, says a report by credit rating agency Moody’s.However, those same three companies also face the greatest exposure to patent expiries over the next three years, highlighting the perennial battle faced by drugmakers to develop new medicines as old ones lose market exclusivity.Eli Lilly is one of five companies, together with Novo Nordisk, Amgen, Pfizer and Merck & Co to have seen an increase in patent exposure since Moody’s previous study in 2013.Michael Levesque, the report’s author, said this reflected rising competition from biosimilars— drugs that aim to mimic biological medicines at a lower price.Pharmaceuticals companies have been gradually shifting from chemical-based pills to more complex biological therapies derived from living cells. Whereas traditional drugs typically face low-cost generic competition as soon as their patents expire, so-called biologics are much harder to replicate.This has allowed biological products such as Roche’s breast cancer treatment Herceptin to maintain market dominance even after their patents have begun to expire.Mr Levesque said biosimilars were still a long way from threatening the almost overnight collapse in price and market share faced by non-biological drugs when they go off-patent. But he noted they were gradually gaining acceptance from regulators. In December, an expert panel of the US Food and Drug Administration paved the way for the first US biosimilar when it recommended approval for a copy of Amgen’s Neupogen cancer medicine by Novartis of Switzerland.“Companies with strong emphasis on biotech such as Roche and Biogen Idec still have the greatest protection from patent exposure but competition from biosimilars will gradually increase,” he added.Overall, Moody’s study showed a strengthening in outlook for the pharmaceuticals industry in the last two years ago as drug-development pipelines have improved.The FDA last year approved 41 new medicines— the most for 18 years and its second-highest tally on record. One of these was Opdivo, a hotly-anticipated cancer drug whose $4bn of forecast annual peak sales helped secure Bristol-Myers Squibb top spot in Moody’s ranking of pipeline strength.Amgen and Merck & Co were among others of the 16 companies analysed to show pipeline improvement compared with 2013.Mr Levesque said the industry was showing steady rather than dramatic progress, forecasting that operating profits would grow, on average, in the low-single digits over the next three years.In addition to patent exposure, increased pricing pressure was another brake on growth, he said, highlighting the recent push by US insurers to force discounts from Gilead Sciences and AbbVie on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs.
35;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Wall Street had forecast $3.421 a share.Biogen’s biggest-selling drug — oral multiple sclerosis treatment Tecfidera — had a strong quarter with $743m in sales in the US, well above analyst estimates of $697m and providing relief to investors who had increasingly feared that sales for Tecfidera had slowed. Tecfidera is now the most prescribed oral MS treatment in the US, chief executive George Scangos said on a call with analysts.Biogen revenues rose 34 per cent in the quarter to $2.64bn and the company predicts adjusted earnings of $16.60 to $17 a share, compared to analyst estimates for $16.37 a share.Biogen shares have risen 22 per cent over the past year and Nomura upgraded its target price for the company to $401 from $378 in the wake of the results. However analysts have warned that to maintain momentum the company may need a new blockbuster drug.The report “supported our view that meaningful upside in (Biogen) shares is dependent on early stage or lower probability assets,” wrote Nomura analysts in a research note, referring to BIIB037, an Alzheimer’s drug that Biogen is pushing through phase 3 clinical trials. Enthusiasm for the drug is “increasingly priced into shares”, the bank said.Apple shares hit a record high of $120, surpassing the previous intraday high of $119.40 touched last November, before slipping back down to $117.16 at market close. The gains came just days after the iPhone maker stunned Wall Street with its blowout earnings. Fourth quarter net profit grew 37 per cent to $18bn — making it the biggest quarterly profits reported by any public company in history.Shake Shack hit the public markets on Friday morning, opening at $47 on its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, more than double the initial public offering price of $21 a share. The high-end burger chain raised $105m in its IPO, giving it a valuation of $745.5m. Shares in Shake Shack finished the day at $45.90.Barbie-maker Mattel reported more bad news on Friday. The struggling toymaker, whose chief executive abruptly resigned this week, reported sales dropped 12 per cent during the critical holiday quarter. Revenues fell 6 per cent to $2bn, below analyst forecasts for $2.12bn, as Mattel struggles to compete with iPads and other electronic gadgets in the toy industry.Shares in Mattel dropped 5 per cent in early trading in New York, but recovered to finish the day little changed.Amazon climbed more than 13 per cent after the Seattle ecommerce group returned to profit in the fourth quarter, helped by a 53 per cent jump in Prime subscribers, its unlimited two-day shipping and streaming media service.US equity benchmarks slipped on Friday after soft GDP data prompted risk aversion.The S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,994.99, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.5 per cent to 17,164.95, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.0 per cent to 4,635.24.
37;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;US investors double down on biotech bets;Advances in innovation help sector add to 2014 gains, bucking wider January sell-off;Investors in US equities confronted with a volatile market so far this month are returning to one of their favoured trades of recent years: betting on biotech.Having risen 100 per cent over the preceding two years, biotechs have maintained their ability to outperform the broad S&P 500. Already this month the Nasdaq biotech index has risen 5.7 per cent, rebounding from a sell-off during December and adding more than $40bn to its market cap, compared with the broader S&P 500 which is little changed.The leadership by biotechs reflects how companies in the sector sit at the cutting edge of potential medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs, promising huge rewards for investors. In a low-growth environment biotechs are seen by investors as one of the few sectors that can deliver compelling opportunities.After four years of double-digit gains for the sector and five years when it has finished ahead of the benchmark S&P 500, Wall Street believes the biotech boom can continue.“We have witnessed significant innovation in the biotech industry over the early part of this decade, highlighted by cures in hepatitis C and transformative advances in prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis and numerous orphan diseases,” said Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst with Barclays.“Rather than signalling a period of innovation lag, we believe we are still in the early-to-middle innings of a wave of innovation.”The bank also expects brisk earnings growth and projects a 19 per cent rise in large-cap biotech earnings this year, compared with an 8 per cent advance by the S&P 500 and an 11 per cent rise by healthcare, given drug launches and a slate of trials.But risks remain high, particularly for smaller companies awaiting data from trials and for looming drug launches. Goldman Sachs noted that expectations for some upcoming debuts varied greatly, which could present a hurdle for stocks. Forecasts for Vertex’s much-anticipated cystic fibrosis treatment range between a low of $1.3bn and a high of $2.8bn in 2016, which could represent three-quarters of the company’s overall sales.Rather than signalling a period of innovation lag, we believe we are still in the early-to-middle innings of a wave of innovationThe potential for lower payouts from pharmacy benefit managers and a rotation into other sectors of the market could also dent the biotech bull run.“Any sector that has had a three year-plus run like biotech, the risk grows as correlations between stocks grow,” says Matthew Harrison, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “A speed bump for one of the major biotechs appears to have significant sector implications.”Market valuations of three stalwarts of the industry — Biogen Idec, Gilead and Regeneron — have more than doubled over the past two years. New treatments, including Gilead’s blockbuster Sovaldi and Harvoni hepatitis C medications, have proved a fillip. Wall Street expects the latter to generate sales of $39.6bn between 2015 and 2017.The soaring valuations of the largest biotech companies are not particularly troublesome, according to analysts with Barclays and Morgan Stanley, who point to metrics such as price/earnings and equity value-to-sales ratios. The Nasdaq biotech index trades with a p/e of 42.7 times expected 2015 results, below the 72.6 level recorded in 2012 but far above that of the S&P 500, data from Bloomberg show.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
38;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2015-01-12T15:14:01Z;Fresh round of M&A sweeps pharma sector;Roche, J&J and Biogen in series of tie-ups a day after Shire deal to buy NPS;Another round of mergers and acquisitions is sweeping the pharmaceuticals sector, in a sign that last year’s boom in healthcare dealmaking is continuing in 2015.Roche, Johnson & Johnson and Biogen Idec were among drugmakers to announce tie-ups on Monday, a day after Shire agreed to buy NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2bn.Bankers and executives said further M&A was likely across the sector as larger drugmakers hunt for promising assets to bolster growth.Shire’s $5.2bn acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals was the latest example of a larger drugmaker making a big gamble on a smaller biotech company whose prospects are heavily dependent on regulatory approval for an experimental productRoche said it would buy a controlling stake in Foundation Medicine, a US molecular and genomic analysis company, in a $1.18bn deal aimed at strengthening the Swiss group’s development of personalised cancer therapies.Johnson & Johnson of the US agreed a licence deal with AC Immune of Switzerland worth up to $509m, under which the pair will collaborate on potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.Biogen Idec of the US announced the acquisition of privately held Convergence Pharmaceuticals, a UK-based chronic pain specialist spun out of GlaxoSmithKline in 2010, for an initial $200m and a further $475m subject to the success of its experimental medicines.Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals also joined the fray by agreeing to merge with OnCore Biopharma of the US in an all-paper deal to combine forces in developing treatments for hepatitis B. The implied market value of the merged company is about $750m.The surge of deals came as executives, investors and bankers gathered in San Francisco for this week’s JPMorgan healthcare conference — the industry’s biggest annual get-together and traditionally a big catalyst for M&A activity.Shire was first out of the blocks on Sunday with its acquisition of NPS, a US rare disease specialist, in a deal that highlighted the UK-listed group’s emergence among the fastest-growing and most acquisitive companies in the sector.People close to the matter said Dublin-based Shire had been working on further potential deals in recent weeks after its M&A war chest was boosted by a $1.6bn break fee from AbbVie after the collapse of its proposed merger with the US group.Roche’s deal with Foundation marked the latest in a string of bolt-on acquisitions by the Swiss group which investors have been pressing to deploy its huge cash flows more aggressively.Last month, Roche snapped up the privately owned Austrian biotech group, Dutalys for $489m, and earlier last year splashed out $8.3bn on the US biotech company, InterMune.Roche will pay $1.03m for a 56.3 per cent stake in Foundation and will invest at least $150m to accelerate the development of its products, which analyse molecular information from tumours to help determine the best treatment.J&J’s deal with privately held AC Immune involves so-called anti-tau vaccines which are considered to be among the most promising potential treatments for Alzheimer’s. The agreement involves research and development collaboration between the pair and an exclusive licence for J&J to market any resulting product.
39;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Caterpillar falls on downgrade due to oil and gas exposure;Exposure to oil price accounts for about 12% of company’s revenues;Caterpillar was among the worst-performing stocks on the US benchmark on Monday, after JPMorgan analysts downgraded the mining and construction equipment maker for its exposure to oil and gas.Analysts at JPMorgan cut Caterpillar to “underweight” from “neutral” and lowered their price target to $80 from $95.At a time when the price of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has fallen more than 50 per cent since mid-June last year, Ann Duignan, an analyst at JPMorgan, said Caterpillar’s direct exposure to oil and gas through services and products used in exploration and production accounts for about $6.5bn, or 12 per cent, of its total revenues.The company also has indirect exposure to mining, US construction and emerging markets where growth is expected to be pressured by lower oil prices. North American construction accounts for about 17 per cent of Caterpillar’s revenues, and of that Ms Duignan estimates 5 per cent “may be leverage to oil and gas states”. Canadian Oil Sands, which is also expected to experience a slowdown in demand, represents about 3 per cent of total revenue.“Overall, Caterpillar’s combined indirect exposure may be as much as 15 per cent of its revenues — implying that upwards of 30 per cent of its total revenue may come under increasing pressure in 2015-16,” said Ms Duignan. The stronger dollar is another factor that could hurt Caterpillar’s competitiveness.Shares of Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $87.03 and are down nearly 21 per cent in the past six months.Shares of Isis Pharmaceuticals gained nearly 11 per cent to $69.19, after the company announced a collaboration with Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, to develop drugs to treat autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Isis will get $35m in upfront payments and an additional $800m in licence fees. Isis will also receive tiered royalties.Shares of drugmaker Biogen Idec declined 1 per cent to $337.77 after analysts at Nomura downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy” and lowered their price target to $378 from $407. M Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura, lowered his sales estimates of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, following slower US sales growth based on data from IMS, which tracks drug prescriptions and sales.Mr Somaiya lowered his US multiple sclerosis drug sales estimates for Biogen by 3 per cent in 2015 to $6.3bn and by 4 per cent to $9.8bn in 2020.The S&P 500 was dragged lower by the energy sector, which fell 4 per cent, as the price of Brent crude fell more than 6 per cent to $52.90. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, fell to fresh five-and-a-half year lows, below the $50 a barrel mark.

40;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Biogen climbs after ‘promising’ trial;US stocks shake off decline after global rally;Biogen Idec led the US benchmark index after the biotechnology company said its experimental drug to treat Alzheimer’s showed promise in an early-stage trial and that it would now be moved to phase 3 trials.Speaking at Deutsche Bank Biofest, Biogen said its BIIB037 drug showed a reduction in the beta-amyloid protein in early-stage patients and that, by 54 weeks, patients exhibited statistically significant cognitive improvements.A build-up of beta amyloid in the brain is associated with Alzheimer’s.The cognitive improvements were not “altogether surprising”, said Brian Abrahams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo.Milder patients who had received Eli Lilly’s Solanezumab had shown a slowed rate of cognitive decline.While there was still some way to go before it would be clear whether Biogen’s drug had “meaningful benefits”, Mr Abrahams said the results were “consistent with our view that, given low expectations, Biogen’s Alzheimer’s programme offered the most potential for an upside pipeline surprise, and we see this as a significant first step towards adding a new, large market opportunity”.This “warranted today’s share appreciation”, Mr Abrahams added.Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “This is promising and certainly another example of the big upside events Biogen has in its pipeline, of which there are many mid-late stage programmes.”Its pipeline includes treatments for multiple sclerosis and a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy in children, for which it has partnered with ISIS Pharmaceuticals.Biogen shares climbed 6.43 per cent to $328.27, taking its year-to-date gain to nearly 19 per cent.Shares in Royal Caribbean Cruises gained 6.17 per cent to $76.75 after S&P Dow Jones Indices said the cruise operator would be added to the S&P 500 at the end of trading on Thursday.Royal Caribbean, which operates 41 ships and has contracts for an additional eight, will replace Bemis Company, the maker of packaging products.Its shares also gained after Barclays boosted its price target on the stock from $75 to $94.Trading in RadioShack shares was halted after the struggling electronics retailer said it had received notice from a lender of covenant breaches on its $250m loan provided by Salus Capital Partners and Cerberus Business Finance, units of Harbinger Group and Cerberus Capital Management, respectively.RadioShack, which plans to “vigorously contest the claims”, said the breaches related to the recapitalisation and amendment to the company’s asset-based lending credit facility it made in October.Avanir Pharmaceuticals said it had agreed with Japanese drugmaker Otsuka Pharmaceutical to be acquired for $17 per share in cash, valuing Avanir at $3.5bn.The news pushed Avanir up 12.80 per cent to $16.92.US stocks shook off Monday’s decline following a broader rally in Europe and Asia.The S&P 500 gained 0.64 per cent to 2,066.55, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.58 per cent to 17,879.55 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.60 per cent to 4,755.81.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

Adjusted earnings of 72 cents a share also beat expectations.Activist investor Daniel Loeb, who manages the US hedge fund Third Point, has been critical of the company since he announced a stake in January. Mr Loeb has previously said the company should consider breaking itself up.“Today’s numbers shouldn’t provide much, if any, of a distraction to investors, with bulls able to rally around continuing margin expansion in almost all businesses and hope (of what’s to be said shortly),” Duffy Fischer, an analyst at Barclays, said.Shares of Dow Chemical closed 1 per cent lower at $47.61. Shares are up 7 per cent this year.Biogen shares lagged behind the S&P 500, falling 5 per cent to $309.07, after sales of its multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, came in just short of estimates, raising concerns that the drug is on a modest trajectory of growth.The biotech company reported net income of $856.9m, or $3.62 a share, ahead of expectations. Revenue climbed 37 per cent to $2.5bn, in line with expectations.Sales of Tecfidera reached $638m in the US in line with estimates, while international sales of $149m were short of estimates for $156m.On its conference call, Biogen said one patient that took the oral medication developed a brain infection, which also weighed on the stock.“On a quarterly basis, the product had been beating estimates, and there were expectations that it would overachieve, not come in line or modestly below,” Eric Schmidt, an analyst at Cowen, said. “It’s far too early to say that Tecfidera has had its day in the sun.”DBV Technologies, a French biotechnology company, fell less than 1 per cent in its debut on the Nasdaq to $22.90.Shares of DBV listed in Paris have climbed more than 40 per cent since the company disclosed a phase II trial of a treatment for peanut allergies met its primary end point in September. At the time, DBV said it would seek to begin a late-stage phase III trial in 12-18 months.Yahoo climbed 5 per cent to $42 after the company eclipsed third-quarter revenue and profit expectations.Sales rose 1 per cent to $1.15bn as investments in mobile began to pay proceeds, eclipsing Wall Street estimates. When excluding costs to acquire traffic, Yahoo said sales climbed 1 per cent to $1.09bn. The figures follow six consecutive quarters of declines.US stocks declined modestly, after the S&P 500 had its biggest rally of the year on Tuesday.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,927.11.

42;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2014-07-31T17:33:27Z;Stocks: the value is out there;The trick is in seeing where the overvaluation lies;The problem, we are assured, is localised. Yes, reliable measures of valuation for stocks – as a group – are elevated. The cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio is a fluorescent 60 per cent above its 130-year average. Q, which compares stock prices to the replacement value of company assets, has been higher only in 1929 and 1999. Profits as a proportion of US output – a measure that the competitive logic of capitalism implies must be mean reverting – is at postwar highs on an after-tax basis.But Janet Yellen, Fed chairwoman, called out shares only in social media and biotech as stretched. And strategists echo the message: pick your sectors and your stocks carefully and you can protect capital.What look like value stocks are still out there. Kellogg’s earnings report on Thursday was middling, but it generates solid returns, has a non-terrifying forward earnings multiple of 15, and yields 3 per cent. But overvaluation is emphatically not restricted to a small number of sectors. Of the constituents of the S&P 500, 69 have seen their share prices double in the past two years. Some of Ms Yellen’s targets are on the list: Celgene, Netflix, Facebook, Biogen Idec. But is Goodyear Tire an emblem of the new economy?Another example: McKesson, a famously well-managed company in the old-fashioned drug distribution industry. Its shares have gone from $90 to $190 over two years. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio has gone from 12 to 18 over the same period (its trailing ratio is at an all-time high). Analysts expect EPS growth averaging 18 per cent a year for the next four years. Can McKesson do it? Sure. Does its valuation leave room for error? None whatsoever.There are plenty of other examples just like this one. This locality is getting awfully big.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
43;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;AbbVie puts investor patience in European drugmakers to the test;;Will the last mid-sized European drugmaker please turn off the lights? AbbVie’s £27bn takeover approach for UK-listed Shire has highlighted the scarcity of companies bridging the gap between big pharma and small biotech in Europe.Whereas the US has nurtured a cadre of biotech powerhouses such as Amgen, Biogen Idec and Gilead Sciences that are shaking up the traditional pharmaceuticals industry, Europe has few such examples.Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chief executive, is due in London this week to seek backing from Shire shareholders for a takeover. If he eventually prevails, it would add to a history of European drugmakers being sold before they reach full maturity.“In Europe, investors have not always had the patience to give biopharma companies the time they need to grow,” says Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, pictured, urging investors to back the board’s rejection of AbbVie’s offer.Shire is an unlikely poster child for European life science. While it was founded in the UK, today its management and research are largely US-based and much of its revenues come from treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among American teenagers.Yet it remains European in one important respect: its London listing puts it among the top quartile of the UK’s FTSE 100 index, bigger by market capitalisation than household names such as Tesco, Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems.Since Dr Ornskov took charge last year, Shire has produced the highest shareholder return of any FTSE 100 company. Its takeover would mark the loss of one of the world’s fastest-growing drugmakers from the European investment landscape.Having shifted its tax domicile to Ireland and reduced its UK workforce below 500, Shire cannot count on political support of the kind that helped AstraZeneca, the much bigger British drugmaker, fight off an unwanted £69bn approach from Pfizer last month.The company is almost the definition of the “mid-Atlantic floating entity with no allegiance to anybody except the lowest tax rate” that Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, once warned was eroding public trust in business.Dr Ornskov bridles at such criticism, arguing that all drug companies are global and owe their allegiance to patients and shareholders. But, with nearly half of Shire’s shareholder base in the UK, he says the company has a firm anchor in London.AbbVie’s approach, therefore, provides a test of whether European investors are willing to forgo a hefty premium – of 58 per cent over Shire’s share price in mid April before takeover speculation intensified – in the hope of bigger long-term rewards. Dr Ornskov has predicted a doubling in revenues to $10bn by 2020 as it moves aggressively into high-margin treatments for rare diseases.“Shire together with Actelion have the potential to do something similar to what we have seen from Gilead and Biogen in the US,” says Dr Ornskov, referring to the Swiss biotech company often touted as a takeover target. “If these high-growth European companies keep getting taken out, they are going to get pretty scarce.”The pharmaceuticals sector has been convulsed by deal-making this year as cash-rich drugmakers hunt for growth. For US predators, European companies carry the added appeal of big tax savings by providing a vehicle through which to shelter offshore cash from high US rates.Europe has no shortage of big pharmaceutical groups, with Roche and Novartis of Switzerland, Sanofi of France and GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca of the UK all powerful global players. It also has a strong research base with three of the world’s top five medical science universities – Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London – in the UK, according to Times Higher Education.But while there are several thriving biotech clusters across Europe, relatively few companies reach the scale of Shire or Actelion. Promising UK companies such as Celltech, PowderJect and Cambridge Antibody Technology, have been gobbled up by bigger rivals just as they were hitting their stride.“The US has been much better at developing mid-sized companies,” says Sir John Bell, professor of medicine at Oxford University. “We’ve had 35 years of biotech [in the UK] but very few companies have broken through.”Europe was at the forefront of biotech when Biogen was founded in Geneva in 1978. However, the company soon moved to Boston and listed on Nasdaq, drawn by the greater depth of capital and risk appetite in the US, as well as the bigger drugs market. European biotech has struggled to keep pace ever since.Several promising European companies are emerging, such as Genmab in Denmark, Morphosys in Germany and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, with more following behind. Almost $500m has been raised by biotech companies from five initial public offerings in Europe so far this year, exceeding the $305m raised from six IPOs in the whole of last year, according to Mergermarket.However, the tally pales in comparison with Nasdaq, where 32 biotech IPOs have taken place so far this year, raising $1.98bn.Whereas the US has many specialist healthcare funds attuned to the rhythms of drug development, European companies are more dependent on generalist investors.David Solomon, chief executive of Zealand Pharma, a Danish biotech company, points to Novo Nordisk as proof of what can be achieved with long-term support. The Danish diabetes specialist has grown into a near-$100bn company backed by the foundation that controls it.“You need large funds that see the long-term value and build a durable partnership with the company,” says Mr Solomon. “That has been the challenge in Europe.”
44;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Bristol-Myers Squibb: side effects;Group’s valuation rests on select band of experimental drugs;One of these things is not like the others, as Big Bird sings. Look at the mega-cap pharma and biotech stocks. In the near term, most are expected to grow slowly and have middling valuations to prove it. Biogen Idec, Novo Nordisk and Gilead trade at sportier multiples of earnings than the others, because of the higher growth targets analysts are pencilling in. Then there is Bristol-Myers Squibb. From 2013 to 2016, Wall Street sees flattish sales and earnings creeping up at 3 per cent a year. But its gonzo valuation – 29 times this year’s earnings – is the highest in the group.There are reasons for this. Bristol has earned the market’s respect with big, profitable divestments – in wound care, nutritionals, medical imaging and, most recently, diabetes drugs – that have left it focused on a few disease areas where superior drugs can earn fat returns. Were it not for one big drug – the antipsychotic Abilify, which is past patent expiry – growth would look better. And the company has long focused on shareholder returns, paying a meaty dividend.But by far the most important factor is very high hopes for growth in the long term – 2017 and beyond. These hopes turn on Bristol’s portfolio of immunotherapies: drugs that allow the body’s own defences to attack cancer. It has commercialised one drug, Yervoy, for skin cancer, and has another, Nivolumab, in the works for treatment-resistant lung cancer.It is rare to find a company as big as Bristol – it has a $90bn market cap – whose investment case depends so heavily on a single set of experimental projects. Consider: if the immunotherapies disappoint, and the earnings multiple falls to a still industry-leading 20 times, the stock stands to lose a third of its value. The company will release some important clinical results on the immunotherapies in mid-May. Investors who know the stakes will be holding their breath. Muppets who hold the shares thinking they own just another big pharma could be in for a big surprise if the studies do not read out as expected.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
45;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2014-03-27T18:06:13Z;Baxter: own devices;Simplification is good but the units face the same challenges;Once you’ve played the trump card, what do you do with the rest of your hand? That’s a question Baxter International’s management and shareholders must now consider. The healthcare company, with a market cap of $40bn, played its trump card on Wednesday, when it announced it would separate its biopharma and medical product businesses. Shares rallied 5 per cent on the news, a nice surge, after a year in which the stock had been essentially flat. But both companies face the same challenges they did before the corporate structure was simplified.Baxter’s biopharma business, with $6bn in sales, is best known for its haemophilia treatment, Advate. Haemophilia treatment is a $10bn market growing at 4 per cent to 5 per cent a year, driven by emerging markets such as Brazil and China. Advate’s franchise is threatened, however, by “long-acting” agents, from competitors Biogen Idec and Novo Nordisk, which can be taken less frequently. Cowen & Co. estimates that long-acting agents will take 35 per cent of the haemophilia A market by 2016. Baxter’s biopharma business is expected to grow just 3-4 per cent in 2014. This is what has weighed on shares of late.Baxter’s medical products business has about $10bn in revenue and specialises in dialysis, intravenous equipment and infusion pumps. This unit has lower margins than the biopharma business. However, Baxter closed in September on its $4bn acquisition of Swedish renal business Gambro and that should render savings.Deutsche Bank estimates that Baxter’s price to earnings multiple of 13 sits about 15 per cent cheaper than its peers. By that benchmark, a modest 5 per cent pop in shares shows that investors remain concerned about Baxter’s businesses, however they may be organised. Corporate structures matter and investors prefer simplicity. But operations matter the most.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
46;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:07:36+0000;Investors brace for end of the biotech run;;When the long bull run in biotech stocks came to a shuddering halt last week, Wall Street looked south to Capitol Hill for an explanation.Henry Waxman, the veteran Democratic congressman, was blamed for spoiling the party after he and two colleagues wrote to Gilead Sciences questioning the $84,000-per-patient price of its new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi.This sparked concern over whether politicians might imperil the sky-high returns forecast for a wave of new medicines emerging from the sector.With little prospect of bipartisan support for intervention, the letter seemed a flimsy pretext for a market rout. But analysts say the Nasdaq biotech index was ripe for correction after rising two-thirds in the past year and more than threefold since a six-year low in 2009.The focus now is on whether the pullback – the index was down 12 per cent from a month ago on Tuesday – represents a renewed buying opportunity or the start of a sustained reversal in what has been among the top performing sectors of US equity markets for the past two years.“Some investors are rotating out of biopharma into financial, technology, industrial and consumer sectors,” says Ying Huang, analyst at Barclays. “Investors are wondering if we have seen the peak of biotech for the foreseeable future.”Biotech bears point to the sector’s stretched valuations, with stocks trading at an average 400 times reported earnings and almost 94 times estimated forward earnings, as evidence of a bubble.The sector has always had a feel of the casino. While big pharma’s research and development risks are insulated by strong cash flow from existing products, biotech companies often involve bets on the success of a single experimental drug.But, even by the industry’s high-rolling standards, some of the valuation rises of the past year have been exceptional.Take Intercept Pharmaceuticals, a Manhattan-based company with 50 employees which reported revenues of $1.6m and net losses of $67.8m in 2013.There are high hopes for the company because it is developing what would be the first approved drug for a form of liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which affects up to 5 per cent of Americans and is rising in incidence because of a connection with obesity.Since listing at $15-a-share in 2012, the stock is now more than 20 times higher at around $346, valuing the company at $6.75bn. On one day in January its shares climbed nearly fourfold on the back of positive clinical trial data.Yet, the stock has fallen more than 25 per cent in the past week – outstripping the wider market decline – after Intercept revealed that patients taking part in a trial had experienced an unusually high number of heart-related problems.The company is still confident of the treatment’s prospects but the setback brought a reminder that apparent wonder drugs are often derailed before reaching market.Biotech bulls say such risks are more than outweighed by the potential rewards, pointing to the success of Gilead, whose new Sovaldi drug could top $5bn of sales this year – by far the most successful launch in industry history.Others such as Biogen Idec have also produced huge returns for early investors as breakthrough drugs have catapulted them into the realm of big pharma.Optimists say this time really is different to previous booms and busts because of advances in genetic science that enable companies to develop more targeted treatments for niche patient groups. This allows them to be tested in smaller trials, which accelerates development.They also point to cuts in R&D investment by big pharma that has left the industry increasingly reliant on innovation from smaller biotech companies, either through lucrative licensing deals or takeovers.Among the 10 biggest biotech companies, average annual sales and earnings growth is more than three times that of the S&P 500 average. “You could argue for much higher price to earnings than we are currently seeing,” says Mark Schoenebaum, biotech analyst at ISI.The sector’s strength has been fed by a flood of generalist investors chasing growth stocks. This has supported more than 60 US biotech IPOs in the past year with more scrambling to reach market before the window closes.Vadim Zlotnikov, strategist at AllianceBernstein, says the recent sell-off is part of a broader downward re-rating of growth stocks as improving economic prospects and a rising interest rate environment reduces the appeal of long-term gambles.“It feels gut-wrenching,” says one large investor. “But I don’t think it is time to get out because the fundamentals haven’t changed.” The next few weeks will reveal whether others have equally steely nerves.
47;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Elan opens formal sale process;;Elan, the Irish pharmaceutical business facing a $6.7bn hostile bid from Royalty Pharma, said on Friday it was putting itself up for sale, in a move swiftly dismissed by the US private equity group as a fresh tactic to deflect the takeover.In the latest twist in a bitterly fought battle for control, the Dublin-based company said in a short statement on Friday that it was “proceeding with a formal sale process in light of the expressions of interest received to date”.The action seemed to suggest Elan’s management was giving up on its plans to remain independent as a healthcare company, following the sale of Tysabri, its multiple sclerosis drug, to its partner Biogen Idec earlier this year.But Pablo Legorreta, head of Royalty, dismissed the planned sale, saying his company had not been approached. “The only thing that is certain for Elan shareholders is Royalty Pharma’s offer,” he said.Even if successful, a sale of Elan would be unlikely to be completed for two to three months. The company’s move follows a previous statement from Elan that it was considering offers from other potential buyers – a move which was viewed by some observers as a stalling effort by the company to derail Royalty’s bid.Unless Royalty wins a legal challenge set to be heard next Wednesday, its offer is set to lapse, after indications that it had failed to persuade Elan investors to vote against all of the company’s four proposed “poison pill” deals.One adviser to Elan said the company had already received “a handful” of offers from pharmaceutical companies, and it expected to proceed with a sale valued in excess of $13.50 a share, above Royalty’s offer and equivalent to a long-term valuation closer to the company’s own estimate of its worth at $15.50 to $20.80 a share.Royalty launched a last-minute effort this week to persuade the shareholders to vote against the Irish company’s resolutions to authorise fresh acquisitions and a share buy-back. It has proposed a $13 a share cash offer, with up to $2.50 in the form of a contingent value right.Possible purchasers for Elan have included Biogen Idec itself, based in Boston, which holds 80 per cent of the future revenues from Tysabri, but in the restructuring earlier this year agreed to pay about 20 per cent of the value of the product in royalties to Elan.Elan said Royalty would be welcome to take part in the bidding process “if they so wish”, while maintaining its message to shareholders that they should not tender to the US business’s offer in the meantime.Elan’s financial advisers are Citigroup, Davy Corporate Finance, Morgan Stanley and Ondra Partners.
48;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2013-04-03T17:44:54Z;Irish regulator sets Elan bid deadline;;The Irish takeover regulator has stepped into the battle for control of Dublin-based pharmaceutical group Elan by setting a deadline for Royalty Pharma to table a firm bid for the company.In a statement on Wednesday, the Irish Takeover Panel said that, after representations from the various advisers, it had decided to give Royalty Pharma until May 10 to either make a firm bid for Elan or announce that it will not proceed.The move by the regulator follows revelations earlier this year that Royalty Pharma, a US private equity group that buys the rights to patented drugs, had offered $11 a share to buy Elan, valuing the company’s equity at $6.6bn.The $11-a-share offer was an effort by Royalty to gain access to future income from Tysabri, the multiple sclerosis drug jointly developed by Elan. Elan sold the drug to its US partner Biogen Idec for $3.25bn in cash but retained a slice of future royalties.Elan had rebuffed the approach, calling it “highly opportunistic” and “heavily conditional”.Royalty Pharma said that it was “disappointed that the board of Elan continues to refuse to work with Royalty Pharma to facilitate an offer being presented to Elan shareholders and has instead sought to impose a deadline for Royalty Pharma to make such an offer without the benefit of due diligence”.Pablo Legorreta, chief executive of Royalty, has previously raised the prospect of increasing the $11 bid price as long as he can conduct due diligence on Elan’s assets.Royal Pharma added that the company’s refusal to engage “risks depriving Elan shareholders of the opportunity to decide on the merits of the possible offer”.Mr Legorreta stepped up his assault on Elan last month by questioning the experience of the Irish pharmaceutical group’s management and launching an appeal direct to investors.Elan said it welcomed the decision by the Panel to impose the deadline and that the proposal by Royalty Pharma “remains an indication of interest, is highly conditional and may or may not lead to an offer being made”. It added the offer was “opportunistic in its timing.”Elan, which has been dismissive of the bid without formally rejecting it, has promised to make acquisitions in areas such as cardiology and to pay a cash dividend directly linked to royalties. It has also launched a share buyback.The New York-listed group said that it would consider any credible proposal by Royalty Pharma or another party.Elan’s shares fell to a low of €8.67 on the ruling by the Takeover Panel, having closed on Tuesday at €9.05. However, the shares recovered some of those losses on Wednesday to close around €8.92
49;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Royalty Pharma steps up battle for Elan;;Royalty Pharma stepped up its $6.6bn battle for Elan by questioning the experience of the Irish pharmaceutical group’s management and launching an appeal direct to investors.Pablo Legorreta, chief executive of Royalty, a privately held business that mainly acquires royalties in patented drugs, stuck to his $11 a share bid while raising the prospect of an increase if he could conduct due diligence on Elan’s assets.Elan, which has been dismissive of the bid without formally rejecting it, has instead promised imminent acquisitions, such as in cardiology, as well as a share buyback and a cash dividend directly linked to royalties.But Mr Legorreta said of Elan’s management: “They have done a really good job in streamlining and selling assets, but they just don’t have any experience in acquiring or integrating businesses.”He said he was starting presentations to Elan investors on the US West Coast on Wednesday to press the case for its sale to Royalty, before continuing with a roadshow on the East Coast and then in Europe next week. The presentations are designed to target 10-15 shareholders owning the majority of the business.In a statement, Elan remained non-committal on the proposal, which it called “highly conditional” and “opportunistic.” Elan last month unveiled a deal to sell its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri to its partner Biogen Idec in exchange for $3.25bn in cash and continuing royalties.Mr Legorreta said he had first approached Elan’s senior management about an acquisition in autumn last year ahead of the Biogen deal.
50;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2013-03-04T17:17:28Z;Elan pledges royalties-linked dividend;;Elan, the Irish-based drug company, has moved to counter a $6.6bn takeover bid by pledging to pay a fifth of the royalties on its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri directly to shareholders, in a dividend that some analysts placed at nearly $70m next year alone.In an unusual written commitment, chief executive Kelly Martin said the company would hand more than 20 per cent of its royalty income directly to investors twice a year from this autumn, once its divestment of the drug is completed.He also accelerated the timetable for potential acquisitions following the Tysabri transaction, agreed with its partner Biogen Idec and unveiled last month, saying further details should be provided “in the coming days and weeks”.His comments come after Royalty Pharma, a private equity group that buys the rights to patented drugs, last week offered $11 a share to buy out Elan, valuing the company’s equity at $6.6bn.Elan, which had previously not made public the approaches from Royalty, called the proposal “highly opportunistic,” while not issuing a formal rejection of the “conditional” bid. Following the Biogen Idec deal, worth $3.25bn in cash and future royalties, the company said it would offer a one-off $1bn share buyback, refinance debt and seek future acquisitions.Under the terms of its deal with Biogen Idec, the company will receive 12 per cent royalties on sales of Tysabri in the first year after closing, rising to 18 per cent on sales up to $2bn and 25 per cent on any additional sales above that level. In 2012, sales on the drug were $1.6bn.Mr Martin made it clear the royalty-linked dividend payout would have no cap. “This dividend structure gives shareholders the right to enjoy unlimited participation in the upside from the Tysabri sales increase which we anticipate for the future,” he said.Berenberg estimated the Tysabri royalty would trigger dividends to Elan shareholders of $68m in 2014 rising to $175m in 2023. Others have argued Tysabri’s sales will be threatened by newer multiple sclerosis drugs coming on to the market.Deutsche Bank said in a research note the Elan announcement provided welcome additional clarity on the company’s plans, and the recent rise in the share price implied that investors thought Royalty Pharma would raise its bid. But the investment bank cautioned that “Royalty Pharma’s likely required rates of return will mean revised bids materially above $12/share are unlikely”.
51;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2013-02-25T14:45:42Z;Elan / Royalty Pharma: gone shopping;Which investment banker-turned-pharma executive will investors back?;"Turning a company into a cash shell means one of two things. Either it is about to go shopping, or it appears on someone’s shopping list. Last week Elan Corp was the former; now it is the target of an $11-a-share indicative offer from Royalty Pharma, a private US company that invests in drug royalties. A deal at that level would value Elan at $6.6bn. Yet its shares jumped 9 per cent to over $11.50 after Monday’s announcement. The key to this deal will be which investment banker-turned-pharma executive investors choose to back – Elan’s Kelly Martin (ex-Merrill Lynch) or Royalty’s Pablo Legorreta (ex-Lazard).After selling its 50 per cent stake in Tysabri, its best-selling multiple sclerosis drug and last remaining asset, to Biogen Idec on February 6, Elan will receive $3.3bn and a slice of future royalties, but has no further operations. Mr Martin has outlined a $1bn share buyback and an acquisition strategy that sounds aggressive but is very vague. Mr Legorreta is not the first to point out that Elan has no recent history of generating returns from acquisitions. So the chance that Mr Martin would blow Elan’s cash on a value-destroying biotech deal is arguably high. Some investors will no doubt prefer Royalty’s offer, if it materialises, of cash now instead of uncertain returns no sooner than the day after tomorrow.Buying Elan would be Royalty’s biggest deal by far, even after procuring some chunky royalty streams in recent years. Adding the Tysabri royalties would be a good fit with its stake in Biogen’s Tecfidera multiple sclerosis drug royalties. An offer at $11 a share would represent an enterprise value multiple of 16 times Elan’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, about twice the sector average. That is exceedingly full; Royalty would have little room to sweeten a debt-funded offer. Elan could raise the share buyback. It says it has been working for more than a year on “a number of strategic transactions”. But Mr Martin may have left it too late to go on his shopping trip.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
52;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Elan unveils share $1bn buyback;;Elan, the Irish-based drug company, has pledged to buy back $1bn of its own shares, refinance debt and seek fresh acquisitions after receiving $3.25bn from a restructuring of its partnership with Biogen Idec over a multiple sclerosis drug.The company said it was planning “a number of strategic transactions” designed to diversify its products, therapeutic range and geographical footprint.The action follows a deal agreed at the start of this month by which Elan scrapped its joint venture with Biogen Idec of the US in favour of an upfront cash payment and a “double-digit tiered royalty” for the life of the Tysabri drug.Kelly Martin, the chief executive, said in a statement: “Understandably, many market participants are looking forward to further clarity around how we intend to deploy the significant upfront payment we will be receiving from Biogen Idec upon the close of our transaction … We have been making significant progress in this regard and are prepared to move expeditiously, upon close, on the redeployment of capital.”Deutsche Bank on Friday said in a note: “We welcome the announced share buyback and see potential for significant value to be unlocked for existing shareholders as management executes. However, close to 40 per cent of Elan’s current market cap could be invested in as yet unknown assets and, as such, we are unlikely to gain the visibility needed to become constructive on the shares until transactions are concluded.”It added: “In our view, the shares remain suitable only for those investors willing to take positions purely on the basis of management’s possible uses of cash.”Elan posted full-year earnings at the time of the Biogen Idec deal that showed earnings before interest, tax and depreciation – including Tysabri – were up 13 per cent to $220m, on sales up 13 per cent to $1.2bn.It reported a net loss of $137m on sales of $200m from continuing operations. It retained more than $1.5bn in accumulated tax losses.Mr Kelly said: “By unlocking a portion of the Tysabri asset value while retaining a significant earnings upside, we have a unique opportunity to reward shareholders, diversify our business and create a highly distinctive business platform upon which to advance to the benefit of shareholders and patients around the world.”
53;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2013-02-06T17:40:58Z;Biogen to buy Elan’s stake in MS drug;;Biogen Idec, the US biotechnology company, said on Wednesday that it would pay $3.25bn in cash to acquire Elan Corp’s stake in its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug.The deal gives Biogen full control of the drug, Tysabri, which it developed in conjunction with Elan. Tysabri generated about $1.6bn in sales last year and Biogen will continue to make contingency payments to Elan based on its revenues.For Elan, which is based in Dublin, the deal heralds a restructuring that will probably see the company acquire another company.“This is a natural next step for Biogen Idec and Tysabri, and it underscores our deep, long-term commitment to improving the lives of MS patients around the world,” said George Scangos, Biogen’s chief executive.Analysts predict that Tysabri sales could reach $3bn by 2016. Multiple sclerosis, which is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, affects 2m people around the world.The deal represents a fresh start for Elan, which was dealt a blow last summer when a late stage trial for its promising Alzheimer’s drug failed, triggering the cancellation of partnership programmes with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.Last year Elan announced plans to spin off its experimental sciences arm, raising speculation that it could be a takeover target.“The restructuring of this business collaboration provides Elan with significant strategic flexibility,” said Kelly Martin, Elan’s chief executive, on Wednesday. “We are enthusiastic about the market opportunities around the globe and remain flexible and creative about the manner in which we would participate in those opportunities.”Shares of Biogen rose 2.84 per cent to $161.83 in midday trading. Elan’s stock price fell 8.5 per cent to $9.57 in New York.
54;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2013-02-06T16:25:26Z;Elan / Biogen: where are the drugs?;Biotech group needs a new strategy now more than ever;Elan Corp has become the drug company that has no drugs. The Dublin-based biotechnology group has been looking for a strategic direction for several years. In the meantime, shareholders have endured boardroom disputes, the hiring of banks to explore options that amounted to very little, and the fizzling out of key drug trials. Wednesday’s announcement that it will sell its 50 per cent interest in Tysabri, its successful multiple sclerosis drug and only real asset, to Biogen Idec, which owns the other 50 per cent, brings an era to a close. Can Elan 2.0 be a bit more reliable?Elan will get $3.3bn for its Tysabri stake, plus a slice of future royalties (it got $1.2bn of revenues from the drug in 2012). That looks a good deal. But investors may not see much of the cash. Kelly Martin, Elan’s chief executive who was due to retire a year ago, says there may be some distribution but he is intent on an acquisition. Moreover, it could be a sizeable one. UBS estimates that taking the Tysabri cash, deferred tax assets and the share of future royalties, the sale to Biogen could be worth $7.5bn. That would give Elan considerable buying power.Selling Tysabri removes one type of uncertainty for shareholders (future revenues) and adds another (a $3bn cash pile can burn a lot of holes in a lot of pockets). That might explain why Elan’s shares initially surged on the disposal and then fell into negative territory. Investors were already hurting from the failure of clinical trials for an Alzheimer’s drug last year. Elan’s shares are off 30 per cent since then and are down 70 per cent over five years, trailing other biotech groups such as Jazz Pharmaceuticals. Hopes that Biogen might buy Elan outright have now been dashed, removing any takeover premium. Elan has attractions as a speculative vehicle but investors will need no reminding that good biotech does not come cheap.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
55;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2012-07-15T16:22:01Z;US biotech warning over Europe price cuts;;European price cuts threaten the development of future medicines by squeezing drug companies’ research budgets, the head of Biogen Idec, one of the largest US biotech groups, has warned.In an interview with the Financial Times, George Scangos, the chief executive of the Boston-based company, said European healthcare systems imposing lower prices were “freeriding” on the US, which pays more for drugs. “International reference pricing is not sustainable. We are going to be a lower margin industry. Going forward, that’s just a fact.”He said lower sales were likely to translate into a reduction in the number of future treatments. With companies focusing a high proportion of their remaining spending on developing new indications and formulations of medicines already approved for sale, the greatest hit would be on riskier, earlier-stage experimental drugs.“If margins are less and prices are squeezed, R&D budgets will be squeezed,” he said. “The part most vulnerable is early stage. We will see a single-digit number of new chemical entities approved again each year. The flow of new drugs would slow dramatically.”While supportive of US healthcare reform, Mr Scangos criticised as “well intended but misguided” its creation of the independent payment advisory board to control Medicare spending, echoing recent comments from John Lechleiter, the head of Eli Lilly and current chairman of PhRMA, the trade body.Mr Scangos, a former academic and executive at Bayer, was recruited to run Biogen Idec two years ago from Exelixis, a San Francisco-based drug company, after a period of troubles for the company which came under pressure from Carl Icahn, the veteran activist investor.He said he initially refused the post when he was approached by a headhunter. “After three years of proxy battles, products under threat and a dysfunctional board, I said ‘no’.”But he has since found working with that board of – unchanged – directors to be very smooth. Since his appointment, he has undertaken a series of reforms including refocusing its portfolio of medicines and cost-cutting, while the strong performance of existing experimental products he retained has helped to sharply lift the share price.While the company had shifted its non-research and development operations to Weston, he is returning them to a single hub in Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the heart of Boston’s life sciences activities. “You don’t want to have a gulf between staff,” he said, praising the collaborative spirit of the region, which has even be compared to the Bay area.Most fundamentally, he ended 17 projects – existing Biogen Idec products for cancer and cardiovascular disease – to concentrate on autoimmune diseases and immunology. “We’re just not a big enough company to do it all.”As he told analysts in a roadshow recently: “We’re putting patients first, playing to win, which means no dabbling. It means that if we’re going to do something, we should do it with power, we should do it with critical mass.”Instead, he emphasises the importance and commercial benefits of offering a range of treatments for diseases which the company specialises in. This franchise system is demonstrated by the work on multiple sclerosis, for which it already markets Tysabri and Avonex, with another half a dozen drugs in development. “We can be more cost effective with a suite of treatments.”Jefferies, the broker which has a “buy” recommendation on the stock, concluded after a review day of the company’s pipeline “we can justify our price target based on the MS franchise alone with potential upside from haemophilia and ALS programmes”, referring to its early stage treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a type of motor neuron disease.
56;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2012-05-06T18:24:48Z;Drugmakers see $33bn bout of M&A activity;;"A recent spate of takeovers in healthcare, as drugmakers seek to replace expiring drug patents, has made it the busiest sector in April with acquisitions around the world worth more than $33bn, according to Dealogic.Completed transactions included AstraZeneca’s $1.3bn purchase of Ardea, which has an experimental drug for gout, while other companies of similar size named as potential takeover bids include Onyx and Amylin.Several deals were unsolicited or have turned hostile. GlaxoSmithKline has an outstanding $2.6bn bid for Human Genome Science, joint developer of Benlysta for lupus; and Roche recently withdrew a $7bn bid for Illumina, a US diagnostics company which spurned the offer.“We’re in an attractive M&A market as big cap pharma companies are looking to acquire innovation to address their patent cliffs,” says Rick Leaman, managing partner at Moelis & Co, the New York investment bank.Clint Gartin, Morgan Stanley vice-chairman of investment banking and head of healthcare banking, says the heavy deal flow illustrates the fast pace of change in the sector. “In healthcare, a new drug can change the environment overnight. It can make some products not competitive, and move others to the front row.”Borrowing is cheap, helping acquirers to boost earnings rapidly after completing takeovers. The large pharmaceutical companies also remain highly cash generative from existing products, while sales of divisions – such as Pfizer’s $12bn nutrition disposal to Nestlé– provide more funds. Bayer and Johnson & Johnson are among those that have indicated they are interested in new transactions.While the appetite for “mega mergers” has dulled, several midsize companies including Shire and Biogen Idec are regularly cited as potential targets. Even Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, AbbVie and AstraZeneca are periodically cited as takeover candidates should they fail to replenish their own pipelines.Drew Burch, head of healthcare M&A at Barclays, says: “The nature of the business is that the revenues are dependent on patent protections. That means at some point you face a decline in that revenue stream. The replacement has either got to come from your own labs or from outside.”"
57;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2012-01-30T19:55:16Z;US pharma: keep taking the tablets;Biotechs, despite higher multiples, look a better bet than the pharma stocks;Time to get off the drugs? We’ve had a good time, after all. Over the past 12 months, the average return of the eight-largest US pure-play pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies by market value is a dizzy 34 per cent, according to Capital IQ, compared with the S&P 500’s buzz-killing 3 per cent. Before going cold turkey, keep a distinction in mind. The big eight fit in two broad categories. Pfizer, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly are very slow-growing, dividend-paying pharma stocks. Amgen, Gilead, Celgene and Biogen Idec are big-cap biotechs that are expected to squeeze out solid single-to double digit sales growth over the next few years.For the more staid former cohort, there are two general explanations of the strong one-year performance (up 24 per cent). Big-cap dividend stocks across all sectors have had a great run. And the year before the four were flat as a group, while the S&P rallied mightily, rendering them cheap and paving the way for them to perform well simply by reverting to the mean. The big biotechs (up 45 per cent) have been driven more by specific product and pipeline successes, for example a new multiple sclerosis drug at Biogen, and one for osteoporosis at Amgen.The pharma stocks, then, have run up less and, except for Bristol-Myers, are cheaper than the biotech stocks. It would be a mistake to think that price-to-earnings multiples in the single digits are a signal of low risk, however. As drugs such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, Bristol’s Plavix, Lilly’s Zyprexa and Merck’s Singulair lose patent protection, revenues are expected to fall at all four companies over the next few years. The big pharmas will rely on their pipelines or acquisitions to turn things around – a chancy business either way. The biotechs, despite higher multiples, look a better bet. If you want to party on, pay up.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Biogen Idec has been just such a company recently. As a result it is the best-performing large capitalisation healthcare stock in the world year-to-date, according to Capital IQ. The shares have risen by over two-thirds.On the risk side, revenues of Biogen’s fastest-growing drug, the multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri, have come to look much more sustainable. Investors and patients had been focused on the small risk of dangerous infections that accompanies use of the drug. But increased availability of a test for a virus implicated in the infections has made it possible for patients to gauge the risks ahead of time.More importantly, Biogen’s key pipeline product, BG-12 for MS, has had strong late-stage clinical results. It is delivered orally rather than by injection, making it easier to use, and it appears to be safer than the only other oral MS drug currently available, Novartis’s Gilenya. Credit Suisse estimates annual sales of the drug could be $3bn; Bernstein reckons $4.2bn. Significant figures, given that Biogen has a bit over $5bn in annual revenues currently.Risks have not disappeared: safety data about both BG-12 and Tysabri will continue to roll in, for better or worse. And MS patients and their doctors are notoriously careful about switching to new treatments, so adoption of BG-12 may be slow, if it is approved. Biogen’s shares trade at a significant premium to its big biotech peers such as Gilead and Amgen, suggesting that much of the upside from BG-12 and Tysabri is priced in.Biogen a year ago had the all the attributes of a great pharma value stock: products addressing serious medical needs, an innovation-driven growth story, and a low valuation. It no longer checks the last box.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
59;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Study reveals genetic variations behind MS;;"A huge international study of multiple sclerosis has revealed 57 genetic variations that underlie the disease. The results prove that MS is primarily a disorder of the immune system, which then attacks the central nervous system.For the study, published in the journal Nature, 250 researchers studied the differences in DNA between 9,800 people with MS and 17,400 healthy control subjects. They discovered 29 new genetic variants, besides confirming 26 mutations suspected previously from smaller studies.“Our research settles a long-standing debate on what happens first in the complex sequence of events that leads to disability in MS,” said Alastair Compston, professor of neurology at the University of Cambridge. “It is now clear that MS is primarily an immunological disease, and this has important implications for future treatment strategies.”MS is the most common disabling disease among young adults, affecting an estimated 100,000 people in the US and 2.5m worldwide. Like many complex disorders, it results from the interaction of a large number of genes and environmental factors; inheritance studies suggest that nature and nurture each contribute about 50 per cent to the risk of developing MS.Most of the genes implicated in the latest MS study play pivotal roles in the workings of the immune system – particularly in the function of T-cells, which attack foreign substances in the body, and interleukins, natural molecules that facilitate interactions between immune cells.About a third of the genes found to be involved in MS have already been implicated in other auto-immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type-1 diabetes and Crohn’s disease, indicating that the same general processes can start a range of diseases with quite different symptoms.There are now two big questions for understanding these diseases: first, what triggers the aberrant auto-immune response in the first place – possible causes range from viral infection to vitamin D deficiency – and second, what directs the damage to occur in particular tissues? In MS, the aberrant T-cells migrate from the blood into the brain and nervous system, where they induce the immune system to attack nerve fibres and their protective insulation, the myelin sheath.The results of the study show that drugs to treat MS should focus on preventing the initial faulty immune response, Prof Compston said. One MS drug on the market (Tysabri, marketed by Biogen Idec and Elan) and three more in clinical development work in this way, although they sometimes have serious side-effects.“We are now in the second phase of MS treatments, which are much more effective than the first phase – but much less safe,” he added. “We can now move on to a third phase where the drugs will be very effective and very safe.”"

The deal is set to close in the third quarter of this year and is expected to create $50m in synergies by 2013.Shares in Endo rose 0.5 per cent to $41.06, falling back in late trading from earlier 5 per cent gains, while AMS shares surged 32.1 per cent to $29.50. Elsewhere in the sector, Biogen was up 7.2 per cent to $78.55 after a successful trial for its multiple sclerosis treatment while Forest Laboratories added 4.1 per cent to $34.21.But in the wider markets, the S&P 500 index lost 0.3 per cent to 1,324.46, adding to the 0.4 per cent losses on Friday. The energy sector saw the sharpest losses following the IMF report which reduced its forecast for US growth in 2011 to 2.8 per cent from 3 per cent.Cameron International, the oilfield services company, was down 3.5 per cent to $53.54 as oil prices lost ground while Baker Hughes lost 3.2 per cent to $69.31. The S&P energy sector was down 1.9 per cent.The material sectors also saw strong losses with Freeport-McMoRan, the copper producer, falling 3.1 per cent to $55.44 and Consol Energy, the coal miner, losing 4.2 per cent to $50.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat in the session at 12,381.11 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,771.51.Before the IMF report the markets were slightly higher with traders looking optimistically towards the upcoming earnings season. Over the next few weeks almost two-thirds of the companies in the S&P 500 will report their first-quarter earnings.“We look set to have a very healthy earnings season,” said Kate Warne, market strategist at Edward Jones. “Although I think that there will likely be fewer earnings surprises than in recent quarters.”Analysts are expecting that stocks on the S&P 500 will see earnings per share growth of 11 per cent in the first quarter from the same period a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. This is a significantly slower growth rate than the 36 per cent jump in the fourth quarter of 2010, but the growth is coming from a higher base.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, reported earnings that topped analysts forecasts after the closing bell on Monday.The company reported earnings excluding restructuring costs and other one-time items of 28 cents a share, topping the 27 cents expected by analysts. The stock was down 0.8 per cent to $17.77 ahead of the result.This week will also see earnings reports by JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday and Google on Thursday.There was more deal activity in the telecommunications sector. Level 3 Communications, the internet video and communications network operator, said it had agreed to acquire Global Crossing, the IP solutions provider, in an all-stock offer valued at roughly $1.9bn.The news sent shares in Level 3 up 18.1 per cent to $1.70 and Global Crossing up 68.7 per cent to $24.97.In other deal news, Tyco International jumped 3.3 per cent to $48.72 following unconfirmed reports that Schneider Electric was weighing up a takeover offer for the maker of security systems.Shares in NYSE Euronext, the largest exchange operator in the US, lost ground after its board unanimously voted on Sunday to reject the offer from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, which was intended to break up the planned merger with Deutsche Börse.In a statement, the NYSE Euronext board said the deal with Deutsche Börse would “create substantially more long-term value for shareholders, and is significantly more likely to close”.Shares in NYSE lost 2.9 per cent to $37.59. Nasdaq fell 1.5 per cent to $28.03.Viasystems Group, the electronics manufacturer, was down 2.7 per cent to $25 after saying that it expected “minor impacts” from the Japanese earthquake on the flow of supplies.Monsanto, which reported disappointing results last week, was up 1.4 per cent to $67.17 after the seed producer was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to “buy” from “hold”.
61;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2011-03-11T19:33:57Z;Icahn warns another downturn may lie ahead;;Carl Icahn has joined the growing chorus of prominent investors warning that another downturn may lie ahead.“You’ve got to be myopic if you’re not at least concerned that there might be a major correction,” the veteran corporate raider told the Financial Times this week after informing outside investors in his Icahn Partners hedge fund that their money was no longer needed.“Bernanke has done a brilliant job but he can’t hold interest rates down for ever, and in any event he stops in June and we don’t know what happens after that,” he warned.The 75-year-old billionaire has no intention of giving up the boardroom battles which made him famous, however.“I’m not going to change my modus operandi, I sort of like it. We as activists have done well all these years, and there are still a lot of companies out there with a great deal of fat on them.”Rather he claims he simply does not want to be responsible for other people’s savings through another crisis.“It’s funny, it really doesn’t bother me that much if I have paper losses. However, I talked to a couple of friends who put money in, and when it’s down 30 per cent, even though they’re not poor guys, it bothers me that it’s my responsibility.”Yet the prospect of regulation played a role, and investors are no longer willing to commit capital for the long periods required for activist investing. “People are very skittish, so no one is giving three year lock-ups, even people who love us,” said Mr Icahn.The performance of the Icahn fund was also mixed. It more than doubled, before fees, since the 2004 launch, but good returns in the past two years were largely recouping losses suffered in 2008.Furthermore, while Mr Icahn’s decision not to limit investor withdrawals was founded on principle – “I’m of the old school where if someone gives you their money I respect it”, he said – it also meant that he captured much of the rebound.“They kept taking their money out and I kept putting it in, so we never liquidated. Being ethical turned out to be very profitable, although at the time I wasn’t sure that it would be.”In 2007 Fortune noted that of about $7bn under management in the Icahn fund, $1.5bn belonged to Mr Icahn. When he closed the fund this week it still had about $7bn of assets, but only a quarter was owned by outsiders.His record of effecting change at large companies, one of the reasons that outside capital was sought in the first place, is also mixed.Highly-profitable victories at companies such as Biogen, BEA Systems and Genzyme are balanced by failures at Yahoo, Motorola and the now bankrupt Blockbuster.Although Mr Icahn argues that at Time Warner, where he began agitating for a break-up in 2005, the company “pretty well did what we were trying to get them to do, even if it took a few years”. “I think our record shows that we enhance value. We were even invited back on to a couple of boards (Motorola and Yahoo) that I never would have expected,” he added.Further battles lie ahead, with Mr Icahn accumulating “a lot of cash, quite a number of billions”. But he remains concerned about the markets. “When everybody is getting bullish and everybody is making loads of money it worries me because I’ve seen it happen many times before.”As for succession, his son Brett has been managing small-cap investments for him for a decade, but Mr Icahn has no intention of stopping yet. “I haven’t thought about it, it depresses me to think about it,” he said.
62;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2010-10-27T21:15:54Z;Elan cuts losses by boosting sales;Headline multiple sclerosis drug helps Irish pharmaceutical group;Falling research costs and rising sales of its headline multiple sclerosis drug helped Elan, the Irish pharmaceutical group, trim its losses during the third quarter.The group’s pre-tax loss reduced from $255m to $73m, driven by falling research and administrative expenses, offset slightly by declining sales of older drugs.The company confirmed that it remained on target to deliver annual adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $150m and – for the first time in many years – an operating profit and positive cash flow from operations.Kelly Martin, chief executive, said, “We continue to construct an operating model which allows us to leverage our core strengths while collaborating on many other components within the business.”In-market sales, including sales made by distributors, of the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri rose 9 per cent to $307.2m for the quarter. Elan said that patient demand rose for Tysabri, which is developed and marketed alongside the US firm Biogen Idec, and a price hike in the US negated the effect of US healthcare reform and pricing pressures in other markets.The shares closed down 1.67 per cent at €3.97.

Analysts had forecast a total of 320,000 units. Home sales had been falling since a tax credit expired this year.The S&P 500 homebuilders index rose 3.7 per cent, with DR Horton up 3 per cent to $11.17, PulteGroup higher by 4.7 per cent to $9.07 and Lennar rising 3.3 per cent to $15.42.AIG, the bailed-out insurer which has units that initiate, insure and invest in home loans, advanced 6.9 per cent to $39.30.FedEx boosted investor confidence by raising its profit forecast. It pushed up its earnings per share guidance for this quarter to a range of $1.05–$1.25 from $0.85–$1.05. The news came after UPS reported better second-quarter earnings than expected last week. FedEx shares rose 5.6 per cent to $83.39.Ralph Fogel, investment strategist at Fogel Neale Partners, said “It’s interesting to note that with recent moves in the market, both up and down, it is transportation that has led the move.”US-listed shares in BP rose 4.9 per cent to $38.65 after it was reported that the oil company was set to announce the departure of Tony Hayward, chief executive, in the next 24 hours. American Bob Dudley was touted as Mr Hayward’s successor.Shares in Anadarko Petroleum, which owns 25 per cent of the ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, rose 3.6 per cent to $50.53.Genzyme biotech company rose 7.7 per cent to $67.38 in early trading following reports that Sanofi-Aventis was more likely to buy the company than GlaxoSmithKline. US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis rose 1.6 per cent to $29.82 and GlaxoSmithKline’s US-listed shares lost 0.7 per cent to $36.74. The S&P 500 healthcare index was up 1.4 per cent.On Friday, speculation that French pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis might have approached Genzyme about a possible merger boosted its share price by 15.4 per cent.Biogen Idec, the biotech group, advanced on speculation that it was a potential takeover target, rising 8.3 per cent to $57.89.Shares in oil and gas producer Delta Petroleum surged 9.3 per cent to 87 cents after the company agreed to sell several non-core assets to Wapiti Oil & Gas for $130m.Other deals included Core-Mark Holding, a distributor of packaged goods to convenience stores, which was up 5.6 per cent after it agreed to buy Finkle Distributors for about $43m.After the bumper earnings releases of last week, there was a pause in the earnings season on Monday with fewer companies releasing before the bell.Among those that did, FMC Technologies, the provider of technology for oil and gasfields, reported earnings of 78 cents, above forecasts of 71 cents. But the company’s revenue was worse than expected and it did not raise guidance for the full year in spite of a strong order book. Shares were up 2.3 per cent to $61.77.Lorillard cigarette manufacturer also rose after delivering better earnings than expected. Shares were up 1.3 per cent to $77.25 after the owner of the Newport menthol cigarette brand said net income was $263m, or $1.73 a share, for the second quarter, compared with analysts’ predictions of $1.61 a share.Both Office Depot and telecoms company Sprint Nextel rose ahead of results they are due to report this week. Office Depot, which reports today, was up 7.7 per cent to $4.73 and Sprint Nextel, which reports tomorrow, rose 7.7 per cent to $5.05.Onyx Pharmaceuticals put on 21.2 per cent to $26.04 after it reported positive results from a study testing its experimental drug carfilzomib.

As part of the agreement, Elan will pay $203.5m to settle all the claims against it from the US government and from state healthcare groups.Elan will also plead guilty to a misdemeanour violation of the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and will enter into a “corporate integrity agreement” with the US Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.Elan cautioned that the resolution of the current Zonegran litigation could potentially expose the company to “other litigation by state government entities or private parties”.Elan has experienced difficulties in the past with its products. In 2005, the group took its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri off the market, following the death of two patients; the group faced a shareholder class action suit over the drug later that year.However, Tysabri, which was co-marketed with drug group BioGen, returned to the market in 2006 after the US Food and Drug Administration decided that patients willing to accept the risks of the drug should have access to it. Tysabri now has annual sales of more than $1bn – almost two-thirds of group revenues.In April of this year, Elan said it was conducting a review into the possibility of splitting into two separately listed groups, with one focusing on the development of neurology drugs and the other on medicine formulation and drug-optimisation technologies.Shares in Elan closed down 19 cents at €3.75 on Friday."

Total non-farm payrolls fell by 125,000 but that included a 225,000 fall in census workers.However, the numbers were not as bad as some traders were expecting, said Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial. “The Street had priced in the worst-case scenario, and it didn’t get it.”The market is close to bottoming out and should rally as the next earnings season starts, Mr White said.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent to 1,022.58, and 5 per cent lower on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 9,686.48, and fell 4.5 per cent during the week. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5 per cent to 2,091.79, leaving it 5.9 per cent lower on the week.Drugmakers were among the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 on Friday following reports that Sanofi-Aventis, France’s biggest pharmaceutical company, is preparing a significant acquisition in the US that could be worth up to $15bn.Allergan rallied 7.2 per cent to $62.29 on Friday, Biogen Idec added 5.8 per cent to $49.42 and Genzyme advanced 5.9 per cent to $52.80.Eli Lilly advanced 1.7 per cent to $33.67 on Friday after the drugmaker said it had agreed to buy Alnara Pharmaceuticals, a privately-held Massachusetts-based biotechnology company developing protein therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic diseases.US-listed shares in BP rose 8.6 per cent on the week to $29.35 as the relief wells to stop the worst oil spill in US history progressed ahead of schedule and the clean-up effort dodged a direct hit from Hurricane Alex earlier in the week.It was the first weekly gain the stock has posted since the oil spill began in April.Emerson Electric was down 0.6 per cent to $43.42 on Friday after the board of Chloride, a London-listed power supply systems maker, recommended a $1.5bn takeover by the US conglomerate, bringing to an end a drawn-out bid battle.Tesla Motors, an electric car company that has yet to make a profit, priced its initial public offering above its forecast range to raise $226m on Tuesday.Its shares were up 40.5 per cent on their first trading day, before falling back to to end the week only 3.2 per cent higher than the initial price. The maker of the $109,000 Roadster sold 13.3m shares at $17 each after offering them in a range of $14-$16.Google was 0.7 per cent lower on Friday at $436.55 as it announced a $700m acquisition of ITA Software, a travel technology group, opening a new front in its battle with Microsoft. The deal is among the search company’s biggest acquisitions and could give it influence in a key area of online commerce.Microsoft’s own relative success in travel search could help Google clear the antitrust process.Morgan Stanley fell 1.1 per cent to $22.83 on Friday as the bank said it had sold City Mortgage Bank, its Russian mortgage unit, to Orient Express Bank for an undisclosed amount. Morgan Stanley bought Moscow-based City Mortgage in 2006.Dell was flat at $12.03 on Friday after the personal computer maker said it had agreed to buy Scalent, a private data centre software company, for an undisclosed sum.The deal is aimed at boosting Dell’s existing offering of servers, storage and network platforms.
66;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2010-06-10T21:51:40Z;Researchers are out of race for the top job;;Wanted: chief executive for pharmaceutical company to bring lucrative new medicines to market. Scientists need not apply.The search is on for new bosses at several drug companies, including Elan and Biogen Idec. That may be good news for headhunters, but for a sector that traditionally derives its income from research and development, it will bring little hope for ambitious scientists.At many of the biggest pharmaceutical companies, where it was formerly the norm for researchers to migrate from laboratory to executive suite, business, marketing and commercial experience is becoming the new norm.In the 1980s, for example, Merck, the pride of the drug industry for its strong in-house research, was headed by Roy Vagelos, a chemist and doctor who developed potent anti-cholesterol drugs and gave away Ivermectin, a treatment for river blindness, for free across Africa. Now the boss is Dick Clark, who has a commercial background.In February, Joe Jimenez, who worked largely in the packaged goods sector, took over from Daniel Vasella, a qualified doctor, as chief executive of Novartis.A similar pattern has been seen across big pharma, reflecting broader changes to the industry model. Marketing and diversification away from prescription drugs has become the focus of business models.Indeed, those who run medical research have often been relegated to a support function, as their budgets have been trimmed. That, in turn, has redrawn the job description of the pharmaceutical chief executive.Dana Krueger at Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive recruitment company that has just completed a study of the backgrounds of biotech CEOs, sees a similar pattern. Very early-stage drug developers are often still run by scientists whom she typically characterises as having a “collaborative, nurturing style”.By contrast, once their products get closer to market – or they begin negotiating licensing deals with larger companies – people with a business background and a more controlling style assume the top job. “You want someone who is outward-looking, and focused on execution,” she says.In the increasingly ruthless pharma ecosystem, with higher regulatory barriers and costs, and ever more sceptical and demanding investors providing funding, the changing business model also means that radically innovative prospective drugs often suffer at the expense of less ground-breaking ones with a greater chance of commercial success.Just two companies have stuck to the scientist-CEO model, including Eli Lilly and Gilead. “We have a number of scientists in senior positions,” says John Martin, Gilead CEO. “Their perspectives are helpful, and I think essential, because many of the day-to-day business decisions we are making relate to the science we are working on.”But the case of Sanofi-Aventis highlights the potential pitfalls of promoting an individual accustomed to research to the top job. In 2007, the company appointed Gérard Le Fur, its long-standing head of research and development, to run the company. But his prized weight-loss and anti-smoking drug, Accomplia, flopped, and he was reluctant to communicate with investors or articulate a new strategy. As he told the Financial Times at the time: “I’m a backstage person – it’s a genetic thing.”A few months later the company ousted Mr Le Fur and appointed Chris Viehbacher, a former accountant who had risen through the commercial ranks at GlaxoSmithKline.The Russell Reynolds analysis suggests that the best skillset is to combine scientific training with a formal business degree and commercial experience. Ms Krueger says many scientists are doing just that.Even Dr Vagelos admits that the era of the scientist-CEO may be over. “While a medical scientist can learn the business end, as I did at Merck, a non-technical person can learn enough about the technology to lead a company very well.”
67;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2010-03-08T18:57:54Z;AstraZeneca job cuts reflect new landscape;;When AstraZeneca revealed details last week of 3,500 job cuts across its global research and development operations, it was not just the company’s own employees who felt concerned.The decision by the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group is the latest in a series of recent restructurings that will have an important impact on the volume of future medical innovation and the way in which it takes place.Many companies have reduced in-house expenditure and closed some disease-research units in the past few months, partly to reduce duplication following a series of large-scale acquisitions such as Pfizer’s takeover of Wyeth and Merck’s of Schering-Plough.Other “big pharma” companies have taken similar steps, seeking fresh efficiency measures at a time of growing commercial pressure to reduce fixed costs. GlaxoSmithKline said last month that it would halt research in areas including depression to concentrate on diseases where the science and its own strengths are more promising.Chris Viehbacher, chief executive of Sanofi-Aventis, says: “A third of our total research and development spending are costs for buildings before you even switch the lights on and bring in a single scientist.”The action frees up money to be invested more flexibly in promising projects, whether taking place internally or externally. That reflects a growing recognition even by companies such as Merck – once proud of its almost exclusively in-house efforts – of the need to tap scientific breakthroughs taking place outside its own walls.Andrew Baum, pharmaceuticals analyst with Morgan Stanley, forecasts that many more companies will shift towards a greater “externalisation” of their drug portfolios, estimating that the returns could be three times as high from investing in less risky drugs already brought to mid-stage development by biotech companies.But the switch away from in-house drug development by large companies also raises concerns. David Brennan, chief executive of AstraZeneca, says: “You still need to have sufficient in-house staff to scrutinise external projects.”There are also more fundamental worries about whether smaller drug developers can maintain the total industry “pipeline” of drugs. Clive Dix, chairman of the BioIndustry Association in the UK, says: “The jury is still out on whether biotech will be enough to fuel the engine of big pharma in the longer term.”Mungo Park, chairman of Innovator Capital, a healthcare specialist bank, cautions that extra money for biotech from the larger pharmaceuticals companies will be insufficient to offset a decline in other sources as investors turn towards other sectors such as “clean technology”.External projects remain far from a panacea. Last week Pfizer announced the failure of a clinical trial of Dimebon, the Alzheimer’s disease drug it developed with its partner, Medivation. On Monday Roche closed down a joint project with Biogen Idec to develop Ocrelizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment.A recent study by Thomson Reuters estimated that in-licensed drug compounds systematically failed more often that those originated in-house at every stage of the development process. Big companies will need to learn from in-licensing failures if their new externalised approach is to succeed.
68;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:07:36+0000;MS drugs scheme fails to deliver results;;A pioneering scheme designed by the government to impose a money-back guarantee on pharmaceutical companies if their drugs did not adequately treat patients has failed to provide any clear conclusions more than seven years after it was launched.In an article published on Wednesday in the British Medical Journal, a team of medical academics concluded there was no evidence to date that five drugs given since 2002 to multiple sclerosis patients were cost-effective.The long-awaited study was the first public analysis of a “risk-sharing” programme established by the Department of Health and a series of pharmaceutical companies after the government’s medicines watchdog advised against use of their products by the National Health Service.The findings of the research, led by Mike Boggild, a consultant neurologist from the Walton Centre in Liverpool, raise questions about the growing number of other pharmaceutical risk-sharing schemes subsequently agreed between drug companies and government.They also stirred further criticism of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which assesses the cost effectiveness of new drugs, and the willingness of the NHS to follow its recommendations.After Nice rejected the drugs Avonex, Betaferon, Rebif and Copaxone as poor value for money in 2002, the drug companies discounted their products to between £5,800 and £8,000 ($9,600 and $13,326) on condition that the price could change again after as little as two years if results were 20 per cent more or less effective than claimed.However, it took until 2005 before the 5,500 multiple sclerosis patients necessary to assess the drugs had been recruited, and the data was only finally released this week, more than two years after the first evaluation period ended in 2007.Echoing criticisms raised when the scheme was first launched, Dr Boggild said it was hard to assess the cost-effectiveness of multiple sclerosis drugs because of the difficulties in comparison with lack of treatment and because their effect can only be observed over long periods.“There would have been easier diseases to study with this sort of study,” he said.The Multiple Sclerosis Society, a patient group, criticised the “belated” publication of the data, called the scheme “ineffective” and highlighted that the ability to gain access to the drugs varied widely across the UK, and was among the lowest levels in Europe.“This is a deeply frustrating situation,” said Simon Gillespie, chief executive.
69;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;J&J wants deals with rivals to share risk;;"Johnson & Johnson, the US healthcare group, will in future take more long-term minority stakes and forge alliances with rival pharmaceuticals companies in an effort to share the rising costs and risks of drug development.William Weldon, chief executive, told the Financial Times: “The cost of developing compounds has become so high and become so risky that we are looking to share the risks and opportunities and find more and more partnerships.”His remarks reflect a trend even by large, cash-generative pharmaceuticals companies to find new ways to share the potential costs as well as the profits in proving the safety and efficacy of new drugs to regulators and winning agreement by healthcare systems to reimburse them.Mr Weldon stressed that he had no deals under consideration, but that US healthcare reform had added even more uncertainty to the environment for drug development. “You’ll see more and more sharing of risks because the upside can be spectacular.”The comments came in an interview after J&J recently approved alliances involving the purchase of 18 per cent of the equity of Elan, the Ireland-domiciled biotech company, for Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis drugs, and a similar investment in Crucell, the Dutch vaccines business.In a different tack, J&J also this summer signed an alliance with Gilead, the US biotech group, by joint trials to develop a once-daily HIV therapy combining J&J’s experimental medicine TMC278, with Gilead’s Truvada, which combines its drugs Viread and Emtriva.J&J has long managed at arm’s length many subsidiaries in its three divisions covering consumer healthcare, medical devices and drugs. It allows them to retain considerable autonomy. But it has usually chosen fully to acquire these companies and centralise back-office operations.A growing number of large pharmaceuticals companies that traditionally took full control of drug development are forging similar partnerships to share risks, including
GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, which are combining their experimental and existing HIV medicines into a joint venture.Bristol-Myers Squibb has agreed joint drug development projects with AstraZeneca for cancer and with Gilead for HIV.As a result of its Elan deal, J&J has also become linked to Elan’s existing partners, Biogen Idec and Wyeth, now part of Pfizer, with which it is developing Alzheimer’s drugs. “We are very happy to partner with Wyeth,” Mr Weldon said.In both Elan and Crucell deals, the company has agreed to a standstill in its equity holdings for the coming years."
70;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-10-23T18:52:04Z;Elan hit by Tysabri questions;;Irish drugs group Elan plunged 20.5 per cent to €3.42 on Friday, as European markets headed lower.European regulators announced they were reviewing Tysabri, a multiple sclerosis drug produced by Elan and Biogen Idec, a US biotechnology group, on reports a brain disease linked to the drug had begun to appear more frequently.Tysabri was Elan’s “key revenue and cash generator” and contributed to 65-70 per cent of its annual revenue, said Sam Farthing of Merrion Capital Group in Dublin.There was a danger doctors would prescribe the drug to fewer patients and for shorter treatment periods to limit risk, Mr Farthing said.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 slipped 0.6 per cent to 1,008.9 but was flat over the week. The CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.3 per cent on Friday to 3,808.24, leaving it 2.2 per cent lower on the week, while the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt declined 0.4 per cent to 5,740.25.Volvo shares rose on Friday after the Swedish trucks group said it had capped third-quarter losses at a lower than expected SKr3.3bn ($4.9bn). The company said it had begun to see signs of recovery in Asia, its second-largest market. Volvo shares closed up 4.5 per cent for the week at SKr69.75.Elsewhere in the car sector, BMW was 8.1 per cent higher at €35.94.The carmaker said it was “on track to deliver its 8-10 per cent margin targets by 2012”, and consensus estimates have already built in the assumption of a marginal third quarter earnings loss, Credit Suisse said.Daimler advanced 4.9 per cent to €36.89 after surprising the market this week with better-than-expected results a week early.Ericsson finished the week 0.8 per cent lower at SKr72 after the Swedish telecoms equipment maker’s earnings suggested operators are continuing to hold back on new investment .Goldman Sachs upgraded the group and French peer Alcatel-Lucent from “neutral” to “buy” on Friday, citing the companies’ effective cost-cutting measures. Alcatel-Lucent was 3 per cent lower for the week at €3.06.In banking, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse were both down in spite of reporting strong third quarter profits. Credit Suisse fell 5 per cent over the week to SFr56.75 while Deutsche Bank lost 3.5 per cent to €52.91.Brewers benefited from speculation that SAB Miller or Heineken would make a bid for the beer unit of Fomento Economico Mexicano, the maker of Dos Equis.Heineken rose 0.7 per cent to €29.76, Anheuser-Busch was 0.9 per cent higher at €33.82 and Carlsberg rose 3.1 per cent to DKr367. Pernod Ricard came out of the week 3.1 per cent higher at €55.72 after the group reported it had seen a return of demand in the US.
71;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-09-30T01:03:30Z;Pharmaceuticals: Same end, entirely different means;;"Their headquarters stand less than two kilometres apart, on opposite sides of the river Rhine in the city of Basel in Switzerland.But the strategies adopted by pharmaceutical groups Roche and Novartis could not be more different. They exemplify the growing divergence in the sector, one that has been intensified by the financial crisis.Helped by strong cash flows from top-selling products, both companies have been able to finance substantial acquisitions designed to sustain high sales, profits and market capitalisation. Yet their approaches to achieving these common goals differ markedly.Roche has recently completed the takeover of Genentech. It long held a majority stake in its US-based biotechnology partner but was forced to launch a hostile bid last year to buy out minorities. The deal has reinforced and recentralised the focus of the combined group on speciality care medicines and diagnostics.Despite the recent success of Tamiflu, the antiviral drug now selling widely to treat pandemic flu, most of Roche’s income comes from hospital-prescribed biological treatments such as Avastin, which has ever wider applications in cancer and has been relatively shielded from post-patent competition.That has allowed the company to charge high prices and avoid the need for costly large primary care sales forces, often much criticised for their marketing tactics.But while Roche was planning – though it is now re-thinking – a new headquarters in a skyscraper, Novartis is completing a campus-style home.The scattered selection of low-rise buildings in widely varying styles symbolises its much more diversified approach to business.Novartis sells primary care as well as speciality drugs. It has also extended itself beyond prescription-based, patent-protected medicines.At the moment, it is in the process of acquiring Alcon, an eyecare company, adding to takeovers in recent years of Hexal – which made it the world’s second largest generic drug company – and of Chiron, to build its portfolio in vaccines.While Severin Schwan, who took charge of Roche last year, represents a new generation of recently-appointed pharmaceutical bosses drawn increasingly from law (in his case), finance and marketing, Novartis chief executive, Daniel Vasella, who was appointed more than a decade ago, is one of the few doctors still in charge.The two men represent many of the extremes of the divergence in approaches of drug companies.In the Novartis camp are GlaxoSmithKline, strong in over-the-counter drugs and generics; and Pfizer, broadening its activities with the acquisition this year of Wyeth, which will bolster its presence in vaccines and enable it to access the over-the-counter niche it had turned its back on only a few years before.Sanofi-Aventis has also expanded into generics and animal health through Merial, buying out its joint venture partner Merck, which itself will strengthen its position in animal health by taking over Schering-Plough. Such diversification lowers overall margins, but smoothes cash flow and the uncertainty of developing drugs.The “pure pharma” approach of Roche, on the other hand, is taken by a shrinking number of companies. This includes AstraZeneca, which has persistently rejected large-scale acquisitions since the purchase of the biologicals business MedImmune. Like Eli Lilly, which includes an animal health division, it labours under questions about its smaller scale, as it is over-shadowed by mega-mergers elsewhere.There is undoubtedly pressure to consolidate. “The changes in the macro-environment have transformed everything,” said Fred Hassan, head of Schering-Plough, earlier this year when explaining his agreement to the takeover by Merck. He argued that the financial crisis accelerated existing cost and pricing pressures.Further deals may draw in companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, Biogen Idec and Elan (in which Johnson & Johnson recently bought a stake). Generic companies Ratiopharm and Actavis are up for sale.The crisis has created a buyers’ market for “big pharma”, while many fledgling biotech companies have struggled to extend financing and been forced to seek outright purchasers rather than partners.Three other trends mark the sector. The first is growing pressure from payers in the US and beyond, with greater scrutiny of pricing. That, combined with drug patent expiries and uncertainty over replacement, is driving talk of more innovative commercial and research models. The short-term consequence is cost cutting, such as Eli Lilly’s recently announced 14 per cent headcount reduction by 2011.A second common factor is geographical expansion. As the US market stagnates, most growth is coming from middle income countries, from China to Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa. That requires new thinking about pricing to reach large but poorer pools of patients, often without state or private healthcare cover.Finally, as consultancies including AT Kearney and Roland Berger have highlighted, there is a shift away from central internal control of the drug development and distribution process towards external alliances and partnerships."
72;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-09-15T02:28:28Z;Elan revises J&J deal to appease Biogen;;Elan, the Irish domiciled biotech company, will receive $115m less than previously agreed from Johnson & Johnson as part of a revised investment deal designed to salvage a pivotal partnership with Biogen Idec.The company claimed it had “cured” an “unintended” breach of its long-standing collaboration agreement with Biogen Idec, based in Boston in the US, over Tysabri, their jointly developed multiple sclerosis treatment, by changing aspects of J&J’s $1.5bn recapitalisation deal with Elan announced in July.Elan said the new terms allowed it to respect the deadline endorsed by a New York judge to resolve any conflicts with Biogen Idec by the end of this month or risk the collapse of the Tysabri partnership.However, the revised deal with J&J means it will now receive just $885m instead of $1bn from J&J in exchange for 18.4 per cent of its equity. A further minimum payment of $500m as previously agreed to develop most of Elan’s Alzheimer’s portfolio of drugs remains intact.The reduced payment for equity casts questions over Elan’s previous denial of Biogen Idec’s argument that the new deal represented a “delegation of rights” away from Elan because of a clause allowing J&J to help with funding in the event that the Tysabri deal required renegotiation.It was also not clear on Monday night whether Biogen Idec accepted Elan’s argument that it had resolved outstanding questions in a way that meant the Tysabri collaboration would remain intact. The Boston-based company refused to comment, as did J&J.Elan had argued in its legal defence against Biogen Idec that the termination of the Tysabri partnership would result in Elan forfeiting all rights to the drug or the ability to buy out Biogen Idec’s rights to the drug, and imposing on it “draconian penalties”. It said the consequence would be “irreparable injury”.The litigation was a further setback for Elan, which had been struggling under criticism of its corporate governance and a need to find a partner able to provide it with new funding, pay down debt and continue investment in new drugs without losing control.By negotiating a deal with J&J for less than 20 per cent of its equity, Elan was able to proceed and raise money without having to seek shareholder approval. J&J’s partnership strengthens Elan’s prospects to pursue its experimental Alzheimer’s drugs and vaccine.
73;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-09-04T00:46:20Z;Elan dealt a blow with Biogen ruling;;Elan, the Irish domiciled pharmaceuticals company, suffered a sharp setback in its recapitalisation plans when a US judge ruled on Thursday that a planned $1.5bn deal with Johnson & Johnson violated the terms of an existing partnership with Biogen Idec.Deborah Batts, a Manhattan federal court judge, ruled that Elan had breached the terms of its contract with Biogen Idec for its pivotal multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri and had 23 days to repair the damage.The decision marked a failure in Elan’s strategy to swiftly seek a suspension of Biogen Idec’s demand that the Tysabri contract be renegotiated after claiming that the two companies’ cost and profit sharing deal agreed in 2000 had been breached by the Johnson & Johnson deal unveiled in July.In an interpretation upheld by the court, Biogen Idec argued that a confidential clause in Johnson & Johnson’s contract on assisting Elan with funding in the event of a renegotiation of the Tysabri deal itself constituted a delegation of rights away from Elan.Elan had argued that there was no such delegation as a result of the Johnson & Johnson deal, by which the large US pharmaceutical group took an 18 per cent equity stake and pledged $1.5bn in joint funding for a range of other products.It also claimed that Biogen Idec had not taken up its offer to scrutinise the full text of the confidential funding arrangements with Johnson & Johnson.Judge Batts said that the Johnson & Johnson deal did not result in an assignment of rights away from Elan, but “it would seem there has been a breach of the Biogen Idec collaboration agreement”, paving the way for Biogen Idec to pursue a break-up of its Tysabri pact by a deadline of late September.In its legal filings, Elan had argued that the termination of the partnership would result in Elan forfeiting all rights to Tysabri or the ability to buy out Biogen Idec’s rights to the drug, and imposing on it “draconian penalties”.Elan said that it would result in “irreparable injury”.Elan said in a statement on Thursday: “We respect the court’s decision and the expedited attention in this matter.“We are committed to working with Johnson & Johnson [to] close the transaction as quickly as possible, consistent with the Biogen-Elan Tysabri collaboration agreement.”
74;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Elan starts legal action in drug row with Biogen;;Elan has launched legal action to prevent the “irreparable injury” that would be caused by the collapse of its partnership with Biogen Idec over its pivotal multiple sclerosis drug.The Ireland-based pharmaceuticals company is challenging a claim from Biogen Idec, based in Boston, that Elan’s recent $1.5bn (£893m) deal with Johnson & Johnson placed it in “material breach” of their profit-sharing agreement for Tysabri.In a filing with the US District Court, Elan said it had received a letter from Biogen Idec at the end of last month giving it notice that it was terminating the collaboration agreement first signed to develop and commercialise Tysabri in 2000.That letter gives the two companies 60 days – until late September – to finalise a restructuring of their Tysabri partnership, only days after J&J’s equity investment and funding deal is set to be completed with Elan.Biogen Idec argued that following Elan’s deal with J&J, announced last month, its partner was in “material breach” of the agreement, which is rendered void by any delegation of rights.Shane Cooke, Elan’s chief financial officer, told investors in a conference call last month that J&J had agreed in a confidential aspect of its deal to help finance the purchase of Biogen Idec’s share in Tysabri in the event that there was any change of control.However, in a view that Elan maintained in Thursday’s court filings, Mr Cooke also stressed that the J&J deal did not in itself represent any change in control that would affect the existing Tysabri partnership with Biogen Idec.Elan has since offered to share the full terms of the J&J financing agreement with Biogen Idec, and has now filed them with the court in an attempt to win a ruling that there is no violation.It says in the filing that termination of the partnership would result in Elan forfeiting all rights to Tysabri or the ability to buy out Biogen Idec’s rights to the drug, and imposing on it “draconian penalties”.Elan said on Thursday: “There’s nothing in the pending transaction that is contrary to our collaboration agreement with Biogen Idec for Tysabri …This is the same agreement we have been operating under for the last nine years. It is unfortunate that, because of Biogen Idec’s actions, Elan was left with no alternative but to seek court intervention to protect its interest.”Biogen Idec was unavailable for comment on Thursday night.Shares in Elan closed up 5.5 cents at €5.56 in Dublin.
75;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-07-16T20:40:46Z;US stocks rise in choppy trade;;"US stocks rose close to their highs for the year on Thursday after a late rally pulled the markets out of a range following a choppy morning.The afternoon’s gains were fuelled in part by words from prominently bearish economist Nouriel Roubini that the recession would end this year.That helped overcome early nervousness about the ramifications of a possible bankruptcy by CIT Group, the commercial lender.CIT, which is struggling to fund itself, said there was no “appreciable likelihood” of a government bail-out, leaving the company facing a bankruptcy filing.The shares collapsed 75 per cent to 41 cents, and the effects were felt on the rest of the market.“We might not see the effect of a CIT bankruptcy straight away but, if somebody doesn’t step in to fill the gap they will leave in the market, it will have an effect on medium-sized businesses and so on unemployment,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.This was enough to keep markets subdued during the morning, in spite of a record drop in the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits.Even impressive profits from JPMorgan were not enough to spark an early rally.The bank reported revenues and profits easily above what analysts expected on record income from its investment banking side.The shares fell 0.4 per cent to $36.13 after a weekly gain of over 12 per cent.But stocks pulled out of their range after Mr Roubini’s comments and data showed sentiment among homebuilders rose in June.Homebuilders jumped on the data, with Lennar gaining 4.4 per cent to $9.55 and Pulte Homes picking up 3.9 per cent to $9.02.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.9 per cent at 940.74, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 8,711.82 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.2 per cent to 1,885.03.There was support for the markets from the technology sector, with IBM rising 3.2 per cent to $110.64 as investors bet correctly the company would beat profit estimates when its results were released after the bell.Biogen Idec rose 0.9 per cent to $47.10 after the company managed to increase revenues by 10 per cent from the previous year, boosted by strong sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs.Rival Baxter also beat expectations with its earnings. The company raised its earnings forecast for the year and the shares rose
3.1 per cent to $54.74.The healthcare sector also showed strength, triggered by positive earnings from two biotech companies.But microchip maker Xilinx knocked confidence in the sector after its results disappointed after Tuesday’s strong showing from market leader Intel.Shares in Xilinx fell 1.9 per cent to $20.26 after it warned that profit margins could be squeezed this year even though it beat its estimates for the past quarter.Marriott International also disappointed investors even as it reported net income above what analysts had forecast. The hotel operator’s shares were down 6.2 per cent to $20.44 as the company refused to provide guidance for the next quarter, saying the “current global economic and financial climate continues to make predictions very difficult”.This also knocked shares in rival Starwood Hotels, which dropped 2.8 per cent to $21.13.Mobile handset maker Motorola was a heavy faller, losing 4.2 per cent to $6.33 after European rival Nokia warned of shrinking profit margins amid continued declines in global sales.Harley-Davidson shares were volatile in the morning after the release of its quarterly earnings, dropping to $16.65 before climbing 8.4 per cent to $18.96 as it beat bearish estimates and said it would cut 1,000 more jobs.The gain came even as profits fell 90 per cent and the company warned of “continued weak” consumer spending for discretionary purchases.Meanwhile shares in Mosaic, the fertiliser company, leapt 12.2 per cent to $49.98 after a Brazilian newspaper reported that Vale, the Brazilian iron ore miner, may bid for the company at $56 per share."
76;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-07-01T20:26:38Z;US stocks start quarter on strong note;;"US stocks began the second half of the year on a positive note on Wednesday with shares in prominent food and drink manufacturers leading the market higher.General Mills, which makes Cheerios, reported better profits than expected, lifted by lower commodities prices and strong sales of new brands.The company also raised its forecast for earnings in 2010, and the shares picked up 3.9 per cent to $58.18.Constellation Brands, which owns several alcoholic drinks brands, including Robert Mondavi wines, kept costs sufficiently low to beat profit expectations in spite of falling revenues. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $13.61.A weaker dollar boosted shares in multi-national brands. Coca-Cola, which Credit Suisse had said could soon see double-digit earnings growth, picked up 2.5 per cent to $49.18, while rival Pepsiadvanced 2.8 per cent to $56.52.Elsewhere in the sector, Yum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut and KFC, gained 5 per cent to $35.02 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares, saying its overseas businesses would probably exceed its target of 10 per cent growth in profits.Commodities stocks rallied strongly in the morning but fell back as the price of raw materials dropped during the day. Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold miner, finished 0.9 per cent higher at $50.57.The price of oil briefly rose above $71 a barrel, but then fell back in the afternoon. After a strong morning, Chevron closed 0.4 per cent higher at $66.52 while Exxon Mobil climbed 0.9 per cent to $70.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent higher at 923.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 8,504.06 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.6 per cent to 1,845.72.Investors remained focused on commodities and the dollar rather than economic data released during the morning, including two early indications on job losses.The market initially took confidence from the Challenger jobs report, which said that companies announced 9 per cent fewer job cuts in June than the previous year, the first annual decline in planned cuts since February 2008.This was counterbalanced by data from ADP Employer Services, which said companies cut more jobs than expected in June.Investors also took a near 20 per cent fall in mortgage applications during last week in their stride.“People are starting to dismiss some of the negative data and focus on the positives,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.But with the more closely watched data on initial jobless claims and the official unemployment rate due out this morning, the markets slipped as investors became more cautious.“I was surprised by the reaction to the data this morning,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab. “But people have taken some of the gains off the table as we get closer to Thursday’s unemployment reports.”Pfizer gave up 0.7 per cent to $14.90 after the company said it would not continue a late stage trial of its cancer drug Sutent after disappointing results.But rival Biogen Idec climbed 3.6 per cent to $46.77 after it acquired the rights to market an experimental drug made by Acorda outside the US for a fee that could rise to $550m.An analyst at JPMorgan warned that the deal would make it less likely that Acorda would be taken over however, and its shares fell 14.9 per cent to $23.99.There was further concern for the hotel industry after Barclays said a recovery in lodging stocks would lag behind a broader recovery, and the bank downgraded shares in Choice Hotels.This came the day after Wachovia downgraded Starwood Hotels, saying similarly negative things about demand in the sector.Choice lost 2.3 per cent to $26.01. Starwood added to Tuesday’s losses, falling
4 per cent to $21.31.A second initial public offering in less than a week reinforced optimism about demand for new equity, as shares in LogMeIn, a newly listed software maker, rose 25.1 per cent to $20.02 on its first day of trade."
77;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-06-29T20:45:40Z;Wall Street rally boosted by upgrades;;US equities rallied on Monday as upgrades in the consumer sector and improving energy stocks helped lift stocks after an early droop.Homebuilders were especially strong after Credit Suisse upgraded shares in KB Home, citing a rebound in orders, KB’s shares climbed 5.1 per cent to $14.11 and its rivals also saw some upside. Lennar gained 5.8 per cent to $9.71 and Pulte Homes rose 2.4 per cent to $8.97.Meanwhile retailers also did well, with JC Penney standing out after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company’s shares, saying it is the most likely department store to outperform margin expectations with its second-quarter results.Shares in the retailer rose 1.8 per cent to $28.89.Consumer stocks were joined by the energy sector in providing support as the price of oil rose back above $71 per barrel. Chevron gained 1.4 per cent to $66.88 and ExxonMobil rose 2.2 per cent to $70.58.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Teppco rose 5 per cent to $30.12 after Enterprise Partners said it would buy the pipeline company for $3.3bn, equivalent to $31.36 per share.The S&P finished 0.9 per cent up at 927.23, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 8,529.38 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,844.06.Volumes were low, however, and the markets were more sensitive to the relatively few trades.“Volumes are light ahead of the extended weekend, and many investors are watching out for the unemployment numbers out later this week” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.The reversal came after early weakness from healthcare stocks, led by Biogen Idec, which ended lower after it said a 10th patient had developed a potentially deadly brain disease after taking its multiple sclerosis drug. The shares lost 5.5 per cent to $47.23.There were some positive signs for banks, which reports suggest have made strong profits this quarter on the back of booming equity and debt issuance.Morgan Stanley rose 1.7 per cent to $29.10 and Goldman Sachs picked up 1.8 per cent to $149.36, with just one more session until the end of the quarter.Sentiment was also boosted by words from Christina Romer, chairman of the president’s council of economic advisers.She told the Financial Times the US economy would feel a substantial boost from the Obama administration’s emergency spending package over the next few months.These rises came in spite of negative economic data from two regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Chicago Fed said US economic activity remained at very low levels in May, while the Dallas Fed said manufacturing activity in that area has fallen more than expected during June.“Many of the data points recently have been mixed,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “But after the S&P hit 890, investors started to put in some of the cash they’ve been sitting on.”Alcoa, the aluminium maker, underperformed other materials stocks after analysts at FBR said the aluminium market was over-supplied, and downgraded the company’s shares. The stock lost 3 per cent to $10.44.Technology stocks made gains, with Microsoft picking up 2.2 per cent to $23.86 on news that the company is looking for a buyer for Razorfish, its digital agency, which one analyst valued at up to $700m.Investors also seemed reassured about the status of Oracle‘s deal to buy Sun Microsystems, even though the US Justice Department has asked Sun for more details about its flagship Java software before approving the takeover.A lawyer for Oracle said last week he does not expect the deal to be delayed, and shares in Sun rose 1.9 per cent to $9.18 on Monday, while Oracle gained 1.2 per cent to $21.50.Meanwhile the annual rebalancing of the Russell indices created some turbulence, with companies that moved up from the small- to mid-sized 2000 index to the large-cap 1000 index faring particularly well.Netflix, the online dvd rental company, gained 2.1 per cent to $41.20 while Interactive Brokers rose 1.6 per cent to $15.49.
78;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Sanofi-Aventis reports earnings up 17%;;Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceuticals company, on Wednesday posted earnings up 17 per cent as it expressed interest in future acquisitions and unveiled a cull of its pipeline designed to focus on the most promising experimental medicines for patients and profits.Chris Viehbacher, the chief executive appointed in December, said he had cancelled 14 drugs currently being tested in humans, while leaving 51. ”I feel a whole lot more comfortable about the quality,” he said.He said the decision followed a detailed review of research and development designed to add ”a much cleverer definition of value to patients and the overall economic value to the company” to criteria for assessing whether to pursue new drugs.The action marks a shift for Sanofi-Aventis, which Mr Viehbacher characterised as previously being focused more on scientific merit and the technical probability of successful regulatory approval. ”We’ve got the whole company behind these projects,” he said.In spite of continuing investor concern about patent expiries on existing medicines and the ability of the company to successfully development replacements, Mr Viehbacher said he felt four late-stage remaining drugs reflected ”a good healthy number” and stressed continuing deals to help strengthen in-house capacity.In an indication of his expansion plans in the company’s core prescription business, he said he hoped to expand biological medicines from 15 per cent to closer to 50 per cent of projects.He expressed interest in expanding in animal health, a niche in which it currently operates via Merial, a joint venture with Merck of the US, and which could expand following Merck’s acquisition of Schering-Plough, which also has a large animal health business.He added that he would ”never say never” to large-scale deals if they offered value to shareholders, adding that the €500m range of the acquisitions he had co-ordinated so far was ”not necessarily indicative of where we’re going to go.”However, he stressed that ”people are having trouble finding a value proposition” with Bristol Myers Squibb and Biogen Idec, two US companies with which Sanofi-Aventis has been linked as a possible purchaser.Sanofi-Aventis’s adjusted earnings per share, excluding selected items, in constant currency terms were up 10 per cent to €1.67, or 17 per cent as reported, on sales up 2.5 per cent to €7bn as reported. It gave guidance for at least a 7 per cent earnings per share rise for 2009 ahead of currency fluctuations. Net income was €2.2bn.
79;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-04-17T20:52:31Z;Citi and GE set positive tone for Wall St;;US stocks gained further ground on Friday, completing their sixth straight week of rises for the first time since the market peaked in late 2007.Positive results from Citigroup and General Electric helped bolster confidence during a choppy morning’s trade on Friday, before positive words on the housing market from BB&T, the regional bank, gave the rally impetus.Citigroup reported a trading profit for the first time in six quarters. That translated into a loss per share after a reset in the price of convertible preferred stock in January but the loss was narrower than expected.Much of that performance appeared to have already been priced in, with Vikram Pandit, Citi chief executive, having said the company enjoyed a profitable January and February. Citi’s shares fell 9 per cent to $3.65.But other banks performed better as investors took their lead from BB&T, which surprised the market with its earnings.The company said housing markets in Florida, Georgia and Washington are stabilising, one of the key signs for improving health in financial companies.Its shares jumped 11.2 per cent to $23.42. This gave further momentum to the sector after Regions Financial surged in the previous session, having said it was profitable in the first quarter. Regions continued those gains on Friday, rising 7.9 per cent to $7.23.Bank of America, meanwhile, picked up 2.5 per cent to $10.60 and Wells Fargo gained 4.2 per cent to $20.26.JPMorgan continued Thursday’s advance after reporting better results than expected, rising 0.1 per cent to $33.26.General Electric unveiled a higher profit than expected, helped by good performance in its energy operations, which counteracted rising consumer defaults in its finance arm, GE Capital. GE’s shares erased early losses to end 1 per cent higher at $12.39.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.5 per cent to 869.60 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.1 per cent to 8,131.33 points. The Nasdaq Composite index erased early losses as the market digested results from Google, and closed 0.2 per cent up at 1,673.07 points.All three main market measures made weekly gains of between 0.5 and 1.6 per cent after a week of fluctuations as investors weighed results from some of the biggest US corporate names, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Intel.“If the majority of investors believe the rally has gone too far, it is sure to go further,” said David Kreinces, portfolio manager at ETF PM. “I think the S&P has a good shot at 900 before it sees some pull back.”Google rose sharply before the close in the previous session, with investors betting on better results than predicted. It continued those gains on Friday after profit was confirmed to have beaten forecasts. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $392.24.Other technology companies joined Thursday’s rally but many lost ground on Friday as investors accounted for the fact that Google’s performance came more from cost-cutting measures than strong revenues.Microsoft lost 2.8 per cent to $19.20 and Intel gave up 1.8 per cent to $15.60.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Biogen, the drug company, beat analysts’ expectations by recording a profit of $1.05 per share. But its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $50.09 as weak demand led to falling sales of its brand name drugs.Mattel, the toymaker, reported a heavier loss than predicted as retailers cut back on inventories amid falling consumer demand.However, its shares rose 15.2 per cent to $15.01 as investors took confidence from the company’s better profit margins.“There is still a fair amount of cash on the sidelines with hedge funds and institutional investors,” said Bill Knapp, investment strategist for MainStay Investments. “But for every day the rally continues, another investor joins in and makes it stronger.”
80;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-04-09T13:54:35Z;Biogen chief denies search for investor;;The head of Biogen-Idec, the Boston-based biotech group subject to intensifying takeover speculation, has denied that his company is in talks with another pharmaceutical company or that he needs any such deal.Shortly before rumours of a bid sparked a fresh rise in the share price, James Mullen, chief executive of Biogen, told the FT that he did not need access to capital or a strategic partner.He said: “We’ve got a decent sized company and a reputation for good science. We’re in good shape, with scale and global representation. I would not say we would not think about having a partner, but a broad partner is not needed at the moment.”He stressed that the company had $2.4bn of cash on its balance sheet and current cash generation was in excess $1bn.Biogen is currently in a proxy battle with activist shareholder Carl Icahn, whose proposal to limit the number of directors on the board has been rejected by the company.Mr Mullen said: ”It typically takes one year to recruit a qualified director, and one year more to learn about the business. There’s an advantage to being able to go up and down.”He said that Biogen “would be interested” if there is a possibility to renegotiate with Elan their 50:50 cost and sales sharing agreement over Tysabri, a treatment for multiple sclerosis which is being developed for Crohns disease and oncology.But he said there were no current talks about changing the arrangement, which could be modified by mutual consent or if there was a change in control in either company.Biogen said it would not comment on specific rumours around mergers and acquisitions.
81;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;A dose of pharmaceutical competitiveness;;"Last December, only weeks after Barack Obama had won the race for the US presidency, Richard Clark, the head of Merck, arranged a meeting with Fred Hassan, his opposite number at Schering-Plough.In the world of pharmaceuticals, the meeting would mark a significant change of era. The two men’s offices are a few miles apart in New Jersey, historic centre of gravity of the US industry, and their companies have similarities and a history of co-operation.But, for Merck, the proposal was radical. In spite of its decades-long tradition
of “going it alone”, with research and development largely done by in-house scientists, Mr Clark suggested a merger. The move produced Monday’s $41bn deal to buy Schering-Plough.The transaction, in the wake of Pfizer’s $68bn take­over of Wyeth unveiled in January, and Roche’s ongoing $46bn hostile buy-out of minorities at Genentech, could trigger further consolidation in the sector.For Merck, there is a clear logic. Like other large groups, it faces patent expiries on existing drugs and is struggling to find replacements. With the downturn driving down cash returns and depressing equity valuations, it is an attractive time to do a deal.Joining pipelines improves prospects of bringing drugs under development to market, while diversifying into less profitable but less uncertain products, such as over-the-counter medicines and animal health.The combination allows Merck to reduce costs, with planned annual savings of $3.5bn from 2011.It has already co-operated with Schering-Plough, notably in the development of Vytorin, a medicine to lower cholesterol. “We’ve always been impressed with Fred’s leadership and our two cultures are very similar,” says Mr Clark.The key question, which explained the lengthy negotiations before the deal’s announcement, was price. The company was being courted by another New Jersey peer, Johnson & Johnson, which some analysts argue was a closer fit.Schering-Plough has a healthier pipeline of drugs in development than many groups, and is under less pressure from patent expiries. But Mr Hassan says: “We were in line with our strategic plan and doing well with good growth, but the changes in the macro environment have changed every­thing. There are rising hurdles to get new products approved, and more and more large-scale trials. You have to have more staying power, and size helps.”The final shape of the deal is not yet clear. Schering-Plough technically acquires Merck, although the latter is clearly the dominant partner.A primary aim was to avoid triggering a “change in ownership” clause, which would have forced Schering-Plough to hand over its joint development of Remicade to its partner Johnson & Johnson. That clause may yet be contested.Peter Kim, Merck’s head of research and development, argues that while there is
a strong fit between the medicines on which the two companies were working, there are very few duplications or overlaps that would spur antitrust regulators to demand sell-offs.Merck could either combine or sell off the two animal health businesses, for instance. In any case, its management will face considerable distractions as it attempts to combine the companies – a process for which it has little experience on which to draw.A broader question is how far the deal – or the forces that drove it – will lead to still more consolidation in the sector. “These things always come in threes,” one large institutional investor said on Monday. “Valuations are not high and it’s a very good time to act.”Mr Obama’s commitments to healthcare reform suggest there is likely to be further pressure to cut medicine prices, compounding existing long-term trends. And getting drugs through the regulators is becoming more difficult and costly.Bristol-Myers Squibb could be next, with interest from both AstraZeneca of the UK and Sanofi-Aventis of France – both of which are partners with the US company in drug development. Amgen and Biogen Idec are also cited. “The problem is we are running short of buyers,” the investor said."
82;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-02-01T23:32:40Z;Sanofi to join Pfizer on acquisition trail;;Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceuticals company, is gearing up for acquisitions to expand and diversify operations under its new chief executive.In the wake of Pfizer’s $68bn takeover of Wyeth last week, Sanofi-Aventis has held talks with bankers about possible deals.The move would mark the latest in a spurt of consolidation in the pharmaceuticals sector, at a time when the short-term financial strength of some of the larger companies provides opportunities to address long-term structural problems.In a presentation to staff last Friday ahead of his first public statement when the company announces full-year results next week, Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi-Aventis’s chief executive, indicated that he was interested in acquisitions to both expand and diversify its range of businesses.Mr Viehbacher, who was hired last autumn from GlaxoSmithKline after Sanofi-Aventis dismissed Gerard Le Fur, is keen to make his mark with a similar but still bolder version of the strategy adopted by Andrew Witty, who beat him to the top job at GSK in late 2007.UBS estimates that Sanofi-Aventis could raise €17bn-€20bn ($22bn-$26bn). The company reported third-quarter cash-flow generation of €1.9bn, against a backdrop of falling debt.Bristol Myers Squibb – which had previously been considered a merger partner and with which Sanofi-Aventis jointly controls the rights to the blood-thinning blockbuster Plavix – is one takeover option. Other US targets frequently discussed Amgen and Biogen Idec, which would help diversify its portfolio. But there are also several niche companies in which Sanofi-Aventis may take an interest, including generic drugs companies Actavis and Ratiopharm, and Crucell, the last significant independent vaccine maker.A number of large pharmaceuticals companies held back awaiting Pfizer’s move, fearing otherwise that they would be drawn into expensive bidding wars.With Pfizer’s management time and cash now committed to Wyeth, Roche freshly launched on a $42bn hostile bid for Genentech, and other large companies such as Novartis, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca already absorbing recent acquisitions, the field of rivals has suddenly narrowed.GSK looks set to extend its cost-cutting programme, including thousands of redundancies, in the latest industry response to increased competition from generic drugs manufacturers.
83;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-01-27T00:26:19Z;Pfizer seals $68bn Wyeth purchase;;Pfizer on Monday unveiled a $68bn takeover of Wyeth, reasserting its flagging position as the world’s largest pharmaceuticals group and paving the way for a fresh bout of consolidation across the sector.The acquisition – to be paid for using equal amounts of cash, equity and debt – creates a group with $71bn in sales from a broad range of products and plans to save $4bn in annual operating costs by cutting 15 per cent of its combined workforce.Pfizer had been under growing investor pressure to boost its performance as a series of top-selling drugs come off patent, led by the loss of exclusivity in 2011 of Lipitor, the cholesterol-lowering medicine that contributes a quarter of current annual sales.In a sign of its difficulties, the company reported a 4 per cent fall in fourth-quarter sales to $12.4bn and a 90 per cent drop in net income to $266m after a $2.3bn settlement with the US ­district attorney of Massachusetts probing its marketing ­practices for painkiller Bextra.The scale of the new group and the restructuring it will trigger are likely to spark other pharma­ceuticals mergers and acquisitions that have been held back while waiting for Pfizer.Bankers said that the transaction would also boost confidence by demonstrating that cash-rich companies could still find opportunities amid the market turmoil.“This is the first time in months that we have seen an old-fashioned M&A deal, complete with financing and it has cheered the market,” one banker said.The deal is the eighth-largest M&A involving a US target, according to Thomson Reuters, which estimated that the seven advising banks could earn as much as $150m in fees.It is also the third largest globally in the sector after Pfizer’s $89bn acquisition of Warner Lambert in 1999 and the $79bn GlaxoSmithKline merger in 2000.Jeffrey Kindler, Pfizer’s chief executive, said: “The combination of Pfizer and Wyeth provides a powerful opportunity to transform our industry …This is a very positive sign for the American economy and American business, and shows that the banks are doing what they are supposed to be doing.”Sanofi-Aventis, of France, which appointed a new chief executive, is among rivals likely to launch takeovers, while long-cited targets include Biogen Idec, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Amgen.

Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
86;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-01-14T19:03:04Z;Elan;;"Elan, Ireland’s biggest biotechnology company, is stuck in a thicket. The neurological disease specialist needs cash to pay down debt and put new drugs through costly clinical trials. But sales of its main cash cow, the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, have struggled to hit $1bn thanks in part to its association with a deadly brain disease. Facing pressure from shareholders, who have suffered a 70 per cent fall in share price since July, the company has hired Citigroup to review its strategic options.Elan, which also has an Alzheimer’s drug in late-stage trials, could make a tempting target for a drugmaker eager to fill its research pipeline. But there are obstacles to an outright sale. Elan brought Tysabri to market in partnership with Biogen Idec, which has the right to acquire the drug following a change of ownership. That would deprive potential buyers of a key Elan asset. Some shareholders have also argued against a sale, saying the slide in Elan’s shares could make it difficult to secure a fair price.A partnership, with a rival offering cash and marketing muscle in return for a share of the profits on future treatments, might be more palatable. But such deals have risks. Jack Schuler, a big Elan shareholder, has argued that Biogen’s sales team has little incentive to promote Tysabri aggressively because it competes with Avonex, Biogen’s own market-leading multiple sclerosis treatment.Elan dismisses that argument. But if Mr Schuler is right, one solution might be to sell Biogen a minority stake in Elan. Part-ownership in the company would give Biogen a stronger incentive to maximise Tysabri sales, while providing Elan with funds for further research and development. An investment by Wyeth, a partner on Elan’s most advanced Alzheimer’s drug, could also help Elan out of a tight spot.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

87;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2009-01-13T15:25:51Z;Elan hires Citigroup to weigh sale;;Elan Corporation has hired Citigroup to conduct a strategic review of the company that could result in a merger or sale, the Irish drug maker said on Tuesday.Shares in the company initially rallied strongly as investors bet on the possibility of a takeover, although on Monday of this week the company explicitly denied it was in talks with Pfizer of the US.“The goal is to secure access to the necessary financial resources and commercial infrastructure to allow Elan to accelerate the development and commercialization of its extensive pipeline and product portfolio,” the company said in a statement.“The range of alternatives that will be assessed could include minority investment or strategic alliance, a merger or sale.”Carlos Paya, president of Elan, said that of those options, the group would prefer for a large company, likely a major pharmaceutical group, to take an equity stake.“Both the management team and board of Elan would ideally prefer to have a minority investment from a company that would have both the financial backing to provide the additional liquidity to keep the pipeline moving, as well as bringing a strong commercial organisation to help maximise the potential revenue from that pipeline,” Mr Paya said.Elan’s share price has fallen by more than 70 per cent since July, after its lead product Tysabri, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis, was linked to a potentially lethal brain disease.The stock has also been dragged lower by mixed results from clinical trials of Bapineuzumab, an Alzheimer’s drug now in the final stage of clinical trials that it is developing with US group Wyeth.Leading shareholders have expressed frustration with management strategy, in particular with relation to the marketing of Tysabri, and one major shareholder has even called for the resignation of Kelly Martin, Elan’s chief executive.“I think that what’s been seen on the sales [of Tysabri] is impressive despite those potential side effects,” said Mr Paya.“Working even harder in the future on how we can put [in place] the right risk-benefit for patients who could take Tysabri would make it even more successful.”The choice of Citigroup to lead this strategic review marks a change from last August, when Elan asked Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs to conduct a strategic review of its development and manufacturing division with a view to potentially selling the division. In October, Elan said it would not be selling the division after all.”Elan works with a number of advisers, and we use different banks for different projects,” said Shane Cooke, Elan’s chief financial officer.“We believe Citigroup is well placed to advise Elan on a broad strategic review of the kind announced today.”After the initial sharp rally Elan’s shares gave up most of those gains after Biogen, its US partner on Tysabri, said the number of patients taking the drug had slowed in the third quarter. Elan closed 1 per cent higher at €6.11.
88;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2008-08-01T21:27:45Z;Elan hit after drug linked to brain disease;;Shares in Elan lost almost half their value on Friday after Tysabri, the Irish pharmaceutical company’s leading drug, was linked to a potentially lethal brain disease.The news comes as a fresh blow to the company whose shares plunged this week when Elan reported mixed results from its mid-stage trial of Bapineuzumab, an Alzheimer’s drug being developed with Wyeth.Elan, which markets Tysabri with the US’s Biogen Idec, confirmed that two European patients who had been using the drug had contracted progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a viral condition that occurs in people with depressed immune systems.One patient is clinically stable and at home, but the second patient is in hospital.Elan said it was maintaining its patient target of 100,000 for Tysabri by 2010 and added that the drug would stay on the market.Tysabri was approved for treatment for MS sufferers in the US and in Europe but was taken off the US market in 2005 because of three multifocal leukoencephalopathy cases.However, the drug returned to the market in 2006 with tougher prescription guidelines after MS patients demanded it be brought back, citing its effectiveness in treating the symptoms of the disease.Patients have been warned that Tysabri carries a 1-in-1,000 risk of developing the life-threatening infection.There are 31,800 patients on Tysabri globally and 6,600 of them have been on it for at least 18 months, according to Elan. In the second quarter of this year the drug generated $200m (£101m) in sales.Ian Hunter, an analyst at Goodbody, said: “If this is an isolated reaction, the share price should tick back up. But the downside is that this is the start of more cases. There is uncertainty.“We have to now wait and see,” said Mr Hunter. “In the US, physicians will probably continue to enrol patients but in Europe they may be more cautious.” Several analysts have downgraded their share price targets.Elan has hired Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs to carry out a strategic review of its development and manufacturing division, which could see the business floated or sold with a price tag of up to $1.5bn.Elan, which is one of the largest stocks on the Irish stock market, fell 43 per cent, or €5.6, to €7.35.
89;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2008-08-01T20:56:51Z;US stocks fall as investors digest jobs data;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second session on Friday, and trimmed already modest weekly gains, as investors wrestled with downbeat jobs data, poor results from General Motors and a bump in the price of oil.The latest employment report from the Labor Department showed that the US economy shed jobs for a seventh successive month in July, although the decline was slightly smaller than expected. The unemployment rate rose from 5.5 per cent in June to 5.7 per cent – the highest level since March 2004.Poor results from GM, the largest carmaker in the US, added to the losses. The company said it had made a second-quarter loss of $15.5bn, four times larger than analysts expected, because of the cost of labour disputes and a slump in domestic sales.A bump in the price of oil added to the pressure. GM shares fell 7.6 per cent to $10.27. Ford shares dipped 3.1 per cent to $4.65.By the close nine of the 10 leading industry groups were in the red, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent to 1,260.31 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 11,326.32 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,310.96 points.Over a volatile week, the Dow edged down 0.3 per cent, the Nasdaq held its ground and the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent due to mixed second-quarter earnings, a decline in the price of oil and some weak data on growth, home prices and employment.Stu Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “You could be asking why markets are holding up as well as they are in the face of all of this . . . the S&P 500 was down around 1,200 a few weeks ago and here we are at 1,250 or so. I think a lot of the bad news is already discounted in the market.”S&P 500 company second-quarter profits have fallen 20 per cent on average compared to a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. Profits have slumped about 82 per cent at financials and more than 100 per cent at consumer discretionary companies while energy company profits have grown by 18 per cent. Excluding financials, average earnings on the S&P 500 rose 3 per cent.On Friday, financials were the only gainers as strength in the investment banking sector offset some bad news from exchanges. NYSE Euronext slid 12.9 per cent to $41.15 after it posted second-quarter profits that undershot ambitious analyst estimates.The shares in CME, another exchange operator dropped 7.6 per cent to $332.94 after it said that July daily average trading volume had fallen compared to a year ago.The financial sector as a whole made a late run to take its gain for the week to 4 per cent after Merrill Lynch announced asset sales and capital raising and the markets concluded that the results season had averted worst-case scenarios.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “Overall, the US banks reported weak but not disastrous second-quarter results, and the markets breathed a sigh of relief.”For much of the session the energy sector was the only one to advance, but disappointing results from Chesapeake Energy, an independent natural-gas producer, and Chevron, the oil producer, eventually took their toll. Chesapeake lost 1.9 per cent to $49.22, Chevron dipped 0.3 per cent to $84.31, and the sector fell 0.4 per cent.Material stocks also fared poorly, hit by new data showing US manufacturing activity stagnated in July. Metals stocks led the materials sector down 2.6 per cent. Titanium Metals dropped 6.8 per cent to $10.50, Nucor fell 6 per cent to $54.78 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 5.6 per cent to $91.31.In healthcare, renewed safety concerns about Biogen Idec’s multiple sclerosis drug weighed on the sector. Biogen slumped 28.3 per cent to $50.01 while the sector gave up 1 per cent.In technology, poor results from Sun Microsystems, weighed on the sector. The maker of server computers said profit fell 73 per cent. Shares retreated 12.3 per cent to $9.32. The sector dipped 0.6 per cent.
90;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2008-07-31T22:39:07Z;Bristol-Myers in $4.5bn Imclone offer;;Bristol-Myers Squibb offered on Thursday to buy the 83 per cent of ImClone it does not already own for $4.5bn, leaving Carl Icahn, the chairman of the biotechnology company, to decide whether to negotiate over a deal.The $60 a share all-cash offer values ImClone at about $5.2bn and represents a 29 per cent premium to its closing share price on Wednesday.Bristol-Myers is already ImClone’s largest shareholder, with 16.6 per cent of its outstanding shares. The two companies have jointly produced Erbitux, the blockbuster cancer drug, since 2001, when Bristol-Myers agreed to pay $1bn, or $70 a share, for a 19.9 per cent stake in ImClone. The company’s share price dropped below $7 a year later.The offer handed Mr Icahn a financial boost, but his fund was later dealt a blow when Biogen Idec said two multiple sclerosis patients taking its key drug, Tysabri, had been diagnosed with an often fatal brain disorder linked to the drug. Shares of Biogen, which is 3.4 per cent owned by Mr Icahn’s fund, plunged 20 per cent after hours, depleting his stake’s value by $139m.Erbitux is, similarly, Imclone’s only significant product, and the companies have been testing the drug against lung and other types of tumour to broaden its use. Global sales of the drug rose by a third to $423.3m in the company’s second quarter compared with the same period in 2007.Bristol-Myers pays ImClone 39 per cent of its North American net sales of Erbitux. A merger would give Bristol-Myers full access to the Erbitux revenue stream. But ImClone’s worth also lies in its pipeline of drugs in earlier-stage development.James Cornelius, Bristol-Myers’ chief, called Mr Icahn, who arrived at ImClone’s helm after a bitter battle in 2006, and left a message on Thursday morning to confirm the offer. It was not clear whether the two had spoken, one insider said.Icahn Associates, which owns 13.5 per cent of ImClone, had not responded publicly to the offer by last night. Shares in ImClone jumped 37 per cent to $63.93 as investors bet Mr Icahn would require an incremental boost to Bristol’s bid before agreeing to a deal.ImClone gained notoriety in 2002 when Sam Waksal, its former chief executive, was jailed for insider trading for selling shares in the company shortly before an announcement that the US Food and Drug Administration had rejected its initial application for Erbitux.Martha Stewart, the founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, spent five months in prison for lying to federal investigators who were looking into her sale of ImClone stock.Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Global Markets and Credit Suisse Securities are acting as financial advisers to Bristol-Myers Squibb. Cravath, Swaine & Moore is providing legal counsel.
91;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2008-07-31T18:19:19Z;Bristol Myers/Imclone;;Time to beef up that revenue stream. Bristol-Myers Squibb on Thursday became the latest big pharma company to bid for a smaller rival. It offered $60 per share for ImClone Systems, the New York biotech company chaired by activist investor Carl Icahn. Bristol-Myers already owns 17 per cent of ImClone and shares the US marketing rights for its colon cancer drug, Erbitux, so the all-cash offer amounts to $4.5bn for the remaining shares.Bristol-Myers says the offer is part of its “string of pearls” strategy to sell off its non-drug assets and buy companies and licences that strengthen its offerings in higher-priced speciality drugs. ImClone’s attraction lies in Erbitux’s potential to treat other cancers. It also has several other compounds in early testing. Bristol-Myers, like most of its competitors, is facing a “patent cliff”. Drugs representing about 30 per cent of its 2007 pharma revenue will lose patent protection by the end of 2012, according to Lehman Brothers.There was no immediate response from Mr Icahn. But ImClone shareholders, who have seen a spate of recent drug company deals, may want more than the 29 per cent premium Bristol-Myers is offering over Wednesday’s close. Mr Icahn, after all, is known for driving a hard bargain, and rival drug company Sanofi-Aventis just agreed to pay a 64 per cent premium for Acambis, its vaccine partner.But Mr Icahn is not infallible, particularly in the biotech sector. When he pressured the management of Biogen Idec to put itself up for sale last autumn, the company failed to find a buyer. Shareholders then rejected Mr Icahn’s bid to put three supporters on Biogen’s board.ImClone’s share price rose 38 per cent on Thursday, to $64, above the Bristol-Myers bid. Investors should be wary of overreaching. Mr Icahn, who appears to have bought in when ImClone was priced below $30 a share, has already doubled his money.Post and read comments on this Lex
92;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2008-07-08T20:37:10Z;Wall Street rallies in late trade;;Wall Street stocks rallied the most in over a month on Tuesday, bouncing back from bear market territory as falling commodity prices boosted consumer facing stocks and financials roared ahead.Oil was the prime mover on Tuesday, falling about $6 a barrel and dropping below $137 a barrel.That retreat, and some new data showing that tax rebates continue to fuel spending helped consumer-facing stocks. Gap added 5.6 per cent to $16.75 and Ford rose 9.6 per cent to $4.90 while the consumer discretionary sector advanced 2.2 per cent.Office Depot, however, was a weak spot, dropping 31.6 per cent to $7.08 after it said North American same-store sales fell nearly 10 per cent in the second quarter and it warned on operating margins.Consumer staples also fared well, climbing 1.5 per cent. SuperValu rose 5 per cent to $32.67 while Wal-Mart rose 3.9 per cent to $59.11.Results from Pepsi Bottling Group took some of the shine off the sector, however. The company posted second-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations but investors were unimpressed, trimming the share price by 2.7 per cent to $27.88.Industrials and healthcare stocks also advanced, adding 0.7 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.An analyst upgrade boosted United Parcel Service 4.3 per cent to $60.40 while falling oil prices helped other transport-related stocks gain.GE climbed 3.5 per cent to $28.06, CSX advanced 6.9 per cent to $60.79 and Ryder System rose 4.4 per cent to $70.08.In healthcare sector, stocks rallied a day after S&P equity strategists upgraded the group to “market weight” arguing that with equity volatility likely to remain elevated and valuations low, “investors will re-focus on healthcare’s defensive qualities, allowing for better relative performance. ”Schering-Plough was among the leading gainers, climbing 4.6 per cent to $20.86 after it said its experimental treatment for infertility had met its main goals in a late-stage study.Biogen Idec and Abbott Laboratories gained 6.9 per cent to $62.94 and 5.9 per cent to $57.37 respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day up 1.7 per cent at 1,273.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 11,384.21 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3 per cent at 2,294.42. Both indices moved out of bear market territory.Financials stocks climbed sharply, adding 5.7 per cent for their biggest one day gain since early April. The Federal Reserve chairman suggested the central bank would give investment banks access to emergency cash into 2009 while the chief executive of JP Morgan said credit losses would ease.The news offered the sector some consolation after a volatile start to the week in which they re-tested five year lows.The most heavily sold stocks made the strongest advances. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Washington Mutual jumped, soaring 11.9 per cent to $17.62, 13 per cent to $13.64 and 16.8 per cent to $5.99 respectively.On Monday a wave of speculation that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government sponsored mortgage entities, might have to raise capital to retain their triple A credit ratings triggered heavy selling .In spite of Ben Bernanke’s soothing comments, there were some moments of excitement.IndyMac Bancorp provided the most spectacular of those, plummeting 38 per cent to $0.44. The California mortgage specialist said it did not have enough capital to offer new home loans and an analyst said shareholders may be wiped out.Energy stocks crumpled in response to the falling oil prices however. The sector fell 1.6 per cent and is now on the brink of a correction from its May highs, down about 9 per cent..Exxon Mobil fell 1.2 per cent to $85.94 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.3 per cent to $89.15.Still, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, warned: “It is a passing thing. I don’t think we are going to get a real break in energy prices until the fourth quarter when prices are seasonally weak and some Fed rate hikes take effect.”The materials sector fared little better, losing 0.6 per cent as commodity prices slipped back and investors worried that a global economic downturn would hurt demand. US Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $150.55 while Nucor lost 4.4 per cent to $63.16.
93;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2008-04-24T02:21:37Z;Life sciences: Culture of growth;;“Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one’s living at it,” quipped Albert Einstein.Scientists round the country may be nodding their heads in agreement given the poor state of the markets and the resulting difficulty in securing funding for drug development.But this sentiment will be acutely felt in the south-east of England, in particular in the Thames Valley, which has historically been home to a large concentration of life science companies, notably biotechnology start-ups.Jeff Alexander, executive director for global competitiveness at the South East England Development Agency, says: “The Thames Valley is home to companies including Bayer, Wyeth and Celltech. Winnersh Triangle near Reading has seen a growth of companies in the life science sector over the past few years.”Home to one of the country’s largest life science clusters, the Thames Valley boasts more than 140 businesses focusing on pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food, healthcare or agriculture.The area’s draw is undoubtedly its proximity to London, its highly-skilled population and easy access to regulatory and national research bodies. Research- intensive universities in the area are prestigious and include the University of Reading, Oxford University and, at the south-east edge of the region, Royal Holloway.One focal point of life science activity is the Oxford Science Park, which began life as an innovation centre and is located four miles from Oxford city centre. It is home to about 60 companies, of which the majority are in biotechnology.Biotechnology companies are small and rely on a limited number of technology successes. Landlords can see them as high-risk tenants if they do not have a government grant or the backing of a big pharmaceutical company.Instead of offering long leases, Oxford Science Park, which was developed and is owned by Prudential Property Investment Management and Magdalen College, offers space on a rolling monthly basis to give tenants the flexibility to vacate in 30 days.Rents include service charges and running costs so expenses are accounted for in one lump sum.The park is now thriving as a centre of excellence, with more than 530,000 sq ft of office and laboratory space. Oxford BioMedica, a well-known UK biotech company which spun out of Oxford University, has been based there since 1997.“It is always good to be close to an academic centre of excellence when you are in high-technology science,” says Alan Kingsman, chief executive of Oxford BioMedica.“Think of the biotech centres around Boston/Cambridge, NIH in Bethesda, San Francisco and San Diego – all major centres of academic bioscience and all major biotech company clusters.”The association with Oxford University gives the company a clear public relations advantage. And both the City of London and Heathrow are easily accessible. “The business is global and so international travel is important,” says Prof Kingsman.Shire, the FTSE 100 pharmaceutical group, has its roots firmly in the Thames Valley – in the Hampshire International Business Park at Basingstoke.“The area has a large skill base without there being too much competition. For example we are not so close to Oxford that we have people poaching our people,” says Jessica Mann, spokesperson for the company.“International travel is very easy. That is very important because of our global network. We can get on a plane and see regulators quickly. We spend a lot of time with the US Food and Drug Administration and we can do this easily.”Ms Mann adds that the location represents good value for money as Shire can expand its premises cheaply compared with central London.GlaxoSmithKline is one of the few large multinational pharmaceutical companies to have a serious presence in the Thames Valley. Its headquarters sit on the Great West Road, are 660,00 sq ft and hold 3,000 staff. Situated between Heathrow and Hammersmith in West London, GSK sits on a “power corridor” – a strip that has also been chosen as prime real estate by Sky TV, Gillette, Samsung, GE and Mercedes.The list of other large healthcare companies which have a presence in the Thames Valley is long and includes: Eli Lilly, Baxter Healthcare, GE Healthcare, Johnson & Johnson, UCB, Abbot Laboratories, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lonza Biologics and Reckitt Benckiser.“Good travel links, space for start-ups and growth of biotech, the interchange of people between academia and industry, and a flourishing commercial environment that rewards innovation are needed to continue to develop the biomedical science base in and around London Cambridge and Oxford,” says Patrick Vallance, senior vice-president for drug discovery at GSK.”This golden triangle of opportunity provides a world class talent pool and creative environment which is important for the health and vibrancy of the biotech sector.”Biotechnology companies in the Thames Valley include Avidex MediGene, Celgene, Biogen Ide c and Piramed.

Biogen has said it has a $10bn war chest and is eyeing acquisitions in the coming months.Genmab has denied it is in takeover talks.Wider European markets started the week on a sour note as the aftershocks of the fraud scandal at Société Générale and growing fears of a global economic slowdown weighed on shares. The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1 per cent to 1,317.15. “There is still a lot of uncertainty out there and a lot of fear. Markets remain volatile,” said Jimmy Yates, head of European trading at CMC markets.US sales of new homes in December dropped to their lowest level in almost 13 years, missing forecasts, stoking fears of a recession and driving cyclicals down.Industrial metals were tarnished with Sweden’s SSAB B-shares down 4.2 per cent to SKr139.50, Austria’s Voestalpine down 3.1 per cent to €42 and Germany’s Salzgitter down 2.6 per cent to €94.45.Worries about the troubled financial sector continued to affect sentiment, as the rally that drove markets upward at the end of last week gave way to gnawing concerns about the health of banks’ balance sheets.SocGen led the fall, tumbling 9.6 per cent to a low of €66.80 before closing down 3.8 per cent lat €71.05 as Citigroup slashed its recommendation on the stock from medium-risk “buy” to a high-risk “sell” calling the French bank “a fading star”.The investment banking operation would perform poorly and a €5.5bn rights issue to repair its balance sheet in the wake of the alleged fraud would weigh on the stock, the brokerage said.“The €5.5bn rights issue is set to come at a deep discount, diluting earnings,” said Citigroup analyst Kimon Kalamboussis, adding the company’s risk appetite would be diminished.Keefe, Bruyette and Woods said SocGen had been “terminally wounded” and was heading for a break-up in the manner of Dutch bank ABN.Irish banks slid after UBS said asset price depreciation in Ireland’s commercial property sector posed a growing risk to balance sheets, downgrading Anglo-Irish Bank and Allied Irish Banks from “neutral” to “sell”. Anglo Irish slid 3.9 per cent to €9.5, AIB slipped 4.8 per cent to €15.21.Austria’s Erste Bankfell 6.3 per cent to €36.10 on concerns about its exposure to the Romanian economy after Morgan Stanley said last week that the market had underpriced the risk of the falling Romanian currency. The lei has fallen 20 per cent against the euro since July.Belgo-Dutch bank Fortis bucked the downward trend in the financial sector, surging 8.1 per cent to €14.33 in a relief rally after revealing its subprime exposure was less than feared.Fortis said on Sunday that its 2007 profit could be €1bn lower due to its subprime exposure – scotching speculation of a €2bn writedown that had driven it down
10 per cent on Friday.Bear Stearns sounded a note of caution about the Fortis rally saying more subprime writedowns could still shave the stock’s gains, and the bank had still not fully disclosed its €50bn structured product portfolio. “Further asset contagion would make Fortis more vulnerable to negative newsflow, especially given its tight capital position.”"

Companies are telling you, the bond market is telling you and consumers are telling you – it’s baked in,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.Financial companies were volatile after Bank of America agreed to buy Countrywide Financial for $4bn in stock. Countrywide moved the market all week amid rumours – which it denied – that it might seek bankruptcy protection.Traders were relieved that the deal saved the troubled mortgage lender from possible collapse. However, Countrywide’s shares fell 24.8 per cent to $6.33 this week, below the $7.16 per share transaction value, and BofA fell 3.4 per cent to $38.50 amid concerns over the deal.

American Express’s warning came after Capital One Financial, the card issuer, cut its full-year profit guidance by more than 20 per cent. The shares fell 10.5 per cent to $44 and 7.4 per cent to $42.59, respectively.Economists have long feared mortgage-related losses would spread into the broader economy as consumers unable to make home payments default on loans. AmEx’s warning was particularly worrisome as its high-end clients were considered more resistant to a consumer slowdown.Tiffany & Co added to these worries after the luxury jeweller cut the upper end of its fiscal-year earnings outlook, causing it to sink 13.5 per cent to $35.80 for the period. The news capped a poor week for US retailers after some poor same-store sales from mid-market clothing chains. Gap fell 12.5 per cent to $17.20 this week.Wall Street hopes aggressive Fed action will help prevent the US economy from tipping into recession. However, stocks managed only a mute rally after a speech by Mr Bernanke on Thursday opened the door to further rate cuts.While the domestic economy is seen weakening, some analysts argue US multinationals will suffer less from a downturn because so much of their revenues are overseas. The weaker dollar has also provided a boon for exporters. Coca-Cola fell sharply on Friday but rose 3.1 per cent to $63.77 over the week.Telecoms also sold off after AT&T warned of a slowdown in its domestic consumer business.

The gains were far from convincing with almost half of the index’s members closing to the downside.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,827.49, stemming a fall of 3.5 per cent in the first three days of this year, its worst start in 76 years.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,499.46, having twice fallen as much as 1.3 per cent in the session before rebounding. Shares in computer hardware companies trailed.Traders kept a close eye on support levels in the futures market. The March S&P 500 contract was at 1,424, just shy of its contract low of 1,418 set in November.“The stock market is starting off 2008 in a fairly challenged state with earnings estimates under scrutiny, credit conditions still very unstable and recession fears pretty much everywhere,” Tobias Levkovitch, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, said.The fourth-quarter earnings season starts this week with US corporate profits expected to fall 9.8 per cent, according to Thomson Financial, marking a second consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth.Average earnings fell 4.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2007, the first year-on-year decline since the start of 2002, as writedowns at financial companies and losses in the homebuilder sector dragged profits into negative territory.Expectations for this year are much improved but Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said Wall Street projections for 15.1 per cent earnings growth in 2008 were “wildly optimistic”.Alcoa will on Wednesday become the first Dow component to report fourth-quarter results.

97;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-12-14T21:39:49Z;Wall St unease about credit squeeze remains;;Wall Street stocks hit reverse gear this week after interest rate cuts and a central bank plan to help ease banks’ funding problems failed to convince investors that the worst effects of the credit squeeze were over.The spectre of inflation returned after both producer and consumer prices rose more than expected, threatening to limit the ability of the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates to stave off a recession.Energy and telecoms groups were among the best performers but financials again felt heavy selling pressure amid concerns about earnings as the fourth quarter results season began.The S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,467.95 on Friday and ended the week 2.4 per cent lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent this week to close at 13,339.85 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.6 per cent over the week to 2,635.74.The Russell 2000 small cap index fell 4 per cent to 753.93 on the week, hurt by a rise in volatility. “The mindset of ‘selling into strength’ has come back into this market,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said.After two consecutive weeks of gains, the major indices retreated amid widespread dissatisfaction with measures announced by the Federal Reserve and other central banks designed to help ease liquidity bottlenecks in financial markets.Stocks plunged on Tuesday after the Federal Open Market Committee cut interest rates 25 basis points, less than many investors had hoped. “It made you wonder about their [the Fed’s] sophistication and their ability to predict what the market reaction would be,” Ms Krosby said.Although equities posted a modest recovery the following day on news of a new term auction facility and foreign exchange swap lines, stocks failed to pare most of their losses with inter-bank lending rates remaining stubbornly high.Investors displeased with the Fed’s response were given a further jolt by data that showed a sharp spike in inflationary pressure.An index of consumer prices rose 0.8 per cent last month, its biggest rise in more than two years. Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy inputs, rose 0.3 per cent, more than expected. The CPI data came a day after wholesale prices rose the most in 34 years.The inflation data may restrict the Fed’s ability to deliver the rate cuts the market wants and equities fell after the news.Citigroup had another bad week after Vikram Pandit’s appointment as chief executive failed to boost its flagging share price. Citi was forced to take $49bn in structured investment vehicle assets onto its balance sheet and and the shares fell 10.5 per cent to $30.70 over the week.Lehman Brothers kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season for the big banks but its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $62.24 on the week, in spite of results that beat Wall Street’s estimates.Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bear Stearns report next week.

AT&T rose 6.9 per cent to $41.14 on the week after the phone company increased its dividend and announced a large share buyback programme.Honeywell put on 2.5 per cent to $59.98 after the diversified manufacturer’s profit guidance pleased traders. 3M guided for double-digit revenue growth next year but the shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $85.93 this week.Microsoft was a standout technology stock rising 2.3 per cent to $35.31 after an analyst at JPMorgan raised his 2008 profit estimates.Retail stocks had a poor week in spite of November sales figures that were twice as high as economists had forecast.

98;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-12-13T21:50:27Z;Wall Street climbs after late rally;;US shares delivered a lacklustre performance on Thursday as doubts about a plan by world central banks to help alleviate the worst effects of the credit squeeze weighed on sentiment.Inflation data also fuelled selling pressure before a late rally dragged the major indices higher. The biggest spike in producer prices in 34 years added to concerns that the Federal Reserve might be restricted in its ability to continue cutting interest rates.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,488.41, having traded lower for most of the session. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,668.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 13,517.96 after a big move by Honeywell supported the index.Utilities and industrials performed well but banking stocks endured another dismal session amid concerns about earnings prospects.Shares in Lehman Brothers, which kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season for the big banks, fell in spite of better-than-expected quarterly profits.The shares declined 2.1 per cent to $60.50 after fixed-income revenues dropped sharply and analysts said the inclusion of one-time gains meant the results were not as good as they might appear. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns report quarterly results next week.Washington Mutual fell 2.9 per cent to $15.59 after Bank of America told investors to sell and cut its price target 46 per cent to $13.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, fell 4.1 per cent to $23.84 after it entered a $29bn reinsurance agreement with Assured Guaranty. The S&P financial index fell 0.5 per cent to 399.88.Bank of America, down 0.9 per cent at $43.05 and Wachovia, 0.8 per cent lower at $40.19, contributed to a downturn in sentiment the previous day after they issued negative forecasts for this quarter’s performance.The downbeat sentiment in equities on Thursday was further sparked by a vital index of producer prices, which rose 3.2 per cent in November, its largest gain since 1973 and twice the increase forecast by economists.Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, was up 0.4 per cent, against expec-tations of only a 0.2 per cent increase.“What’s disturbing is really the rise in core inflation,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said. “Everybody was kind of confused about why the Fed reacted the way it did, but now you see the reason.”But the Fed’s plan to tackle a reluctance by banks to lend to one another remained the main focus of investor attention on Thursday. Some analysts said central banks had not gone far enough as interbank lending rates remained stubbornly high.Stocks fluctuated wildly after the plan was unveiled on Wednesday, continuing a recent trend for large intraday price swings. “I think this volatility is going to continue,” said Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at Charles Schwab.The Vix volatility measureis not moving down as much as it normally would when the market rallied. Mr Frederick said: “That’s a sign of fear on the part of market makers. They’re not convinced that any rally we might get on a given day is sustainable.” The Vix was flat at 22.48 on Thursday.Retail stocks were a talking point after retail sales rose 1.2 per cent in November, twice the expected 0.6 per cent increase. The data helped ease concerns about a disappointing Christmas shopping period but the S&P retail index fell.Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, fell 2.4 per cent to $68.54 after an 11 per cent increase in quarterly profit failed to satisfy investors. The shares are up 30 per cent this year.Shares in Biogen Idec, the biotechnology group, slumped 23.7 per cent to $57.91 after efforts at exploring a possible sale yielded no serious offers.Honeywell jumped 5 per cent to $60.65 after the diversified manufacturer’s 2008 profit guidance cheered investors. But Ciena fell 12.1 per cent to $37.04 after the network equipment maker forecast revenue growth to slow in its new fiscal year.JetBlue, up 14.4 per cent at $7.15, provided support to a range of airline stocks after Lufthansa acquired a 19 per cent stake in the low-cost airline.
99;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-12-13T19:01:33Z;Biogen retreats;;Golden goose? Biogen looks more like a shattered clay pigeon. After spurning flirtations from potential suitor Pfizer early this year, Biogen caved in to prodding from activist investor Carl Icahn and agreed to solicit takeover bids. That launched its share price sky high, as investors bet that desperate drugmakers would pay up to win Biogen’s biotech drug pipeline. But big pharma did not prove desperate enough and Biogen’s stock has come crashing down.After floating up from about $44 in March, helped by a growing buy-out premium assigned to biotech stocks, then by Mr Icahn’s agitations, Biogen shares spiked as high as $84.75 in October. A deal at anywhere near that price would have been misguided – it would have required a prematurely bullish bet on Tysabri, the multiple sclerosis drug Biogen developed with partner Elan. Tysabri is linked to a rare brain infection and Biogen’s projections on how many patients will use the drug seem unrealistically high. Three days after Biogen said it might sell itself, the US Food and Drug Administration announced it needed more time to review Biogen’s application for the use of Tysabri to treat Crohn’s disease.Mr Icahn, for his part, seems to have shot himself in both feet. His push this year for MedImmune to put itself on the block paid off handily, thanks to AstraZeneca’s willingness to pay a hefty premium. But he has failed in his efforts to convince Genzyme to sell itself and, with a Biogen deal scuttled, MedImmune is starting to look like a one-hit wonder.Biogen and Mr Icahn both overreached and have been batted down. Biogen needs to regain control of its business and focus on what made it attractive to buyers in the first place – its pipeline of middle- and late-stage drugs. If it can strike success there, Biogen’s suitors may come knocking again.
100;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Biogen fails to attract buyers;;Biogen Idec will remain an independent company after putting itself up for sale and attracting “no definitive offers” to buy the US biotechnology group, sending its shares plunging on Wednesday.Biogen’s shares were nearly 28 per cent lower, or $20.96, at $54.95 in after-hours trading in New York after the group announced its failure to find a buyer.Biogen’s stock price has been sinking back to levels not seen since before October 12 when the group said it had hired Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch to auction the company. The group decided to put itself up for sale after receiving interest from potential buyers, including investor Carl Icahn.But Biogen said on Wednesday that Mr Icahn declined to pursue his earlier expression of interest and it received no definitive offers after contacting “every major pharmaceutical company”.The group said it provided equal access to critical company data for all companies to make an offer.The lack of interest in Biogen could reflect increasing caution in large drugmakers for making big deals, despite looking for acquisitions to boost growth.The biotech group, with a market value of about $20bn and two blockbuster multiple sclerosis drugs, said its board of directors authorised management to explore whether a sale to “major pharmaceutical companies” would create more value than remaining independent.Biotech is an increasing area of interest for big drugmakers. Many big pharma groups are simultaneously trying to offset future lost revenues due to patent expiries on key drugs while also fighting pricing, regulatory and scientific pressures for their medicines.Biogen is almost 30 years old and has $3bn in annual revenues.It has two multiple sclerosis drugs: Avonex, with about $1.9bn in sales expected this year, and Tysabri, which it shares with Irish drugmaker Elan, with about $300m in sales expected this year. It also shares revenues with partner Genentech from blockbuster cancer drug Rituxan, which is increasingly being tested for use in auto-immune diseases.
101;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-11-19T01:07:22Z;Celgene to buy cancer drug group for $3bn;;Celgene, the US biotechnology group, on Sunday night agreed to pay $2.9bn in cash and stock for Pharmion, a developer of drugs to treat blood cancers, highlighting consolidation pressures in the biotechnology industry.Celgene is paying $72 per share for Pharmion, or a 46 per cent premium over the Colorado-based company’s closing share price of $46.28 on Friday. Slightly more than one-third of the payment to Pharmion shareholders – or $25 per share – will be in cash, with the rest in Celgene shares.Pharmion’s main drug is Vidaza, which is used by patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood disease than can lead to leukaemia. Pharmion also owns the European rights to Thalomid, a Celgene drug that treats multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. Pharmion lost $91m last year on revenues of $239m.The world’s largest biotechnology groups, as well as big pharmaceutical companies, have been making acquisitions of smaller biotechnology groups developing hit drugs, in order to bolster dwindling pipelines.As they look beyond their own research and development capabilities to expand, big biotech and pharma groups are often tempted to buy peers with which they already collaborate.The sale of Pharmion to Celgene comes as Biogen IDEC, one of the top US biotechnology groups, is exploring a sale following pressure from Carl Icahn, the activist investor who has also expressed an interest in buying the company. Biogen has a market capitalisation of $20.5bn. There has also been speculation Mr Icahn might push for change at Genzyme, another biotech group in which he has invested. Genzyme is worth nearly $20bn.Based in New Jersey and run by Sol Barer, chairman and chief executive, Celgene has seen its shares rise by about 18 per cent over the past year. On Friday, they closed up 0.6 per cent at $64.90, while Pharmion’s rose 5 per cent to $49.28.The deal will weaken Celgene’s earnings in 2008 but enhance them in 2009, according to the company. “Our combined global infrastructure will leverage the therapeutic and commercial potential of Pharmion’s products, particularly Vidaza, which has the potential to become a major global therapy,” Mr Barer said.Pharmion shareholders will own 6 per cent of Celgene after the deal closes.JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch advised Celgene while Bank of America advised Pharmion. Proskauer Rose, Arnold & Porter and Willkie Farr & Gallagher were the law firms on the transaction.
102;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-10-16T18:16:49Z;Biogen entertains offers;;Carl Icahn has struck yet another match in the US drugs sector, knowing that desperate pharmaceutical companies will circle the flame. Biogen Idec, Icahn’s latest activist target, has now agreed to entertain takeover offers. Given Big Pharma’s propensity to overpay for acquisitions, Mr Icahn and other Biogen shareholders may stand to reap substantial rewards. But a deal for the biotech giant may not be such good news for an acquirer’s shareholders.Biogen’s share price has nearly doubled to more than $82 since mid-April, based largely on takeover speculation. Potential suitors should avert their eyes from that frothy valuation, which equates to 26 times estimated 2008 earnings and values Biogen at about $23.5bn. But Mr Icahn, who expressed interest in buying Biogen himself to get the ball rolling, is betting clear-headedness will not prevail. The world’s drug giants are frantically searching for new treatments to offset revenue losses from blockbuster drug patent expirations. Biogen’s size would give a buyer immediate scale in the biotech field. This is the sort of a potential panacea AstraZeneca used to justify the more than 50 per cent premium it paid in April for MedImmune.The $15.6bn MedImmune buyout, which Icahn also helped spur, was widely viewed as too expensive, and has battered AstraZeneca’s stock. At current prices, a takeover of riskier Biogen could be even more foolhardy. There are worries that Biogen’s expectations for the number of patients who will use its Tysabri multiple sclerosis drug are too optimistic, particularly because it has been linked to a few deaths. Biogen splits its profits on Tysabri and auto-immune drug Rituxan with rival companies. Its competition is strengthening. And its pipeline, while strong, has yet to produce a clear winner.With so many unknowns, potential buyers such as Pfizer, Sanofi, Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline may be wise to wait for the fog to lift – or at least for Biogen’s share price to cool.
103;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-10-16T05:02:16Z;Elan eyes buying Tysabri stake;;Elan, the Ireland-based biotechnology company, will consider buying back the 50 per cent outstanding interest in Tysabri, the multiple sclerosis drug, it sold to Biogen Idec of the US if its partner goes ahead with a plan to put itself up for sale.Elan said on Monday it had hired Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, to evaluate the options that would be triggered by a change of control in Biogen Idec, including the right to repurchase its interest in the drug at fair value.It said that “under certain circumstances”, it could also sell its stake in Tysabri, continue its arrangement with Biogen Idec’s new owners, or renegotiate the current contract. Its decision would be taken “in the best interests of shareholders”.The analysis highlights the complexities that would be triggered by untangling Tysabri, following Biogen Idec’s statement last week that it had received expressions of interest from third parties and had authorised management to evaluate them.Regulatory filings reveal a series of agreements with Elan, which originally developed Tysabri and signed a development and marketing agreement with Biogen Idec in August 2000.Biogen Idec manufactures Tysabri and Elan buys it back for distribution in the US, in an operation that generated net sales of $28m (£14m) in 2006 after costs and royalties. In the EU, Biogen Idec distributes the drug and shares the financial results, which resulted in losses of $28m for Elan last year.Tysabri was approved in the US in November 2004 but then suspended pending an investigation after the death of one patient and serious side effects in another. It was reintroduced in June 2006.Elan has a basic US patent for Tysabri to treat multiple sclerosis, expiring in 2014, and additional US patents and applications, some with Biogen Idec. The two companies have submitted a request for regulatory approval for the drug in Crohn’s disease in the US and the EU.Shares in Elan closed up 87 cents at €16.72.

After its warning earlier this month, the bank delivered a 57 per cent drop in quarterly profits as write-downs linked to subprime mortgages, leveraged loans and fixed-income trading topped $3bn.Citigroup’s third-quarter earnings declined to $2.38bn from $5.51bn a year earlier but the result was slightly better than analysts had forecast. Citigroup had warned that third-quarter earnings would decline 60 per cent.However, the shares fell 3.4 per cent to $46.24 after comments by Gary Crittenden, chief financial officer, unsettled traders. He cautioned that mortgage delinquencies have accelerated and said consumer credit market conditions “will continue to deteriorate”.“The subprime issue is still there,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “The market wanted to hear it was over.”Homebuilder stocks traded lower Monday. The S&P homebuilder index fell 4.1 per cent at 429.44. KB Home shed 4.3 per cent to $27.70.Citigroup’s results, along with a plan – together with Bank of America and JPMorgan – to launch a $75bn fund to buy mortgage-linked securities, put credit market concerns back in the spotlight Monday.Financial stocks were sold down Monday. The S&P financial index was 1.8 per cent lower at 467.11 while the investment bank index was down 2.1 per cent at 210.14. Merrill Lynch fell 2.1 per cent at $73.60, Bear Stearns shed 2 per cent at $120.69 and Lehman Brothers slipped 3.6 per cent at $62.33.Technology stocks were also lower.

105;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Icahn hints at Motorola challenge;;Carl Icahn, the US activist investor, has signalled the possible launch of a new campaign against Motorola if performance at the telecommunications equipment maker does not improve.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Icahn said: “There is value there, and if that value doesn’t manifest itself I, as an activist, would think very seriously about coming back.”Mr Icahn, 71, failed to gain a board seat at Motorola in May after a bitter proxy war that lasted several months.Since that defeat, however, he has remained a large Motorola shareholder. He owns more than 70m shares, or a stake of about 3 per cent, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr Icahn, who had earlier in the year pushed for a massive share buyback, believes Motorola’s troubled handset division should be separated from the rest of the group. Motorola has disagreed with that assessment.Motorola declined to comment on the possibility of a fresh challenge from Mr Icahn. But the fact that he is considering agitating again is unlikely to be welcomed by Ed Zander, the company’s chairman and chief executive.Mr Zander has vowed to turn Motorola’s mobile phone unit round and appears to retain the confidence of the Motorola board in spite of the company’s continuing problems.Industry analysts say Mr Zander has worked hard to revamp the company’s senior management team while cutting costs, but they remain concerned about what they perceive as Motorola’s lacklustre product portfolio and continuing market share erosion.Motorola shares closed 1.3 per cent higher at $19.13 on Friday. A year ago, they were trading above $25.Speaking to the FT after a speech at the World Business Forum in New York, Mr Icahn also said the credit squeeze and the economic uncertainty offered “some interesting opportunities”.However, he added: “One must be extremely careful about the economy and about the markets. There are a lot of things that could go wrong.”On Friday, Mr Icahn scored a coup when Oracle made a $6.6bn bid for BEA Systems, a software company in which he had amassed a large stake. BEA shares rose 38 per cent to $18.82, offering Mr Icahn a paper gain of about $250m.Mr Icahn has also expressed an interest in acquiring Biogen Idec, the US biotechnology group with a market capitalisation of about $20bn, the group said on Friday.
106;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-10-12T23:25:09Z;Icahn shows interest in Biogen;;Biogen Idec, the large US biotechnology drugmaker, on Friday said it would consider selling itself, and had received interest from buyers “including one from investor Carl Icahn”.The group, with a market value of $20bn and blockbuster multiple sclerosis drugs, said its board of directors authorised management to explore whether a sale to “major pharmaceutical companies” would create more value for shareholders than remaining independent.It hired Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch to act as advisers on any potential deal, but cautioned there was “no assurance” that a sale would occur. Nevertheless, the group’s shares soared 18 per cent to $81.95 in after-market trading in New York, after closing at $69.43.Biogen could be attractive to some big pharmaceutical companies, who are increasingly hungry for biotech drugs and expertise. Many big pharma groups are trying to offset future lost revenues due to expiring patents on key drugs while fighting pricing, regulatory and scientific pressures for their medicines.They want more biotech medicines – which use genetically modified copies of human proteins to treat disease – because of their often greater potential to be a new kind of drug with more pricing power. Biogen, almost 30 years old and with $3bn in annual revenues, is one of the big biotechs with a biotech pipeline but also blockbuster products that could immediately help a buyer.Biogen has two multiple sclerosis drugs: Avonex. with about $1.9bn in sales expected this year and Tysabri, which it shares with Irish drugmaker Elan, with about $300m in sales expected this year.The company also shares revenues with partner Genentech from blockbuster cancer drug Rituxan, which is increasingly being tested for use in autoimmune diseases.The company has rebounded from a safety scare that temporarily forced the suspension of US sales of Tysabri in 2005 due to fears of a rare infection.It restructured and Tysabri has been back on the US market and for sale in Europe for about a year.In early September, Biogen management detailed its outlook forecasting 15 per cent compound annual revenue growth and 20 per cent compound annual earnings growth, excluding one-time items, from 2007-2010.
107;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
108;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-09-13T20:42:57Z;Wall Street rally led by blue chips;;Wall Street stocks rose sharply higher on Thursday, buoyed by tentative signs of stability in money markets before next week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve.Stocks also held up in the face of a new record high for the price of oil, as benchmark West Texas Intermediate closed above $80 a barrel for the first time.The S&P 500 index rose 0.8 per cent to close at 1,483.95, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite’s gain of 0.4 per cent to 2,601.06.As stocks rallied, equity volatility, as measured by the Vix index, eased just 0.8 per cent.Financials were one of the best performing sectors in the S&P, while the top stock was Countrywide, up 13.9 per cent at $18.93, which more than reversed its losses earlier this week. The largest US mortage lender said it had arranged $12bn in additional secured borrowing capacity.Another sign that credit conditions were starting to stabilise was seen in the latest weekly data on the commercial paper market released by the Federal Reserve. Outstanding CP declined for a fifth successive week but the pace was much slower.“The decline is also the smallest since the CP tempest began last month,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.“The notion that the moderation might signal the worst of the crisis is over is corroborated by anecdotal evidence of buyers beginning to re-enter, albeit on a very, very tentative scale, the CP market.”Lehman Brothers continued its recent rebound before third-quarter results next week with a rise of 4.6 per cent to $59.68. The bank’s shares have rallied nearly 13 per cent this week.The economic calendar picks up on Friday when retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilisation reports arrive. The information will provide policymakers with their last pieces of data before they meet next week to discuss monetary policy.Investors expect at least a 25 basis point cut in the 5.25 per cent Fed Funds rate. But given the continued strains in global money markets facing financial institutions, some economists and investors are calling for at least a half-percentage point easing.The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the major benchmarks on Thursday with a rally of 1 per cent to 13,424.88. A number of Dow components were in the news, led by General Motors, up 10 per cent at $33.29, after the United Auto Workers union indicated a willingness to help cut healthcare costs.McDonald’s gained 6.1 per cent to $54.30 amd set a record high of $54.68 after it announced a 50 per cent increase in its annual cash dividend to $1.50 a share. The company said this week that global same-store sales rose 8.1 per cent in August. The stock has rallied more than 10 per cent since Monday.Citigroup said: “Positive global momentum combined with shareholder friendly initiatives position McDonald’s well in a challenging market environment,” as it maintained a $58 target on the stock.Microsoftraised its quarterly dividend by a cent and the stock was up 0.8 per cent at $29.16.Merck was another Dow stock on the rise, with a gain of 0.4 per cent to $49.86 after Bank of America upgraded the pharmaceutical giant to a ‘buy’ with a price target of $57.Shares in Exxon Mobil were 1.1 per cent higher at $88.62, boosted by record oil prices. Other stocks in the news included, Target, up 2.7 per cent at $64.42 after the retailer said it might sell $7bn in credit-card receivables. Analysts at Citigroup said: “It is a positive that Target is taking steps to determine if there is additional value that can be returned to shareholders.“Bill Ackman’s 9.6 per cent stake in the company could have prompted management to take action, in our view.”Qualcomm rose 3.4 per cent to $39.17 after a judge halted an import ban on mobile phones containing the company’s 3G handsets. It represents a legal victory in the chipmaker’s patent dispute with rival Broadcom, whose shares rose 1.4 per cent at $35.87.Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 4.2 per cent to $13.30 after it announced a collaboration with Ortho-McNeil, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, up 1 per cent at $63.11, for the treatment of various medical disorders.Biogen rose 1.1 per cent to $65.40, and reversed losses in early trade after UBS downgraded the biotech drug maker to “sell” and maintained a $58 price target.First Data closed a fraction firmer at $33.39. Investors focused on talk that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which engineered a $26bn buy-out of the credit card processor, could delay the sale of loans to fund that deal.The stock remained below the $34 a share buy-out price.
109;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-09-04T14:46:01Z;Rule changes ease pharma pain;;Many of the world’s biggest companies have rushed to India to establish research and development centres. Cisco, SAP, Suzuki, Yahoo and Alcatel are among the heavyweights that have collectively pledged to invest billions of dollars.Notably absent from the rush are global pharmaceuticals companies. Many fled India in the 1980s when the country would not grant patents on pharmaceutical products. But since 2005 a new, stronger Indian patent regime, enacted as part of World Trade Organisation negotiations, has rekindled interest.Lingering concerns over how New Delhi will implement the new rules has curbed investment from global pharmaceutical makers in drug development. Apart from UK drugmaker AstraZeneca, which in 2003 revealed a $40m tuberculosis research centre in Bangalore, few are setting up facilities.Drugmakers are, however, finding other ways to leverage India’s large pool of English-speaking, lower salary scientists to help bring down soaring development costs.Some are forming “research-based” partnerships with Indian companies. Merck of the US last year partnered Advinus Therapeutics, a local company backed by Tata, one of India’s largest conglomerates. Merck and Advinus will collaborate on early-stage development of drugs for metabolic disorders, with Merck retaining the right to advance research into late-stage clinical trials. GlaxoSmithKline and Ranbaxy have also teamed up.But the most dramatic change has been in clinical trials conducted in India. Global drugmakers have aggressively ramped up clinical trials in the country through their own local operations or by outsourcing to third parties. The number of ongoing clinical trials in India has surged from 40-50 in 2003 to about 270 in the pipeline now, according to Clinicaltrials.gov, a website operated by the US National Institutes of Health.Clinical trials, the lengthy studies in which experimental medicines are tested on patients, are 40-60 per cent cheaper to conduct in India than in the US, according to iGate Clinical Research, an Indian company that conducts trials. India’s large, diverse population, private sector hospitals and English-speaking physicians also provide a sound infrastructure for conducting trials.Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, pioneered the use of India for clinical trials in 1995, well ahead of the current wave. Given weak patent protection at the time, Pfizer began trials with complex, hard-to-copy medicines. Eli Lilly soon followed.Apart from Pfizer and Eli Lilly, no others ventured into clinical trials for years “for one reason: intellectual property”, says Dr Vasudeo Ginde, president of iGate Clinical Research.In anticipation of the new patent regime, others began testing the waters with new clinical trials in 2003. Those active in the country now include Amgen, Biogen, Johnson & Johnson, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline.Dr Hasit Joshipura, managing director of GSK’s India unit, says 8 per cent of the parent group’s trials are now conducted in India. GSK India, which leads the domestic pharmaceutical market in total sales, conducted 15 global clinical studies last year, compared with three before 2005.But hurdles stand in the way of India reaping a larger portion of the $9.5bn contract clinical research industry, two-thirds of which is still based in the US.The rapid growth of clinical trials has sparked ethics and transparency concerns.India currently permits phase two and phase three clinical trials, which involve testing on patients who have the ailments the relevant drugs are designed to address. Phase one trials, where drugs are tested on healthy people, are not allowed.There have been allegations that some low-income, illiterate patients are not aware of what they are signing up for. The New England Journal of Medicine published an article in 2005 on clinical trials in India entitled “A New Colonialism?” But Dr Ginde of iGate says patients who sign up for trials do not tend to be of low economic status.To add transparency, the World Health Organisation this summer added India’s government-backed clinical trials registry to its own global database. The WHO says the registry requires researchers to submit details about their trials, which are vetted by an Indian government regulator, to ensure that the companies will be “more accountable to the people who consent to participate in trials”.Concerns over intellectual property in India also remain. The US-India Business Council, a lobby group that represents 250 US companies, says a lack of full protection over data gleaned during studies, or “data exclusivity”, will limits appetite for clinical trials in India.Novartis is also unhappy with a clause in the new patent laws denying protection to incremental innovations to existing drugs. The company filed a legal challenge to the provision, alleging India was not complying with WTO regulations, after the government rejected a patent application for the anti-cancer drug Glivec.A court ruled against Novartis last month, prompting the Swiss drugmaker to say it would shift planned investments elsewhere. Daniel Vasella, chief executive, told the Financial Times: “This [ruling] is not an invitation to invest in Indian research and development, which we would have done.”The court decision was a bitter pill for others to swallow as well.Gregory Kalbaugh, director and counsel at the business council, says: “Most companies would like to invest in India.” But remaining unease over India’s patent laws “is causing a great deal of worry amongst our companies”.Some believe the western drugs companies are merely posturing. Dr Ajit Dangi, director-general of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, which represents domestic and multinational companies, says: “One such case shouldn’t deter people from investing in India. I don’t think anyone will pull out. [But] they might evaluate the market more cautiously.”
110;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-06-01T20:23:32Z;Wall St rallies as data boost sentiment;;Wall Street enjoyed another banner week, with the S&P 500 and other benchmarks moving into record territory.Deals and earnings continued to provide a catalyst for big moves in a number of stocks. Technology and small capitalised stocks led gains as a series of economic reports this week suggested that the economy could enter summer on an upswing. While that outlook has largely reduced the chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut this year, stock investors focused on the bright side of a robust economy in 2007.“This week’s data has shown that the economy is gathering momentum,” said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services. “Retail investors have not been buyers of late and this should start to bring them back.”Late on Friday, the S&P closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,536.34, a gain of 1.4 per cent this week. The benchmark closed above its March 2000 record level of 1,527.46 on Wednesday and is now up 8.3 per cent so far this year.Mr Anderson said the S&P 500 is currently valued at attractive levels and that investors should look to favour growth over value stocks and also domestic rather than international equities.Blue chips also moved further into uncharted territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average made its 26th record close this year on Friday. The Dow rose 0.3 per cent to close at 13,668.11 and had made a new intra-day high of 13,692, for a rise of 1.2 per cent this week.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to finish at 2,613.92 for a gain of 2.2 per cent this week. For the year, the Nasdaq is up 8.2 per cent and approaching 2006’s gain of 9.5 per cent. The Russell 2000 index rose 0.7 per cent and closed in record territory on Friday, for a gain of 2.8 per cent this week.Among stocks in the news on Friday, Dell rose 1.45 per cent to $27.30, for a weekly rise of 5 per cent, as its its first quarter earnings beat estimates. The computer maker announced a 10 per cent cut in its workforce after the results.Shares in Dow Jones surged 14.8 per cent to $61.20 on Friday, for a gain of 18.3 per cent this week. The Bancroft family which controls Dow, said it would it would meet and discuss the $5bn offer made by News Corp in April. Shares in News Corp rose 2.5 per cent to $24.22.On Friday, shares in CKX, which operates Elvis Presley’s Graceland estate, rose 37.8 per cent to $14.65, after the company received a $1.3bn buy-out offer from Robert Sillerman, its chairman and chief executive.“We continue to believe the company will ultimately accept the $60-a-share offer from News Corp, with concessions that ensure the journalistic integrity of Dow Jones publications,” said James Peters, publishing industry analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. “We do not see competing bids emerging.”Earlier in the week, Wachovia said it would buy AG Edwards, a brokerage firm, in a $6.8bn deal. Shares in Wachovia fell 1 per cent to $54.51, while AG Edwards jumped 17.3 per cent to $88.75 this week. The deal will make Wachovia the second largest US retail brokerage after Merrill Lynch.Ceridian rose 7.2 per cent to 35.41 after the information services company agreed to a $5.3bn private equity buy-out.The battle for the CBOT Holdings intensified this week. The InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange to support its bid the CBOT.At this stage, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and has thus far not expressed a preference for a competing bid from ICE. This week, ICE fell 1.4 per cent to $142.97, CBOT rose 2.4 per cent to $196.98, while CME gained 4.6 per cent to $537.Archstone-Smith Trust, a real estate investment trust, was purchased for about $22.2bn, including debt, by Tishman Speyer Properties and Lehman Brothers. ASN rallied 11.5 per cent to $61.57.CDW, the technology retailer agreed to a $7.3bn private equity offer and is shares rose 12.6 per cent to $85.07 this week.In other deal news, Avaya, the office telecommunications-equipment maker, was in discussion with private equity firms and other investors about a possible sale of the company or its divisions. Avaya rose 17.6 per cent to $16.08 this week.Dendreon, jumped 24 per cent to $8.10 this week, after regulators approved its experimental prostate vaccine.Despite the general rally in blue chips, Citigroup dropped 1.1 per cent to $54.51. The bank is one of only five stocks in the Dow that are negative performers to date this year, down 2.1 per cent. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who holds 4 per cent of the stock, gave a ”vote of confidence” to Chuck Prince, chief executive, and said the company should be given ”some time to perform”.Citigroup’s shares rose sharply last month on news that Eddie Lampert’s hedge fund had built a 0.3 per cent stake prompting speculation that he might press for a shake-up.Google rose back above $500 for the first time since the start of February, gaining 3.5 per cent to $501.39 this week. The company released details about its new Gears technology that will enable people to browse internet services, including e-mail, either online, offline or intermittently connected to a network.Shares in Adobe rose 5.1 per cent to $44.53 on news the software designer will incorporate Google’s new gears.Biogen Idec rose 5.7 per cent to $52.29 this week after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.Wal-Mart raised its share buy-back program to $15bn, on Friday and sent its shares up 3.9 per cent to $49.47.Ciena recorded its third straight quarterly profit and raised its sales forecast.

111;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-05-30T20:50:28Z;S&P 500 hits record high after Fed minutes;;The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Wednesday, as investors looked on the bright side of the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting minutes.While stocks are set to record their third straight positive monthly gain on Thursday, investors face a cocktail of potentially potent economic data due on Friday.On Wednesday, fears that a sharp slide in Chinese stocks overnight would spark a similar reaction on Wall Street faded early. Stocks opened lower but losses were quickly contained. “Any link between Shanghai and the S&P 500 is tenuous at best,” said Jack Ablin, portfolio manager at Harris Private Bank.For some investors, the lack of a major pullback in US stocks was disappointing.“We were ready for some opportunities in equities if there was a large sell-off,” said Michael Kastner, port-folio manager at Sterling-Stamos.After the Fed minutes were released, the leading benchmarks made fresh highs and the S&P 500 index finished up 0.8 per cent at 1,530.23, above its March 2000 close of 1,527.46. The June S&P futures contract rebounded from a low of 1,512.60 earlier in the day and closed at a new contract high of 1,532.50. Within the S&P, the energy and telecoms sectors led gains, while health care lingered in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite shrugged off early losses and closed up 0.8 per cent at 2,592.59, a fresh six year high. A decline of 0.4 per cent in semiconductor stocks dented the technology sector, led by Intel, down 1 per cent at $22.08 and Applied Materials, off 1.5 per cent at $18.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 13,633.08, its 25th record close this year. Caterpillar, up 3.6 per cent at $78.48, led gainers in the Dow.Healthcare stocks Merck, down 1.3 per cent at $52.71, and Pfizer, off 0.5 per cent at $27.41, both weighed on the blue-chip benchmark.A bright spot in the healthcare sector was Biogen Idec, up 5.9 per cent at $52.13 after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.With attention focused on employment, inflation and manufacturing reports due on Friday, stocks generally traded in a narrow range.“All eyes are on the employment report,” said Mr Ablin. “The labour market has been sustaining the consumer in the face of higher gas prices and weak housing.”On Wednesday, ADP said it expects 97,000 new private sector jobs were created in May. The ADP report which excludes government workers suggests payrolls will be around 117,000 this month, below the current consensus call of 135,000.Traders believe a payroll gain of at least 100,000 jobs will be enough to soothe concerns that the labour market is faltering.Mr Kastner said investors were hoping that capital investment spending would take over from consumer spending in pulling up economic growth and take over from consumer spending in the months ahead. He also believed corporate earnings were likely to fall this year, pressuring stock valuations.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the news that CDW the technology retailer had agreed to a $7.3bn private equity buy-out.InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the hope of boosting the chances of its hostile bid for CBOT Holdings.At this juncture, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ICE hopes its deal with CBOE will resolve a legal dispute between the options exchange and CBOT, which argues that some of its members are entitled to an equity stake in CBOE.Shares in ICE rose 0.65 per cent to $148.71, CBOT shares gained 2.4 per cent to $197.62, while CME was up 0.4 per cent at $527.85.In other deal news, eSpeed, an electronic bond trading platform controlled by Cantor Fitzgerald, said it would buy BGC Partners, Cantor’s privately held brokerage unit, in a $1.3bn deal. Shares in eSpeed rose 0.4 per cent to $9.23.In earnings news, Coldwater Creek reported a stronger than forecast first quarter profit and the retailer rose 16.6 per cent to $24.37.Pulte Homes said it would cut 16 per cent of its workforce, and shares fell 0.1 per cent to $27.41.Shares in Coca-Cola were up 1.6 per cent at $53.05. Citigroup upgraded the beverage maker to a “buy” with a $59 price target.NiSource fell 7.8 per cent to $22.07 after the utility said it had concluded talks without selling its Indiana electricity assets, but would still consider spinning off that unit. Utility stocks have recently pared solid gains this year – the S&P utility sector is up 12.8 per cent in 2007 – as investors have become concerned at the sector’s low dividend yield as compared with rising bond yields.“Utilities have run a little further beyond reasonable valuations,” said Mr Ablin.Verisign was 5.3 per cent higher at $29.43 after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned. The internet infrastructure company’s stock is up 22.1 per cent this year on the back of expansion and diversification of its operations.
112;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2007-04-23T20:31:19Z;Wall St lower in light trading;;"Wall Street stocks were lower in light trade on Monday following a run-up to a number of psychologically significant benchmarks.The leading stock indices have made big gains over the past month, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average to within touching distance of the 13,000 mark and the S&P 500 index towards its record high of 1,527, set nearly seven years ago.With little news to lift the mood on Monday, the leading indices drifted in and out of positive territory, unable to break through either of the “magic numbers”.The Dow was weighed down by General Motors, which fell 3.2 per cent to $30.67 after vice chairman Bob Lutz said the “mortgage industry meltdown” had hit industry sales this month.The Dow closed 0.3 per cent lower at 12,919.4 and the S&P was down 0.2 per cent at 1,480.93. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.1 per cent per cent to 2,523.67.While the benchmarks are primarily symbolic, they provide an important technical test of the market’s resolve.In particular, if the S&P record is broken, it may provide a telling sign of wider shifts in the way assets are being allocated.The Dow’s reaching the 13,000 mark is more likely but also less consequential. Vastly less money is linked to the Dow than to the S&P.“Dow 13,000 is not necessarily the magic number for a reallocation of money from bonds into stocks,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos.But Mr Kastner said “low interest rates and better-than-expected earnings are encouraging investors to switch out of bonds into stocks. Investors will chase returns”.For the year to date, the Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index has risen
1.8 per cent, which trails a 4.4 per cent rise in the S&P.Solid earnings updates from many companies have been a fillip for the Dow in particular as expectations were heavily played down ahead of the first-quarter earnings season.Results have been announced by 16 of the 30 companies making up the Dow so far and 10 have beaten analysts’ forecasts.No Dow component companies reported earnings yesterday but six are due to do so this week.Anticipating better profit updates, analysts at Banc of America Securities raised their 12-month target on the S&P 500 from 1,465 to 1,550.“Earnings should continue to benefit from commodity prices that are higher than anticipated, as well as some signs that some companies near the end of the production pipeline are beginning to achieve some price increases of their own,” the bank said.The weak dollar has helped boost earnings and BofA said their current estimates could rise if the currency falls further in value.Georges Yared, chief investment strategist at Yared Investment Research, said the earnings outlook for the second quarter and the balance of the year looks healthy and can support further gains in stocks.“We are getting good guidance and the Dow can go well beyond 13,000.”In deal news, Bank of America slipped 1 per cent to $50.51 after it agreed to buy ABN Amro’s LaSalle unit for $21bn.The deal, which is contingent on Barclays buying ABN, will make BofA the largest bank in Chicago, one of the few regions where it did not have a big consumer banking presence.Shares in MedImmune rose 17.8 per cent to $56.57 after AstraZeneca agreed to buy the biotech group for $15.6bn, or $58 a share.Other biotech groups were given a boost by the deal with Biogen Idec up 4.8 per cent to $48.86. Pfizer fared less well, slipping 2.3 per cent to $26.35 after Prudential Equity cut its recommendation, citing weakness in the pipeline of new drugs.“While the stock may be at the bottom, it is unclear for us what will lift it from here short of something revolutionary,” said analyst Tim Anderson.Shares in Amazon slipped 1.3 per cent to $44.36 after Piper Jaffray & Co cut its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “under perform”. Analyst Aaron Kessler said the share price reflected anticipation of significant margin improvements that were unlikely to materialise.In earnings news, Hasbro jumped 7.7 per cent to $32.54 after the toy maker beat analysts’ profit forecasts on the back of the biggest rise in its sales for about eight years. Analysts were particularly impressed by a heroic jump in sales of action figures such as Captain America, which are part of a five-year licensing deal Hasbro struck with Marvel last year."
113;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2006-04-07T08:01:12Z;Elan says Tysabri shows promise in study;;Elan, the Irish biotechnology company that developed the withdrawn multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri with Biogen Idec, said on Friday that the drug had shown significant positive effects on patients in a trial, further boosting hopes of a return to the market.“The Tysabri study data show not only significant reductions in relapses and disability, but also suggest improved quality of life,” the company said in a statement. “This is very encouraging.”Elan said it had never before seen positive findings on its quality of life measures in a Phase III multiple sclerosis study. The data were presented this week at a neurology conference in California.Multiple sclerosis leads to progressive disability, and the company said that the drug had shown a significant impact on measures of disability progression, such as visual and cognitive function.Tysabri had been considered a bright spot for the biotech sector, sales of which had been expected to reach between $2bn and $3bn by 2007. But the drug was withdrawn abruptly in February last year after three patients on the drug contracted a rare brain disease.Shares in Elan lost 70 per cent of their value in the immediate wake of the withdrawal, and Biogen Idec plunged 45 per cent.However, following a safety evaluation, an advisory panel of experts put together by the US Food and Drug Administration recommended last month that the drug was safe enough to return to the market, although patients should be monitored closely for side-effects.Elan is currently awaiting a final decision from the FDA, which is usually guided by the advice of such panels. The review period for the drug has been extended to the end of June.If Tysabri returns to the market, it is likely to provide competition for Rebif, the bestselling rival multiple sclerosis treatment made by Switzerland’s Serono.Elan shares rose about 3.2 per cent to €12.07 in early trade in Dublin.
114;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T17:32:33+0000;Fresh rate worries weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street suffered another weak session on Thursday as the prospect of higher US interest rates continued to rattle investors.Stocks initially pushed higher, buoyed by the Bank of Japan’s decision to keep its short-term interest rates at around zero per cent for the time being.But the main indices turned sharply lower in afternoon trading after a fresh uptick in yields on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond rekindled fears about the effect of higher borrowing costs on corporate profits.Hawkish interest rates comments from a Federal Reserve official and news of a record trade deficit further undermined sentiment.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent at 10,972.28, while the S&P 500 lost 0.5 per cent to 1,272.23 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent to 2,249.72.Worries about rising interest rates prompted sell-offs in financial and technology stocks, although defensives such as Procter & Gamble saw gains.Chipmakers led the retreat on the Nasdaq, with the Philadelphia semiconductor sector index down 1.4 per cent. Sector heavyweight Intel fell 1.3 per cent to $19.75, National Semiconductorlost 3 per cent to $27.18 and Broadcom shed 2.5 per cent to $45.57.Google fell for the fourth consecutive session, losing 3.1 per cent to $343 after it agreed to settle a lawsuit over online click fraud. UBS cut its price estimate on the stock from $425 to $400, saying the settlement would “antagonise” confidence in its ability to communicate with investors.Google’s weakness weighed on internet portal Yahoo and online retailer Amazon. They fell 2.3 per cent to $30.28 and 1.9 per cent to $36.12 respectively.Intuit, the maker of the TurboTax software, was among the few to buck the down trend. Its shares jumped 6.6 per cent to $51.73 after it upgraded its sales outlook, noting a late surge in business as the tax season shifted into high gear.Losses on the Dow were pared by General Motors, which gained 4.5 per cent to $21.34 even after the United Auto Workers union denied reports that it was close to an agreement with GM to cut labour costs.Elsewhere, news of Imax’s proposed sale drove the entertainment technology company’s stock 9 per cent higher to $10.35.Rumours of outside interest also lifted Sharper Image. Shares in the struggling gadget retailer surged 22.6 per cent to $12.21 after an activist shareholder group said it planned to oust incumbent management.Drugmaker Biogen gained 4.5 per cent to $47.54 after its Tysabri multiple sclerosis drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel.After soaring more than 24 per cent in its market debut on Wednesday, shares of shares of NYSE Group fell 4.9 per cent to $76.10.
115;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2006-03-08T22:49:12Z;FDA panel votes in favour of Tysabri;;Shares in Elan, the Irish biotechnology group, rose by as much as 26 per cent on Thursday in the wake of a US regulatory panel recommendation that suspended multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri is safe enough to return to the market.The panel of experts assembled by the Food and Drug Administration voted 12-0 on Wednesday to recommend that US patients again be allowed to take Tysabri after it was pulled last year because of sudden safety concerns. But the panel has stipulated that the biotechnology groups closely monitor patients for dangerous side-effects.The FDA will make the final decision but usually follows recommendations from advisory panels.Backing for Tysabri is a badly-needed boost for Biogen Idec of the US and its Irish counterpart Elan.The groups withdrew Tysabri a year ago after finding that three patients contracted a rare brain and spinal cord infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Two of the three died.Tysabri suppresses a part of the immune system to treat multiple sclerosis, and the PML cases raised questions over whether it increased patients’ risk of infection. The companies’ shares plunged.But Biogen and Elan’s outlook cleared somewhat yesterday as the advisory panel recommendation pushed away some clouds over Tysabri.The drug, which was once expected to be a blockbuster, is expected to climb back slowly to about $70m in sales this year, according to Goldman Sachs.Elan’s shares, which collapsed following Tysabri’s withdrawal, rose €2.20 to €13.50 in morning trading in Dublin.
116;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Swiss to tackle EU over tax rates;;Switzerland is preparing to send a “firm and clear’’ re-buff to Brussels this month over concerns raised by the European Commission about whether advantageous Swiss cantonal tax rates for companies violate the terms of the free trade agreement between Switzerland and the European Union.Bern will argue that Commission claims about hampering free trade are groundless, both in terms of substance and applicability.“The EU argument is on a very weak basis”, said Stephan Kux, head of EU relations and inward investment for the canton of Zurich, Switzerland’s biggest region. “For a start the free trade agreement excludes the entire services sector.”Both the British and French governments have been angered by Procter Gamble, and its rival Colgate, relocating their European headquarters to Geneva, and Biogen Idec, the US biotech group, moving from Paris to Zug.Experts estimate that foreign companies establishing holding company structures can lower their tax rates in Switzerland to as low as 7 per cent, compared with 12.5 per cent in Ireland and an EU average of about 20 per cent.The issue, which was raised by the Commission at the end of last year, has both surprised and irritated the Swiss, which see it as an unjustified attack on their tax sovereignty as well as an indirect way for Brussels to attempt to harmonise the European corporate tax base, a goal that has also met stiff resistance in many of the 25 EU member states.Switzerland is not a member of the EU, but its crucial economic and political relationship with the surrounding EU block has been regulated by a series of bilateral agreements, including a free trade agreement signed in 1972.A Commission official said Brussels had raised the tax issue both in response to complaints from some EU governments and members of the European parliament. “This issue has been around for some time but the feeling was that we should address it now,” the official said.Switzerland has always argued that tax competition between its 26 cantons has been one of the pillars of its economic success and attractiveness to foreign investors.Low taxes have helped formerly agricultural cantons, notably Zug and Schwyz, attract new investment, while internal competition has spurred higher tax regions to control spending and keep taxes low.The issue of differential cantonal taxation is discussed periodically: late last year, eyebrows were raised when Obwalden, a small, farming based canton, decided to slash company tax in an attempt to emulate Zug and Schwyz.However, such downward leapfrogging has drawn surprisingly little criticism, with most observers seeing such initiatives as attempts to compensate for unfavourable locations or relatively poor infrastructure.Insiders admitted, however, that stressing low taxation exclusively in attempts to attract new inward investment could raise hackles abroad. Such concerns were less evident concerning investments by complete newcomers – such as Google’s decision to establish a research centre in Zurich – than transfers from other European countries.
117;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Biogen and Elan seek to resuscitate MS drug;;"Biogen Idec and Elan Corporation on Monday moved to resuscitate their withdrawn multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, as the two drugmakers submitted safety reviews to US regulators asking for approval to sell it again.Biogen Idec, the US group, and Ireland’s Elan asked for a priority review of
six months for their approval submission to the Food and Drug Administration. The application included two-year trial data, a new safety assessment and a plan to monitor potential risks.The groups, which develop and market Tysabri in partnership, also plan a similar submission for the ongoing approval review process at the European Medicines Agency.Requesting approval from regulators marks an important step for the companies after a damaging setback over safety concerns and two deaths.In February, Biogen and Elan voluntarily withdrew Tysabri and stopped clinical trials when they confirmed two cases of a rare central nervous system disease, one in which the patient died.A review of trial data found a third case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) a year earlier which also resulted in a death.Shares of both groups plunged after the withdrawal of a drug seen as a potential blockbuster and a key to their immediate future growth. Elan shares have fallen almost 70 per cent since the withdrawal, while Biogen’s are more than 40 per cent lower.Elan’s shares closed at $8, and Biogen’s at $38.46 in New York trading on Monday.Moreover, The risk concerns with Tysabri emerged at a time when tensions were high in the US over the regulator’s ability to monitor drug safety, particularly with the controversy over Merck’s withdrawal of pain drug Vioxx.Nevertheless, analysts, patients and the companies pointed to the significant needs of serious conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) and drug risk tolerance”We are grateful to the MS community for their patience and support over the last several months while we’ve conducted an extensive safety evaluation of Tysabri in collaboration with leading experts,” said Dr Burt Adelman, Biogen Idec’s vice president of development.Dr Lars Ekman, head of Elan’s research and development, said: “We are very encouraged by this filing. We strongly believe in the therapeutic benefit of Tysabri and the difference it could make in the lives of patients with MS.”The FDA submission included final two-year data from a trial using Tysabri alone in patients, and another trial using it in combination with Biogen's’ Avonex.They also gave regulators a safety review of patients using Tysabri in clinical trials."
118;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2005-06-02T20:56:30Z;Falling oil and strong tech lift Wall Street;;It was a fight to the finish on Wall Street on Thursday, but the bulls prevailed as falling oil prices and rising technology shares pushed the leading indices higher after a bout of profit-taking.Biogen Idec and Elan, the pharmaceuticals groups, fell amid reports of another setback with a key multiple sclerosis drug.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally to 10,553.59. The S&P 500 rose 2.14 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,204.36, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 9.94 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,097.80.Trading got off to a shaky start as investors digested new data on productivity and jobs. Another report showed rising factory orders in April.Warren West, president of Greentree Brokerage Services, said he had expected some investor hesitation after stocks hit three-month highs on Wednesday amid easing inflation fears and dovish comments on interest rates by the head of the Dallas Federal Reserve.Semiconductors led gainers as stocks perked up in late-afternoon trading. Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip group, rose 1.1 per cent.Energy stocks were mixed after the price of oil fell below $54.ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil refiner, rose 0.3 per cent. Sunoco, a rival, fell 0.4 per cent.Wendell Perkins, senior portfolio manager at Johnson Asset Management, said that high valuations relative to oil prices were beginning to make the energy sector look less attractive. “We’ve been taking money off the table there,” he said.Consumer products groups notched up the worst performance on the S&P, with shares in Avon Products, the cosmetics company, down 1 per cent. Kimberly Clark, the paper products group, fell 1.3 per cent to $64.32.Pharmaceuticals stocks were thrust into the spotlight after reports emerged that a fourth patient being treated with Tysabri, Biogen Idec’s multiple sclerosis drug, may have developed a rare neurological disease.Biogen fell 4.3 per cent to $38.07. The US-listed shares of Elan, Biogen’s Irish partner, dropped 14.3 per cent to $6.85. Shares in both companies plunged earlier this year when Tysabri was recalled from the market after several patients fell ill.Shares in Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, the investment banks, fell after analysts lowered their second-quarter earnings forecasts. Goldman shares fell 1 per cent. JPMorgan was fractionally lower. Lazard shares rose 1 per cent after a prominent banker quit.Eastman Kodak, the photography equipment company, rose 1.4 per cent to $26.94 after it won regulatory approval to buy a Canadian maker of digital printing equipment.DuPont, the chemicals group, fell 1.1 per cent to $46.56 a day after it raised prices in Asia.Consumer discretionary groups were higher. Coach, the luxury fashion group, jumped 4.6 per cent to $32.07.
119;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Elan losses widen on MS drug suspension;;Elan pledged to cut costs in a bid to break even this year, after losses almost doubled in the first quarter as the Irish drugs group counted the cost of the suspension of its Tysabri drug.The group said the withdrawal of its multiple sclerosis drug in February, after two patients contracted a rare and often fatal disease of the central nervous system, had prompted it to cut spending by $100m to $250m this year.Elan hoped this, together with the strong performance from its drug technology operations, would help it to rein in full-year losses.“Our response to the events surrounding Tysabri has been aimed at balancing the need to prudently manage costs while, at the same time, maintaining an appropriate platform from which to advance the company,” said Kelly Martin, Elan’s president and chief executive.Net losses widened to $115.6m from $62.2m in the first quarter, following a $58.6m net operating loss relating to Tysabri. Total revenue decreased 31 per cent to $102.7m as Elan divested a number of products and businesses and also suffered supply shortages of its drug Maxipime.Tysabri, which is being developed with Biogen Idec, Elan’s US partner, generated sales of £12.9m after the group provided for estimated returns of $16.4m and wrote off $14m of Tysabri inventory.Mr Martin said the suspension of Tysabri had been a “disappointment to many constituents including patients, physicians and shareholders”.The market had harboured great hopes that the drug would be the driving force behind Elan’s sustained recovery. The group came close to collapse in 2002 but sales of Tysabri - forecast to reach up to $3bn by 2007 - were expected to return it to profitability.Elan said on Thursday that adjusted full-year losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were expected to be between $240m and $260m, including Tysabri costs and first-quarter revenues. Total revenue was expected to be about $500m.The group added that it was carrying out a comprehensive safety evaluation of Tysabri with Biogen, and would make further adjustments to its cost structure when this was complete.Elan’s shares, which have lost more than 80 per cent of their value since the suspension of Tysabri, inched up 2 per cent to €3.45 in morning trade on Thursday.
120;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2005-04-22T12:31:10Z;Lex: Serono;;It has been a bad year for pharmaceutical surprises. Elan and Biogen shares tumbled in February after they withdrew multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. Serono, Europe's largest biotech company, this month discontinued trials of two new products. The company on Friday shocked the market with a $725m provision in its first quarter results against a possible US fine for allegedly bribing doctors to prescribe Serostim, which treats weight loss in Aids patients.While the company could have managed the news better, the charge needs to be put into perspective. First, it relates to events in 1999. Second, Serono is sitting on a cash and bond cushion of $1.9bn. It is annoying for investors that it might spend nearly half of this on the fine, instead of returning more money to shareholders. But if the $725m marks the end of the matter, it closes the door on an unsavoury episode.Of more concern is its dependence on Rebif, the multiple sclerosis drug, which last year accounted for half Serono's $2.2bn sales. This quarter it rose to 53 per cent the opposite trend to the one investors would like. Sales of other products like fertility drugs were weak. While Serono says it is making progress in areas such as oncology and dermatology, the quality of its pipeline and the sources of future growth are unclear.Ernesto Bertarelli, Serono's chief executive, is better known in the media for his yachting. Maybe he should be spending more energy adding boats to the Serono fleet.
121;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2005-03-04T18:10:35Z;Eurofirst 300 hits 33-month peak;;The best and worst performers in a week when the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed at a 33-month high came from the pharmaceuticals sector following the withdrawal of Tysabri, the multiple sclerosis treatment of Irish drugmaker Elan and its US partner Biogen Idec.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 1.1 per cent over the week to 1,107.58, up 0.7 per cent on the day.Elanhad focused its efforts on Tysabri. Earlier last month it revealed a study showing the drug slowed down the rate of disability from the disease by 42 per cent, making it the most effective MS treatment on the market. But following the death of a patient last weekend, and the suspected infection of another this week, the treatment was withdrawn.The anticipated arrival of the drug has caused some volatility for the stock this year, but overall the news was well received. Coming into this week, the stock stood at €20.44, but by the end had fallen more than 78 per cent to €4.47.Brokers said little about Elan’s woes as investors had already voted with their feet. Rather, they concentrated their efforts on companies with alternative treatments.Switzerland's Serono, which makes rival Rebif, was the week’s biggest gainer on the Eurofirst 300 – up more than 24 per cent to SFr892 over the five-day period – as investors were encouraged by several brokers to switch.Lehman Brothers upped the stock to “overweight” from “equal weight”, while Morgan Stanley raised it to “equal weight” from “underweight”. Deutsche Bank, which upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”, said it was now forecasting Rebif sales growth this year of 9 per cent from 6 per cent.“The investment case at Serono is intricately linked to the fortunes of Rebif and so any respite from the intense competitive pressure it had been facing recently is good news,” said Brian White at Deutsche.Schering, whose positive growth outlook impressed investors on Friday when it presented its annual results, was also a beneficiary from the Elan fallout. Deutsche Bank upgraded it to “buy” from “hold” as a result of the removal of some of the competition from its Betaseron MS treatment.Lehman Brothers raised its price target, re-iterated its “overweight” rating and said: “Even if Tysabri re-enters the market at a later date, we do not believe the label will be sufficient to represent a significant threat to Betaseron.”Schering, which gained 1.1 per cent after its results on Friday, added 4.2 per cent over the week to €55.89.Hopes of further record-breaking results from European oil companies were ignited after crude prices rose sharply this week.Merrill Lynch said it remained committed to its “overweight“ rating on the sector and said among its top picks were Statoil, Norsk Hydro and OMV.Statoilwas the best performer over the week, up 4.6 per cent to NKr114.5, followed by Repsolof Spain, with a weekly gain of 4 per cent to €21.35. Norsk Hydro moved 2.3 per cent higher to NKr540, while OMVgained 3.3 per cent on the week to €266.4.
122;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2005-02-28T21:24:41Z;Wall St in reverse despite fresh merger wave;;US stocks declined as rally fatigue prevailed over Wall Street amid rising oil prices put a lid on animal spirits on Monday.By the close, the S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 1,203.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.7 per cent to 10,766.23. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.7 per cent to 2,051.72. The lockstep changes in the indices suggested the influence of momentum trading.The sluggish start to the week came after a three-day rally put US markets at their highs for 2005. Weighing on the markets was a continued rise in crude prices, which were fuelled by worries about cold weather in the US north-east and the prospects for a production cut by Opec in March.The day’s big loser was Elan, which plunged 70.3 per cent to $8 in heavy trading after the Irish biotech company withdrew its multiple-sclerosis drug Tysabri over safety concerns. Shares in Biogen Idec, which co-markets the drug, fell 42.6 per cent to $38.65.Outside of the pharma blowup,Another bout of Monday merger mania grabbed the headlines and dominated trading. A long-rumoured deal in the retail sector was finally consummated – Federated Department Stores agreed to acquire its rival May Department Stores for $11bn.Shares in Federated rose 27 cents, or 0.6 per cent to $56.45, in part because the retailer said it would increase its annual dividend to $1 a share. Shares in May eased 2.4 per cent to $34.51.Shares in the trucking company USF soared 23.1 per cent to $47.80 after Yellow Roadway unveiled a $1.4bn acquisition. Yellow Roadway’s stock eased 5.8 per cent to $57.75.Also, One planned marriage was called off: King Pharmaceuticals and the general drug maker Mylan Laboratories scuttled their merger over a disagreement on terms. Mylan shares rose 48 cents, or 3.9 per cent to $17.60, while shares in King fell 76 cents, or 6.8 per cent to $9.55.Shares in the volatile satellite-radio companies surged higher after the industry leader XM Satellite unveiled a 30 per cent price increase. XM shares climbed $2.67, or 14.7 per cent to $32.96 and its rival Sirius Satellite gained 34 cents, or 8.2 per cent to $5.57.Shares in Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, climbed 58 cents, or 0.2 per cent to $51.61. It posted unexpectedly strong numbers for February, with same-store sales rising 4 per cent.Wall Street analysts largely shrugged off the market’s modest decline, but some expressed concerns about the prospects that the economy might fuel higher inflation in light of last week’s strong non-farm payrolls data.Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Fleming, said Friday’s jobs report was the highlight of the week.“It’s a good news-bad news situation, we all like to see more people have jobs but no one likes higher costs or higher inflation,” he said.Mr Schweitzer said he continued to view that market as range-bound in the near term because the economy could strike some investors as “too strong for its own good”. Phil Dow, the director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, dismissed concerns about a too strong economy in the near term and said high quality companies that pay a dividend “haven't really done anything”.Before all is said and done, those stocks are going to move higher,” he said
123;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2005-02-28T19:06:48Z;FTSE dips below 5,000 level;;The largest ever profit recorded by a British based bank was unable to inspire the London market on Monday.The FTSE initially rose to 5,030.2 in early trade but the market later went into retreat as sentiment was hit by rising oil prices, concerns over interest rates and a weak start on Wall Street.A plunge in the shares Elan and Biogen Idec after the companies suspended trials of a multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri also weighed on trading. Elan tumbled 69 per cent in London while while Biogen fell 43.4 per cent.The FTSE 100 lost 0.8 per cent at 4,968.5 while the mid-cap FTSE 250 added 0.1 per cent at 7,254. Trading volume was solid at 3.4bn.HSBC fell 2.8 per cent to 868p on concerns that aslowdown in the bank’s dividend growth was a signal from the bank’s management that the organic growth of the business would be weaker in future.HSBC reported record full-year pre-tax profits of $17.6bn for 2004, up 37 per cent over the previous year. However, there were also concerns expressed over higher than expected growth in costs and bad debt.

Both businesses could now become attractive targets for private equity players, according to Panmure Gordon which raised its target price for Bunzl to 540p from 520p previously.“Filtrona is a very attractive business for a private equity buyer so the story is not over yet,” said Mike Murphy of Panmure Gordon. “The results and demerger will focus attention on the very attractive nature of both businesses.”Centrica, the UK’s largest gas and electricity supplier, rose 1.1 per cent to 236.5p and BG Group gained 1.9 per cent to 408.25p on speculation of a merger which would reunite the two companies which demerged from from British Gas in 1997.This was sparked by comments in the weekend press by Sir Roy Gardner. Analysts played down the prospect, saying a link-up with BG Group would bring more international diversification than Centrica would require.They said Centrica needs to replace production and has funds set aside but buying a developed field could prove prohibitively expensive so some kind of long-term partnership seems desirable.Hays, the recruitment group rose 2.5 per cent to 134.25p in anticipation of strong results from the recruitment company today.With copper and aluminium prices continuing to trade at near record levels, mining stocks were prominent among the FTSE leaders with BHP Billiton up 1.1 per cent at 776.5p and Antofagasta up 1 per cent at £13.84.Somerfield rose 0.5 per cent to 188p after Baugur, the Icleandic group said it was continuing to review its options and it would seek a recommendation from the retailer’s board if it decided to proceed with an offer.French Connection rose 2.6 per cent to 315p following weekend press reports Baugur could be looking to take a minority stake in the fashion retailer. Baugur is already exposed to the UK fashion sector through its ownership of Oasis, Karen Millen and Whistles.French Connection’s strength was in marked contrast to Marks and Spencer, down 2 per cent to 350.5p on concerns over early price discounting and Next, off 1 per cent at £15.41.Premier Foods fell 4.7 per cent to 265p as concerns that the impact on the company of the product recall due to contamination by the illegal dye Sudan 1 could be worse than initailly expected.Jardine Lloyd Thompson fell 1.4 per cent to 376.75p as the insurance broker reported disappointing full-year results with a 9.7 per cent fall in underlying pre-tax profits to £99.8m. However, the dividend was maintained at 20.5p which dealers said provided confidence that the company can return rapidly to growth given the cash-generative nature of the business.British American Tobacco fell 0.4 per cent to 955p after the Chinese State Tobacco Manufacturers Association significantly cut the import quota for its brand State Express 555. The impact on earnings is expected to be less than 1 per cent this year but could dent BAT’s long-term prospects in China.Persimmon fell 2.6 per cent to 778p on profit taking after the housebuilder reported record pre-tax profits before goodwill write-offs of £470.4m and a 50 per cent increase in the dividend.“Persimmon is well placed to initiate consolidation within the industry at the right price,” said Tessa Starmer of Seymour Pierce. “However, potential targets still look over valued.”Old Mutual rose 1.1 per cent to 141.75p, helped by strong growth in its US life business and a return to profit by Nedcor, its domestic banking unit. “Overall, the company is delivering growth across its global business and future growth is not reflected in the current share price,” said Geoff Miller of Bridgewell Securities. See more on Old MutualHammerson rose 1.3 per cent to 885p as the property company reported a 89.6 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits figures to £127.2m. The headline figure was flattered by exceptional profits of £40.3m mainly from the sale of properties. Excluding these, adjusted pre-tax profits rose by 1.2 per cent to £86.9m. Net asset value per share rose by 16.6 per cent to 936p from 803p previously, helped by an underlying increase in property valuations of 8.8 per cent overall.Hammerson also announced that Ronald Spinney will retire as Chairman on September 20 2005 to be succeeded by John Nelson, currently a non executive director. Mr Nelson was formerly chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) and vice chairman of Lazard Brothers, having started his career with Kleinwort Benson. He is also deputy chairman of Kingfisher and a non-executive director of BT Group.Associated British Foods dipped 1.1 per cent to 770p after a positive trading statement which said trading in its established businesses was satisfactorily ahead of the previous year and a positive contribution was expected from the acquisitions it had made.The main acquisitions were the international yeast, bakery ingredients and US herbs and spices businesses from Burns Philp, the premium canola oil brand, Capullo, in Mexico and the Billington’s sugar business in the UK. The company said each of these businesses had performed in line with expectations.

Pre-tax profits (before exceptionals and goodwill) rose 27 per cent to £172m, beating analysts’ forecasts. Inchcape hinted that an acquisition announcement was fairly imminent but analysts said this was more likely to be a small private group rather than a listed company. Panmure Gordon raised its target price £23.00 from £21.50 previously.Having run up on Friday in anticipation of strong results, Persimmon fell 2.6 per cent to 778p on profit taking after the housebuilder reported a 33 per cent increase in pre-tax profits (before goodwill amortisation) to a record £470.4m and a 50 per cent increase in the dividend. “Gearing has reduced to 15 per cent and we think Persimmon is well placed to initiate consolidation within the industry at the right price,” said Tessa Starmer of Seymour pierce: “However, we maintian our view that potential targets still look over valued.”British American Tobacco fell 0.4 per cent to 955p after the Chinese State Tobacco Manufacturers Association significantly cut the import quota for its brand State Express 555. The impact on earnings is expected to be less than 1 per cent this year but could dent BAT’s long-term prospects in China. Michael Smith of JP Morgan said “We estimate that BAT was exporting 5 -10bn sticks per annum into China and that this is likely to decline to well below 5bn sticks per annum.”Among the smaller companies, Phytopharm fell 19.8 per cent to 151.5p after the biotech group, which specialises in developing medicines made from plants, shelved plans for a £24m fund raising. The delay came after its Japanese partner dropped the development of Cogane, an experimental Alzheimer’s drug. This left some investors fearing a cash crunch at the company, although Phytopharm said it expected to receive a £4m milestone payment from its former partner. The fund raising could be revived.Reed Health slumped 23 per cent to 50p after the medical recruitment group warned trading difficulties at a number of its units would cause it to miss analysts’ expectations, set at about £4.5m for 2005.

A deal could be announced on Wednesday.Faroe Petroleum gained 4.9 per cent to 119p after the oil and gas group reported narrowed 2004 losses of £178,000, from £722,000 a year earlier. The company has no producing assets, but is focused on developing the area between the Faroe and Shetland Island.“The potential of this area for oil and gas exploration is enormous as it contains some of the largest producing fields in the UK,” said Durlacher in a note.Domino’s Pizza rose 1.3 per cent to 235.5p after the fast food delivery group reported a 35 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to £8.8m.

125;BIIB;Biogen Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
