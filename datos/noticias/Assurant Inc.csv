It is a cheaper type of income protection that pays out for shorter periods of time – typically one to two years.Cardif Pinnacle said that the price rise was a direct result of more people making claims on their insurance in 2009, as the recession hit and more people found themselves out of work.Assurant has also raised its premiums for some customers, citing “exceptional” volumes of claims over the past 24 months. One policyholder, a former company director, complained to Assurant after his premiums rose from £82.50 to £143 per month – a 74 per cent increase.This wave of increases comes just six months after the Financial Services Authority (FSA) intervened last year to force insurers to rebate millions of customers who had faced premiuim increases on their payment protection insurance policies in 2009.The FSA was concerned that insurers had not been clear or fair enough about their right to increase premiums. Insurers were required to tighten their policy paperwork and small print before notifying customers of any further rate changes.Consumer group Which? says that while consumers are receiving refunds, the regulator “must come down hard on any who continue to put the squeeze on their policyholders by hiking
premiums.”But the FSA has since clarified that the “onus was on the business to decide what is fair”.“We are not specific about what is fair in terms of a change to premium but if a firm said they were getting increased claims that would be a valid reason for increasing premiums,” says an FSA spokesman. “If customers are not happy with the premium increase and think it unfair, they can cancel the policy.”The Association of British Insurers (ABI) agrees with the FSA that insurers need to be able to show that any premium increases are “proportionate” to any increase in their claims costs. But policyholders who are unhappy with premium increases that have come into effect this year are advised not to cancel a policy too quickly, as they may find it hard to buy new like-for-like cover.Some insurers have tightened terms recently, by increasing qualifying periods – the amount of time a person has to be off work before they can make a claim – from 30 to 60 days. Individuals whose health has worsened will also find it harder to obtain equivalent cover, as will those working in sectors that pose a greater risk of redundancy.“In my view people working for Cadbury’s, airlines, the construction industry and financial services sector should stick with their existing policy,” says Bob Cook, of Platinum Financial Consulting, the independent financial advisers.“Better quality products may emerge at a more reasonable premium later in the year. If that coincides with the start of a recovery in the job market, that may be a much better time to review your options.”Insurers have until the end of June to refund premium increases made in 2009.Case study:Clare Mullen, an air stewardess from Glasgow, was angered when her insurer, Assurant, tried to raise the premiums for her MPPI policy by 82 per cent last year – and thinks that any future rises would be “grossly unfair”.The 51-year-old was paying £41 a month to cover £1,100 a month but was notified that her premiums were about to rise to £75 per month. “I couldn’t afford the increase, but I couldn’t afford not to have a safety net either,” she says. “So I reduced my cover to £650 a month but the premium still rose to £44.“My insurer has not reinstated my cover to where I was before the premium rise, in spite of the FSA’s intervention, so I am paying more, but for half the cover – which isn’t fair or adequate,” she adds.Ms Mullen says that any further increase would force her to give up her insurance. “I would find it hard to get a new policy because I am in a high risk sector, both for redundancy and accidents,” she explains. “I don’t think that it is fair of insurers to penalise existing customers like this, especially ones who have paid over many years in good faith.”"

Excluding the sale of Spanish insurer Seguros Bilbao and the divestment of its share in US company Assurant, profits increased 26 per cent. Earnings per share were 5 per cent higher at €1.10, up from €1.16.Banking performed best with a 40 per cent increase to €776m compared with €553 in 2004, boosted by higher revenues, flat costs and lower debt provisioning.Gilbert Mittler, Fortis’ chief financial officer, said the group was on track to meet the goal of 10 per cent compound annual earnings growth over the next five years, set by the chief executive, Jean-Paul Voltron, in late February.However Mr Mittler stressed it was an average growth rate, and said more details on this growth strategy would be revealed in a market update on June 24.Fortis wants to quit the African market, where its Belgolaise Bank operates in 12 countries. “We are slowly but surely evaluating all the options, including the sale of that company,” Mr Mittler said.In April, Fortis announced it had bid €985m for Disbank, Turkey’s seventh-largest privately-owned bank. The sale was expected to be completed in late June or early July.Turkey’s thriving economy has attracted several European banks, including UniCredito and BNP Paribas, to make acquisitions there recently.Fortis also opened three new business centres, in Italy, Switzerland, and Germany, during the quarter and plans to expand the number of centres in 25 countries, but Mr Mittler would not say whether that rate would continue.“It’s very difficult to know exactly the planning of the opening of that type of branches. It depends very much on finding the right people and the right customer bases,” Mr Mittler said.Income from outside the Benelux countries was 15 per cent and was on track to reach 30 per cent by 2009, Mr Mittler said.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
