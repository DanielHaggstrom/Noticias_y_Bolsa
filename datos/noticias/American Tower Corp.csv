0;AMT;American Tower Corp;2019-05-30T12:58:58Z;American Tower buys African masts group Eaton in $1.85bn deal;Acquisition could trigger further M&A in market seen as ripe for consolidation;American Tower has acquired African masts business Eaton Towers for an enterprise value of $1.85bn.The deal could trigger more activity in the African towers market, which has long been tipped for consolidation. Towers have become tradeable assets for telecoms companies worldwide with the US, Africa and India leading the pack in splitting the masts from the operations side of the sector.European companies have been slower to embrace the split, although Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom have moved to review their huge mast portfolios while smaller companies Sunrise and Altice in Portugal have sold their towers, opening up an opportunity for independent companies such as Cellnex to hoover up thousands of towers.Eaton Towers, which was founded in 2008, owns 5,500 towers in Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Burkina Faso and Niger, which it leases back to carriers including Orange, Tigo, Vodacom and MTN.The company was due to list shares in London and Johannesburg last year but pulled the float. The Financial Times reported at the time that the initial public offering was expected to flush out a bidder such as American Tower, one of the largest independent mast owners in the world.Eaton Towers was founded by Terry Rhodes, who launched African mobile phone company Celtel and remains its chief executive, alongside former Orange chief executive Sanjiv Ahuja and Alan Harper, a Vodafone veteran who now chairs satellite company Avanti. Its largest investors are Capital Group Private Markets, Development Partners International, Ethos Private Equity and Standard Chartered’s private equity arm.IHS Towers and Helios Towers, another African group to have pulled a London listing last year, also operate large African mast networks.“To grow from an idea of a few people 10 years ago to become a leader in African shared telecoms infrastructure with approximate annual revenue and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of $250m and $150m respectively and bottom-line profitability is a unique achievement,” Mr Rhodes said on Thursday.Jim Taiclet, chief executive of American Tower, said: “This transaction will significantly augment our existing footprint in Africa and positions ATC to take even better advantage of the growth opportunity in the region as 4G mobile data technology is deployed to serve millions of Africans over the coming years.”
1;AMT;American Tower Corp;2019-01-04T16:44:20Z;Global property: mortar attack;Despite a good quarter, the market has natural doubts about real estate;At times like this, the portfolio manager’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of defensive stocks. She or he will look for companies that can survive an economic downturn, as signalled by the decline in asset prices. Foodmakers fit the bill. But property? Shares are notoriously cyclical. But they had a good run relative to broader world stock markets last quarter. That should be a blip.It was a terrible period for the MSCI World index, down over 13 per cent in dollar terms. Its real estate constituents lost only a third of that, better than most defensive sectors such as consumer staples and drugs. US real estate investment trust American Tower rents out mobile phone and broadcast towers, easily covering dividend payments with its rising cash flow. Hammerson, in contrast, has big exposure to the UK’s ailing retailers. American Tower powered ahead. Hammerson was hammered.Despite a good quarter, the market has natural doubts about real estate. Share prices react quickly to market moods. Land values less so. Discounts to net asset value have widened. In Europe, this figure is at 20 per cent, according to data from Green Street Advisors, a five-year low. Net loan-to-value for European developers is up slightly to almost 40 per cent. But at least a buffer exists should asset prices crash.Chinese markets have priced in doomsday. There the discount has returned to the level of the global financial crisis at more than 40 per cent. Property stocks can expect periodic pummellings. Residential developers are most exposed. This time prices-to-forward earnings ratios for Chinese developers are cheaper than ever at 5 times. That might reflect debt worries. Evergrande, the largest, stands out with net debt per share worth 95 per cent of Citi’s estimated NAV.A lot of worry is already priced into this sector. But given the threat of an extended global economic slowdown, a contrarian bet is unwise.
2;AMT;American Tower Corp;2018-03-01T22:39:19Z;Helios joins African telecom tower IPO charge;Mobile infrastructure groups plan London listing;Helios Towers Africa is set to float in London and Johannesburg in an initial public offering that will value the African mobile phone towers operator at around £2bn, including debt. The listing, expected to take place later this month, is the second move by an African-focused company in the sector to tap the London markets. Eaton Towers is closing in on its own London listing that would value the company at about £1.5bn, including debt.Helios owns more than 6,500 towers in Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Ghana. It had revenue of $345m in 2017 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of $146m. It has $600m in debt. The company was founded in 2009 and is chaired by Allan Cook, the former Cobham chief executive and WS Atkins chairman. Kash Pandya was appointed as chief executive in 2015 when he joined from Aggreko, where he was head of its international operations.Helios is owned by a host of funds including Soros Fund Management and Albright Capital Management, as well as telecoms companies Millicom and Bharti Airtel. No funds will be raised by the float.Helios is one of three major African tower companies looking to list alongside Eaton Towers and IHS, which is the largest player but is unlikely to look at to London, according to industry experts.Eaton is expected to reveal its plans in the coming weeks with a listing in London and Johannesburg also planned. The company has also been tipped as a takeover target with US buyers, including American Tower, which has expanded into Africa, potentially interested, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Eaton Towers has declined to comment on its plans. It appointed Jim Sutcliffe, the former chief executive of Old Mutual and Prudential’s UK business, as its chairman ahead of the planned float. African tower companies hope to appeal to investors by pointing to long-term contracts in fast-growing markets where data revenue is booming as lower-cost smartphones are launched across the continent.
3;AMT;American Tower Corp;2018-02-28T05:00:31Z;Eaton Towers closes in on £1.5bn London listing;Africa-focused telecoms infrastructure group appoints insurance veteran as chairman;Eaton Towers, the Africa-focused mobile phone towers operator, has appointed insurance industry veteran Jim Sutcliffe as chairman and is closing in on a London listing that would value the company at roughly £1.5bn, including debt. The company is set to reveal the details of an initial public offering in the coming weeks, according to people with direct knowledge of the plan. Eaton is one of three African towers companies looking to list, alongside Helios Towers Africa, which is also considering a London listing, and IHS Towers.UK-based Eaton has built up a portfolio of 5,000 towers in five African markets, spread broadly across Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Niger and Burkina Faso.The company is owned by Capital Group Private Markets, Development Partners International, the Ethos Consortium and Standard Chartered’s venture arm, who are looking to sell having backed the business since 2011.Eaton is pursuing a primary listing in London and will also seek to float in Johannesburg. It will not be raising new funds as part of the process. The company has been tipped as a takeover target with US buyers, including American Tower, which has expanded into Africa, potentially interested, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Eaton Towers declined to comment on its plans. Mr Sutcliffe is a former chief executive of Old Mutual and Prudential’s UK business, and has spent three decades in the insurance industry. In 2015, he resigned from the board of the Financial Reporting Council after accepting millions of share options to join Quindell, the claims processor, in an apparent breach of the body’s corporate governance rules. Eaton Towers was founded in 2008 by Terry Rhodes, who launched African telecoms operator Celtel, former Orange chief executive Sanjiv Ahuja and Alan Harper, a former Vodafone executive. Mr Rhodes is still chief executive. Listed tower companies performed well in 2017 with American Tower and SBA Communications in the US and Cellnex in Spain rising in value. However there have been two failed floats of European tower companies in the past two years. Telefónica pulled a listing of its Telxius unit due to valuation concerns and the inclusion of subsea cables alongside its masts. It later sold a stake in the unit to KKR, the private equity firm.Arqiva, the UK broadcasting and mobile phone towers company, pursued a dual-track process to either sell or float the company last year but both attempts failed after concerns were raised over its debt and the long-term outlook of the broadcasting industry.
4;AMT;American Tower Corp;2017-05-24T13:14:08Z;Sunrise sells mobile masts to Cellnex in SFr500m deal;Swiss telecoms company is latest to offload physical infrastructure to cut costs;Swiss telecoms company Sunrise has sold its 2,239 mobile towers to Cellnex, in the latest move by a European telecom company to offload physical infrastructure in an attempt to cut costs and raise cash.Cellnex, the acquisitive Spanish tower company, led a partnership that included Deutsche Telekom’s investment arm and Swiss Life, the insurer, to seal the SFr500m (£394m) acquisition that expands its estate to 23,000 towers across Europe.Sunrise follows in the footsteps of other operators including Wind in Italy and Bouygues in France to sell off towers to specialist companies. Larger telecoms companies Telecom Italia and Telefónica have sold or listed parts of their tower businesses without ceding control.Private and public investors see towers as good infrastructure assets offering fixed long-term returns, while telecoms companies look to exit the sector and focus on other areas. The model is well established in the US by companies such as American Tower, and is becoming increasingly popular in Africa and Asia.Olaf Swantee, chief executive of Sunrise, said that specialist companies are better at dealing with “concrete and steel” assets. “A telecoms company is not great at dealing with leasing agreements and landlords,” he said.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningSunrise, which was owned by private equity companies before its initial public offering in 2015, will use the funds to lower its debt with the goal of achieving an investment-grade credit rating. It will also spend more on its network and increase dividend payments.Switzerland has stronger network coverage than the UK, according to Mr Swantee who said that Sunrise, the smallest of the four Swiss telecoms companies, has 90 per cent geographic coverage despite the country’s mountainous terrain.Arqiva, the UK broadcast and mobile towers company, confirmed this week that it is up for sale which could provide an entry into the UK market for a specialist buyer although the company’s debt has deterred trade buyers in the past.Sunrise shares gained as much as 2 per cent on Tuesday.
5;AMT;American Tower Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Euro tower companies: right call;Telecoms companies should look at selling the infrastructure and leasing it back;The deals practically make themselves. European telecom companies need capital for network investment. As bond yields fall in Europe, meanwhile, investors’ need for alternative sources of income grows acute. So the former should sell their infrastructure, and lease it back. Done and done.This has long been a popular idea in the US. Companies such as American Tower and Crown Castle — both tax-advantaged real estate investment trusts — own towers and rent space on them for antennas. Given long-term contracts with carriers, the scarcity of towers, and low maintenance capital needs, they can carry lots of debt. Both companies have net debt exceeding their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by five times. As Reits, they must return most of their profits to investors. Investors are happy with the structure: they both trade at price to earnings ratios above 40, leaving their dividend yields well below 2 per cent.Tower business exists in Europe, too. In February, Italy’s EI Towers bid for rival Milan-listed Rai Way, owned by the Italian broadcaster Rai. The latter insisted on maintaining majority control of its towers. Last week, EI appeared to consent to buying a minority stake. Both companies trade at lower valuations than their US equivalents — partly because they lack the tax advantages of Reits and due to their much smaller size. Their price to earnings multiples are in the 30s.There could soon be more traded Europeans in the industry. Abertis, the Spanish infrastructure company, plans to spin off a majority stake in its own telecom asset business as Spanish-listed Cellnex Telecom. Assuming valuation multiples similar to EI or Rai Way, it could be worth €3-4bn.The fact that the Europeans need not pay out the bulk of earnings may be an advantage — providing more flexibility to invest when opportunities appear, and making them less sensitive to swings in interest rates. That discount to US peers looks attractive.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
6;AMT;American Tower Corp;2014-07-29T17:01:20Z;Windstream soars on Reit spin-off plan;;The US telecoms sector climbed on Tuesday after a small wireline network announced plans to spin off part of its business into a real estate investment trust, establishing a new way for rivals to derive value from assets.Windstream, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, said it would turn its existing fibre and copper network, as well as other fixed real estate assets, into a publicly traded Reit, allowing the new company to avoid federal income taxes.The approach has been tried by cellular tower operators like American Tower, but not by a larger cable or fibre optic network owner.Windstream said its board of directors had received a favourable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, although it will still require regulatory approval.“Given the IRS approval, we expect other companies may explore the possibility of spinning off their wireline assets into a similar structure,” Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said.Analysts with Credit Suisse said AT&T and Verizon were likely evaluating a similar strategy, but would “have the advantage of waiting to see how the Windstream transition plays out”.The conversion to a Reit comes as many companies, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector, evaluate means to reduce taxes. Several, including AbbVie, are hoping to redomicile overseas to reduce their tax bill.The news sent shares of S&P 500 listed telecom operators broadly higher. Windstream soared 12 per cent to $11.83, AT&T rose 3 per cent to $36.59, Verizon advanced 1 per cent to $51.97 and Telephone & Data Systems increased 5 per cent to $25.92.UPS was under pressure after the company, which together with FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL dominates the business of shipping parcels around the world, cut its profit forecast for the year as it invests in its business.The company said it would expand operations on the day after Thanksgiving in the US as part of a $175m increase in operating expenses. UPS executives hope to avoid a surge in demand last year that left it incapable of meeting delivery targets.Earnings per share will now be between $4.90 and $5.00 this year, UPS said, compared to a previous forecast of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.Shares of UPS are among the worst performing on the Dow Jones transport index this year. The company declined 4 per cent on Tuesday to $98.86 while rival FedEx dropped 2 per cent to $147.14.A 17 per cent slide in second-quarter profits and tepid third-quarter earnings guidance from Herbalife sent its shares 14 per cent lower to $58.35.Net income at the nutrition supplement company declined to $120m, or $1.31 per share, shy of Wall Street expectations. Sales climbed 7 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Herbalife has sought to keep shareholders on board amid its battle with Mr Ackman, the founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund who claims the company is a pyramid scheme.The company, which denies Mr Ackman’s allegations, accelerated its $1.5bn share buyback plan earlier this year.Both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a probe into the allegations.Darden shares rose 4 per cent to $46.88 after the company said Clarence Otis, who has served as Darden’s chief executive for nearly a decade, would step down at the end of the year amid an ongoing tussle with activist investor Starboard Value.The shake-up within Darden’s executive suite came as the company entered settlement discussions with Starboard regarding the firm’s proxy contest.Darden, which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said it would trim the list of nominees to its board of directors to ensure at least three Starboard nominees are elected at the company’s annual general meeting in September.Overall, US equity markets trended lower despite rising consumer confidence figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,969.95 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,912.11. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 4,442.70.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
7;AMT;American Tower Corp;2014-05-08T10:59:09Z;Sun Hung Kai: trying times;Kwok brothers’ property developer may be worth another look;Since the billionaire co-chairmen of Sun Hung Kai Properties were arrested in connection with a bribery investigation two years ago, shares in the property developer have underperformed the sector by at least 20 per cent. On Thursday, the trial of Thomas and Raymond Kwok and three co-defendants began in Hong Kong. All plead not guilty. This year, property blue-chip SHKP has beaten the Hang Seng and local peers, losing 3 per cent to the market’s 7 per cent. Time to look again?SHKP’s landmark projects – Kowloon’s 118-storey International Commercial Centre and, across the harbour, the 88-floor International Financial Centre – are highlights of the city’s skyline. By market capitalisation it is second among Hong Kong real estate companies to Li Ka-shing’s Cheung Kong, and fourth globally after Simon Property and American Tower. Apart from a mobile network licence in Hong Kong, SHKP sticks to what it knows: property development and management in Hong Kong and the biggest mainland cities. Its A plus credit rating is the strongest in the sector, jointly with Japan’s Mitsubishi Estates.Solidity is rarely exciting but it can be undervalued. A bonus warrants issue in February – one per 12 shares, exercisable over two years – has not helped market mood. Nor have softening Hong Kong property prices. Yet averaging analysts’ net asset value estimates produces a NAV of HK$170. SHKP historically trades about 25 per cent below NAV but this year the gap has averaged 43 per cent. The trial is expected to last two months, with intense coverage. It will weigh on the stock. But SHKP has spent two years coping with the issue, during which time it has broadened its top management and proceeded with business as usual. A bet now carries risks – but, by historical standards, not particularly expensive ones.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
8;AMT;American Tower Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
9;AMT;American Tower Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;AT&T / Crown Castle: finding solutions;"A pricey deal for Crown; a mystifying one for AT&T";Crown Castle’s corporate motto – “We are solutions” – is a beautiful example of its genre, a distillate to which other amorphously positive but utterly meaningless slogans can only aspire. It could be used equally well as a tag for anything, so one might as well apply it to Crown’s deal to assume control of 9,700 of AT&T’s cellular masts in return for $4.85bn, announced on Sunday. What problems does the deal solve?For Crown, the problem is how to take advantage of a market that is high on mast companies in general and Crown in particular. Over the past two years, Crown’s shares have returned 70 per cent, pasting the wider market and its peer American Tower. This has driven its enterprise value to a heady 17 times next year’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. The justifications for this valuation are familiar. The company will convert to a Reit structure next year, so reducing taxes and increasing the profits that can flow to investors. Demand for wireless data capacity rises relentlessly. The business is very stable as it runs on to long-term contracts. That the market buys these justifications makes it easier for Crown to buy these assets at a dizzy price – 19 times the cash flow the masts will contribute even before the costs of financing the deal – with only modest grumbling from the market (Crown’s shares fell a per cent or 2 on news of the deal).What AT&T is trying to solve is less clear. The company does not need to reduce debt. It could use the cash for share buybacks but, until AT&T says otherwise, the Crown cash will fuel speculation about an offer for Vodafone. Vodafone, after the cash from its Verizon Wireless stake comes in and is paid out to investors, will cost at least $70bn, or 6 times ebitda, even before a control premium is factored in. The cash from Crown only solves a fraction of that problem.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
10;AMT;American Tower Corp;2013-09-06T22:11:29Z;US stocks steady on lacklustre jobs report;;US stocks shook off a poor jobs report and international tension about intervention in Syria to move slightly higher in midday trading, putting the S&P 500 on track to finish higher on the week.One of the week’s biggest risers was JC Penney, which added 0.4 per cent to $14.27 on Friday.The retailer ticked up 14.3 per cent on the week after Bill Ackman, hedge fund manager, disclosed that he was exiting his position in the company after a difficult year that included an ill-fated decision to bring in a chief executive from Apple.JC Penney shares remain off 27.6 per cent in 2013.US shares began the day on a downward tilt before rebounding to trade higher in late morning in New York. The S&P 500 closed the day up fractionally at 1,655.16, with five of the 10 major sectors trading higher.The benchmark index finished the week 1.4 per cent higher.However, the day’s uptick took on a decidedly defensive stance, with utilities stocks the main beneficiary of the rally. The sector was up 0.6 per cent, led by AES Corporation, 3 per cent higher to $13.09 and Edison International better by 1.5 per cent to $45.04.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day off 0.1 per cent to 14,922.50, but 0.8 per cent higher on the week. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed the day slightly higher at 3,660.01, up 2 per cent for the week.E-Trade Financial was among the best performers, up 4.6 per cent to $16.26 after a Goldman Sachs analyst upgraded the company to “buy” from “neutral”. The company received approval on Wednesday for a $100m capital distribution plan.American Tower, the real estate investment trust, which operates mobile phone towers, rose 4.6 per cent to $71.91 after the company announced that it would purchase privately held MIP Tower Holdings for $4.8bn.American Tower was also helped by a retreat of bond yields that have recently taken their toll on Reits. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries was off 7bp to 2.93 per cent.That helped send Reits, which tend to perform better in a low yield environment, when interest payments are appealing, broadly higher. The Vanguard Reit ETF was up 1.6 per cent to $64.80.Smith & Wesson, the gunmaker, fell after the company scaled back its forecast for the current quarter. Shares in the company were off 10.2 per cent to $10.31.The firearms manufacturer has recently benefited from concern among customers about possible gun legislation after a series of high-profile shootings in the US. Smith & Wesson remains up 22.2 per cent in 2013.Quiksilver, apparel producer, rose sharply after announcing third-quarter figures that beat expectations. The company, known for its surf style, was up 31.7 per cent to $6.85 and is now more than 61 per cent higher on the year to date.Friday’s move upward gave the S&P 500 a four-day rally to start September. Investors pushed 21 of the 24 S&P industry subgroups higher on the week.The breadth of buying indicated a broad confidence and the lack of serious concern about the ramifications of growing tensions over Syria, said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.“I think that the market has been doing a pretty good job ignoring or at least blocking out a lot of the rhetoric surrounding Syria,” he said. “The performance for the S&P 500 through last night was pretty much contrary to its reputation. The S&P normally has fallen in September.However, he added, the lacklustre jobs news and general acceptance that tapering will happen sooner than later may limit investor confidence going forward.“I think investors are ready for the rally to switch from being liquidity led to fundamentally driven. I think investors would have felt better if they saw a stronger employment report because they realise that tapering is an inevitability,” he said.“I think what’s causing investors to be worried by tapering is not necessarily that rates are rising, but that they don’t believe that the economy is strong enough to stand on its own two feet without Fed support.”
11;AMT;American Tower Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Ex-Blackstone top executive in French telecoms towers race;;Blackstone Group’s former top executive in Asia has emerged as the leading contender to buy the French assets of TDF, Europe’s largest telecoms tower operator, in a deal that could be worth €3.8bn, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.Dering Capital, the firm started by Ben Jenkins after he left the US private equity group in 2011, is competing against separate bids from Canadian pension groups CPPIB and PSP Investments for the assets, which are being sold by buyout group TPG.American Tower is also looking at the French business, according to two of the people close to the process. Dering Capital has submitted a non-binding offer that is close to the €3.8bn minimum valuation – including debt – that the sellers have requested, they said.Dering Capital relies on a group of wealthy co-investors – including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and families in Asia – to fund its deals on an ad hoc basis.TPG and Axa Private Equity, which together own 60 per cent in TDF, are seeking to sell TDF in segments after taking control of the company in 2006, in a deal worth €5bn including debt.So far, all the indicative bids for TDF France have come in below the sellers’ asking price. At that level, they would enable the sellers to reimburse only the company’s debt, people familiar with the talks said – indicating the challenges in selling the large private equity assets bought during the credit boom.Mr Jenkins has experience of deals in the sector. He was involved in Blackstone’s investment in US telecoms tower operator Global Towers, which was sold to Macquarie in 2007 for $1.43bn.He left Blackstone soon after Michael Chae was moved from the New York office to Hong Kong in December 2010 to head the operations there.Dering Capital could not be reached for comment.
12;AMT;American Tower Corp;2013-07-21T17:27:07Z;Short-sellers: sound and fury;Carson Block gets little traction on his latest short call;"Rebellion is hard to keep up. Biting the head off a bat on stage works brilliantly. But how to follow up? The high-profile short-seller has a similar problem. Maintaining a market-moving reputation requires ever-bigger targets.Carson Block’s Muddy Waters Research, which once chewed on flighty Chinese companies, wants to move up the food chain. Its latest report, out last week, is on American Tower, a US cellular mast operator with a $30bn market value. The note contains arguments that might appear in any bearish report, spiced with two sharp points about the company’s accounts. American Tower’s chief executive, we are told, is a big seller of its shares. Real estate investment trusts – a structure American Tower just adopted – are in a bubble. Foreign profits will be hard to repatriate and currency exposure, unhedged. Wireless infrastructure is shifting away from masts. The company has overpaid for debt-funded acquisitions. Interesting, non-scandalous stuff.The spicy allegations are that the company may have fraudulently overstated the price of an acquisition in Brazil by $250m and that it entered sale-leaseback deals which are, in effect, loans – temporarily pumping up rental revenue.American Tower has offered a detailed response to the fraud claim; said its accounts were audited; and disputed other charges. The market has shrugged: the shares are off just 3 per cent since the report came out. If Mr Block’s more exciting claims turn out to be empty, using them to get attention for a sensible but dull sell report is dirty pool. That said, noisy short-sellers should be given leeway.

13;AMT;American Tower Corp;2013-02-28T19:24:44Z;American Tower: risks and rewards;One important concern is leverage;The riskiness of a stock is often thought to vary inversely with its price/earnings ratio. Stocks receive a high p/e for growth potential, but they can blow up. Low-growth, low p/e stocks chug along. American Tower, which owns cellular masts from the US to Chile to India, looks like a safe, high-multiple exception.The tower business is steady for several reasons. It runs on long-term contracts. Multiple carriers can lease space on a single tower, so which carrier is ascendant hardly matters. Wireless usage rises relentlessly. Mast sites and permission to build are scarce, a high barrier to entry. American’s shares have quadrupled the market’s return since 2008.The business is capital-intensive – land must be bought or leased and towers built – so returns on capital are not stellar, at about 7 per cent (returns improved last year when the company converted to a real estate investment trust, reducing taxes). But American can raise capital cheaply. Its equity, at 35 times forward earnings, has a sub-3 per cent earnings yield, and its 10-year bonds yield under 4 per cent.And American is growing. It pays its distributions from cash flow and uses what is left – and takes out debt – to snap up new sites, primarily outside the US. This has made American’s capital structure increasingly debt-heavy, but the acquisitions contribute profits quickly, and debt-to-earnings ratios, while high, have remained stable.What could go wrong? Almost every Wall Street analyst has a buy on the stock, reason enough for worry. Should interest rates start to climb, any company that, like American, is leveraged and has a debt-funded acquisition strategy is going to get stung. Large-scale consolidation in the US market would decrease demand, but even failing that, as Macquarie research has emphasised, American’s organic growth in the US market could soon slow. Wireless carriers have been fighting to best each other’s 4G networks. That means putting up a lot of new antennas. The arms race may be petering out, though. No company is perfectly safe.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,078.64.Vivendi’s shares extended a two-day rally, fuelled by news that Egyptian telecoms magnate Naguib Sawiris was considering an acquisition of SFR, the French media and telecoms group’s domestic telephone company.The potential deal is estimated to be valued between €13bn and €14bn.The shares rallied 1.8 per cent to €15.97. The stock has gained nearly 8 per cent since Tuesday when the company raised its adjusted net income target for 2012 to €2.7bn off the back of third-quarter results.The CAC 40 index in Paris slipped 0.5 per cent to 3,382.40.Natixis was the worst performing stock on the FTSE Eurofirst 300. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas warned that consensus expectations for the French lender’s 2013 net profit of €1.2bn were too high.Exane BNP Paribas also cut its rating on the stock from “outperform” to “neutral”. The shares fell 5.7 per cent to €2.41.News that KPN will sell some of its German mobile telecoms towers to American Tower Corporation for €393m in order to alleviate its net debt position failed to please investors.Analysts at Bernstein cut their rating on the Dutch group’s stock from “market perform” to “underperform”.Shares fell 5.3 per cent to €4.34, against a 1.8 per cent fall on the wider AEX index to 324.76.Zurich Insurance, Switzerland’s largest insurer by premiums, said it was unable to rule out more writedowns after reporting a fall in net profit of 62 per cent in the third quarter to $477m.The shares fell 3.9 per cent to SFr223.10, compared with a 1.5 per cent fall on the Swiss Market Index to 6,574.56.
15;AMT;American Tower Corp;2011-12-20T23:53:03Z;T-Mobile could sell towers to fund investment;;A month before AT&T announced it would pay $39bn for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, the chief executives of the German company and its American subsidiary outlined a survival plan for the fourth-largest US mobile network.René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, told analysts and reporters in New York in February that T-Mobile USA might sell its extensive network of 7,000 mobile phone towers to help fund investment in a new 4G network based on LTE technology. Such a transaction, which analysts estimated might net about $2bn, could be back on the front burner now that AT&T’s bid has been formally abandoned.Analysts say the most likely potential buyers for T-Mobile’s tower network, then as now, are American Tower or Crown Castle, although neither company has publicly expressed any interest in such a transaction.In recent years, several of the main US wireless operators have sold some or all of their towers, often leasing them back as required. For example, Sprint Nextel sold about 3,000 towers for $670m in 2008.While the sale of the mobile phone network would not cover the full costs of building the LTE network that T-Mobile USA needs to compete with its rivals, it could provide funds that the company could use to gain the wireless spectrum it must acquire before it can begin to contemplate rolling out new broadband wireless data services.Crucially, as Mr Obermann noted in February, the sale of the tower network could reduce T-Mobile USA’s reliance on Deutsche Telekom to fund its future development, enabling the German group to refocus its capital investment in Europe.Mr Obermann said then that T-Mobile USA would sell the assets only if they fetch a good price. “We are definitely not in a rush,” he said, adding that a sale would depend on whether “the financials work out”.
16;AMT;American Tower Corp;2011-08-02T21:02:39Z;US stocks tumble most in a year;;US stocks fell the most in a year on Tuesday, their seventh straight losing session in a row, as worries about the economy outweighed the resolution of the debt ceiling deal.The resolution of the debt ceiling deal, with the Senate’s “yes” vote and President Barack Obama’s signature, only served to unleash a wave of selling, driving the S&P 500 index down 2.6 per cent, its biggest single-day drop since August of last year. The broad index is now down 0.3 per csent for the year.“Stock market sellers had been held in check by the prospect of a debt ceiling relief rally,” said William Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “The largest effect is that it allows investors to focus more fully on the deterioration in the economic fundamentals.”Consumer discretionary and industrial groups were pacing declines, dropping 3.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.Traders were disappointed early on by earnings at Archer Daniels Midland, the food processing group, and by a poor report on consumer spending.The S&P 500 index ended the session at 1,254.05, well below its 200-day moving average of 1,284. Technical analysts said the next resistance level was 1,250, its March low.The Nasdaq Composite index was 2.8 per cent lower at 2,669.24 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.2 per cent to 11,866.62.ADM shares fell 6.2 per cent to $28.60 after it reported second-quarter earnings of 60 cents per share, missing analysts’ target of 84.8 cents.Shares in Emerson Electric, a manufacturing conglomerate, slipped 4.1 per cent to $47.06 after the company warned that orders would slow in the latter part of the year. “US and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft patch,” it said.Parker Hannifin, a manufacturer of mechanical equipment, fell 8.5 per cent to $70.88, its lowest for the year, after it warned that orders from the military and defence sector would be soft, and provided guidance for the year below what analysts were expecting.Retailers began their portion of the earnings reporting season on Tuesday with Coach, the high-end designer, seeing sharp falls after it was reported that personal spending slipped 0.2 per cent in June, below the 0.1 per cent growth expected by economists.“The data on personal income and spending suggests that the third quarter begins with no momentum from the consumer sector,” said Mr Delwiche.Coach shares were off 6.5 per cent to $61.03, down from their all-time highs of $67 reached in July.Retailers are the last major economic segment to report earnings. Many of those reporting later this week were down, including Nordstrom, down 5.8 per cent to $47.05, and Macy’s, off 5.6 per cent to $27.63. Tiffany, the jeweller, paced all declines in the S&P, falling 8.2 per cent to $73.38.The fear is that the non-farm payroll report on Friday, a key measure of consumers’ ability to spend, could be as poor as last week’s GDP figures and Monday’s industrial production survey.“If retailers report weak numbers or guidance, we could see another leg lower in the S&P index,” said David Rovelli, managing director of equity trading at Canaccord Genuity.The debt deal itself is, in part, adding to consternation as those who believe that US stimulus spending has played a crucial part in supporting markets fear that spending caps will make it nearly impossible to approve any additional government help.“We’ve been operating under the assumption for the last two years that equity investors should be bullish until the bill comes due, as democracies rarely choose deflation,” said Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas. “But the bill has come due and we have to reduce our outlook.”Trading in consumer groups would be weaker if not for McGraw-Hill, the US publishing group that also owns Standard & Poor’s.Its shares jumped 7.3 per cent to $44.43 after Jana Partners, a hedge fund, revealed that it had taken a stake, leading to speculation that the company may be broken up .Shares in Pfizer, the drugmaking giant, dropped 4.6 per cent to $18.14 despite it topping second-quarter earnings-per-share targets, coming in at 60 cents versus 58 cents. It said it was bracing for further declines in sales of established drugs such as Lipitor.Exchanges group NYSE Euronext was off by 4.9 per cent to $31.40. It reported earnings of 61 cents in the quarter versus forecasts of 59.5 cents, but warned that revenue capture could slow if trading volumes rebound.MetroPCS, the US wireless group, fell sharply by 37 per cent to $10.26 after it reported earnings well wide of the mark at 24 cents per share versus the 28 cents per share forecast.That result dragged down competitors as well with American Tower falling 3.8 per cent to $50.50.
17;AMT;American Tower Corp;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;Reliance receives fresh offers for towers unit;;Reliance Communications’ efforts to cut its debt took a step forward when the flagship of Anil Ambani’s business empire said it had received several firm offers for its telecoms towers unit.RCom, India’s second-largest mobile phone operator by subscribers, said it had “received formal indicative offers from several interested parties” for Reliance Infratel, although it would not name them.Mr Ambani’s group last year secured a $9bn agreement to sell the telecoms tower business to GTL Infrastructure, the Indian mobile tower group, but the deal collapsed in September. That deal would have helped reduce RCom’s net debt – just more than $7bn as of the end of March – and possibly paved the way for Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates to buy a stake in the Indian group.RCom reiterated on Tuesday that finding a buyer for the assets would help the group make a “substantial reduction” in its overall debt position and stay well within its long-term leverage ratios.It said due diligence was taking place and the company hoped to secure a deal soon, subject to talks. Mukesh Ambani, head of Reliance Industries, had been seen as a possible bidder for all of part of his brother’s telecom assets.However, Reliance Industries said on Tuesday that it was not among the bidders for the towers unit.American Tower, a US group that recently acquired a towers business from India’s Essar, is seen as another possible bidder. But market commentators remain sceptical that RCom will be able to strike a deal at a good price in the current market environment. The announcement comes a day after RCom reported its seventh consecutive fall in quarterly profits and a drop in full-year profits.Syed Safawi, head of RCom’s wireless business, said then that other initiatives were in progress to deleverage. He also said RCom had cut debt costs by shifting to cheaper sources of financing.RCom’s debt position has been a continued source of concern and weighed on the shares, which have fallen 38 per cent in the past year. They closed up nearly 2 per cent on Tuesday at Rs88.50.Analysts say the Indian telecoms sector is ripe for consolidation. But it has become less attractive for investors as they await the outcome of a $39bn probe into alleged corruption into awarding second-generation phone licences in 2008.The former telecoms minister and several telecoms company executives have been charged in relation to the 2G scandal, including some from within Mr Ambani’s own business empire. All deny any wrongdoing.
18;AMT;American Tower Corp;2011-05-03T20:51:55Z;Energy and materials lead Wall St lower;;Shares in Pfizer slipped back after its first-quarter revenues fell short of expectations, weighing on the healthcare sector and helping to lead the wider markets lower for the second consecutive session.The world’s largest drugmaker by revenue reported that sales had fallen slightly in the quarter to $16.5bn, which was short of the $16.6bn expected by analysts.This left shares in the company down 2.8 per cent at $20.44 as investors chose to focus on this revenue miss rather than the company’s 10 per cent increase in net income, which was ahead of what analysts had expected.The market’s disappointment over the results weighed on the healthcare sector with Watson Pharmaceuticals falling 1.2 per cent to $62.63 and Mylan losing 2.5 per cent to $24.23.The S&P healthcare index was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 12.3 per cent this year and one of the best-performing sectors on Wall Street.These losses helped pull the wider markets lower, with the S&P 500 index closing 0.3 per cent softer to 1,356.62.But the biggest drags on the index were energy and material stocks as many commodity prices lost ground.Within the energy sector, Halliburton, the oilfield services company, was down 2.1 per cent to $47.89 while Noble Energy fell 2.9 per cent to $90.60.Disappointing results from Chesapeake Energy also helped to weigh on the sector, with shares in the energy group falling 5.7 per cent to $31.33 after it reported a drop in first-quarter earnings.The S&P energy index fell 2.4 per cent, by far the worst performance of an S&P sector.The materials sector also lost ground, although not by as much, edging back 1 per cent. Massey Energy, the coal miner, fell 3.6 per cent to $65.25 while Consol Energy lost 3.5 per cent to $52.26.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was broadly flat at 12,807.36 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent to 2,841.62.In the previous session, the markets were given an early boost following news on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed by US forces in Pakistan. But the benchmark indices still closed the day slightly lower as investors began to worry about where the market was now heading following the lofty technical highs reached in previous few sessions.Last week, the S&P achieved a 35-month high, the Nasdaq rose to a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.“A lot of technicians are saying we are overbought here and we should move back for a while,” said Linda Duessel, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors.JPMorgan released a downbeat note on Tuesday saying they expected “turbulence” in the equity markets during the coming months because of the turmoil in the Middle East, fallout from the Japan earthquake, US budget deficit concerns and growing inflationary pressures.However, a survey from Charles Schwab, the retail brokerage, found that investor sentiment was at its highest point since late 2009 with 47 per cent of traders surveyed saying that they were feeling optimistic about the market compared with 28 per cent a year ago.In another positive sign on Tuesday, US factory orders rose in March for the fifth consecutive month, in the latest sign of strength in US manufacturing.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in MetroPCS Communications jumped 10.1 per cent to $18.14, the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, after the wireless provider reported a doubling in its first-quarter earningsThis helped to lift the telecoms sector. American Tower advanced 1.9 per cent to $52.52 while AT&T added 2.1 per cent to $31.86. The S&P telecommunications index was up 1.5 per cent.In the utility sector, FirstEnergy put on 6.1 per cent to $42.02 after the power company gave an earnings outlook that surpassed expectations.The gains came despite the fact that the company’s reporting a fall in profits as it booked costs related to its $4.7bn purchase of Allegheny Energy in February.Anadarko Petroleum, the US oil and gas company with a minority stake in BP’s disaster-hit Macondo well, reported a 12 per cent fall in underlying earnings for the first quarter because of a decline in natural gas prices and a rise in costs. The stock declined 2.3 per cent to $78.51.
19;AMT;American Tower Corp;2011-04-20T14:39:03Z;Bumper earnings set broad-based US rally in motion;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped up to its highest point since 2008 led by technology stocks after bumper quarterly earnings reports fromIntel and IBM lifted sentiment.Shares in Intel, the chipmaker, were up 7.8 per cent to $21.41 after reporting first-quarter earnings of 56 cents a share.This was ahead of the 46 cents expected by analysts and about 30 per cent higher than the same period a year ago.IBM’s results were similarly strong with its operating earnings climbing 21 per cent to $2.41 a share, ahead of the $2.30 expected.But the shares were down 0.4 per cent at $164.75 after IBM did not lift its full-year forecast as much as some investors had hoped. Others were concerned about the lower-than-expected new services bookings for the computer company.But the results from both companies were still strong, alleviating concerns that sagging consumer spending, flatter PC markets and disruption to supply chains from the disaster in Japan would dent a tech recovery.Elsewhere in the sector, Yahoo jumped 4.7 per cent to $16.87 on first-quarter sales and earnings that topped estimates.The internet search engine saw a 28 per cent drop in earnings from the same period a year ago but also reported an increase in audience size, pages viewed and time spent on its network of sites.Shares in Apple, the second-largest company in the world by market capitalisation, were up 1.4 per cent to $342.41, ahead of the release of its second-quarter earnings.All this left the S&P technology sector 2.4 per cent higher, the biggest rise on the index in seven months, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 4.3 per cent.That helped the S&P 500 index jump 1.4 per cent to 1,330.36, erasing all the losses sustained earlier in the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 12,453.54, a level not seen since June 2008. The Nasdaq Composite added 2.1 per cent to 2,802.51.Also helping sentiment in the wider markets was better-than-expected US housing data. Existing home sales rose at an annualised rate of 3.7 per cent in March, according to the National Association of Realtors, which was ahead of the 2.5 per cent expected by economists.Material and energy stocks bounced higher as commodity prices advanced amid a weaker US dollar.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, was up 1.2 per cent to $16.64 while Chevron, the energy group, added 2.3 per cent to $107.81. The S&P material and energy sectors were up 1.2 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.Only banking stocks saw meaningful losses in the session after Wells Fargo’sfirst-quarter results disappointed the markets.The fourth-largest US bank by assets reported earnings 1 cent above expectations at 67 cents a share but revenues fell short, leaving the stock down 4.1 per cent to $28.83 at the close.The KBW banking index was down 0.5 per cent.AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, reported 57 cents a share in first-quarter earnings, which was a 39 per cent increase from the same period a year ago, but broadly in line with expectations. Shares in AT&T, the first of the big US telecoms groups to announce its results, were down 0.6 per cent to $30.13 following the news.But the rest of the sector was higher with Sprint Nextel adding 1.3 per cent to $4.80 and American Tower putting on 3.2 per cent to $51.09. The S&P telecoms sector was up 0.4 per cent.Among industrials, United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, added 4.3 per cent to $85.90 after it reported a forecast-beating 17 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings and raised its profit forecast. The S&P industrial sector was up 1.5 per cent.Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator trying to break up an agreed deal between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, reported a 19.6 per cent jump in first-quarter net income as revenues rose across its businesses.Shares in Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent to $27.32 but NYSE, the takeover target, added 1 per cent to $39.08.In deal news, AES, the Virginia-based global power producer, announced that it had agreed to buy DPL, a regional energy company. DPL rose 9.3 per cent to $30.16 while AES added 3.3 per cent to $12.88.
20;AMT;American Tower Corp;2011-03-21T20:55:01Z;Wall St rises as fears over Japan ease;;The telecommunications sector was shaken by news that AT&T will buy T-Mobile USA, while elsewhere on Wall Street sentiment improved as concerns over Japan’s nuclear crisis eased.AT&T announced on Sunday that it was buying T-Mobile from Deutsche Telekom for $39bn in a deal that will create the largest wireless carrier in the US. Shares in AT&T were up 1.2 per cent to $28.26.The news sent Sprint Nextel, the No 3 US carrier, tumbling 13.6 per cent to $4.36. Sprint was itself in talks with Deutsche Telekom to merge with T-Mobile, and this surprise deal with AT&T pulled the rug out from underneath it.The telecoms sector as a whole had a mixed reaction to the news. Verizon Communications, the second-largest US telecoms group by revenues, was up 1.7 per cent to $36.46 but Qwest Communications International fell 3.4 per cent to $6.69. Overall, The S&P telecommunications index was down 0.2 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent to 1,298.38, aided by news over the weekend that engineers had managed to cool down some of the reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 12,036.53, up 3.6 per cent in the last three sessions, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.8 per cent to 2,692.09. The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 15.2 per cent in the session, although it is still up 25.7 since its mid-February lows before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East.The improving situation in Japan lifted some insurance stocks as worries eased somewhat over the extent of their liabilities. Hartford Financial Services Group was up 3.9 per cent to $26.49 while American International Group added 6 per cent to $37.03.The gains for AIG came despite an announcement that its bill for the damage caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami will be at least $700m.The KBW property casualty index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 2 per cent losses last week.Semiconductor stocks also rose as fears over supply constraints resulting from the Japan disaster receded. “Our most recent checks suggest the supply worst-case scenario likely has been averted,” wrote analysts at Citigroup.Applied Materials was up 2.5 per cent to $15.21 while Cirrus Logic added 4.9 per cent to $20.95.Qualcomm, the world’s largest producer of mobile-phone chips, rose 3.7 per cent to $53.63, also helped by news that Sterne Agee & Leach had raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was up 1.8 per cent, bouncing back from the 2 per cent loss seen last week.The industrial sector rallied from its 1.7 per cent loss last week as Japanese tensions eased. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, added 2.4 per cent to $19.72 while 3M put on 2.2 per cent to $90.95.The previous week saw heavy volatility on fears of a nuclear catastrophe in Japan. In the first three days, the S&P 500 lost 3.2 per cent and the Vix volatility index spiked up 46.4 per cent. The markets then rallied somewhat on Thursday and Friday to close only 1.9 per cent lower over the week.Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial said that markets had been trying to get “back to normal” on Friday but were constrained as traders worried about potential bad news over the weekend.“When nothing major happened in Japan over the weekend, the upward momentum was able to take over and lift equities on Monday,” said Mr Warren.Energy stocks benefited from an oil price jump in the session following the bombing of Libya over the weekend and warnings from Muammer Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, of a “long, drawn-out war”.Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, was up 4.4 per cent to $89.72 while Marathon Oil added 4.4 per cent to $51.84. The wider markets appeared unperturbed by the rise in energy prices.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Tiffany & Co was up 5.1 per cent to $60.22 after reporting fourth-quarter profits up 29 per cent, beating market expectations.The jewellery group, which gets 18 per cent of its revenue from Japan, fell 9.3 per cent last week following the disaster.
21;AMT;American Tower Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;American Tower buys Indian assets for $450m;;American Tower is expected to announce as early as Wednesday a deal to buy the mobile phone tower assets of Indian industrial group Essar for $450m in a further step towards the consolidation of the country’s telecommunications industry.The move, the second such deal in India’s tower sector this year, will give the US cell mast operator a foothold in the world’s fastest-growing large mobile market.Essar Telecom Infrastructure is one of India’s largest independent mobile mast companies, with 4,500 towers.“The deal will hopefully be signed tomorrow and then an announcement made,” said a person familiar with the deal. The Essar Group declined to comment.The deal follows the $1.8bn sale last month by mobile operator Aircel, a unit of Malaysia’s Maxis Communications, of its tower unit. The buyer was GTL Infrastructure, India’s largest independent tower company.The GTL and Essar deals reflect intensifying competition in India’s mobile market as more than a dozen operators from round the world slug it out for a share of the country’s more than 500m subscribers.India’s mobile operators need to raise money for auctions of third-generation mobile spectrum and to counter losses from discount tariff programmes while maintaining capital expenditure.Some, such as Bharti Airtel, India’s largest mobile operator, are looking outside India for more profitable opportunities for growth.Bharti is in talks with Zain over a $10.7bn deal to acquire the Kuwaiti telecoms operator’s African networks.Bharti’s controlling shareholder, Sunil Bharti Mittal, is hoping Africa’s under-developed markets will allow him to repeat the growth he pulled off in India even as conditions tighten in his domestic market.Under their deal American Tower will acquire 100 per cent of Essar Telecom Infrastructure, a company that Essar operates separately from its other telecom holdings.These include a minority stake in Vodafone Essar, India’s third-largest mobile operator, controlled by Vodafone of the UK.Essar also has an indirect interest in Indus, India’s largest mobile tower company, with about 90,000 masts, which is controlled by Vodafone Essar, Bharti and another operator, Idea.Essar was advised by Barclays Capital on the American Tower deal.
22;AMT;American Tower Corp;2009-05-14T18:55:42Z;Creditor to predator;;It was 2004 and America’s housing boom was near its height – 2.2m homes were started in the US that year and, if there was one thing they all needed inside and out, it was doors. One main supplier of those: Masonite International, a Canadian company that for 80 years had been in a construction materials business William Mason, its founder, helped develop with his trademarked hardboard.So it came as little surprise that Masonite caught the eye of the mighty Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which days before that Christmas won management’s approval for it to take over the group. Outside shareholders held out against the New York private equity house and a few months later were won round only by an improvement in the terms to value Masonite at C$3.3bn.Four years on, with housing markets ravaged by subprime defaults and the wider crisis those triggered, Masonite finally filed this March for bankruptcy protection in the Delaware and Ontario courts. Under the ownership of KKR, which had borrowed $1.5bn from the banks and issued an additional $770m in high-yield bonds to help gain control, it had closed or consolidated two dozen facilities and, from some 15,000 staff, it was down to fewer than 8,500. Last year the group sold only 36m doors, compared with 55m in 2006.But what is most telling of all about Masonite is who its next owners may be. They are likely to include Oaktree Capital, a little-known investment firm based in Los Angeles. Despite its low profile, Oaktree is emerging as one of the dominant players of an arcane game that will dominate the financial world this year – investing in the debt of troubled companies in anticipation that some debtholders will end up controlling them at bargain prices.In bankruptcy, ownership of a company passes to the debtholders from those who control the equity. But in a twist of fate among the practitioners of tooth-and-claw capitalism, it is the private equity buy-out groups – which loaded with debt the companies they acquired and squeezed those assets to improve their returns – that are now about to be bested by other masters of the fleet-footed financial arts.Among targets of these predators are many of the less happy purchases made by the world’s most renowned private equity firms. “Creditors are about to become the owners of many companies,” says Howard Marks, Oaktree’s chairman. “Equity owners will be wiped out. When you buy with borrowed money, there are some environments you can’t withstand.”The end of the boom brought a halt to the ownership drive by private equity that used cheap debt to acquire ever larger companies, paying a big premium over the public market. In 2005-07, the industry spent almost $2,000bn on deals, according to Carlyle Group. Now, the transfer of part of the west’s corporate landscape to investors in distressed debt is just beginning.Just like private equity, distressed debt investors are used to playing hardball to get their way. But because they thrive on the misfortunes of others, they are inevitably referred to as vultures or grave-dancers. Yet the business of Oaktree and others such as Apollo Management, Avenue Capital and Centerbridge Partners is not for the faint of heart. It has about as much predictability as Russian roulette. Success can depend on obscure legal arguments, with billions of dollars riding on a judge’s interpretation of minor technical points.On the occasions that this pays off, however, distressed debt players can acquire companies at a fraction of the price the private equity firms paid – as little as 20 or 30 cents on the dollar.Buy-out firms have been good at acquiring companies. But their ability to operate them has increasingly been questioned as more and more of the solid operating businesses they own default on their bequeathed debt and file for bankruptcy. The question then also becomes whether investors in distressed debt will be any better at the exigencies of day-to-day business once such groups pass into their hands.Certainly, the approach of each varies greatly. Some are mere traders, wanting to flip their stakes on the slightest rise in the value of the debt or if they can cut a deal with other stakeholders. But Oaktree and Centerbridge are among those to have developed capabilities in owning companies for years, adding value and learning from the mistakes of their previous owners.When the buy-out firms bought these companies during the boom years, executives claimed that the debt they were piling on to their acquisitions would not be a problem. Agreements with lenders imposed virtually no conditions, while innovations such as the ability to suspend cash interest payments on part of the debt gave added flexibility. But, like others, they underestimated the severity of the recession. “Private equity firms anticipated a 30-year storm,” says Mr Marks. “They did not anticipate a 100-year storm. They had good companies but there was too much financial engineering and too much leverage.”By buying cheaply, reducing the debt burden and improving their operating performance, distressed investors are positioning themselves to be able to resell these businesses for huge profits.But first they must identify companies with a sound underlying business but that are faltering because they have too little cash flow to support their debt. Then they have to determine how much a company is worth and examine how its debt is structured – as highly leveraged groups invariably have different classes of debt, each with its own place in the creditors’ pecking order. The key is to guess which portion will turn into equity – and then build up control of that class of debt.Secrecy is the key to accumulating a big enough position to be able to control a company when it hits the wall. If word gets out, the price will rise and the exercise becomes more costly as others piggyback.Miscalculations can mean an investment ends up worth zero – “a bagel”, in Wall Street’s pithy jargon. Aim too low and you can get wiped out because there is not enough money to go around. Aim too high and at best you are merely paid back. “The business is all about probabilities,” says Jeff Aronson, co-founder of Centerbridge.That gamble is clear from what happened with Aleris, an ailing aluminium sheet maker. In the last quarter of 2008, Oaktree started buying chunks of its debt. Nobody was immediately around to piggy­back. “We were like pigs in mud,” Bruce Karsh, co-head of Oaktree, recalls fondly.TPG, the San Francisco-based private equity firm, had paid $3.5bn for control of Aleris with $850m of equity and the rest in debt. But as the economy worsened, so did the prospects of Aleris. In December, TPG had to post money with the banks on its behalf, a sign that it was standing by the company. That made the debt worth more but the big prize – control – threatened to elude Oaktree. “We can’t predict what will restructure and what won’t,” Mr Karsh says philosophically. “All we can do is try to identify what is good value.”But by February, as Aleris bled, TPG had withdrawn its support and the group filed for Chapter 11. As the largest lenders, Oaktree and Apollo, which turned out also to have bought some of the debt, were asked to give the company the so-called debtor-in-possession money to function while operating under bankruptcy protection. When it emerges, the two are likely to own Aleris for a fraction of what TPG paid.Private equity’s splurge left companies with so much debt. It is harder to know which class of it will be paid off fully, which will return nothing (since recoveries are likely to be far lower than before) and which class will take over a company – the distressed debt equivalent of scoring a touchdown.To play successfully therefore requires patience and a variety of skills as well as luck at any one of several crucial junctures. About a year ago, Oaktree and Centerbridge both began looking at the long list of good cyclical companies that were likely to have difficulty repaying their debt as the economy slowed. Unbeknowns to each other, Masonite was one that showed up on both their screens. Working independently, each monitored the company for signs of distress, which included clues such as whether it was drawing down bank lines of credit. The two then contacted the trading desks of Wall Street to let them know they were buyers and began accumulating.Initially, Oaktree bought the bonds but quickly switched to the bank loans as it became clear that holders of the bank debt would become the new owners. “To be fair, it was a miscalculation,” Mr Karsh says.Through last autumn and winter, Masonite was in talks with its lenders to restructure the $2.2bn debt that its sales could no longer support. An agreement was reached that would mean a Chapter 11 filing. Oaktree and Centerbridge will own the largest chunk of equity and may have control when it emerges from court protection.Oaktree’s approach is seen as more cautious and cerebral than many of its peers. “They are among the most thoughtful groups out there,” says Mark Bradley, responsible for relations with the private equity groups at Morgan Stanley. “The [recessionary] environment fits their capability perfectly.”Mr Marks sends out letters to his investors that have acquired cult status in almost the same way as those of Warren Buffett (who threw in his lot with Oaktree in the Enron bankruptcy and has used data from Oaktree in his own letters). Among readers are Bader al-Sa’ad, head of the Kuwait Investment Authority. Although Mr Marks is a product of the University of Chicago, with its markets-know-best approach, he believes securities prices are not always right but merely reflect consensus. His favourite observation is that a 6ft man can drown in a stream whose average depth is 5ft.Today, Oaktree is waiting to see what will happen to its investments in Masonite and in Charter Communications, the fourth largest US cable operator, which in March filed for Chapter 11 with almost $22bn (€16bn, £14.4bn) in debt. Bank lenders to Charter plan to go to court next month in an effort to block a restructuring that would give Oaktree and Apollo control.“In 2001, in the last distressed cycle, the lesson was to jump in quickly or miss the opportunity,” says Steve Kaplan, another of the half-dozen who founded Oaktree six years earlier. This time, the cycle is likely to last far longer. “Once we gain control, we forget we were distressed investors and become owners,” he adds.As that last cycle became more severe, Oaktree for example spent $100m acquiring the debt of SpectraSite, gaining control at the provider of signal towers for mobile phone operators along with Apollo in 2003. Nursed back to health, SpectraSite emerged as a public company and Oaktree tripled its money. In 2005, SpectraSite merged with American Tower in a deal valuing it at $3.8bn including debt.But whatever distressed investors’ skills at running businesses rather than just running a slide rule over them, the companies over which they preside have far less debt than before.
23;AMT;American Tower Corp;2006-05-21T21:30:25Z;Law firm opens new front in stock option probe;;One of the most powerful securities class-action law firms in the US has opened a new front in prosecutors’ investigation of the backdating of stock options.The firm promises to file suits against executives and directors who allegedly manipulated stock option practices to guarantee the receipt of windfall compensation.New York-based Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, filed suit against UnitedHealth Group last week and signalled that it is ready to target more companies being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York.The lawyers’ decision to take on the stock option scandal comes as the class-action securities industry is reeling from last week’s indictment of one of its most prominent players, Milberg Weiss, and two of its senior lawyers, after a six-year probe.BLB&G,says law firms should be judged by their own conduct. The indictment could boost firms such as BLB&G if Milberg’s clients change lawyers.As part of its legal action against UnitedHealth, five pension funds represented by BLB&G are asking a judge to freeze $2bn in unexercised stock options that were granted to the company’s chief executive and chief operating officer.Gerald Silk, a partner at BLB&G said: “We’re basically asking the judge to take the key out of the getaway car until the backdating mess is sorted out.”Mr Silk said he was discussing with clients potential litigation against another group that is being probed, Affiliated Computer, and others. John “Sean” Coffey, another BLB&G partner, says the backdating of options is a “very hot issue” that his institutional clients are “upset over”. An investigation by US authorities into whether executives and directors changed the effective dates on stock options to secure higher compensation widened last week after prosecutors issued subpoenas to companies. These included UnitedHealth, which said it was co-operating, and Vitesse Semiconductor, the chipmaker that fired its chief and two other executives as it widened its internal probe into the timing of stock-option grants. American Tower Corporation and RSA Security said they also received SEC letters of inquiry.At the core of the BLB&G legal action are allegations that William McGuire, chairman and chief executive of UnitedHealth, and Stephen Hemsley, chief operating officer, breached their fiduciary duty when they, along with other executives, received stock options during the 1990s at “abnormally low and statistically anomalous exercise prices”.

The company that operates the credit-rating service of the same name dipped 12 per cent to $62 as expenses rose and revenue growth slowed below analyst expectations.Sprint-Nextel was one of the most heavily traded stocks after the telecommunications company announced a fall in first-quarter net income from $472bn to $419bn after merger-related costs and higher marketing expenses.The shares fell 2.7 per cent to $24.35, bucking the trend in an otherwise buoyant communications sector.One company leading the positive trend in the sector was American Tower which gained 4.4 per cent to $34.65 after it announced that quarterly losses had been reduced.The company, which leases space on its communications towers to the likes of Cingular, said that sales gained 74 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.Monster Worldwide, the owner of online jobs recruitment website Monster.com, rose on quarterly results that were significantly stronger than expected, up to $42.3m from $20.6m in the same period last year. Monster shot up 6.9 per cent to $55.86.
25;AMT;American Tower Corp;2005-05-04T18:48:05Z;American Tower to buy Spectrasite for $3.1bn;;American Tower, the biggest mobile phone tower operator in the US, said on Wednesday it would buy rival SpectraSite, extending its market share and creating a combined company with more than $1bn in annual revenues.The $3.1bn all-stock deal gives SpectraSite investors 3.575 shares of American Tower class A common stock for each SpectraSite share. American Tower stockholders will own 59 per cent of the combined company, and SpectraSite investors the remaining 41 per cent.The companies expect the deal to yield $400m in synergies, as well as create the clear market leader. Jim Taiclet, American Tower chairman and chief executive, said: “This combination is a defining event in the tower industry …we will have more towers in the best markets. Together, we will be the premier tower company in North America.”American Tower closed at $17.21 in New York on Tuesday, thus valuing Spectrasite at $61.53 per share - an almost 10 per cent premium over SpecraSite’s Tuesday closing price of $56.20.American Tower also reported higher first quarter profits on Wednesday.

North Carolina-based SpectraSite owns or operates about 10,000 sites, mostly in the US.SpectraSite’s shares rose almost 5 per cent in pre-market trading on Wednesday.
26;AMT;American Tower Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
