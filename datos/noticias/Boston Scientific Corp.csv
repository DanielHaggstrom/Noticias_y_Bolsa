0;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2018-11-23T18:32:02Z;Corporate week in review, November 24;1MDB scandal, Boston Scientific, StanChart, chipmakers, Tencent and Alibaba;A round-up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.The fallout over Goldman Sachs’ involvement in the vast 1MDB fraud deepened this week, after the bank said its former chief executive met with the man at the heart of the scandal on a second occasion.Lloyd Blankfein, now chairman of Goldman, met with Jho Low in December 2012 at the bank’s New York headquarters during a meeting with the chief executive of Aabar, an Abu Dhabi investment fund, according to a spokesperson for the bank. The revelation that the bank’s most powerful executive met with Mr Low on at least two occasions could hamper the bank’s efforts to distance itself from the Malaysian financier, who has been charged by US prosecutors of masterminding the $2.7bn money laundering and bribery scandal. Earlier in the week, an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund sued Goldman over the scandal, accusing the US bank of bribing its officials during a “massive global conspiracy”.The International Petroleum Investment Company, a former partner of the 1MDB fund, filed a lawsuit in New York seeking unspecified punitive damages from Goldman and individuals, including Tim Leissner, a former partner at the bank who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges over the affair.The long-running 1MDB scandal, in which high-ranking Malaysian officials including former prime minister Najib Razak have been accused of helping loot $4.5bn from the government fund, has spread beyond the country’s borders, ensnaring officials and executives around the globe. Mr Najib, who was charged this year, has denied all accusations.Goldman’s role has come under increasing scrutiny since US prosecutors charged two former Goldman managing directors — Mr Leissner and Roger Ng — for their alleged involvement in the scheme and claimed one current Goldman partner was a co-conspirator.BTG agreed to be acquired by US medical devices company Boston Scientific for £3.3bn in cash amid a flurry of takeovers in the UK healthcare sector.The deal will see Boston Scientific pick up the jumble of healthcare products owned by BTG, which has spent the past few years reducing its reliance on an expensive rattlesnake bite antidote that faces increased competition.It also comes after executive pay criticism against Dame Louise Makin, BTG’s chief executive, over future stock awards and bonus arrangements put in place for the company’s former finance director. Last month, BTG chairman Garry Watts announced his intention to retire by the end of the year.Michael Mahoney, chairman and chief executive of Boston Scientific, said the deal would help enhance his company’s presence in categories including oncology and heart disease. The US group said it expected to realise annual synergies of $175m by the end of 2021, predominantly by eliminating costs.Dame Louise, who took over BTG in 2004, said the cultural and strategic fit with Boston Scientific gave her confidence in the merger. Under her leadership, the company transformed itself from a ragbag of intellectual property rights into a healthcare group that operates in interventional medicine, pharmaceuticals and licensing.Analysts at Panmure Gordon said BTG was the eighth company in the British healthcare sector to be acquired in the past 18 months. It attributed the activity to depressed valuations in the UK compared to global competitors.Boston Scientific is to pay 840p for each BTG share, a premium of 36.6 per cent to its closing price of 615p on Monday. The offer also represents a 51 per cent premium to BTG’s volume-weighed average share price over the past 90 trading days, as volatility from the company’s shaky performance has affected its shares.BTG was created in 1981 by the merger of the National Research & Development Council and the National Enterprise Board. The NR&DC was created in 1948 to help commercialise government patents, which included hovercraft and defence technology, drug treatments and medical devices.BTG said it considered the offer — which values BTG at roughly £3.3bn but may be reduced if it pays any dividend or other distribution before the deal is completed — to be “fair and reasonable”. The company’s directors plan to unanimously recommend to shareholders they vote in favour of the takeover.Alibaba and Tencent’s main business may be shopping and gaming, but their latest earnings reports show they are also giving investment managers a run for their money.The Chinese tech duo’s substantial investment portfolios generated roughly one-third of their pre-tax income in the quarter to the end of September. Tencent declared net other gains of Rmb8.8bn ($1.27bn) while Alibaba noted Rmb6.6bn ($951m) of net interest and investment income.By comparison, Tencent made 7 per cent of its profits from investments in 2016 and 22 per cent in 2017. For Alibaba the share was 14 per cent in 2017 and 30 per cent in the year to March, though some investments may have been booked under different categories in the accounts.The investment gains in the latest quarter were an important buffer for Tencent in particular, as it weathered falling revenues in its gaming division.Standard Chartered is drawing up plans to buy back shares for the first time in a generation as management tries to revive the emerging markets bank’s flagging share price.The buyback plan, which could be announced alongside full-year results at the end of February, represents a significant shift in the direction of the bank, which has raised billions of pounds from investors in the past decade to fund its growth. The proposal is still in its infancy and is contingent on the size of any fine the bank must pay to settle allegations by US authorities that it breached sanctions against Iran, said several people familiar with the plans. Given the sensitivity of the negotiations over the penalty, management are reluctant to put a figure on the scale of any potential buyback, said a person briefed on the plans. However, analysts and investors believe that Standard Chartered would easily be able to afford a buyback of at least £1bn, which could help drive up the company’s share price and its return on equity, a key measure of profitability. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, estimated in a note published this month that the bank was operating with about £3.1bn of surplus capital. One person briefed on the proposal said that any buyback would represent a “disciplined approach to capital allocation” that would balance shareholder returns with the need to preserve capital for the pursuit of new business. The person said a buyback would show that management is serious on boosting the company’s stock price and improving shareholder returns. Bill Winters, chief executive of Standard Chartered, has pledged to achieve a return on equity of 10 per cent in the medium term, well above the 6.1 per cent the bank returned in the first nine months of the year.Chinese investigators said they found “massive evidence” of anti-competitive behaviour by the world’s top three makers of computer memory chips, in a probe that could exacerbate global trade tensions.Officials in Beijing said a price-fixing investigation into South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix and US-based Micron Technology had made “important progress”, without offering any specific examples of wrongdoing.“The anti-monopoly investigation into these three companies has made important progress . . . [It] has yielded massive evidence,” said Wu Zhenguo, head of China’s anti-monopoly bureau under the State Administration for Market Regulation.Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment, while Micron did not respond to a request for comment.The three companies control as much as 95 per cent of the global market for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips, which are widely used in computers and smartphones.After steadily falling for most of the past three decades, the price-per-bit of DRAM chips rose 47 per cent in 2017, according to the US research firm IC Insights, and has continued to increase this year.The Chinese investigation follows a class-action lawsuit in the US, lodged in April, which alleges that the three companies conspired to inflate DRAM prices. The companies are contesting the case.Ineos, the privately owned energy and chemicals group run by Britain’s richest man, is in exclusive talks with US oil major ConocoPhillips to acquire its assets in the North Sea.The potential deal, which has a price tag of more than $3bn according to industry sources, could transform Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s company into a major operator in North Sea oil and gas production, building on other acquisitions and its ownership of infrastructure, refineries and chemical plants fed by the basin.People familiar with the sale process said Ineos had paid ConocoPhillips a “substantial” deposit to give it exclusivity over the talks for three months, fearing competition from other buyers including private equity companies that have a growing role in the North Sea.The ConocoPhillips assets are one of a handful on the block that give companies an opportunity to acquire a substantial North Sea footprint at a time when the energy majors, particularly from the US, have been scaling back in the mature basin to focus on the US shale sector and other prospects.If a deal is reached it would be the latest audacious move by Sir Jim who has built his business empire by borrowing to fund acquisitions in the last decade. Ineos is Britain’s biggest privately owned company with sales of $60bn and earnings before interest, tax and other charges of $7bn last year.Sir Jim founded the company in 1998 and owns a majority stake in the business. The company has expanded from its petrochemicals roots into an industrial conglomerate with positions in other industries including shale exploration, automotive and fashion. Last week Ineos added the resins business of US-based Ashland Global Holdings in a $1.1bn deal.Five of the world’s biggest food companies have abandoned trials aimed at developing a new nutrition labelling scheme for Europe, dealing a blow to efforts to help consumers better understand what is in their food.Coca-Cola, Mondelez, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever have been working together for two years on an “Evolved Nutrition Label”, which would have replaced the monochrome labelling system in place in Europe.The new label sought to use colours from red to green to indicate whether a portion of a given food was high in calories, fat, sugar or salt.But after trials in several countries and consultation with academics and consumer groups, the companies could not gain consensus around the new portion-based, colour-based scheme, said Bart Vandewaetere, a Nestlé government affairs executive.“Colour coding of food labels is very controversial in continental Europe,” said Mr Vandewaetere. “We need leadership from the European Commission to come up with a common approach.”Although the companies have stopped the effort on food labelling, Coca-Cola said that it would continue to trial colour-coded labelling schemes on its beverages.The setback means that European countries will continue developing their own food labelling. In recent years, the UK, Ireland and France have created their own voluntary labelling schemes that use traffic light-like designs to convey information to people scanning packages in supermarkets.
1;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2018-11-20T20:04:16Z;Anti-venom maker BTG provides £3.3bn antidote to the Faangs;Cash offer from Boston Scientific provides relief for investors in UK group;Why worry about Faangs if you have snake anti-venom? While the tech stocks comprising that toothsome market acronym — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet — were slithering into bear territory on Monday, biting US equity bulls in the ar . . . afternoon, shares in British Technology Group, or BTG, were spiking 36 per cent on Tuesday morning — partly because it makes a snakebite cure. Hence that incisive quip (which Lombard ripped off from a sharper Lex column colleague).Investors, it seems, were snapping up BTG shares on news of a £3.3bn cash offer from US rival Boston Scientific. At 840p a share, this was 37 per cent higher than BTG’s closing price on Monday, and 51 per cent above its weighted average share price over the past three months. But the tech-sector premium was for a company that had ceased to be a technology play decades ago. Despite being formed in 1981 from what had been the National Research Development Corporation — a commercialiser of British inventions somewhat lacking in teeth, having spent years chasing the US military for patent royalties on hovercraft skirts — BTG evolved into an odd collection of medical assets. Since chief executive Louise Makin took over in 2004, though, it has been focused on rattlesnake antidote CroFab, other antitoxins and minimally-invasive cancer treatments. And it is these markets that Boston Scientific is seeking a bigger bite of, given BTG’s interlocking fit with its own product portfolio. For BTG, however, the decision to immediately recommend the cash offer looks, at first, like a step back. Only last week, its shares rose 16 per cent on news of a 47 per cent rise in pre-tax profit, a second US acquisition within two months and an ambition to become “a world leader in interventional medicine”. Why flinch so quickly, then?Analysts at Panmure Gordon argued that the price was “ not generous” at 15.2 times BTG’s earnings, compared with a peer group trading on 24 times. Those at Jefferies noted the offer was at nil-premium to their sum of the parts valuation. Even BTG directors deemed it no more than “fair and reasonable”.Still, they all expect BTG to become the eighth UK healthcare group to succumb to a buyer in 18 months. It seems their reasoning is that a 50 per cent share price rise more than draws the sting of new and fierce competition for anti-venom sales. With a Mexican company entering a market that BTG once had to itself, forecasts are for price pressure and falling profitability. RBC warned of imminent pain just hours before Boston Scientific’s offer was announced, saying: “We see FY19E as representing peak earnings for BTG in the medium term should the risks to . . . CroFab materialise.” Little wonder that Invesco and Neil Woodford are among the one-third of BTG backers who have already accepted Boston’s offer. It is the one guaranteed antidote to the sliding value of their other tech holdings.EasyJet flew a record 88.5m passengers last year — and it seems some of them must have been its own investor relations team visiting European fund managers to suggest they buy shares. On Tuesday, alongside news of a near one-fifth rise in annual revenues, the low-cost airline said ownership of its shares by investors in the European Economic Area had reached 47 per cent — approaching the majority required to maintain its flying licences after the UK leaves the EU. Just another 3 percentage points of the equity in European hands and there will be no need for EasyJet to force UK holders to divest themselves of shares — a power the company ultimately has, but would rather not use or talk about.However, its IR team might need to return to Europe — because some investors appear to be cutting their stakes. EasyJet shares fell 5.5 per cent per cent in mid-afternoon trading — despite what appeared to be strong results. Reported profit before tax increased by £60m to £445m, which was enough to cover a 43 per cent rise in the dividend. What could have made UK or EU investors so nervous, then? As with all things European, it would seem to be costs. EasyJet’s entire reported profit could be accounted for by cost savings, which came in at £107m in the period. But the airline admitted that, next year, its total cost per seat at constant currency would be flat — and that excluded fuel costs, which are rising. Airport costs may be reduced by more efficiencies of scale, and new data tools are set to cut the impact of disruption from congested airspace.Nevertheless, the direction of travel is all too clear: total cost per seat has been rising since 2016, while total revenue per seat is down on 2015 levels. Consequently, the margin on each seat sold has fallen from 14.6 per cent in 2015 to 7.6 per cent now.That makes the direction of travel for easyJet’s management team clear, as well: back on flight EZY 2441 to Paris Charles de Gaulle, to see some more fund managers. matthew.vincent@ft.com

Monday’s report from The Wall Street Journal triggered a brief volatility halt, according to New York Stock Exchange data.The Journal cautioned in its report, which cited unnamed sources, that it is “unclear” whether Boston Scientific is receptive to the approach.Boston Scientific’s enterprise value, which includes net debt, was $48bn as of Friday, FactSet data show.The group, which makes devices such as medicated stents for cardiac patients, generated $9.05bn in net sales last year.
4;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2015-03-16T17:04:06Z;Watchman device approval boosts Boston Scientific;Shares climb nearly 4 per cent on hopes of strong sales;Boston Scientific was one of the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500, after the medical device maker received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for its device intended to prevent strokes in patients with a heart rhythm disorder.The FDA approved The Watchman device on Friday, after the market closed. It reduces the risk of stroke in patients with irregular heart rhythms known as non-valvular atrial fibrillation and is an alternative to long-term warfarin therapy, which prevents blood clots.“Watchman would position the device as a second line, or alternative, treatment for a smaller segment of atrial fibrillation (AFib) patients. Surprisingly, the approved indication is much more positive than we had expected as the label essentially keeps the original $1bn-plus market opportunity intact and points to a sizeable population who would be indicated for the Watchman,” Tao Levy, an analyst at Wedbush, said.During an investor update, the Massachusetts-based company said it could generate $500m in Watchman sales over the next five years as many patients seek alternatives to warfarin and other anticoagulant therapies because of a history of bleeding while taking oral anticoagulant therapy.Shares of Boston Scientific, which have gained 32 per cent in the past year, climbed nearly 4 per cent to $17.24.King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the popular Candy Crush Saga game, rallied on Monday, after analysts at JPMorgan raised the stock to “overweight” from “neutral” with a $20 price target.Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan, said the UK developer listed in New York continues to grow its network, already at 356m monthly unique users. It “is gaining significant scale benefits around marketing, cross-selling, and data that further distance the company from smaller competitors”, he said.Mr Anmuth added that the company’s Candy Crush Soda Saga “has reinvigorated the entire Candy franchise” and has done little to cannibalise Candy Crush Saga. The success of the Soda game also suggests the company could add more sequels to the Candy franchise. He also expects King to launch five new games in 2015. Shares of King Digital advanced 1 per cent to $15.04.Netflix shares fell 4 per cent to $422.08, after analysts at Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to “sell” from “hold” and lowered their price target to $380 from $450. The downgrade was driven by “what we perceive to be an intensifying competitive environment necessitating increased investment with uncertain return”, said Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore ISI.Hanesbrands shares advanced 3 per cent to $33.58, after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the US clothes marketer will replace Avon Products in the S&P 500, after the close on March 20.Shares of Salix Pharmaceuticals advanced 2 per cent to $172.75, on news that Valeant Pharmaceuticals had sweetened its bid for Salix and nudged Endo International out of the race. Valeant said it would boost its all-cash offer to $173 per share, from $158.S&P 500 utilities led the US benchmark higher, climbing nearly 2 per cent.The S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 2,081.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.3 per cent to 17,977.29.

5;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2013-10-01T14:57:17Z;Medical taxes: own devices;US budgetary impasse might have a silver lining;"Amid the partisan rancour, little patches of agreement persist. Consider the excise tax on medical devices, which helps to fund President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms. A repeal of the tax has been floated as part of a compromise which would give the Republicans a face-saving victory and get the government running again. Many Democrats have signalled their willingness to repeal it. A truce – which remains unlikely – might be a boost for bipartisanship but would be only a modest help to device makers.The Affordable Care Act levies taxes to fund itself. In exchange, 50m potential customers get health insurance. The medical devices industry’s contribution is a 2.3 per cent sales tax that took effect this year. Device makers, which saw demand drop after the crisis, say the tax has led to restructuring.Most of the big device companies – Medtronic, Stryker, Boston Scientific, Zimmer, Smith & Nephew – have underperformed the market since Mr Obama’s inauguration. The average forecast sales growth at those companies is 2 per cent in 2013, according to S&P Capital IQ.This pattern cannot be explained just by politics. Hospital mergers have made for tough price negotiations; a lack of innovation in the biggest product categories has hurt pricing too.Note that Edwards, which recently introduced a truly innovative product (a replacement heart valve delivered through a catheter), has outperformed significantly over the past five years.A political compromise may end the tax (more spending but less revenue) but with their new discipline, device makers are already strengthening. Average revenue growth is expected to be above 4 per cent in 2014 with earnings growth more than twice that. A tax cut would be a bonus, but it is the companies, not Washington, doing the heavy lifting.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
6;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Medical device groups ‘fail to innovate’;;Medical device companies are themselves to blame for falling margins because they are failing to innovate sufficiently, said Olivier Bohuon, chief executive of Smith & Nephew.Mr Bohuon, who has been restructuring the UK-based device company since his appointment a year ago, told the Financial Times that the industry should launch new products rather than cutting prices and blaming budget-conscious government.“When we talk about price erosion – 3-4 per cent a year – many people are blaming this on government austerity measures, but they are wrong,” he said. “What is happening is that we as an industry are not bringing in enough innovative products to get higher prices.”Mr Bohuon, who left Abbott, the US drug company, to join Smith & Nephew in April last year after a short spell at Pierre Fabre of France, said healthcare providers were prepared to pay a premium for the devices that would save them money in the long term.“When you don’t innovate, your portfolio becomes older, and then in order to be successful in tenders you have a tendency to drop your prices,” he said. “Innovation is the bread and butter of this business.”Mr Bohuon’s comments come as the medical devices sector faces increased regulation and tighter margins. S&N, along with rivals such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Zimmer, is dependent on government reimbursement for much of its turnover, and has seen margins squeezed during the economic downturn as healthcare budgets are cut.The pressure was reflected in S&N’s trading margins for 2011 unveiled in February, which were down 2 percentage points year on year to 22.5 per cent, in spite of revenues rising 4 per cent to $4.27bn.But Mr Bohuon said he was reallocating capital internally at the company to focus on areas providing the greatest potential returns, and placing increasing emphasis on innovative products including in wound care and orthopedics, where it has launched more bespoke products supported by computer-aided design.S&N last year pledged to increase its research and development budget by $300m over the next five years, bringing R&D spend up to 5 per cent of group revenues.Although best known as Europe’s largest maker of artificial hips and knees, S&N has turned its attentions towards sports medicine and wound-management devices, such as negative pressure bandages and highly-specialised tools for keyhole surgery.Its wound-management division launched 35 products in 2011 and is poised to match that number in 2012.“We try to focus on where we need to go, but it’s also important not to remain a step behind our rivals. You cannot say that just because it is difficult to innovate that you don’t want to go there,” said Mr Bohuon.“It is easier to innovate in areas other than orthopaedics. You don’t invent a new hip or a knee every other day.”Last month S&N acquired LifeModeler, a provider of biomechanical software that simulates the human body’s movements, in order to speed up the testing of its orthopaedic products
7;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2012-01-25T23:49:46Z;Results mixed for US healthcare companies;Companies beginning to see uptick in services;Shares of WellPoint fell by nearly 5 per cent after the US health insurer reported disappointing fourth-quarter results and a 2012 outlook that was weaker than analysts expected.The California-based insurer, which is the second-largest in the US by market capitalisation, said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter net income fell by 39 per cent from a year ago to $335.3m, or 96 cents a share, while operating revenue rose 5.5 per cent to $15.1bn.The company, which has been looking to gain more Medicare Advantage customers to capitalise on the ageing US population, was hit by surprisingly high medical costs of customers in its home state. Wellpoint’s consumer business lost $4.6m during the final three months of last year.“Clearly, our consumer segment underperformed, and it was almost entirely due to the senior business,” Angela Braly, Wellpoint’s chief executive, told analysts.Health insurers, which faced harsh criticism during the debate over US healthcare reform legislation, have performed well in the last year as patients tried to avoid medical procedures amid a weak economy.However, as the US economy has shown signs of life recently, healthcare companies are starting to see an increase in the use of medical services.On Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson said that its medical device business was approaching a “trough”, as patients were choosing to move forward with knee and hip replacements that they had delayed.Last week, United Health, the largest US insurer, offered a cautious outlook for 2012, noting that it expected medical claims costs to rise as usage rates increase.WellPoint said it expects to earn net income of $7.60 a share this year.“The company’s track record of execution over the last several years has been spotty, so delivering strong 2012 performance is important to see performance upside,” said Ana Gupte, healthcare analyst at Bernstein Research.Separately on Wednesday, Abbott, the US drug maker, reported a strong fourth quarter, with net earnings rising by 12.3 per cent to $1.6bn, or $1.02 a share. But the company’s share price slipped 1.34 per cent as its revenues and 2012 outlook were softer than Wall Street analysts projected.Scott Stoffel, an Abbott spokesman, said that the company cut 700 jobs and would eliminate several hundred more this year. Most of the jobs are in manufacturing, he said, and some are related to the expiration of Abbott’s contract to supply stents to Boston Scientific.The stronger US dollar meant that foreign exchange provided less of a benefit to Abbott than it previously thought. The US pharmaceutical sector is bracing for the currency shift to become a headwind this year.Abbott said that its plan to split the company into separate research-based pharmaceuticals and diversified medical products businesses is on track to be completed by the end of 2012.
8;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

In the latest outrage, they may demand to know before the government pays for an operation whether the patient needs it.Shares in medical device makers and hospitals tanked on Friday after news that a Florida Medicare administrator would audit patients’ medical records before paying for certain costly cardiovascular and orthopaedic procedures. The report seemed to dovetail with a statement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that similar audits would be implemented in 11 states representing half of the US population. Stocks mostly bounced back on Monday when it appeared the two announcements might be unrelated.Device manufacturers should tremble though when the government threatens to tighten the leash. Companies such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific, St. Jude and Zimmer are all heavily dependent on the named procedures and on public reimbursement. At Medtronic, for example, half of US revenues come from the government. Publicly traded hospitals may be safer: a Credit Suisse analysis finds that the procedures amount to about 1 per cent of their revenues.If the audits are conducted fairly and competently (not a foregone conclusion, of course), the device companies will only suffer in the long term if the procedures are currently being performed on many patients who won’t benefit significantly from them. This has been the case in the past with cardiac stents and spinal devices, for example.Whether it is true now, and whatever happens in Florida, expect more announcements of increased scrutiny from Medicare. This only makes sense in a system where providers are paid by the procedure rather than for outcomes, and where healthcare consumes a fourth of federal spending and counting.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The benchmark US index had been us as much as 1.5 per cent before news the Standard and Poor’s is reviewing its sovereign rating on 6 eurozone sovereigns including Germany, knocked stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.7 per cent to 12,097.83.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.1 per cent to 2,655.76.“Positive news flow from Europe is driving stocks,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi asset strategies at ING.“But the S&P 500 is seeing resistance at the 200-day moving average above 1,260. If you were long from the November lows, it’s a good place to take profit and, if you have money on the sidelines, it seems a bit high to be initiating new long positions,” he added.Bank stocks led the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 handily outperforming all other sectors with a 2.1 per cent rise.Morgan Stanley climbed 6.8 per cent to $16.57. New York-based investment bank Jefferies continued to rally, rising 4 per cent to $12.90.As recently as two weeks ago, the bank had hit year lows of $9.50 on concern about its exposures to European sovereign debt and short-term funding needs.Citigroup climbed 5.9 per cent to $29.83.Goldman Sachs financial services analyst Richard Ramsden beat the drum for US banks ahead of a Goldman banking conference this week.“Fundamentals don’t appear nearly as bad as valuations imply,” he told clients, while acknowledging that hedge funds significantly reduced their weightings to financials in the third quarter.Newfield Exploration fell 3.4 per cent to $44.03 as investors reacted guardedly to its agreement to supply Tesoro Corporation’s Salt Lake City refinery with 18,000 barrels of oil per day from 2013 from planned growth in the Uinta Basin.“Management had been flagging this announcement for a week,” said Subash Chandra, an oil analyst at Jefferies, “but when it came it was underwhelming. There’s no revenue till 2013, and we’re still waiting for updates from new fields within the basin.”Time Warner fell 1.7 per cent to $62.71 on mixed reaction to its plans to make films available for consumers to watch on any platform through a cloud verification service.Gannett climbed 10.2 per cent to $13.13 after Lazard analysts recommended clients buy the stock, tipping the media company to raise its dividend soon.“Cloud” software provider Salesforce.com was the main beneficiary of a Standard and Poor’s note forecasting a round of acquisitions in the software industry. Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $125.01.MetLife rose 3.7 per cent to $32.92. The largest US life insurer said 2012 earnings may reach $5.20 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $5.08 a share.Staples rallied 5.6 per cent to $15.13 after positive coverage over the weekend, which suggested that the stock could rise as high as $22 in the next year if the economy improves and companies spend more on office supplies.

Any sign of cracks must add to fear that the overall European situation is quickly deteriorating with a knock-on effect for US stocks.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 2.1 per cent to 11,257.63, with all 30 members in the red. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.4 per cent to 2,460.08.The financial sector of the S&P 500 declined 3 per cent after the Federal Reserve added to pressure on US banks by announcing that it would stress test their ability to withstand unemployment of 13 per cent and a 6.9 per cent fall in eurozone GDP.At one point Bank of America fell to $5.11, it lowest price since March 2009, before closing at $5.14, a loss of 4.3 per cent for the day.The cost of default protection on BofA debt rose 35 basis points to 472bp, an all-time record according to data from Markit. That equates to $472,000 a year to insure $10m of BofA debt for five years.Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 per cent to $13.03, Citigroup tumbled 3.9 per cent to $23.51 and JPMorgan was off 3.5 per cent to $28.38.Goldman Sachs held the steadiest among the big US banks, off 1.7 per cent to $87.89, but that still left the bank set for its worst close since March 2009.Even Goldman analyst Richard Ramsden conceded that the stress tests would leave big banks in the crosshairs.“We view the test as more onerous for large banks, as regulators appear focused on stressing capital markets (Europe and counterparty) exposures,” he wrote to clients.Smaller lenders were not immune, with the Fed also announcing that all banks with assets more than $50bn must submit a capital adequacy plan by January 2012. Regions Financial fell 5.6 per cent to $3.68.Oppenheimer waded into the debate over liquidity at Jefferies, the New York-based investment bank whose exposures to Europe and funding stability have been much scrutinised.Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said notes from bond research firm Egan-Jones, calling on Jefferies to reduce assets and raise capital, were “plain wrong”.Jefferies shares rose 4.5 per cent to $10.51.Materials and energy stocks suffered as eurozone sentiment translated into fears for global growth.Coal miner Alpha Natural Resources fell 6.7 per cent to $19.27 and US Steel Corp was down 7.6 per cent to $22.41.JPMorgan told clients to have an underweight position for the entire commodities sector after the failure of the US budget “supercommittee”.“Policy failures in the US and Europe have darkened the six-month outlook,” Colin Fenton wrote to clients. “We expect outright total return losses near-term and see greater value in bonds.”Highly cyclical semiconductor stocks also suffered with the Philadelphia Sox index falling 2.5 per cent, led down by Jabil Circuit, which was off 8.6 per cent to $18.36.Groupon fell below its IPO price of $20 for the first time since its debut two weeks ago. Its shares were down 15.6 per cent to $16.96. That meant a third consecutive daily fall of more than 10 per cent, even though investors have been unable to initiate new short positions since Monday.Boston Scientific was one of a handful of stocks in the S&P 500 to record gains. Its shares were up 0.2 per cent to $5.32 after the medical device maker received regulatory approval for a new version of its drug-coated heart stent.Shares in the pharmacy chain Walgreen shares were up 4.4 per cent to $32.09 on reports that it may be able to salvage a deal to fill prescriptions for pharmacy benefit management company Express Scripts.Strong earnings from John Deere also provided some cheer as the world’s biggest tractor maker easily exceeded analysts’ expectations with earnings per share of $1.62 in the quarter to the end of October. Its shares were up 3.9 per cent to $74.72.But any hopes that US fundamentals might detract from eurozone woes were dashed by a flurry of downbeat pre-Thanksgiving economic data. Unemployment claims ticked up while consumer spending grinding almost to a halt in October.
12;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2011-08-03T15:26:26Z;US job creation slows and redundancies soar;;The US private sector added jobs for the 19th straight month in July but growth remained below the level needed for a steady recovery in the struggling labour market, while planned lay-offs jumped to a 16-month high, adding to worries over the health of world’s largest economy.Wednesday’s employment report from ADP, the payroll processor, showed job creation slowed to 114,000 new positions last month from June’s downwardly revised 145,000. The July increase was slightly ahead of expectations of 100,000 and in line with estimates for the private sector component of Friday’s government non-farm payrolls report.“While the ADP has stopped the rot in the run of recent data it still is very far from providing us with any comfort about the outlook for the labour market,” said David Semmens, US economist at Standard Chartered.“Today’s report shows modest job creation for the month of July at a rate of half what is needed for meaningful employment and economic recovery,” said Gary Butler, ADP chief executive.A separate report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement company, added to the gloomy labour picture with the news that the number of announced lay-offs at US companies surged 60 per cent in July to 66,414, a 16-month high. Lay-offs were concentrated at large firms, with cuts at Merck, Borders, Cisco Systems, Lockheed Martin and Boston Scientific accounting for more than half the total.“July marks the third consecutive increase we have seen in monthly job-cut announcements, which certainly seems to provide additional evidence that the recovery has stalled,” said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.The labour market has been mired at anaemic levels through the recovery, with the unemployment rate stuck at 9.2 per cent two years after the official end of the recession. Friday’s labour department report is expected to show the economy added 85,000 jobs in July following June’s nine-month low of 18,000.Lacklustre gross domestic product growth figures released last week confirmed fears that the “soft patch” seen in the spring was in fact a broader and more prolonged slowing of the economy, raising the spectre of stagnation and even double-dip recession.“The slowdown in employment makes more sense in light of last week’s revised GDP numbers showing the economy grew slower late last year and this year than initially reported,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which produces the ADP report.ADP’s figures showed the service sector added 121,000 jobs last month, led by professional services and education and healthcare, while construction employment fell 11,000. The goods-producing sector shed 7,000 positions. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000, a small decrease but a worrying sign for the industry that has been a powerhouse through much of the recovery.Small and medium-sized businesses were the biggest contributors to job growth, with companies employing less than 50 people adding 58,000 jobs and those employing 50 to 500 people hiring 47,000 new workers. Companies with more than 500 workers added 9,000 positions.However, some economists warned against reading too much into the report as a signal for the labour department reading.“ADP employment provided a misleading signal on payrolls for June, which may result in lower than the usual market sensitivity to this report,” said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics. They noted that ADP originally showed a 157,000 rise in private sector employment in June, while the government report found companies had added just 57,000 positions.Meanwhile, growth in the US service sector slowed to the lowest level since February 2010 in July, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The non-manufacturing index fell to 52.7 last month from 53.3 in June, missing expectations of a slight rise to 53.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion.
13;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2011-07-18T18:16:20Z;Medical Devices;The industry once seemed to have it all;"Medical cost inflation may be out of control, but it is not showing up on the income statements of medical device makers. For many of the most important products – pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, orthopaedic implants, spinal implants and cardiac stents – revenue growth has slowed or turned negative over the past few years. Recent company reports show the trend continues.The industry once seemed to have it all: a demographic tailwind from an ageing rich world, defensiveness, exciting scientific innovation. Yet share performance in the past two years has been mixed, with firms focused on pacemakers/defibrillators and stents (Medtronic, St. Jude, Boston Scientific) underperforming badly while orthopaedic specialists (Stryker, Smith & Nephew, and Zimmer) have fared better.All these companies offer newer, fast-growing products, but few of these are likely to be as large as those that are struggling: Bernstein Research pegs global annual sales of pacemakers and defibrillators at $11bn; replacement hips and knees at $13bn. The faster-growing trauma market, for example, totals just $5bn.What is going on? In stents and spinal devices, debates over the strength of the underlying clinical data are reflected in slowing sales. In general, though, despite the secular forces pushing up demand, and the apparent non-discretionary nature of its products, the industry turns out to be surprisingly cyclical. The economic downturn has hurt. Patients’ insurance co-payments and deductibles, loss of job-based coverage and tougher negotiations with strapped hospitals are taking their toll. The critical question is whether economic recovery would restore the industry to health – or whether the crisis has taught doctors, hospitals and patients that they can get by without shelling out for the very latest medical gizmo.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
14;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Analyst fined over misleading message;;A former MF Global analyst has been fined £50,000 ($79,182) for sending clients and colleagues a “misleading and inaccurate” instant message that appeared to contain inside information about a UK-listed company.The Financial Services Authority said trading in shares of Enterprise Inns more than trebled and the price rose more than 4 per cent in the two hours after Christopher Gower sent his message, entitled “Hot off the press” to 14 clients and a message group of 60 colleagues.The case is the first FSA enforcement action to stem from an instant message and reflects growing concern among regulators about rumour-mongering and loose treatment of potential inside information by financial professionals.Margaret Cole, FSA head of enforcement, said: “There is no excuse for a senior retail analyst to be so careless with messages that could have such an impact on the market. Gower’s dissemination of inaccurate information contributed to a large increase in the volume of shares traded and a disorderly market in ETI shares.”Mr Gower’s solicitor declined to comment, as did MF Global.The FSA said Mr Gower’s message on May 7 2008, which cited a meeting he had with the chief executive of Punch Taverns, inaccurately gave the impression he was passing on inside information about Enterprise’s efforts to win permission to convert to a real estate investment trust (Reit).But the regulator stopped short of charging Mr Gower with market abuse, saying that his conduct was “careless” and failed to meet market standards.“This case emphasises the scrupulous care analysts need to take when they make informal communications about companies they are following …[and] shows that the “broker’s banter” defence will not assist if analysts are caught gilding the lily,” said Angela Hayes, partner at the Mayer Brown law firm.The FSA brought a similar case in 2006 against Sean Pignatelli, a Credit Suisse equity salesman. He was fined £20,000 for passing on what appeared to be inside information about US-listed Boston Scientific.In 2008, the regulator warned in a newsletter that it was concerned about the spread of rumours and urged regulated firms to set out their policies about passing on information and do more training of their staff. It warned last year about leaks.US regulators are also cracking down on rumours. The Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008 charged a Wall Street trader with spreading false stories about a company that he was selling short.Paul Glass, a lawyer with Taylor Wessing, said: “This case is a reminder that the FSA isn’t just interested in insider dealing …Any disclosure of misleading information by an approved person which affects the market is likely to be investigated.”

Community Health Systems offered to buy Tenet for $3.3bn, or $6 per share in cash and stock.But Tenet rejected the bid, at about a 40 per cent premium over Thursday’s closing price, as “not remotely fair value”.Shares in Community Health Systems, which has made eight acquisitions in the past two years, making it the largest publicly traded US hospital company, also soared, up 13.4 per cent to $35.89.Other healthcare stocks were lifted by the bid. Carefusion added 2 per cent to $24.19 Thermo Fisher rose 1.9 per cent to $53.04 and Boston Scientific gained 3.5 per cent to $7.11.Positive US economic data helped the wider indices edge up but they struggled to get past their two-year high.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,240.26, and higher by 1.2 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,410.32, up 0.1 per cent over the five days.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,637.54, climbing 1.8 per cent on the week.The US trade deficit contracted more than forecast in October as a weaker dollar and growing overseas economies helped exports hit a two-year high.A separate release showed US consumer sentiment increased more than forecast, to its highest level in six months. But it did not significantly move the consumer discretionary index, which was up just 0.3 per cent.Record commodities imports in China lifted shares in metal producers. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold added 2 per cent to $112.87 and iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources gained 3.3 per cent to $74.33.Industrials led the risers, climbing 1 per cent as both General Electric and Honeywell joined the ranks of companies returning more money to shareholders.General Electric jumped 3.4 per cent to $17.72 after it raised its dividend for the second time this year, making a total increase of 37 per cent this year. Honeywell added 1.3 per cent to $51.98 after it hiked its dividend by 10 per cent.United Technologies also rose, up 1 per cent to $78.40, after it said late on Thursday that it expected profit to rise between 7 and 14 per cent next year.The S&P 500 financials index climbed 3.6 per cent over the week with regional bank stocks surging 7.4 per cent.Analysts at JPMorgan said the rally in regional bank stocks had been sparked by the steepening of the yield curve in US Treasuries. “In our view, this response in valuations is justified given that a steeper yield curve should support net interest income growth as cash and securities are potentially invested at higher rates,” they said. “The steeper curve also points to [a] growing probability of rising short-term rates, which is a potentially powerful catalyst for core-deposit-funded institutions.”This week also saw the best first day of trading for an IPO in three years. Chinese video streaming company Youku soared 146.5 per cent when it debuted on Wednesday but dropped 12.2 per cent to $37.50 on Friday.Borders Group sunk 12.4 per cent to $1.20 after the bookstore chain said that, if talks to refinance failed, it could end up in violation of its credit agreements in the first quarter.Shares in the retailer had gained earlier in the week after Pershing Square Capital Management, William Ackman’s hedge fund, offered to finance a potential bid by Borders for rival Barnes & Noble. Shares in Barnes & Noble edged down 0.7 per cent to $15.08.

Economists had forecast a decline to 52.1.“Consumer confidence is being sapped by high unemployment, rising gasoline prices, low equity prices and now a renewed decline in house prices,” said Paul Dales, US economist for Capital Economics.“This all suggests that the outlook for consumption growth remains ominous.”Shares sunk after the number was released, but later rebounded. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 0.8 per cent, with the retail sector gaining 0.9 per cent.The index of consumer staples stocks added 0.8 per cent, benefiting from strong earnings from Walgreen, the largest US pharmacy chain, which beat expectations in its fourth quarter.Earnings per share were 49 cents, above the average estimate of 44 cents as revenue soared 7.4 per cent to $16.8bn. The retailer sold more prescription drugs, up by 1.6 per cent at stores open for more than a year.Shares in Walgreen jumped 11.4 per cent to $33.81.Last week, competitor Rite Aid suffered after it posted a loss and lowered its forecast for the full year. Rite Aid nudged higher by a fraction to 94 cents after Walgreen’s earnings, losing 0.3 per cent to 94 cents but CVS Caremark, which owns another pharmacy chain, climbed 2.7 per cent to $31.45.The healthcare sector rose 0.9 per cent with medical devices companies leading the risers. Boston Scientific gained 7.9 per cent to $6.18 and CR Bard added 2 per cent to $81.56.US-listed shares in BlackBerry maker Research in Motion lost 3 per cent to $46.91 after it unveiled its rival to the iPad, the BlackBerry Playbook.The tablet computer, which is aimed at its core business customers, will have a limited launch in October with a general release scheduled for January 2011.In early trading, shares in Apple fell 5.6 per cent after speculation that the number two at the company, Tim Cook, could leave to become chief executive at Hewlett-Packard. Although the companies would not comment, analysts quickly dismissed the idea and shares pared their losses to close down 1.5 per cent to $286.86.Hewlett-Packard climbed 0.9 per cent to $41.61 but elsewhere in the technology sector Google lost 0.6 per cent to $527.17, Cisco fell 1.1 per cent to $21.86 and Microsoft declined 0.2 per cent to $24.68.Before the opening bell, the S&P/Case-Shiller index showed house prices stabilising near their lows after the withdrawal of the homebuyer tax credit in April.On a seasonally adjusted basis, prices fell in line with economist expectations by 0.1 per cent in July.The homebuilders sector rose 1.6 per cent with DR Horton adding 2 per cent to $11.26 and Toll Brothers higher by 1.7 per cent to $19.09.But Pulte Homes climbed 1.5 per cent to $8.85 after Goldman Sachs upgraded it from “sell” to “neutral” partly because of debt purchases and cost-cutting.In contrast, Goldman Sachs cut KB Home from “neutral” to “sell” and reduced its price target. The Californian builder is focused on first-time buyers and suffered a 39 per cent drop in orders after the tax credit expired. Shares in KB Home dropped 1.8 per cent to $11.73.In deals news, Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings surged 8.1 per cent to $33.10 after it said it will buy privately owned generic drug manufacturer Qualitest Pharmaceuticals for about $1.2bn. The acquisition should help it cover the fall in revenue expected when the patent on its pain drug Lidoderm expires.Barnes & Noble shareholders voted for a slate proposed by Leonard Riggio, the chairman, instead of a group backed by investor Ron Burkle, ending a battle between the top two shareholders.

18;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2010-03-15T21:11:32Z;US stocks higher after release of reform bill;;US stocks closed broadly higher on the session on Monday following Senator Chris Dodd’s presentation of the finalised version of his financial regulation reform bill, but fears that the Chinese government would ramp up its monetary tightening efforts following comments by Wen Jiabao, Chinese premier, over the weekend weighed down on sentiment.Moderately better-than-expected US industrial production figures and some positive corporate news provided some further support.Overall industrial production rose 0.1 per cent last month compared with the consensus market forecast for no change.It followed a 0.9 per cent rise in January. The manufacturing component, however, fell 0.2 per cent.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,150.51 – importantly because 1,500 is a key technical level traders track.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,642.15. and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent off at 2,362.21.“We have seen the bottom of the abyss for the American consumer as measured by residential real estate prices, which have now bottomed out, and the worst it’s going to get with the unemployment situation,” said Len Blum, managing partner at Westwood Capital. “This is incredibly important as consumer spending accounts for about 70 per cent of US economic activity.”Phillips-Van Heusen, an apparel company that owns the Calvin Klein brand among others, climbed 9.8 per cent to $52.40 after it announced it was to buy Tommy Hilfiger from Apax Partners, a private equity fund, for about $3bn.Walmart gained 2.8 per cent to $55.42 as Citigroup upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy” and raised its target price from $54 to $65.“Walmart realises that it must act now to keep the customer and we expect Walmart to invest aggressively in price,” said Deborah Weinswig, analyst at Citigroup.Consol Energy, a coal and natural gas producer, lost 10.1 per cent to $48.85 after the company said it has agreed to buy Dominion Resources’ natural gas and oil exploration and production business for $3.5bn.The deal includes rights to 491,000 acres in West Virginia and Pennsylvania that will increase Consol’s natural gas reserves by about 50 per cent to 3,000bn cubic feet.Boston Scientific lost 12.6 per cent to $6.80, making it one of the biggest laggards in the S&P 500 index, after analysts at Sanford Bernstein said the company had halted sales of heart-rhythm devices because of a documentation error with its US regulatory filings. The devices brought in $1.8bn last year or 22 per cent of the group’s revenue.PepsiCo shares gained 1.6 per cent to $66.15 on news that the soft drink company raised its dividend by 7 per cent and said it would repurchase up to $15bn of stock.

19;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2010-02-11T22:03:11Z;Positive corporate results lift Wall Street;;Wall Street bounced back on Thursday after positive corporate results distracted the market from lingering uncertainty over Greece.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 1 per cent at 1,078.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 10,144.19 and the Nasdaq rose 1.4 per cent at 2,177.41.US stocks were down for the first two hours of trading after Europe’s rescue plan for Greece failed to satisfy investors, owing to its lack of detail.But encouraging unemployment data and better-than-expected corporate results gave support to the market.The number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits dropped sharply last week.Economists had been expecting about 465,000 new claims but the labour department reported that initial jobless claims had dropped from a revised 483,000 in the previous week to 440,000.PepsiCo doubled its profit in the last quarter thanks to strong international sales but the soft-drink manufacturer’s results were broadly in line with forecasts. Its shares gained 1.3 per cent to $61.19.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, VF Corp rose 2.6 per cent to $74.35 after the apparel group posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit owing to tight inventories. However, the group, which owns brands such as The North Face and Wrangler, warned that the consumer spending climate was still “exceptionally difficult”.AutoNation, the country’s largest car dealership, also beat its quarterly estimates. The group reported its first quarterly increase in revenue from new vehicle sales for five years. However, its shares were down 3 per cent to $17.69.3M rose 2.1 per cent to $80.27 after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded the diversified manufacturer from “market-perform” to “outperform”. They cited better margins and the potential for growth in multi-industrial groups.“These individual stories are able to provide a little bit of support but the issue of Europe continues to hang over the market,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.He added that investors were waiting for greater clarification of the rescue plan, expected next week.Viacom, which owns the MTV Networks and Paramount film studios, posted quarterly profit above consensus estimates thanks to the popularity of movies such as Transformers 2 and Star Trek. Profits rose almost fourfold in spite of declining advertising revenue from its cable channels. But after early strength, the shares were down 0.7 per cent to $30.04.Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest video game publisher, posted better-than-expected results and announced its first dividend.The group’s holiday release, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, has helped it to shrug off lingering concerns in the sector. Activision’s shares jumped 9.6 per cent to $11.07.Tekelec, which provides network equipment, posted better-than-expected quarterly results following strong demand and lower expenses. The company also announced the retirement of its chief financial officer, Bill Everett. Tekelec added 13.5 per cent to $16.89.Boston Scientific, the world’s second-largest maker of heart devices, weighed on the market after giving a disappointing forecast for this year.The group said it would also cut up to 1,300 jobs, or 10 per cent of its non-manufacturing staff. Shares in the company dropped 9.9 per cent to $7.47.Allegheny Energy jumped 12 per cent to $23.55 after FirstEnergy agreed to buy the power company for $4.7bn. The takeover is set to create one of the country’s largest utilities, serving more than 6.1m customers.The acquisition faces both state and federal regulatory hurdles but First-Energy said it expects to close the deal in just over a year’s time. FirstEnergy shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $39.59.Elsewhere in the sector, Hornbeck Offshore Services fell 9.5 per cent to $18.31. The provider of marine transportation to the offshore oil and gas industry gave a disappointing forecast for 2010.
20;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2009-10-20T20:48:06Z;Weak economic data weigh on Wall Street;;US equities fell on Tuesday, with indices pulling back from their highest levels in more than a year as traders focused on weak economic data rather than higher-than-expected earnings, including impressive figures from Apple and Caterpillar.Optimism that equities would post a second day of gains this week on strong earnings fizzled out when data on new residential construction showed a smaller- than-expected rise in September and the producer price index unexpectedly dropped during the month.The S&P 500 lost 0.6 per cent to 1,091.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.5 per cent lower at 10,041.48 and Nasdaq dropped 0.6 per cent at 2,163.47. On Monday, all three indices touched their highest levels in a year and the S&P traded above 1,100.The weaker-than-expected data weighed on homebuilders’ stocks and fuelled uncertainty about the lingering effects of the financial crisis and economic recession. “Housing is the epicentre of this whole crisis,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “So, anything to do with housing matters.”Mr Stone said that, after the rally in stocks over the past few weeks in anticipation of a strong earnings season, Tuesday’s declines also represent a pause for the results to catch up with those rosy expectations.Nonetheless, many earnings reports have provided evidence to support an economic rebound.“All the key bellwethers – Google, Intel, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and now Apple – have been really strong,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “That is what we were hoping to see. That is what will give us some confidence that the cycle is turning.”After the close of trading on Monday, Apple saw profit jump to a record $1.67bn, or $1.82 a share, from $1.14bn or $1.26 a share, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.42. Its shares rose 4.7 per cent to $198.76 and had traded near the all-time high of $202.96 hit in December of 2007. Caterpillar, maker of construction and farming equipment, on Tuesday announced third-quarter earnings of 64 cents per share, down from the third quarter of 2008, but a massive jump on analysts’ forecast of just 6 cents a share.Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive, offered an upbeat outlook. “We believe the third quarter marked the low point for Caterpillar sales and revenues in what has been the toughest recession since the 1930s. We are seeing encouraging signs that indicate a recovery may be under way.”Caterpillar shares ended up 3 per cent to $59.61.Pfizer said third-quarter revenue fell 3 per cent to $11.6bn versus the same quarter a year ago, but it still beat consensus estimates of $11.4bn, and its profit rose. Shares rose 0.3 per cent at $17.93, paring earlier gains. Lexmark, which makes printers, rose 16 per cent to $26.16 after better than expected revenue and profit.Shares in Lockheed Martin were down 6.5 per cent to $71.99. The world’s largest defence contractor, said that its third-quarter profit rose by 1.9 per cent as it enjoyed stronger sales of electronics and aeronautics, but it projected that earnings would drop next year.Net income at Lockheed rose to $797m, or $2.07 a share, from $782m, or $1.92 a share, in the same quarter a year ago, beating expectations of $1.82 a share.Coca-Cola was off 1.3 per cent at $54.07 after its quarterly revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations and the soft drinks maker warned that economic conditions would continue to weigh on consumers. Net revenues fell 4 per cent to $8.04bn versus analysts’ forecasts for $8.11bn. Coca-Cola reported earnings of $1.9bn or 81 cents a diluted share, unchanged from the same quarter last year.Boeing dropped 2.9 per cent to $51.89 after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to underperform from equal weight and cut the target price to $43 from $50 on concerns about further delays on the 787, negative 2010 cash flow and poor aircraft order demand.Boston Scientific lowered its guidance for full-year net sales, prompting a 15.7 per cent drop in its shares to $8.57. After the close, Yahoo! reported a strong increase in third-quarter profit. Shares rose 1 per cent in after hours trade.
21;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2008-12-27T00:54:37Z;NY Times puts Boston Red Sox stake in play;;The New York Times is aggressively courting buyers for its stake in the Boston Red Sox baseball team and potentially the Boston Globe newspaper, in a transaction that could attract bids worth $200m to $225m, according to a person familiar with the matter.The Times faces a cash shortage next May, when a $400m credit facility matures and revenue from continuing operations falls amid a severe advertising decline that has ravaged publishers in the US.The company began discussions two weeks ago with Jack Connors, a former advertising executive in Boston, to sell the Globe and its 17.5 per cent stake in the Red Sox.The Times paid $75m for its stake as part of a 2002 buy-out of the Red Sox franchise and now hopes to sell for four times that amount.The publisher alerted the majority owners of the Red Sox of its intentions to sell in November, the person familiar with the matter said, confirming a Wall Street Journal report.Other parties, including Peter Nicholas, chairman and co-founder of medical devices maker Boston Scientific, is also seen to be interested in the Red Sox stake, according to the person.Another scenario under consideration by potential bidders includes merging the Boston Globe with News Corp’s Ottaway newspaper chain and consolidating and shutting down the Boston Herald, the Boston Globe’s rival.Patrick Purcell, owner and publisher of the Boston Herald and a former News Corp executive, was recently tapped by News Corp to run the Ottaway chain.Mr Purcell is understood to have visited the Globe’s printing plant in Massachusetts shortly after the Thanksgiving holiday in November, the person said.News Corp pulled the Ottaway chain – comprised of eight daily newspapers and 15 weeklies – off the market after failing to sell the papers before a June 30 deadline. One News Corp source said it was not currently involved in discussions.Mr Purcell and Mr Nicholas were not immediately contactable. A New York Times spokeswoman declined to comment.To shore up cash, the Times has sought a sale and leaseback of its new headquarters, expecting to raise $225m as it continues to evaluate a portfolio of assets that also includes About.com and a handful of regional newspapers.The Times’ latest moves come after it rebuffed an offer led by Jack Welch, former General Electric chief executive, and Mr Connors in 2006. At the time, Mr Welch’s group valued the Boston Globe at $550m to $600m.This month, Barclays estimated the Globe would be worth only $27m to $54m. The stake in the Red Sox could be worth about $166m, Barclays said earlier.The Times purchased the Globe in 1993 for $1.1bn. It has written down the value of its New England group by $980m since 2007.
22;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2008-10-01T20:40:32Z;Economic data add to Wall Street gloom;;Another volatile session for US stocks ended in the red as anxiety over paralysis in money markets and a Senate vote on the revised $700bn banking sector rescue package dwarfed even General Electric’s dramatic $15bn capital raising.GE led the declines on the Dow Jones Industrial Average early in the session as its credit default swaps widened. Yet the conglomerate later pared those losses to stand 5.2 per cent lower at $24.18 after it emerged that Warren Buffett would make a $3bn investment.Glum macroeconomic data underlined the parlous state of the US economy, although traders said that the prospect of a vast government intervention to stave off financial collapse took precedence over all other developments.“All these things normally the market would care about,” said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at Voyageur Asset Management. Now, he added, “we care [only] as much as it takes to read a headline”. The S&P 500 fell as much as 2.2 per cent but later clawed back to close 0.5 per cent lower at 1,161.06, ahead of the Senate vote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent at 10,831.07 while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.1 per cent at 2,069.40.Still, the moves were tame by recent eye-popping comparison. Stocks’ biggest rally for six years in the previous session followed their biggest sell-off for more than twenty.Industrials, down 2.6 per cent, led the market declines after a gauge of manufacturing activity – the economy’s silver lining this year – contracted further in September, falling to its lowest level since October 2001. The level is historically associated with a recession in the broader economy.Caterpillar and Honeywell lost 4.5 per cent at $56.95 and $39.68 respectively.A slew of other economic data – from job losses to mortgage applications – also hurt sentiment.Meanwhile, an oil price decline afforded the automotive sector scant comfort. Nor did news that President Bush had approved a $25bn package to help the sector. Ford sank 12.5 per cent to $4.55 after warning that US sales fell 34.6 per cent in September, to its weakest level of the year. It also said second-half profit at its European unit would be hit by falling demand and rising raw material costs.General Motors fell as much as 4.76 per cent but later recovered to stand 0.2 per cent higher at $9.47. Light vehicle sales fell 16 per cent in September.Financials and consumer staples, were the only sectors to enjoy rises of more than 1 per cent. Telecoms and utilities also inched into positive territory.Regional banks continued their recovery from Monday’s brutal sell-off. National City and Fifth Third leapt 65.1 per cent at $2.89 and 16.1 per cent at $13.82 respectively, the former helped by takeover speculation.Citigroup rose 12.1 per cent to $23.Energy stocks, which rallied in the previous session, lost 1.7 per cent as oil prices fell. Peabody Energy led the declines, down 8.8 per cent at $41.05.Airlines soared as crude-oil prices fell below $100. Delta Airlines, for example, added 14.8 per cent at $8.55.Among technology stocks, down 2.2 per cent, IBM was particularly hard hit. It fell 5.8 per cent at $110.13 on fears that the Dow component may have missed its third quarter profit targets.Elsewhere, Boston Scientific and Medtronic fell 7.6 per cent to $11.34 and inched down 0.2 per cent to $49.83 respectively after a court ruled that the pair had to pay $629m in interest to Johnson & Johnson down 2.2 per cent at $67.79. That took its total award in an 11-year patent case to $1.2bn.Ingersoll-Rand and Parker Hannifin fell 5.5 per cent to $29.46 and 3.6 per cent to $51.09 after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the two groups from “buy” to hold”.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the fear gauge, inched up 0.5 per cent to 39.59, indicating extremely high levels of distress.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, rose 1.5 per cent. Earlier in the session, it fell back below the level set when the ban was introduced last month but later recovered.Wal-Martlost 0.4 per cent at $59.66 after the retailer said it would cut prices on popular toys ahead of Christmas.
23;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2008-01-13T17:49:28Z;Chief with an impulse for innovation;;"Bill Weldon remembers talking to his wife about problems in the US housing market long before the credit squeeze set in. The chief executive of Johnson & Johnson had been perplexed for some time by the number of people who were over-extending themselves by taking on large mortgages – a trend distinctly at odds with his self-confessed prudence.“My wife and I are just very conservative people,” he says in an interview with the Financial Times in his modest, almost under-furnished, office.This could be dismissed as scripted false humility. After all, Mr Weldon earns a lot – nearly $5m in salary and cash bonus in 2006 of total compensation valued at $28.6m. But the cautious approach to his own finances is reflected in the way he runs the world’s largest health group.With a market value of $195bn and forecast revenues of $65bn for this financial year, the health conglomerate has few financial restraints. Yet two years ago J&J allowed an agreed bid for Guidant, a medical device maker, to be broken up by a much smaller rival, Boston Scientific, which paid $27bn.Mr Weldon defends his decision to stick to J&J’s $24bn offer as good sense. “If you want to be bold and brazen you could pay whatever you want to get it. But I’m not sure it ever returns value to shareholders. If we couldn’t return value to shareholders, we weren’t going to do it,” he says.It is often hard to tell where Mr Weldon stops and J&J begins. Perhaps this is not surprising as the down-to-earth, square-jawed, 59-year-old has spent his entire 36-year career at J&J, an icon of corporate America.Dressed casually in a light sweater and leather loafers, Mr Weldon is straightforward, competitive and prudent – like an old-fashioned sports coach.“Your personality changes as you evolve,” he says. “I am a very very competitive person. And people know that I want us to play to win, and don’t want us to play just not to lose.”Born in Brooklyn, New York, not far from J&J’s global headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Mr Weldon had not planned a career in management. In fact, he vowed after working one summer as a junior accountant that he “would never go into business”. His ambition was to enter medicine.Just before graduating from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, his wife became pregnant with the first of their two children. So he decided to get a job at J&J to pay some bills as the pressures of fatherhood approached. A family friend who had promised to pay Mr Weldon’s medical school fees died and his medical ambitions were thwarted. “He passed away and I never left J&J,” Mr Weldon says.Now, after almost six years as J&J chief executive, Mr Weldon is considering his legacy. It is a daunting thought in view of the company’s history, which has seen compounded annual sales growth of more than 11 per cent since it was founded in 1887.Increasing scientific, regulatory, pricing and cost pressures have added to the task facing for Mr Weldon, who has restructured J&J, cutting 4,000 jobs, in an effort to keep the company’s profits growing robustly in the next two potentially difficult years. But while J&J is financially cautious, it is also obliged to think big and “experiment with new ideas”, as stated in the Credo it set out more than 60 years ago. This statement of guiding principles prioritises customers, doctors, nurses, patients, mothers and fathers; second, employees; third, helping the community; and last, stockholders who on serving the others “should realise a fair return”.Mr Weldon believes his biggest impact may be on the company’s approach to innovation, though he adds: “I may not be alive to see it happen.” In the short term, he is pushing J&J’s healthcare companies to share ideas and expertise so they can invent products and sell them more efficiently. There are 80 projects in converging technologies, of which about six, he suggests, could be chosen for fast-track development. One involves J&J’s contact lens business working on a lens that delivers a drug directly to the eyes.And in spite of the failure to buy Guidant, which makes implantable devices that use electrical signals to control heart rhythms, Mr Weldon remains fascinated with medical devices. He plans to continue to seek microelectronics expertise and sees no end to the possibilities of medical devices.“I think the device industry is an extraordinary place to be,” he says. “Some day, some way, you’re going to be sitting in New York and the surgeon is going to be performing surgery [on you] from the west coast.”Nearly every conversation reveals his enthusiasm for healthcare technology. In November, Mr Weldon made a move he hopes will help J&J shape the industry’s future, setting up a group with the Orwellian title of the Office of Strategy and Growth to research futuristic possibilities in healthcare.The blue-sky team is charged with identifying as-yet unimagined lines of business, including information technology and potential future partners such as Google, Microsoft and Cisco. “Who knows who it is going to be? It is trying to understand the future of healthcare – totally divorced from where we are today,” he says.In another example, Mr Weldon speaks of how J&J’s decentralised business model and diverse product portfolio have allowed it to thrive while other rivals, particularly the big drugmakers, are seeking ways to transform themselves.“I don’t think there’s any company positioned as well as we are. There’s nobody that has the size and financial strength to be able to do this.”A high school football injury has finally caught up with Mr Weldon, so that he walks a little stiffly now. The knee was replaced two years ago with a titanium implant but it is a constant reminder of Mr Weldon’s days as an athletic, aspiring doctor who detoured to become a J&J salesman. And it is a knee made by J&J’s DePuy, of course.He implies he has no regrets, arguing that his current role gives him the chance to help more people than if he had fulfilled his ambition to become a doctor.And, he insists: “I’d say I am the same person I was 30 years ago.”"
24;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2007-07-11T18:20:50Z;Bausch & Lomb;;It is enough to send the board of Advanced Medical Optics cross-eyed.One minute it is plotting an audacious takeover of Bausch & Lomb, a company almost twice AMO’s size, with a leading shareholder considering a $700m cash injection to help finance the deal. The next, the same shareholder fires off a public letter criticising the bid and AMO management and saying it will vote its 15 per cent stake against a deal.It is unclear what caused ValueAct’s change of heart. But having such a large, vocal shareholder in opposition puts AMO in a tough spot. The company is already stretching itself to make such a bid. It faces a serious integration challenge if it succeeds. There are regulatory concerns. And it is fighting a rival all-cash bid from private equity group Warburg Pincus.Can AMO still win? Possibly. It has committed financing for its $75-a-share offer even without ValueAct. Although that is a mixture of cash and shares, it is well above Warburg’s $65 bid. After an initial tumble round the time its interest in Bausch & Lomb emerged, AMO shares have remained reasonably steady.But success looks more and more like an outside possibility. On top of all the challenges outlined above, there is now the added risk for the Bausch & Lomb board that AMO shareholders could scupper a deal even if it is agreed.AMO shareholders are also no doubt well aware of a recent precedent for companies with product recall problems stretching to buy bigger rivals. Boston Scientific has been a one-way ticket downwards since beating Johnson & Johnson to buy Guidant last year.If Warburg sweetens its bid – something investors are arguably hoping for, given that Bausch & Lomb’s shares trade half way between the two offers – its no-risk cash will be hard to beat.
25;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Lombard share placing to fund crucial trials;;Lombard Medical, the medical devices specialist, has £6.6m from a share placing to fund ongoing clinical trials, but warned that the business may need a further injection of capital in the next 12 months if certain disposals are not made.Lombard also cautioned that if shareholders do not approve the placing of 29.5m shares at 25p the company may not be able to trade beyond July. Lombard has cash and short-term deposits of £1.9m.The proceeds of the placing will be used to fund US trials of Aorfix, a stent graft. The product is already on the market in Europe where last year sales grew to £469,000 (£169,000).The company is hoping to offload its 11.8 per cent holding in Vascular Concepts, an India-based devices maker, which is worth about £2.5m. Lombard may also sell PolyBioMed, its polymer coatings division, which is valued at up to £5m.Shares in Lombard have fallen 50 per cent over the past six months. The company had a setback last year when Boston Scientific Group backed out as the major distributor of Aorfix in Europe. US regulatory approval has also taken longer than anticipated.Brian Howlett, chief executive, said: “We are very confident the clinical trial will generate revenue, we are focused on making sure we get real traction in Europe.”The company has subsequently strengthened its own distribution network outside the US, and the product is now reaching 20 countries.One analyst said: “Lombard has about 12 months worth of cash. The shares could come under more pressure. If they don’t do the trade sell-offs but achieve good penetration in Europe, establish a distribution deal with one of the majors that involves upfront payments, and US clinical trials go to plan they stand a good chance of continued shareholder support.”Lombard has signed a worldwide distribution deal with Medtronic, the US-based medical technology company, for its endovascular stapler, EndoRefix, a product for repairing artery walls.The company should earn royalty payments of up to $5m (£2.5m).Full-year pre-tax losses narrowed to £11.1m (£12m) while sales increased to £517,000 (£169,000m). Losses per share were 21p (151.2p).The shares were unchanged at 27½p.
26;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2007-04-26T21:33:41Z;Bristol-Myers Squibb;;For a company as badly injured as Bristol-Myers Squibb, any signs of recovery are welcome. It has done more than that since last year’s self-inflicted Plavix disaster, when the drugsmaker allowed a generic rival to flood the market.Thursday’s surprise appointment of James Cornelius, interim chief executive, for another two years is unlikely to quell speculation of a potential sale. As CEO of Guidant, Mr Cornelius skilfully engineered the bidding war for the medical device maker and its eventual sale to Boston Scientific. He seems to have been equally adroit at avoiding a takeover of BMS at a bargain price.Admittedly, first quarter earnings at BMS mainly surpassed expectations thanks to an effective tax rate of just 9.4 per cent. But tight cost controls and a recovery in Plavix sales also helped. That further strengthens the case for remaining independent while the Plavix litigation is still pending. BMS and its partner Sanofi-Aventis look set to successfully defend their patent for the blood-thinning drug.In the meantime, however, Sanofi would have an information edge over other bidders, who might otherwise be enticed by the comparatively promising pipeline of BMS. Mr Cornelius’s latest drug development deal, this time with Pfizer, is another sign of how desperate big drugs companies remain to get their hands on new products.The terms appear favourable for BMS even if it gets bought. But like a similar agreement earlier in the year with AstraZeneca, it might reduce the appeal of BMS as a target. Given Mr Cornelius’s record as a seller, chances are he would still secure a decent price. But with BMS shares trading at 23 times this year’s earnings on the back of bid hopes, Mr Cornelius should keep in mind that there is often a fine line between sensible delaying tactics and poison pills.
27;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Speculation on Bristol as takeover talk grows;;"Bristol-Myers Squibb heightened speculation that it was a takeover target on Thursday, as the US drugmaker elevated interim chief executive James Cornelius to become its permanent leader.Mr Cornelius moved from the Bristol board to serve as interim chief executive last year, replacing Peter Dolan, who was fired after mishandling a patent settlement and a subsequent criminal investigation.Barbara Ryan, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “Bristol-Myers obviously could not lure an external candidate and we view this as a purely cosmetic move …The outlook for Bristol remains unchanged in our view with a potential take-out still a likely possibility.”Bristol’s chances of being acquired could grow significantly in the middle of this year as two crucial legal problems are resolved. In June, Bristol hopes to complete a two-year probation period to avoid federal criminal charges for a past inventory and accounting scandal.Bristol will also likely receive a trial decision soon to decide whether the patent is valid on its most important drug Plavix, a blood thinner sold in conjunction with Sanofi-Aventis, its French partner.Sanofi has been among those sizing up Bristol as a potential acquisition.Bristol’s condition was weakened after a raft of patent expires on key drugs.On Thursday, Bristol added a significant partnership with Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, to help it develop and equally share profits for apixaban, a promising anticoagulant treatment.They will also share development of some Pfizer obesity and diabetes drugs.Pfizer, which needs to fill holes for profit growth, has a history of eventually swallowing partners that co-market key drugs. Two of its biggest drugs Lipitor, for cholesterol, and Celebrex, a cox-2 inhibitor class painkiller, came with its blockbuster acquisitions of Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia.Mr Cornelius said he would lead a “strategic review” of Bristol’s four business areas – cardiovascular/metabolic drugs; specialty drugs like oncology; mature brands; and its nutritionals and imaging businesses – to “unlock shareholder value.”Bristol said first quarter earnings excluding items rose 16 per cent to $744m."
28;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2007-03-27T00:45:38Z;Efficacy of stents called into question;;A seven-year US study has called into question whether doctors are overusing heart stents, the blockbuster tiny wire mesh tubes used to prop open narrowing coronary arteries.The results of the study, called Courage, added more uncertainty to a stent market that recently has been thrown into flux over questions of safety, appropriate usage and new competition.This flux was also highlighted by a 7 per cent fall in the share price of Boston Scientific, a leading US stent maker, because new data showed a forthcoming stent by rival Abbott Laboratories could be better than its most important product, Taxus.Debate has swirled among the medical community, regulators and device-makers, raising questions over the past year on whether medical devices have been used too soon and too aggressively.Drug-coated stents, whose coating helps keep arteries from scarring and closing again, have been at the centre of that debate as one of the most widely used devices.Medical devices are increasingly feeling scrutiny, akin to that seen with pharmaceuticals, from doctors and US regulators concerned with potential emerging questions about long-term safety.In addition, as use of expensive devices has increased markedly, more scrutiny has fallen on the relative benefit of new medical devices. For instance, a recent Food and Drug Administration panel recommended against approval of a implantable heart data monitor by Medtronic, a US group, that could transmit patient data to a doctor via the internet.The Courage study, presented on Monday at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting, looked at whether people receiving stents and drug therapy had fewer deaths or heart attacks than those with drug therapy alone.Importantly, the study sought to find out if stents in patients with stable coronary artery disease – whose life was not acutely threatened – reduced risk of death and heart attacks because such a benefit “had not been shown”.The study said that, in 2004, more than 1m stents were implanted in the US and 85 per cent were done so in patients with stable disease.The Courage study found “no significant differences” by using bare-metal stents as compared with drug therapy alone, in death, heart attacks or stroke. It did find that patients with stents had fewer chest pains.
29;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2007-01-14T19:36:33Z;Caremark fight;;It is fun to see real bickering over a takeover. It makes a change from neatly pre-packaged leveraged buy-outs. US drug benefits manager Express Scripts’ proposal to buy larger rival Caremark shows the former’s “desperation” to “interfere” with the latter’s agreed deal with retail pharmacy group CVS, according to Caremark. The spurned suitor, meanwhile, has proposed directors for its target’s board and urged investors to block the CVS deal – which it has also attacked in a lawsuit.Caremark favours a premium-free, all-stock “merger of equals” with CVS. The combination – with a market capitalisation of about $50bn – could, over time, realise the value enhancements touted by proponents of the deal. The Scripts offer, half in cash, is worth about 10 per cent more. But it would involve a delay for antitrust clearance and high leverage.Weighing a seemingly solid, friendly deal against a higher but riskier one is a classic board dilemma. MCI’s former shareholders, for example, are probably regretting the company’s sale to Verizon, agreed in spite of a higher bid from Qwest. Since the deal was done in May 2005, the leveraged upstart’s shares have more than doubled, while Verizon’s have only edged higher. On the other hand, Guidant’s former owners might, with hindsight, wonder if they should have taken blue chip Johnson & Johnson’s stingy offer a year ago against Boston Scientific’s higher bid. Today, with Boston shares down more than 20 per cent, J&J’s cash and stock package would be worth more.At the same time, investors are often disappointed if a company that starts dating ends up single. CVS may yet win over Caremark shareholders with a better offer. But if shareholders vote down the CVS deal, Caremark might need to change its tune and talk to Scripts – or invite other offers. Entertainment value aside, the Caremark board’s dismissive attitude to Scripts looks short-sighted.
30;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
31;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-12-05T21:18:43Z;FDA panel set to review safety of stents;;"Drug-coated stents - once hailed as a revolutionary treatment for clogged arteries - will be the focus of a safety review by a US regulatory panel on Thursday following speculation about a possible heightened risk of later clotting.The tiny wire-mesh tubes, which are inserted to prop open closing arteries, are coated in drugs designed to to prevent arteries from reclosing, specifically from scar tissue.The two-day expert panel convened by the Food and Drug Administration will review the safety risks of such devices, including Boston Scientific’s Taxus, and rival Cypher by Johnson & Johnson.The panel will be looking at possible regulatory recommendations for the FDA on how the stents are used, what safety data is necessary, and the significance of the risk of the clotting - called late stent thrombosis.But the FDA advisory meeting also exemplifies recent shifts in western society about the weighing of risks and benefits. Safety of medical treatments is a hot-button issue for patients, legislators and regulators, particularly following the withdrawal two years ago by US drugmaker Merck of the painkiller Vioxx because of heart risks.Sociologists and risk experts say society’s perception of technology has undergone a subtle shift. Whereas in the industrial age, the concept goes, technology was seen as a solution, in the post-industrial age technology can be seen as a creator of problems, as much as a solution.The FDA’s past few years of controversies has highlighted this shift. The primary technologies of the FDA’s regulatory mandate - which covers a fourth of all US gross domestic product - have faced safety controversies.In traditional pharmaceuticals, there was Vioxx; in biotechnology, there were safety issues for Tysabri, a BiogenIdec treatment for multiple sclerosis; in medical devices, malfunctions of Guidant’s implantable cardiac defibrillators and safety questions about stents; and in consumer health, fungal infection concerns with Bausch & Lomb’s advanced contact solution.In addition, organic foods also attracted controversy in this year’s US recall of bagged spinach due to e-coli bacteria contamination.“The pendulum has swayed way toward safety,” said John Farrall, healthcare industries analyst for private client investments at US bank National City.New regulations, added safety warnings or changes to recommended usage could affect the lucrative US market for coated stents. They often cost nearly double the price of bare-metal stents, generating more than $5bn in US sales combined for Boston’s Taxus and J&J’s Cypher. Safety questions have hurt their usage rates, and negative panel conclusions this week could hurt them further.In meeting documents, FDA staff reviewers said coated stents do well to prevent arteries from reclosing, but also have a “small but significant risk” of clotting after a year, compared with bare metal ones.The Cleveland Clinic, a leading heart research hospital, analysed 14 drug-coated stent studies and found up to five times the relative risk of causing a blood clot than bare-metal stents.Key questions, FDA said, remain on whether more deaths or heart attacks occur with coated stents, and what the limits are in treating heart problems with the popular devices.Dr Donald Baim, chief scientist at Boston, said 30 years of progress in this area had reduced risk, not added it. “These are safe procedures that have reached a level we never dreamed of,” he said.Boston acknowledges the small risk of clotting - 1.3 per cent of Taxus patients versus 0.8 per cent bare-metal stents - but says death rates are not higher in these typically sick patients. In addition, it adds that coated stents’ prevention of repeat procedures is still double that of bare stents.One recommendation that could emerge from the meeting is that patients with coated stents should take blood-thinning drug Plavix for a longer period to prevent clots. This could be a boost for drugmakers Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the maker of Plavix.Competitors such as US devicemakers Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic will be watching the review panel keenly for any sign that the FDA could require further safety data that could delay their new drug-coated stents.But the meeting might be best remembered as a signpost that medical devices - their new technology, cost and risks - are as much under the microscope as drugs."
32;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-11-24T21:40:33Z;City lawyers highlight FSA’s scope to punish;;The £20,000 fine imposed this week on a former Credit Suisse First Boston equity salesman for appearing – falsely – to have inside information highlights the latitude that the Financial Services Authority’s principles-based regime gives it to punish misbehaviour, City lawyers warned on Friday.Sean Pignatelli was penalised on Thursday for failing to consult his compliance department in May 2005 about whether a sensitive e-mail from a colleague contained inside information about a US company, Boston Scientific.He compounded the error by relaying the e-mail’s contents to investment clients in a way that made it sound more like inside information.The e-mail concluded: “Don’t want to get in trouble . . . keep btwn us for now” – words echoed by Mr Pignatelli in calls to some hedge funds who subsequently dealt in the stock in question.“This shows how much leeway principles-based regulation gives the FSA when it comes to taking action,” said Stephen Gentle, criminal partner at London-based law firm Kingsley Napley.Tim Plews, a partner in financial markets at Clifford Chance, said the case was “slap-bang” in the direction he thought the FSA might head under its principles.“This is a real wake-up call to people that their assumptions about what they can and can’t do are open to challenge,” he said.“There must be plenty of people out there who are saying ‘there but for the grace of God go I’ . . . There’s a lot of grey about what’s acceptable and what is not.”Ruth Fox, head of the financial markets regulation practice at Slaughter and May, said the case illustrated how individuals had direct responsibilities to the FSA that were separate from their employers’ duties to the regulator.Adam Epstein, Mr Pignatelli’s lawyer and a partner at Mishcon de Reya, said the FSA’s guidance on what constituted acceptable behaviour was “very limited” and gave the regulator “considerable latitude” when it made decisions on cases.The reaction on Friday on trading floors was muted.A former equity sales rival of Mr Pignatelli’s said: “It is extremely naive to send out e-mails saying ‘keep this to yourself’. I wouldn’t do it myself but if you are going to receive inside information, you do it in a bar.”The lack of public action by the FSA against any of the hedge funds involved suggests either that they did not come under the regulator’s jurisdiction or that they identified that Mr Pignatelli’s calls contained possible inside information and went through appropriate compliance procedures.
33;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-11-23T20:44:31Z;FSA fines trader for ‘outsider’ information;;It might be the first recorded incident of someone being fined for “outsider” trading.Sean Pignatelli, a London-based equity salesman, was not passing on inside information when he called clients about a US medical company in May last year. But on Thursday he was ordered to pay a £20,000 (€29,600) fine to the Financial Services Authority for sounding as though he was.The ruling will unnerve the City given that the regulator accepted that real inside information was not involved and that Mr Pignatelli had not thought he possessed inside information, nor had deliberately sought to give that impression.Mr Pignatelli was on the US equity sales desk of CSFB, now Credit Suisse, when he received an e-mail offering a “good tidbit to pass around” from one of the firm’s analysts in New York.The “tidbit” was a “heads up” about a meeting to be held the next day by Boston Scientific, the US medical devices maker. The analyst said he had met the chief executive, and Boston was likely to lower its earnings guidance. In fact, there was nothing price sensitive in the e-mail.Within six minutes of receiving the e-mail, Mr Pignatelli passed on the tip to four hedge funds that then sold Boston’s shares. In one call Mr Pignatelli told a client: “Keep it to yourself …don’t want to get into trouble, erm…just a heads up ahead of tomorrow’s analyst meeting.”CSFB reported Mr Pignatelli to the FSA the following day and dismissed him for serious misconduct a month later, concluding he had breached its compliance procedure. The FSA said that Mr Pignatelli failed to consider whether the e-mail contained inside information, and should have discussed it with his compliance department.It said it allowed latitude for “sales patter”. Nevertheless, Mr Pignatelli should not have conveyed the information to clients in a way that made it sound more like inside information.Mr Pignatelli submitted to the FSA that a chief executive would not have provided such information to an analyst, and that it would not have been circulated, as it was, in a group e-mail.“I just go into sales mode, you know, try and make the call look as proprietary as possible,” he told the regulator. He declined to comment on Thursday.The FSA also declined to comment on whether it is to take action against the funds that traded after Mr Pignatelli’s calls.

Ordinarily, it would not be much of a story, but Branson has made himself big news this week. Amid all the helpful coverage he has had over ITV, the opportunity to remind people of the stock’s 90 per cent decline in five years is too good to miss. I feel a share price chart coming on…Alas, looking at my page it may be hard to avoid using a picture of Branson. Apologies if you feel you have seen rather alot of him recently.Great story from the FSA this afternoon: an equity salesman at CSFB, Sean Pignatelli, has been fined for passing on information which was not “inside”. At first, I thought Mr Pignatelli had thought the information was private. Apparently not (and apologies to Mr Pignatelli for misjudging him). Having read the FSA’s announcement more closely it seems that even Mr Pignatelli did not believe the information was “inside” and therefore didn’t think he was passing on inside information. His fault seems to have been that he passed on the information, which concerned Boston Scientific, “in a way that, in the FSA’s view, gave the impression that it was inside information”. He has been fined £20,000. Some people in the office here feel rather sorry for Pignatelli.

35;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;J&J sues Boston Scientific over Guidant;;Johnson & Johnson is seeking at least $5.5bn in damages from Boston Scientific for an alleged breach of contract in the takeover battle for Guidant, the US medical devices manufacturer.In a lawsuit filed in New York that could provide a test-case for third-party involvement in US bidding wars, J&J claims that Guidant, now a division of Boston Scientific, violated its merger agreement with J&J by allowing Abbott Laboratories to study its confidential information.That “due diligence”, performed in the heat of the merger battle in December and January, was pivotal in that it allowed Abbott to provide financing support for Boston Scientific and agree to buy a Guidant division to ease regulatory concerns.But in the complaint, J&J claims that Guidant was prevented from “soliciting alternative offers and had limited ability to respond to an unsolicited bid from another party” and could not provide “confidential business information to any other company unless that company was making an unsolicited takeover proposal.”The court’s decision on the merits of the suit could offer an important measure of how far companies can go to ensure they are receiving the highest price in an auction in the US. If counter-bidders are limited in their ability to reach out to potential allies in a bidding war, this could limit the number of takeover battles.Although litigation is common in the medical devices industry, the suit highlights the lingering rancour at J&J over the outcome of the bidding war for Guidant. Having agreed to buy Guidant in late 2004 for $25bn, J&J renegotiated the price of the acquisition late last year after a series of product recalls at the Indiana-based heart device maker. That gave Boston Scientific a window to enter the frame, ultimately placing a $27bn bid that was accepted by Guidant’s board. After losing Guidant, J&J returned to the pursuit of a large deal by winning the auction for Pfizer’s OTC drugs unit, which it agreed to buy for $16.6bn.A Boston Scientific spokesman said on Thursday:“We find it curious that J&J has chosen to sue eight monthsafter Boston Scientific entered into a definitive agreementwith Guidant and five months after the transaction closed. Throughout this process, we complied with all the terms ofthe J&J/Guidant merger agreement. We believe the suit ismeritless and we expect to demonstrate that in court.”Abbott described the lawsuit as“without merit”.
36;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-09-26T23:45:52Z;J&J/Boston Scientific;;Johnson & Johnson should probably thank Boston Scientific for snatching control of medical device-maker Guidant from under its nose earlier this year. After all, Boston’s share price has slumped 37 per cent since its bid was recommended. J&J also walked away with a tidy $705m break fee. Instead, J&J is suing its rival for $5.5bn.It is unclear how J&J gets to such a number and it seems extraordinary that the suit is being filed now, instead of when it might have affected the outcome of the bidding. But it does raise an interesting issue for future deals. J&J’s complaint hinges on interpretation of its merger agreement with Guidant. Basically, J&J is claiming Guidant had the right to share confidential information only with a rival, unsolicited bidder likely to submit a superior offer.However, it claims Boston came in as such a bidder and confidential information was then also shared with Abbott Laboratories. Boston went on to pre-sell an asset to Abbott. That both provided extra cash for its bid and neutralised the antitrust risk that would otherwise have reduced the appeal of Boston’s offer to Guidant. It effectively allowed Boston to beat J&J.With bidders regularly bringing third parties into battles – particularly private equity – the issue does matter. It is clearly in the interest of a seller that potential bidders have all the weapons possible to maximise the price they can pay. For the bidder with a merger agreement, however, it makes sense to limit a rival’s ability to share information more widely, and lure in allies.The case probably says most about the bad blood that remains between J&J and Boston. But, even if the lawsuit goes nowhere, it should focus lawyers and bankers on quite how important the wording of such clauses can prove in contested bid battles.

Yahoo slumped 13 per cent over the five days to $25.52, wiping out the previous eight weeks of gains. The company said third-quarter results would be at the bottom end of their previously forecast range due to slowing advertising revenue.Oracle provided a counterweight to Yahoo’s slump, climbing 7.4 per cent to $17.54. On Wednesday, the software maker reported a 29 per cent increase in first quarter profits, as its chief executive said the company was gaining market share from German rival SAP.Hewlett-Packard shed 3 per cent to $35.11 over the week as its controversial investigation into boardroom leaks to the media began to unnerve investors. News reports said that chief executive Mark Hurd may have had a greater role in the investigation than had previously been thought.Microsoft dipped 0.7 per cent to $26.66. However, the stock has now gained 25 per cent since the middle of June and is back in positive territory for the year.Media group Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times, surged 9.8 per cent to $33.99, its best week in more than two years, after it appointed a special committee to oversee a business review that might lead to a sale of some assets or a leveraged buyout of the group.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent for the week at 1,314.78, a loss on the day of 0.3 per cent, or 3.25 points. On Wednesday, the index briefly hit its highest level in more than five years. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower on the week, losing 0.8 per cent, or 18.82 points, on the day to 2,218.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week down 0.5 per cent, a loss of 0.2 per cent, or 25.13 points, on the day at 11,508.10.Stocks made a brief rally on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent. However, on Thursday the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index fell sharply, increasing investor unease that economic growth was slowing faster than had been thought.“The run-up to this point has been driven by an expectation that the Fed will stop raising rates and get the cooling in the economy they’re looking for,” said Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck.“The price you’re paying for that is uncertainty about how much softening there will be in the economy.

39;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-09-12T22:29:24Z;How the Bristol-Myers chief ran out of lives;;"Peter Dolan, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s chief executive, on Tuesday exhausted the last of his nine lives at the US drugmaker.His exit after another spate of trouble could finally turn the demoralised company into a takeover candidate.Mr Dolan, along with Richard Willard, general counsel, were forced out on Tuesday amid the fallout from controversial patent settlement negotiations over Plavix, its biggest drug.The failed settlement with Apotex, a Canadian generic drugmaker, damaged the company’s profits and reputation just as Bristol appeared to be reviving its image after previous legal problems in Mr Dolan’s tenure.Wall Street had become increasingly concerned over Mr Dolan’s management.However, investors also have high regard for Bristol’s profit growth prospects in the next four years due to big new drugs and a fairly strong pipeline.Those growth expectations have made it one of the few attractive takeover candidates among big pharmaceuticals companies, according to analysts and investment bankers.Added to the mix is the recent history of Mr Dolan’s interim replacement James Cornelius, a Bristol board member. Mr Cornelius this year oversaw the $27bn sale of Guidant, the US medical device maker where he was chairman and also interim chief executive, to Boston Scientific.Chris Schott, analyst at Bank of America, said: “We believe, given Mr Cornelius’s background, that the market will continue to raise the possibility of Bristol as a takeover candidate.”“European drugmakers” could be the most interested, or capable, buyers for Bristol, one investment banker said last month.Sanofi-Aventis, the French drugmaker and Bristol’s partner in Plavix, leads the list of those potential buyers.Other potential suitors include GlaxoSmithKline, the UK drugmaker, and Novartis, the Swiss drugmaker whose chief executive Daniel Vasella clashed with Mr Dolan a few years ago.Experts caution that Bristol would be expensive, with a market capitalisation of more than $48bn, and Plavix’s US patent remains uncertain until after next year’s trial.In addition, a trans-Atlantic deal could face the hurdle of share “flow back,” in which US shareholders balk at holding foreign shares and sell them after a deal.One of Bristol’s attractions is that it is poised for a significant turnround next year, after years of slumping sales and profits due to patent expiries on key drugs.Bristol has launched several promising products, including Orencia for rheumatoid arthritis; Sprycel, an oral cancer drug; Baraclude for hepatitis B; and new Aids drugs. It also has a promising new drug pipe-line including ixabepilone, another cancer drug.Tony Butler, analyst at Lehman Brothers, forecasts Bristol earnings growth at about 16 per cent to 2010, representing the “highest in the pharma group”. Whatever Bristol’s fate, Mr Dolan will not be around to see its turnround next year.He had faced down criticism ranging from overpaying for cancer drug Erbitux to high-profile drug failures to several legal actions at the company with fines reaching $893m.The Plavix deal was a tipping point, but Mr Dolan could never pull himself out of the shadow of an inventory and accounting scandal with a 2.5bn restatement of sales, and securities fraud allegations. The three-year criminal probe installed the federal monitor who ultimately sealed his fate."

45;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-06-26T22:01:34Z;J&J pays $16.6bn for Pfizer unit;;Johnson & Johnson has moved to become the world’s biggest consumer healthcare company after outbidding UK rivals GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser to buy Pfizer’s over-the-counter medicine unit for $16.6bn in cash.The deal concludes a five-month auction that yielded a substantially higher price than Pfizer was expecting from the sale. It will allow J&J to take control of brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Sudafed cough medicine and Neosporin antibiotic cream. The unit produced revenues of $3.9bn last year.Awash with cash, J&J has been pursuing a big acquisition for several years. In January, it was poised to buy Guidant, the maker of cardiac devices, for about $25bn, but was outbid by Boston Scientific.On Monday, J&J shares lost 1.8 per cent to $60.21 after investors digested the high price it took for the company to win the auction. Most analysts had predicted bids between $11bn and $14bn. Pfizer shares ended the day 1.6 per cent higher at $23.01.The outcome of the auction will vindicate Pfizer’s decision to put the consumer unit up for sale instead of spinning it off to shareholders or retaining it. It will use the proceeds of the sale for acquisitions and research. J&J is paying more than four times’ sales for the business, compared with about 3.5 times’ sales for Reckitt’s acquisition of Boots’ healthcare unit last year.J&J is likely to justify the high price with the savings it expects to produce. On a conference call on Monday, Robert Darretta, the chief financial officer, said annual cost savings would be as much as $600m and be fully in place by 2009.However, the deal would reduce J&J’s earnings by 12 cents a share next year and 3 cents a share in 2008, before boosting them in later years.Pfizer put its consumer healthcare unit up for sale in February and said it would also consider a spin-off if it could not attract high enough bids. As well as Glaxo and Reckitt, a number of big consumer products and drugs companies were involved in the auction. These included Colgate-Palmolive and Wyeth.The conclusion of the Pfizer auction came amid a period of intense merger and acquisition activity in North America.On Monday, Phelps Dodge agreed to buy Canadian mining companies Inco and Falconbridge in a deal worth more than $40bn.

49;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-06-06T19:46:58Z;New issues: Generali to raise €2.8bn;;In spite of mounting uncertainty about the outlook for US interest rates, a host of large new issues are hitting the markets on both sides of the Atlantic this week.In Europe, Generali, the Italian insurance group, on Tuesday indicated it was in the process of raising about €2.8bn via a three-tranche bond issue.The issue will be one of the largest seen in Europe in recent months. The final pricing and size of the tranches will not be finalised for another day but a perpetual euro-denominated tranche is expected to yield about 110 basis points over midswaps, and be callable over 10 years.A sterling tranche is likely to be callable in its tenth year and yield 145 basis points over the benchmark gilt, while a second sterling tranche will be callable in 20-25 years and yield about 20 basis points more than the first sterling tranche.The deal reflects a broader programme of balance sheet restructuring that Generali is undertaking as it seeks to buy back shares and buy out the minority stakes of its non-Italian subsidiaries. “This is a capital efficiency exercise,” said one banker close to the deal. The lead underwriters are JPMorgan, HSBC and Mediobanca.In the US markets Telefonica, the Spanish telecoms group, is planning to sell $4bn of bonds in a four-part issue to help refinance its £17.7 purchase of UK mobile operator O2. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Lehman Brothers are managing the sale.JPMorgan on Tuesday was closing a $1bn issue, bankers said, while Aetna is marketing a $2bn offering and Boston Scientific is seeking to place a $1.2bn deal.
50;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-05-28T20:11:03Z;Lex: Executive compensation;;"For executives, reaping the rewards of conquest has long been one of the joys of takeover battles. Acquisitions boost a company’s size, which in turn can be invoked to justify higher managerial compensation. Meanwhile, executives on the selling side see many of their options and stock grants vest automatically and are in a position to negotiate favourable side-deals for themselves.All this skews the incentives to pursue big deals, irrespective of whether they create value for shareholders. Add in unusually favourable financing conditions and it is no wonder that fee-hungry investment bankers see another record year in the offing.What is a little more surprising is the way in which some of the executives are able to cash in. Take Boston Scientific, which still has its work cut out in integrating rival medical device maker Guidant. The latest problems with some of Guidant’s defibrillators and signs of market share losses look manageable in themselves. But they also serve as a reminder of the many risks that could derail the deal’s flimsy financial logic – from safety concerns and intellectual property challenges to pricing pressures.For those Boston employees instrumental in closing the deal, however, the purchase is already paying off. That includes five of its top executives, who alone stand to pocket a deal-related bonus of almost $2m, plus additional options and deferred stock.Other buyers, such as Chevron, have also invoked successful acquisitions to justify bonuses. Overall, pay-awards directly linked to acquisitions still appear to be less frequent than in previous cycles. But they still send the wrong signal, especially when they benefit the management of the buyer. Granting rewards well before there is any evidence that a deal will actually work is questionable in principle.- Click here to add your comments

51;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-05-12T23:47:58Z;Boston Scientific executives win bonuses for deal;;"Five Boston Scientific executives have received special bonuses, some potentially worth more than last year’s salary, following the company’s $27bn acquisition of Guidant, the rival medical device manufacturer.Lawrence Best, chief financial officer; Jim Gilbert, a strategy co-ordinator; Paul Sandman, general counsel; Lucia Quinn, human resources chief; and Paul Donovan, a public relations executive, were awarded bonuses worth at least $1.98m in cash, plus options and deferred stock grants.The awards, following the completion of the deal in April, come at a time of renewed public scrutiny of corporate compensation.Compensation experts cautioned that rewarding executives for completing deals raises governance questions, and could be seen as premature given the often poor record of mergers in creating value for shareholders.The five executives were given two choices – one with a big cash component plus options, the other only options and deferred stock. The largest cash payment offered was to Mr Best, which at $625,000 is equal to his salary for last year.Boston’s board approved the awards on Monday but they were only revealed late on Friday in a US regulatory filing.Boston early this year swooped to outbid rival Johnson & Johnson’s agreed deal with Guidant, a maker of implantable devices, such as pacemakers.Paul Hodgson, a researcher at the Corporate Library, a corporate governance watchdog, said: “The psychology of the boards and compensation committees is they justify it to themselves completely as ‘we’ve done a fantastic job’. Instead of thinking to themselves: ‘This is when the real work starts.’”Charles Rudnick, a spokesman at Boston Scientific, said many people across a “broad cross-section” of the company received bonuses following the deal."
52;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-04-18T22:54:01Z;J&J slices deep into Boston’s stent share;;Boston Scientific’s US market share lead in drug-coated stents has nearly evaporated. Bitter rival Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday said growth in its Cypher stent had pushed its sales up 8 percentage points from the first quarter of last year to take 47 per cent of the US market.The two medical device makers are the main suppliers of the revolutionary drug-coated stent – a tiny wire-mesh tube that is inserted into closing arteries and emits a drug to keep the artery from scarring and closing again.They also recently fought to take over Guidant, a US maker of heart devices, including pacemakers. Boston bettered J&J’s bid for Guidant with a significantly higher offer worth about $27bn.Cypher’s growth was the one bright spot for J&J as first-quarter earnings, excluding items, rose 5 per cent to $3bn on only 1 per cent sales growth to $13bn. However, J&J said Cypher’s US sales hit $366m. Its worldwide market share was 51 per cent because of strong sales in Japan.Boston’s first quarter sales were flat at $1.62bn and earnings fell 7 per cent to $332m. Its performance was hurt by its drug-coated stent Taxus, particularly in the US, where sales fell 15 per cent to $419m. Worldwide sales of Taxus fell 8 per cent to $633m.The increasingly competitive battle over stents underlines a prime motive for both companies’ interest in Guidant. Most of Guidant’s business comes from implantable defibrillators, heart devices that maintain proper rhythm for the heart.The US market for drug-coated stents has already matured. The success of the products means that fewer patients have to go back for repeat procedures, as was common when uncoated stents could become blocked.Robert Darretta, J&J’s chief financial officer, said that worldwide market growth was settling to a percentage in “mid-single digits”. US market penetration “was probably close to its peak”, he said.J&J was “being very aggressive at looking at good business-building acquisitions” of various sizes after pulling out of the Guidant battle. The company is seeking acquisitions to help boost growth, which has moderated.Its pharmaceuticals business is struggling to fight off generic competitors and brisk competition with other branded drugmakers, such as Amgen, the US biotechnology drugmaker.Amgen on Tuesday said first quarter profits, excluding stock options, increased 19 per cent to $1.1bn, while revenue rose 14 per cent to $3.2bn. Sales of Aranesp, an anaemia treatment competing with J&J’s Procrit/Eprex, led the way, rising 24 per cent.
53;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-04-18T14:29:33Z;Wall Street rallies on Fed minutes;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Tuesday as solid company earnings and a clear indication from the Federal Reserve that its rate-raising cycle might be near its end helped overcome worries over rising oil prices.The market jumped after the FOMC issued minutes of its latest meeting in which it said the end to rate rises was “likely to be near”.“The market was caught off guard by the dovish statement,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach. “However, if energy prices continue to go up, the Fed will probably continue with its cycle of monetary tightening.”Scott Wren, senior equity strategist, AG Edwards and Sons, was less concerned about spiralling crude prices.Although oil futures settled at a record high of $71.35, Mr Wren said the fact that the core producer price index only increased by 0.1 per cent in March was evidence that higher energy prices had not led to a more generalised inflation.“It’s wage-pushed inflation the Feds will be looking at,” he said. “Three-dollar gas might slow down consumer spending but that’s going be offset by strong economic growth.”The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 1.8 per cent, or 194.99 points, at 11,268.77, its biggest point gain in more than two years.The broader S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent to 1,307.65, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 2 per cent to 2,356.14.The Amex oil index gained 1.9 per cent, with bellwether ExxonMobil up 2.3 per cent at $63.49 and oil service provider Schlumberger up 2.9 per cent at $64.41.Rate-sensitive stocks such as financials and homebuilders advanced, while Texas Instruments led chipmakers higher with its 3.8 per cent advance to $33.93.The Philadelphia semiconductor index jumped 3.1 per cent after shedding 1.5 per cent in the previous session.Financials were boosted by Merrill Lynch, which rose 1.2 per cent to $79.38 after the group delivered a record $8bn in quarterly revenue.Wells Fargo also saw first quarter profits rise steeply. The stock gained 0.9 per cent to $65.06.IntercontinentalExchange surged 14.3 per cent to $66.16 after analysts at Bear Stearns initiated coverage on the stock with a favorable rating, citing potential for growth and the exchange’s appeal as a takeover target.Other movers included the internet travel services company Travelzoo. Its first-quarter profits topped analysts’ estimates. The shares soared 43 per cent to $28.59.Yahoo and IBM rose ahead of its first quarter earnings. Yahoo rose 1.1 per cent to $31.30 while IBM gained 2.1 per cent to $83.31.Johnson & Johnson, which topped analysts’ estimates with its first-quarter results, rose 0.8 per cent to $58.13 while Boston Scientific, which reported a small decline in first-quarter profit, rose 1.2 per cent to $21.74.
54;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-04-18T14:15:52Z;Boston Scientific first-quarter profit falls 12%;;Boston Scientific, the heart-stent maker, on Tuesday reported a 11.6 per cent decline in first-quarter underlying profits on flat revenues while sales of its core product fell 7.7 per cent.The company, which is due to complete the $27bn acquisition of Guidant later this month, said first-quarter profits were $381m, or 46 cents per share, compared with $431m, or 51 cents per share in the previous year and ahead of average analyst estimates.These figures exclude total charges of $49m, or 6 cents per share, due to stock-options accounting changes and investment writedowns this year, as well as a $73m, or 9 cents per share, acquisition-related charge last year.Including these charges, Boston’s net profit was $332m, or 40 cents per share, down 7.3 per cent from last year’s $358m, or 42 cents per share.Revenues inched up 0.3 per cent to $1.62bn, the highest in Boston’s history.Sales of the Taxus drug-coated stent used to prop open clogged arteries, Boston’s main product, fell 7.7 per cent to $633m compared to $686m in the comparable quarter a year ago, but rose 4.5 per cent from the $606m achieved in the fourth quarter of last year.Boston has suffered a decline in its US market share for drug-coated heart stents, from 57 per cent last year to 51 per cent this year. US sales of Taxus fell 15.2 per cent to $419m.Boston earlier this year outbid its much larger rival Johnson & Johnson in the race to take over Guidant, a maker of cardiac devices. Following shareholder approval of the deal, Boston expects to complete it later this month.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
56;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-03-29T15:03:31Z;Guidant announces heart-stent quality problems;;Guidant, the medical-device maker that agreed to be taken over by Boston Scientific, on Wednesday announced it would suspend delivery of its Xience V heart stent and delay its release to European markets.The setback comes after a series of product recalls last summer led Johnson & Johnson, which had agreed to buy the company, to renegotiate the deal only to lose the battle over Guidant earlier this year to Boston.Guidant said that quality assurance concerns in about 1 per cent of its Xience V inventory led to the decision and also announced that it would stop enrolling patients in clinical trials for the device, which props open blood vessels.The move would result in a $15m charge on its first-quarter earnings, Guidant said. Release to European markets will be delayed until the third quarter.Boston Scientific’s $27bn takeover of Guidant is expected to close by April 18th after an occasionally graught battle between Boston and its much larger rival J&J in order to secure a leading position in the cardiac device market, which is seen as very lucrative by industry watchers.Medtronic, another medical-device maker, on Tuesday filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Guidant, alleging that its older Vision stent violates patents licensed by Medtronic.Guidant shares were fractionally lower at $78.35 in pre-market trading.
57;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-02-17T22:03:52Z;Rising crude puts lid on Wall St gains;;"Wall Street retreated on Friday as rising crude prices and disappointing guidance from technology bellwether Dell put a lid on the market’s recent upward momentum.Sentiment took a knock in morning trading after crude prices jumped more than $1. Weak crude prices had helped pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a fresh four-and-a-half year high earlier this week. But oil rallied yesterday after concerns over supply disruptions were rekindled by new turmoil in Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer.Along with energy prices, Dell’s fourth-quarter results also weighed on the market. Although quarterly revenue and net income both saw double-digit growth, shares in the computer maker fell after it said current-quarter growth would be lower than market estimates.Banc of America Securities cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, saying continued pressure on operating profit margins would keep the stock rangebound. Dell shares dropped 4.9 per cent to $30.38 yesterday, although for the week, the stock was only down 4.4 per cent.Dell’s weakness pulled the Nasdaq Composite down 0.5 per cent to 2,282.36, while the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,287.24 and the Dow dipped 0.1 per cent to 11,115.32.Nonetheless, Wall Street ended the week with solid gains, with the Dow up
1.8 per cent, the S&P 1.6 per cent higher and the Nasdaq up 0.9 per cent.Stocks have steadily advanced this week on hopes that the strength seen in the US economy would outlast the Federal Reserve’s interest rate tightening cycle.“The data that came in this week were strong but not completely FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] unfriendly,” said Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research.“They showed that the economy would continue growing after the Fed stops its interest rate hikes but they were not so strong that the Fed would feel the need to continue intervening.”Technology stocks were a key focus this week, with Hewlett-Packard’s strong performance providing a sharp contrast to Dell’s worsening fortunes.HP shares surged 8.1 per cent over the five sessions to $34.07 after it delivered a stronger-than-expected set of quarterly results. The computer maker beat both revenue and earnings forecasts, suggesting that its huge and controversial merger with rival Compaq was paying off.The week also saw a number of large deals taking place, including Merrill Lynch’s $9.5bn deal with fund manager BlackRock.Merrill Lynch shares rose 3.8 per cent on the week to $75.56 after announcing the deal to acquire a 49.8 per cent stake in BlackRock to combine their investment management units. The combined unit would continue to trade under the BlackRock name and have around $1,000bn in assets under management.BlackRock, meanwhile, soared 11.5 per cent to end the week at $146.58 in spite of being downgraded by Morgan Stanley.Meanwhile, reports that corporate raider Carl Icahn had given up on plans to take control of Time Warner drove shares in the media conglomerate down 2.9 per cent to $17.78.Still on the deals front, Keyspan jumped 12.3 per cent to $40.41 to become the top gainer on the S&P following rumours that the biggest natural gas seller in the US northeast could be put up for sale at a price of $6.5bn.Boston Scientific was the second-best performer on the S&P. It shares gained 11.8 per cent to $24.45 on news that finance chief Lawrence Best had bought up 200,000 shares of the company for $4.5m.UBS analyst Kenneth Weakley, in a research note, said the purchase was “a positive sign on the value of the stock”.Best’s purchase followed a sharp fall in Boston’s share price in recent weeks as investors expressed reservations over the group’s pending $27bn acquisition of rival medical device maker Guidant.Other strong performers included Eastman Kodak, which ended the week
6.9 per cent higher at $26.27 after Legg Mason Capital Management revealed that it had built up a 25 per cent stake.Chipmaker Nvidia was another stand out, climbing 8.1 per cent to $47.47 after it beat market forecasts with its fourth-quarter profit.Consumer electronics retailer Radioshack was less fortunate, slumping 11.8 per cent to $19.08 as its earnings disappoint."
58;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-02-16T21:34:26Z;Hewlett-Packard powers Wall Street gains;;Wall Street powered ahead for a third consecutive day on Thursday, with technology stocks leading the way after sector bellwether Hewlett-Packard delivered a stronger-than-expected set of quarterly earnings.HP shares jumped 7.4 per cent to $34.02 after the technology conglomerate beat both revenue and earnings forecasts. Net income rose 30 per cent to $1.227bn, helped by its restructuring efforts and higher personal computer sales.Deutsche Bank, Banc of America Securities and Bear Stearns all raised their price targets for the stock while Credit Suisse upgraded its recommendation on the shares from “neutral” to “outperform”.“We still like the HP story and think the stock has room for additional upside potential,” said Keith Bachman, a BofA analyst, in a research note.The broader technology sector appeared to benefit from HP’s strong performance. The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent higher at 2,294.63 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 11,120.68 - its highest level since May 2001. The S&P 500, buoyed by gains in the energy sector, advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,289.63.The gains came despite a rebound in crude prices and renewed worries that the current strength seen in the US economy would prompt the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates.“We need good numbers but not too strong numbers,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist, AG Edwards & Sons. “But this week we have seen some pretty strong number in capacity utilisation, retail sales and housing starts.”Internet stocks were heavily traded, with Google and Ebay moving to the upside while Amazon and Expedia traded in the red.News that the number of sponsored link advertising impressions on Google grew 16 percent helped lift shares in the internet search engine out of its recent slump. After skidding almost 26 per cent in the last four weeks, Google bounced back 7 per cent to $366.46.By contrast, shares in Expedia plunged 18.3 per cent to $19.82 after the online travel company said quarterly profit fell 43 per cent.Boston Scientific, which is working to close a $27bn acquisition of rival medical device maker Guidant, moved up 8.7 per cent after its finance chief bought up 200,000 shares of the company for $4.5m. UBS analyst Kenneth Weakley, in a research note, said the purchase was “a positive sign on the value of the stock.”On other earnings news, Applied Materials, which makes equipment used to make computer chips, fell despite topping analyst forecasts with its fourth-quarter earnings.Although Citigroup and UBS both lifted their price estimates on the stock to $25, its shares fell 2.4 per cent to $19.96 on profit-taking after Goldman Sachs advised clients to sell the stock, citing valuation concerns.Network Appliance, the computer data storage company, jumped 7.8 per cent to $33.58 on the back of higher quarterly earnings.Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell more than 6 per cent to $14.51 after it reported a loss of $51m.Despite a weak start to last year’s holiday shopping season Target and JC Penney both delivered strong fourth-quarter earnings. However, while shares in JC Penney climbed 2.2 per cent to $57.85, Target slipped 2.2 per cent to $54.59.
59;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-02-07T14:05:19Z;Boston reports rise in profit despite lower sales;;Boston Scientific, the US medical device maker, on Tuesday reported a 12 per cent rise in net income in 2005 in spite of lower sales of a key heart device during the fourth quarter.The company last month beat Johnson & Johnson in a bidding battle for heart device maker Guidant, for which it paid $26bn, or $80 per share.Net sales for 2005 were $6.28bn compared with $5.6bn the previous year. Net income was $1.52bn, up 12 per cent from that reported in 2004.Sales of the Taxus, a drug-coated stent that is used to keep blood vessels open, rose to $2.56bn, up from $2.14bn in 2004. However, they fell 12 per cent during the fourth quarter, as competition in the market intensified. The Taxus is Boston’s best-selling product.“We are very pleased that the company experienced double-digit growth on a global basis during 2005,” said Jim Tobin, Boston’s chief executive. “In our first full year of Taxus sales, we continued to be the worldwide leader in drug-eluting stents in the markets we serve.“During the second half of the year we launched our next-generation paclitaxel-eluting stent system, Taxus Liberté, and saw our drug-eluting stent market share settle into a sustainable leadership position.”Net income in the fourth quarter was $334m, or 40 cents a share, up 12 per cent compared with a year earlier. Sales were $1.54bn during the period, compared with $1.6bn a year earlier.Boston said it would announce financial guidance for 2006 after the completion of its merger with Guidant.
60;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-28T00:33:02Z;Boston shares hit by FDA warning;;Boston Scientific’s shares fell 7 per cent on Friday after a stern regulatory warning that could affect product approvals quickly soured the US heart devicemaker’s victory in its bidding battle for Guidant.The mood shifted dramatically from the euphoria on Wednesday when Boston clinched an agreement to acquire Guidant for $27bn, or $80 per share.A hard-fought contest for Guidant, a maker of implantable heart devices, came to an end when a deadline elapsed for rival bidder Johnson & Johnson to improve on its previously agreed deal worth $24.2bn, or $71 per share.The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday sent a warning letter to Boston, citing “serious violations” of processes to report product problems and manufacturing quality.The FDA said the deficiencies required changes on a “corporate-wide basis”, and it could withhold new product approvals until it was satisfied with the changes.Meanwhile, Guidant on Friday reported a sharp fall in sales and profits in the fourth quarter, because of a product recall. The recall ended up scuttling its deal originally struck in December 2004 with J&J, which negotiated a lower price, allowing Boston to counterbid.On Friday, Boston’s shares fell $1.52 to $21.63, below the collar threshold in the deal of $22.62, implying a significantly lower price for Guidant of about $78.32 per share.However, the final price will be determined by a 20-day average of Boston’s share price before closing the deal. The falling deal price potentially raises questions about whether J&J could return to the fray.Bob Hopkins, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said in a research note: “If the deal value were to drop below $75, J&J might start to look like a better deal, although J&J’s $71 bid no longer necessarily exists.”People close to the situation said J&J had lost any advantage and would likely have to come back with a stronger offer than its final $71 per share.J&J’s lower offer was seen as comparable to the higher Boston price because it had already received regulatory approval.Boston and Guidant agreed to an $800m break-up fee, but that would be easily surmountable for J&J.Guidant’s share price yesterday remained comparatively weak compared with the agreed $80 takeover figure, trading 2 per cent lower at $73.72 in New York.Typically, wide spreads between the deal price and a target’s share price can signal investors’ fears that a deal will require changes.Guidant’s outlook remained uncertain due to the recalls. Its fourth-quarter sales fell 14 per cent to $828m, and earnings fell 31 per cent to $85m.
61;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-27T21:58:09Z;Corporate earnings flow helps Wall Street higher;;"Wall Street shrugged off concerns about the pace of economic growth on Friday as the improved flow of corporate earnings drove US equity markets sharply higher.The week had produced robust quarterly figures from Caterpillar, the heavy machinery group, United Technologies, the aerospace and industrial concern, and jet maker Lockheed Martin, which helped ease concerns about profit growth at US companies. Shares in Caterpillar rose nearly 12 per cent over the five days.This was followed by strong earnings on Friday from Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods group that last year bought Gillette, and computer software group Microsoftthe previous evening.The combination helped the markets shrug off news that the US economy grew much less than expected in the fourth quarter.In fact, indications that economic expansion may have started to flag raised hopes that Alan Greenspan, outgoing Federal Reserve chairman, would use the Fed’s next meeting on Tuesday to signal an end to the prolonged period of interest rate tightening.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.9 per cent higher at 10,907.21, the fourth day out of five that blue-chip stocks had gained. The positive run helped erase the memory of a sharp sell-off in equities the previous Friday.The broader S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 1,283.72 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,304.23.This took the weekly gain in the Dow to 2.3 per cent; in the S&P to 1.8 per cent; and in Nasdaq to 2.5 per cent.Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co, said the week had seen a change in sentiment.“Last week there were lots of negatives with earnings guidance. But right now there is more good news than bad news out there.“European and Asian markets are strong and with these numbers from Microsoft and Procter & Gamble we have the foundations for a good market.”However, wider concerns were never far from the surface, as the week gave more evidence of a slowdown in the US housing market. The market also remained wary of fluctuations in the oil price, ahead of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna, which begins on Tuesday.The week brought an upswing in merger and acquisition activity and an end to the two-month battle for Guidant, the heart devices maker.It opted for a $27bn deal with Boston Scientific, which meant defeat for rival healthcare group Johnson & Johnson. However, news of weak quarterly earnings from Guidant on Friday weighed on the deal, and Boston shares ended the week down 9 per cent.Walt Disney, the entertainment house, also sealed the $7bn acquisition of Pixar, the animation house that made the Toy Story cartoons, a deal that was well received.“We view the Disney-Pixar combination as a near-perfect strategic fit,” said Jessica Reif Cohen, at Morgan Stanley. Disney shares ended the week down 2.6 per cent.Steel consolidation was also on the agenda, particularly after news that Mittal Steel had made a $22.8bn approach for European rival Arcelor. Shares in US Steel were up more than 17 per cent on the week on hope it too could receive a takeover.The auto industry continued to make the wrong sort of headlines, as General Motors unveiled its biggest loss since 1992, hurt by a $4.8bn fourth-quarter deficit, and Ford Motor announced plans to axe 25,000 jobs and close seven plants in an effort to scale back capacity. That said, General Motors remained the best performing Dow stock last week, up more than 17 per cent.Om Friday, tech stocks came to the fore after Microsoft, up 4.9 per cent to $27.79, reported solid quarterly figures.Chipmaker Broadcom surged 19 per cent to $69.87 as its profits tripled and came in well ahead of Wall Street expectations.Procter & Gamble gained 1.6 per cent to $59.74 on higher-than-expected earnings.Oil giant Chevron rose 0.3 per cent to $60.38 as the continued high oil price pushed its earnings well ahead of the year before.However, a downgrade from “overweight” to “neutral” from JPMorgan pulled Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer, down 1 per cent to $45.84."
62;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-26T00:24:56Z;Boston wins $27bn battle for Guidant;;Boston Scientific on Wednesday emerged against the odds as the winner in the battle for Guidant, the US heart device maker.Boston clinched Guidant for $27bn after Johnson & Johnson, its larger rival, decided to walk away from the bidding rather than increase its final $24.2bn bid.The outcome of the takeover battle - one of the biggest in the US since the dotcom boom - will secure Boston?s future as an independent and powerful player in its sector, but could raise worries that it overpaid.J&J, on the other side, was outmanoeuvred by a rival with limited resources. It might be exposed to critics pointing to flawed negotiating tactics and a lack of determination in pursuing what had been billed as an important acquisition.Guidant?s fate had been in the balance until Tuesday night, when a deadline for J&J to counter Boston?s higher bid expired. After William Weldon, J&J?s chief executive, informed James Cornelius, his counterpart at Guidant, that he would take no action, Guidant was free to break its deal with J&J and sign a new one with Boston.J&J, which will now receive a $705m break-up fee, said raising its bid ?would not have been in the best interest of its shareholders?.Boston and J&J have been fighting over Guidant?s business in the $10bn per year market in implantable cardiac defibrillators and pacemakers. The bid battle has also shaken up the $5bn per year market for drug-coated coronary stents.Medtronic, Abbott Laboratories, St Jude Medical and J&J will be operating in an altered landscape.To secure Guidant?s approval, Boston entered a bid with a higher cash component and expanded protection for Guidant shareholders against a drop in its own share price. In addition, Guidant recruited Abbott to finance part of its offer with a loan and an agreement for Abbott to buy a stake in the combined company alongside some parts of Guidant to ease antitrust concerns.Defeat at the hands of Boston puts the spotlight on J&J?s next moves. J&J recently asked Citigroup to help it examine whether to make a formal bid for Serono, Europe?s largest biotechnology company, according to people familiar with the matter. However, there was no guarantee a bid would materialise, they cautioned.After pulling off one of the most significant opportunistic takeovers in recent history, Boston on Wednesday set out to close the deal as early as possible. Boston is hoping for regulators to sign off on the transaction before the end of March.Boston shares fell 1.9 per cent to $23.54 on Wednesday. Guidant shares, meanwhile, dropped 2 per cent to $75.19 and J&J?s fell 1.5 per cent to $58.50.
63;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-25T23:40:25Z;Strong results boost Abbott Laboratories;;Abbott Laboratories’ shares rose on Wednesday as the US medical products group, a winner in the bid battle over Guidant, reported strong fourth-quarter profits.Abbott is poised to become a strong competitor in the $5bn market for drug-coated coronary stents that help keep open closing arteries, after helping Boston Scientific in its bid for Guidant.Boston raised its price for Guidant to $27bn with the help of nearly $6bn in commitments from Abbott in exchange for rights and divestitures that will speed Abbott’s entry into the stent business. On Wednesday, Abbott reported a 13 per cent rise in quarterly profits excluding one-time items to $1.18bn, or 76 cents per share.Sales in the quarter rose 7 per cent to $6bn. But cost-cutting and strong sales of Humira, Abbott’s blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, helped boost profits.Humira’s sales rose 62 per cent in the fourth quarter to $441m, and 64 per cent last year to $1.4bn.Abbott also saw strong growth in Mobic, a painkiller more widely used after pain drugs cox-2 inhibitors came under scrutiny following Merck’s withdrawal of Vioxx.For the year Abbott earnings rose 10 per cent to $3.9bn, or $2.50 per share, excluding items.Sales increased 13.5 per cent to $22.3bn.Abbott is a diversified group with products ranging from pharmaceuticals, to diabetes monitoring kits, nutritional supplements, and cardiac and spinal devices.The group has been looking for acquisitions to bolster its medical device business – a fast-growing and lucrative market.Without its alliance in the Guidant deal, Abbott was set to be the fourth entrant into the drug-coated stent market trailing Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic.Abbott’s shares ended the session 5.3 per cent higher at $42.17 in New York.
64;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-25T22:12:03Z;Wall Street worried by housing weakness;;Concerns over the health of the US housing market weighed on Wall Street on Wednesday, offsetting modest early gains.News of a third consecutive month of falling sales of existing homes underlined concerns that the housing market has slowed, which could undermine consumer confidence and hurt the US economy.Those fears wiped an early gain of 50 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended off a fraction at 10,709.74.“The rally was derailed by poor housing data. It was much weaker than expected,” said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach.The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent to 1,264.68 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2 per cent to 2,260.65. The falls ended two days of modest gains.Energy stocks also fell sharply as the oil price weakened. ConocoPhillips lost 1.5 per cent to $63.54 in spite of surging fourth-quarter profits.All this took attention away from a couple of juicy takeovers.The battle for medical devices maker Guidant would appear to have been won by Boston Scientific as the pair agreed a deal worth $27bn. This meant defeat for Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group that was also in the running.Shares in Guidant and Boston fell 2.1 per cent to $75.19 and 1.9 per cent to $23.54 respectively as the two-month battle ended. J&J slipped 1.4 per cent to $58.50 even though its loss was sweetened by the prospect of $705m from Guidant for breaking an earlier deal.Talk turned to whether J&J would pursue alternative targets, with St Jude Medical and ImClone the names in the frame.St Jude, which reported disappointing sales figures, fell 6.1 per cent to $50.03 and ImClone lost 2.5 per cent to $34.49.Investors also got a first chance to react to Tuesday’s late news that Walt Disney is to pay $7.4bn for Pixar, the studio behind the Toy Story films.Merrill Lynch was among those to welcome the deal. Analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said: “We view the Disney-Pixar combination as a near perfect strategic fit. Pixar’s family-oriented content meshes well with Disney’s brand.” Pixar rose 0.8 per cent to $58.02 and Disney fell 2.1 per cent to $25.44.Pharmaceutical group Bristol Myers Squibb rose 3 per cent to $21.97 in spite of news that its 2006 result would likely to be lower than expected. The company is fighting off generic treats to Pravachol, its cholesterol drug.McDonalds fell 1.9 per cent at $35.16 as shareholder activist Bill Ackman dropped his campaign for restructuring at the fast food group, a day after it reported a jump in earnings.CBRL Group, another restaurant operator, surged 22.1 per cent to $43.36 on news of a review that it is hoped will boost shareholder value.
65;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-25T21:34:13Z;Questions on failed bid that go to heart of the matter;;Johnson & Johnson was putting a brave face on defeat on Wednesday, after its 14-month attempt to take over Guidant was wrecked by a counterbid from Boston Scientific.J&J had “determined not to increase its last offer for Guidant, because to do so would not have been in the best interest of its shareholders”, the company said.Missing from the statement, however, was any explanation of J&J’s tactics over the past few months, which could represent one of the clearest series of miscalculations in the recent history of US mergers and acquisitions.In the coming weeks, critics of J&J’s handling of the Guidant bid are likely to ask whether the company’s tough negotiating stance throughout the bid battle backfired, and why J&J was outmanoeuvred by Boston, a much smaller rival.Unless J&J returns to pursuing Guidant, the company will also face questions about how it hopes to achieve improvements in its sales and revenue growth, which have recently showed signs of deterioration.For years, Wall Street and medical industry analysts had considered J&J-Guidant to be a dream match.Along with adding important technology in stents, J&J coveted Guidant’s fast-growing implantable defibrillators – devices that maintain, and shock, a heart into its proper rhythm. Cardiac rhythm devices are the one significant medical device area in which J&J does not participate.In November, the combination appeared to be a foregone conclusion: Guidant was set to be sold to J&J for $25.4bn, or $76 per share, after US regulators gave their green light to the deal.But J&J hesitated. Over the summer, Guidant had experienced a series of product recalls, which damaged the company and presented J&J with a reason to seek a lower price. Known for its tough negotiating style, J&J did just that.In mid-November, J&J and Guidant struck a new deal worth $21.5bn, or a much lower $63 per share. At the time, the move appeared to be brilliant.But the thinking on Wall Street is that J&J dangerously overplayed its hand, providing a crucial window for Boston to pounce.“J&J opened Pandora’s box and essentially put Guidant in play,” says Frank Aquila at Sullivan & Cromwell, a New York law firm. This situation offers a lesson: if you want to revise a deal on the ground of damaged goods, you have to be prepared to walk away.”One Guidant shareholder who often invests in takeover targets adds: “They overnegotiated. They were too smart for their own good.”He points out that prior to the revised bid, J&J was already aware of Boston’s interest but might not have taken it seriously. Then in early December, Boston entered the fray with a conditional offer worth $25bn, or $72 per share. At that point, J&J could have sought immediately to close the deal by launching a tender offer, but instead decided to wait for Boston to come up with a firm bid, says one New York-based healthcare banker not involved in the Guidant battle.Over the past three weeks, J&J and Boston have been trading blows, with each side raising its offer twice before J&J folded on Wednesday. There too, J&J was caught off guard. Last week, after offering $71 per share, or $24.2bn, J&J was expecting a response worth about $76 per share from Boston.When Boston bid $80 per share, or $27bn, J&J was left dumbfounded, unable to respond before Guidant’s board backed the higher offer.Ultimately, the decision not to match Boston might be viewed as prudent. “The fact that Boston Scientific won the battle doesn’t necessarily mean J&J was outfoxed. It only means that they didn’t want to go higher,” says Gregg Berman of Fulbright & Jaworksi.But the manner in which J&J lost the battle could be damaging both for the company and its advisers at Goldman Sachs. Goldman was the top investment bank for work on mergers last year but had already ended up on the wrong side of a recent bid battle when it advised CNOOC on its ill-fated bid for Unocal.In fact, as the history books recount the Guidant battle, they will hope to retrace the extent to which J&J took – or refused to take – Goldman’s advice.For now, investors are likely to focus on J&J’s next move. In medical devices, it could pursue St Jude. In pharmaceuticals, it is considering a purchase of Serono.“It seems to us that there is an urgent need for the company to fill the void with biotech and medical device companies,” says Jan Wald of AG Edwards.
66;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-25T21:27:14Z;Lex: Abbott/Guidant;;None of the contestants emerges with much credit from the battle for Guidant. The exception, it would seem, is Abbott Laboratories. Wednesday’s rise of over 5 per cent in its share price contrasts nicely with the weakness of its rivals’. That had little to do with its unexceptional performance in the fourth quarter. Rather, hopes rest on its agreement to buy large chunks of Guidant’s activities from Boston Scientific.Assuming both deals secure regulatory approval, Abbott will indeed have a better story to tell than either Johnson & Johnson or Boston. The best that can be said about Boston’s expensive victory is that the alternative looked almost as bad and that the new group’s heavy debt load will prevent similar shenanigans for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, J&J has wasted over a year in its urgent search for growth by being too aggressive with Guidant.But what exactly is it about medical devices that sends the hearts of investors and executives racing? The deal with Boston/Guidant will jump start Abbott’s coronary stent activities more swiftly than the licensing agreement it had negotiated with J&J. That will reduce its dependence on pharmaceuticals. The trouble is that it will also create a powerful competitor, increasing price pressure across the segment. And if Guidant’s experience is any guide, concerns about safety and intellectual property may be at least as relevant for devices as they are for drugs. Abbott sensibly took advantage of the Guidant bid battle but it has already been amply rewarded by investors.
67;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-25T01:09:35Z;J&J reveals its Guidant motive;;The rationale behind Johnson & Johnson’s planned takeover of Guidant was spelt out on Tuesday when the drug company announced a deteriorating outlook for sales and revenue growth this year.Guidant, which makes implantable heart devices, is at the centre of a bid battle between J&J and Boston Scientific. The outcome was in the balance on Tuesday as a deadline approached for J&J to announce whether it would raise its offer of $24.2bn, or $71 a share, to compete with Boston’s $27bn, or $80-a-share offer. Having initially agreed terms with J&J, Guidant’s board now deems Boston’s offer “superior” to J&J’s.J&J’s top executives were meeting with investors and analysts at a restaurant in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday night. Guidant’s directors left waiting to hear their decision.Complaining of political, regulatory and competitive challenges at its core pharmaceutical unit, where weakening sales and profits have hit hardest, J&J said earnings growth this year could be as low as 8 per cent, down from 13 per cent last year.The same trends continue to be a concern for future growth, where less than 10 per cent annual earnings growth would be seen as failure in terms of the company’s yardsticks.J&J covets Guidant’s implantable defibrillators, pacemakers and stents to boost its growing medical-device business and to add to its diversification beyond its drugs business.Reporting fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, J&J said it expected positive trends in its existing medical device business and its consumer business to boost sales and profits this year.It forecast earnings to increase about 8-10 per cent this year to about $3.78-$3.85 a share. The company estimated sales would rise some 6-8 per cent to at least $53.5bn this year.William Weldon, chairman and chief executive, and other executives declined to comment on the Guidant negotiations.Last year J&J’s earnings, excluding one-time items, increased 13 per cent to $10.5bn, or $3.50 a share, helped by a favourable tax rate.
68;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-24T19:34:24Z;Lex: Johnson & Johnson;;Some men only start to appreciate their mistress when they see someone else taking her to the altar. That probably comes close to what Johnson & Johnson feels. On the face of it, its fourth-quarter results offer a powerful reminder of why it entered its dangerous liaison with Guidant. While J&J once again reported solid earnings in the fourth quarter, the 1.1 per cent decline in sales will only reinforce doubts about its stand-alone growth prospects. Even stripping out negative currency effects, the underlying increase of 0.7 per cent is a far cry from what it will need to deliver in the medium term.The good news is that it would take a few more disappointments to prevent a fairly swift recovery. Its prescription drugs have already taken quite a battering where J&J faces generic competition. Its pipeline looks fairly solid. More legal challenges or safety concerns for some of its other products can hardly be ruled out, but the same is true for much of the pharmaceutics and medical devices sectors. Unlike many, J&J can at least point to a very well diversified earnings base and quite a cash hoard.J&J could clearly afford to snatch Guidant from Boston Scientific, its rival suitor. Doing so, however, remains as unwise as ever. While a swift recovery of Guidant would enhance its growth potential, that can hardly be taken for granted yet. In any case, any further bid would risk eroding its new-found credibility as a comparatively disciplined acquirer. Its bullying of Guidant’s board might make the management of other potential targets pause. But at least it sent a strong signal to J&J’s shareholders that their cash would not be wasted. Overpaying now would only deprive J&J of that one potential benefit it might still salvage from the whole sorry saga.
69;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-23T18:55:56Z;Guidant recalls pacemakers as J&J deadline looms;;Guidant warned on Monday that 54,000 older pacemakers beyond its damaging recalls last year were at risk of malfunctioning, adding more intrigue to the takeover battle for the US heart device maker.Guidant made the warning as a deadline approached for suitor Johnson & Johnson to make another move in the competition with Boston Scientific. The US health products conglomerate has until on Tuesday to react to Boston’s higher offer of $27bn, worth $80 per share, offer for Guidant.Guidant’s board last week decided that Boston’s offer was superior to its agreement to be sold to J&J for $24.2bn, or $71 per share. J&J has five business days to respond before Guidant could seek an agreed deal with Boston.Options for J&J, which reports full-year earnings on Tuesday, range from increasing its bid again for Guidant to walking away from the fight.It was a large recall of implantable heart devices last year that eventually triggered the ferocious acquisition battle for Guidant.Guidant recalled about 100,000 products last summer including implantable defibrillators, which can shock a heart back into proper rhythm, and pacemakers. The incident damaged its sales and profits, and hurt its reputation in the fiercely competitive and fast-growing market for cardiac rhythm management devices worth about $9bn in sales a year.Guidant was also trying at the same time to close its acquisition by J&J for $25.4bn, or $76 per share, signed in December 2004. But the recalls opened the door for J&J to attempt to negotiate a lower price for Guidant, which has about $4bn in annual sales. In November, J&J forced Guidant to take a lower price of $21.5bn, or $63 per share.However, J&J’s tough negotiations and the delays they caused gave Boston an opportunity to enter the fray. One month later, Boston offered $25bn, or $72 per share, for Guidant, igniting a bidding war.Guidant said on Monday that it had found 54,000 pacemakers made between October 1998 and December 2000 that could have potentially faulty seals on the complex devices that could put patients at a slight risk. It said the faulty seals were “mistakenly mixed” with a larger group of good parts. It had notified regulators, who could consider the action a recall.Shares of J&J and Boston were mostly unchanged at $60.84 and $23.57 respectively in New York lunchtime trading, while Guidant’s were slightly higher at $76.20.
70;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-18T01:08:30Z;Boston in new $27bn bid for Guidant;;Boston Scientific struck a potentially decisive blow in the takeover battle for Guidant on Tuesday, after the board of the US heart devices maker switched its support away from Johnson & Johnson and embraced its new, unexpectedly high bid.The decision by Guidant?s directors capped the latest day of drama in the bidding war, which has been raging for the past 10 days and could determine the future landscape of the global medical devices industry.Since December 2004, Guidant?s board had recommended that shareholders vote in favour of a takeover by J&J. That support continued last year, after the price of the deal was cut because of a series of product recalls.But on Tuesday night, Guidant said that Boston?s offer was ?superior?, triggering a deadline of five business days for J&J to match or drop its own bid.The breakthrough for Boston, which is much smaller than J&J and has been pursuing Guidant since early last month, came after it offered to pay $80 per share, or $27bn for the company - a much higher price than the latest bid from J&J, worth $71 per share, or $24.2bn.The move was controversial, immediately exposing Boston to charges that it is overpaying. Most analysts believed that Boston could not bid above $76 per share without suffering a significant financial backlash. Worries that the price might be excessive were reflected in a fall in Boston share price, which dropped more than 5 per cent to $23.90 on Tuesday.But the extra money put on the table by Boston on Tuesday will not entirely come from its own coffers. Crucially, Abbott Laboratories, the US drugmaker, weighed in to help fund the planned acquisition by signing a last-minute deal to take a $1.4bn equity stake in Boston and pay extra cash for a series of overlapping assets that needed to be divested for regulatory reasons.Other new provisions in Boston?s offer included an increase in the cash component of the bid ? from an equal split to $42 a share in cash and $38 in stock - and an expanded ?collar? to protect Guidant shareholders in the event of a sharp fall in Boston?s stock market value.On Tuesday night, J&J would not comment on its next move. But it did issue a relatively feisty statement, saying that it considered the Boston bid ? a highly dilutive and leveraged transaction based on extremely aggressive business projections?. As such, the offer from Boston would ?not provide $80 per share in value to Guidant shareholders?, J&J added .Boston?s reaction to Guidant?s decision struck a predictably different tone, saying it was ?pleased?, and would ?look forward to working together to complete the transaction.?The latest bid from Boston was its third since January 8, when it first offered $72 per share, or $25bn. J&J also raised its bid twice last week - first to $68 per share - then to $71 per share.Guidant shares closed up 7.6 per cent to $76.22.
71;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-18T00:30:41Z;Boston takes on a giant in boldest move yet;;Boston Scientific was built over 26 years by some bold manoeuvres, and the architects of that history are trying to cap off their creation with the boldest move yet.Peter Nicholas, chairman of the board and co-founder of Boston, is still leading the charge with the group?s $27bn offer for devicemaker Guidant. In the process, he is also taking on Johnson & Johnson, a company almost 10 times the size of Boston and one of the world?s largest and most successful healthcare products groups.The presence of Mr Nicholas and his co-founder and fellow board member John Abele, has literally seen the bid become a stare-down with J&J.Mr Nicholas, 64, and Mr Abele, 68, control about 30 per cent of Boston?s shares, according to the company. At stake in the bid battle is their company?s future growth, their personal fortunes and the size of their control in Boston.The cash and stock acquisition proposal of Guidant would dilute the size of their stakes in the combined company.They built Boston over the years via a relationship within which each man has different strengths.Mr Nicholas is the aggressive business manager, and Mr Abele is the technologist and was the early proponent of the future of medical devices.Mr Nicholas, who had worked at Eli Lilly, the US drugmaker and one-time owner of Guidant, met Mr Abele via friends in 1978.Mr Abele had testified before Congress in 1966 on medical devices. A few years later he was working on catheters that doctors could steer through the body to do surgical procedures with little cutting on the body. This business would become the foundation of Boston.In 1979 working at Medi-Tech, a device company, Mr Abele joined forces with Mr Nicholas, who had found financing for the purchase of the business. They formed Boston Scientific and purchased control of Medi-Tech from Cooper Labs.The two men hit the road to sell their product and put together a company.Boston was a private company for many years growing by acquisitions and relished its anonymity.The company went public in 1992 in order to buy out a stake held by Abbott Laboratories. Abbott, the US health group, had invested $21m in Boston, forming lasting ties with the group.But Abbott declined an option to acquire Boston in 1992. This forced Boston to raise money to buy out Abbott?s stake with an initial public offering selling about 25 per cent of the company. It was Abbott which decided to aid Boston in its attempt to win Guidant. The help includes an Abbott loan and an agreement to buy a 4 per cent stake in shares of the group worth $1.4bn.Mr Nicholas has said he prided Boston on being a ?stealth business?, producing products, new technology and headaches for competitors. On Tuesday, he showed J&J he still meant it.
72;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-17T23:04:30Z;Rivals in Guidant fight monitor its potential;;As the sums offered for Guidant keep rising, is the heart ruling the head in the battle for the maker of high-tech implantable medical devices?Boston Scientific has offered $27bn for Guidant, a company with $3.7bn in revenues expected this year, about $1bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and a market value now standing at $25bn. The offer is higher than J&J’s sweetened $24.2bn agreement reached with Guidant last Friday.Almost forgotten in the later stages of the bid battle is Guidant’s damaging product recall last year. The problem found in nearly 100,000 products has hurt profits, harmed its reputation and is giving competitors a boost. J&J’s decision to renegotiate an agreed price, because of material adverse change, opened the door to Boston’s counterbid.Now, it appears, the attention is centred not on Guidant’s weaknesses, but on the huge growth potential of its technology.Its primary business – implantable heart devices that send electric signals to keep a heart beating properly – is the centrepiece of J&J and Boston’s interest. But Guidant also has significant expertise in stents, tiny props used to open closing coronary arteries. Both J&J and Boston covet Guidant’s products as an addition to their own important business in stents.Implantable devices to treat weakening, or sudden, heart conditions are a fast-growing technological innovation in medical care.The business enjoys the favourable winds of demographics. Ageing populations in the developed world, in general, and retiring baby boomers, in particular, could mean a solid market in such devices well into the future.A trio of US companies, Medtronic, Guidant and St Jude, dominate the global market for implantable heart rhythm devices. Medtronic leads with about 50 per cent market share, followed by Guidant with about 36 per cent and St Jude with the rest, according to UBS.The most important product for Guidant, and very important to the others as well, is the cardi implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Guidant also makes pacemakers and other implantable devices that can collect a patient’s heart data and transmit it remotely, allowing a technician or doctor to monitor their condition.An ICD is implanted just under the skin with wires connecting it to the heart. Electric pulses keep the heart beating in proper rhythm. And the device can also sense more serious heart problems, and deliver a significant electric shock to prevent death.The cost of a high-end ICD system is about $30,000. About three-quarters of the implants are in the US, with much of the rest in Europe.As the ICD market has matured, its growth has tempered in recent years. Analysts expect the market to increase 15-20 per cent per year over the next five years, and it is estimated to be a $9bn-a-year market in sales. This is down from growth of 30-50 per cent two years ago, when the devices entered the mainstream.Guidant also has expertise in stents, the tiny wire-mesh tubes inserted into an artery that is blocked by plaques to keep the blood flowing and prevent a heart attack.It led this market until J&J and Boston launched their drug-coated stents, which quickly dominated other products. The drug on the stent helps to prevent the artery from reclosing.The two companies dominate the worldwide stent market, estimated to be about $5bn a year. Competitors such as Medtronic and Abbott Laboratories, a US health products group, are entering this market. Boston and J&J are seeking to retain their leadership with new products, and Guidant has a drug-coated stent programmme that could help.But Guidant’s ICD business is the crown jewel for Boston and J&J, because it gives them a fast-growing business and diversifies their product portofolios. That diversification is key for both companies for different reasons.Boston is overly reliant on Taxus, its successful drug-coated stent. The stent accounts for about 44 per cent of Boston’s $6.3bn in annual revenues. Increased competition, some from J&J’s Cypher stent, could damp its growth.“If Boston fails to acquire Guidant, the company will be left with 44 per cent of revenue basically flat from 2005 to 2006,” said Mark Landy, analyst at Susquehanna Financial.Guidant would make implantable heart rhythm devices about 24 per cent of its sales, while stents would account for slightly less than 30 per cent.Boston touts a combination with Guidant as a fast-growing “pure-play” heart devices company that could rival industry leader Medtronic. It argues that shareholders might feel a conglomerate discount if Guidant were tucked into J&J, one of the world’s largest healthcare groups.“Our continued efforts to consummate a transaction with your company reflect our deep conviction that the strategic merits of this industry-transforming combination would create substantial value for your shareholders as well as ours,” Boston wrote to Guidant’s board.J&J’s pitch is that, with Guidant, it would be a dominant supermarket of medical devices ranging from orthopaedic joint implants, to stents to implantable defibrillators. The acquisition would diversify J&J away from pharmaceuticals, an activity among the company’s most profitable but which is weakening.The daring game over Guidant could also prompt another industry-changing reaction, Tao Levy, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said. A deal for St Jude might soon become a better option.
73;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-17T23:04:03Z;Restraint put to the test as Guidant bids rise;;The wave of dealmaking that has crossed corporate America in the past 18 months has been defined by remarkable prudence.In contrast to the irrational moves of the late 1990s, companies have rarely been caught surprising investors by paying too much for assets, doing big deals after guiding the market away from aggressive acquisition strategies, or raising the stakes beyond their limit in a takeover battle.But that restraint is being put to the test in the fight for control of Guidant.On Tuesday morning, Boston Scientific offered to buy the maker of implantable defibrillators for $27bn, or $80 per share. It is trying to break up a deal for Guidant to be acquired by Johnson & Johnson for $24.2bn, or $71 per share.The move – Boston’s third attempt in 10 days to win control of Guidant – was not unexpected. Since entering the takeover battle more than a month ago, its management has shown a fierce determination to be successful in trumping J&J.But the price that Boston was willing to pay for Guidant on Tuesday caught many on Wall Street by surprise.With its previous bid worth $73 per share in cash and stock, most analysts believed Boston was facing a ceiling of $76 for its bid. Above that, the company would be moving way beyond its financial capabilities, they argued.On the other side, J&J has not been a model of careful dealmaking either. Since December 2004, the healthcare conglomerate has struck four different deals to buy Guidant – at four different prices.First came the original deal, worth $76 per share, or $25.4bn.Then before the deal was set to close last autumn, J&J agreed a new deal worth $63 per share – after Guidant was forced to recall a number of products. And after Boston entered the fray formally last week, J&J twice changed the price it was willing to pay – first $68 per share, then $71.On Tuesday morning, most observers suggested the new bid by Boston meant J&J would have to raise its offer above $76 per share – the level of the original deal, before the recalls appeared to damage the business.One Guidant investor suggested this might be a difficult psychological hurdle for J&J to overcome.But the battle for Guidant is expected to continue. Most mergers and acquisitions advisers point out that, unlike in ordinary deal negotiations, the valuation of a company in a takeover battle is being re-considered at every juncture.This is because of the presence of one additional factor – competition – ordinarily absent from those calculations.For example, J&J was comfortable paying only $63 per share knowing that Guidant would otherwise remain independent.But in order to prevent a takeover by Boston, one of its main competitors in the medical devices area, J&J was ready to change its mind.Meanwhile, Boston sees Guidant as a way to diversify its business away from drug-coated stents and is now moving from being an “opportunistic” bidder to a “strategic” one.
74;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-17T21:42:18Z;Wall Street spooked by oil price concerns;;Wall Street stocks were pulled lower on Tuesday as the oil price jumped to its highest level since early October.Concerns about earnings quality were magnified as unrest in Nigeria and continued tension with Iran sent crude oil to more than $66 a barrel in New York.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.6 per cent to 10,896.4 while the S&P 500 was off 0.4 per cent to 1,282.93 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent lower at 2,302.69.Energy stocks were among the few to make any headway. ExxonMobil rose 1 per cent to $61.55.Other sectors went into retreat. Financial stocks came off the boil as Wells Fargo‘s fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations. Well Fargo fell 1 per cent to $62.60.Speculation it may have to pay more than $1bn to settle an accounting probe sent American International Group 1.4 per cent lower to $69.04. Merrill Lynch, which reports fourth-quarter earnings this week, lost 0.4 per cent to $70.14 amid talk it could be in the market to buy a US regional bank.Dana was the biggest faller on the S&P 500 after the auto parts maker reported a third-quarter loss of $1.27bn after it wrote off tax benefits. Dana slumped 20.6 per cent to $5.40. Continental Airlines fell 11.4 per cent at $17.24 in spite of reporting of a narrower fourth-quarter loss. As well as the oil price concerns, the shares were hit by the airline’s cautious statement on its outlook.A downgrade to “sell” from Merrill Lynch pulled Advanced Micro Devices, the circuit maker, 3.7 per cent lower to $32.86. SanDisk fell 1.8 per cent to $71.54 as Citigroup cut its rating on the maker of flash memory chips for mobile phones and digital cameras to “hold”. There was also a downgrade for Toll Brothers, the homebuilder. It lost 1.9 per cent to $37.03 as Banc of America Securities cut its rating on the stock to “sell”.However, shares in medical devices maker Guidant surged 7.6 per cent to $76.22 as Boston Scientific raised its offer for the company to $80 a share. Boston’s fresh offer, worth $27bn, is a 12.7 per cent premium over the Johnson & Johnson bid that Guidant’s board had accepted late last week. Boston fell 5.2 per cent to $23.90.St Jude Medical rose 0.6 per cent to $53.83 on speculation that J&J would switch its attention to St Jude should it lose out on Guidant.US Steel jumped 5.4 per cent to $52.80 on hopes it could be bought as part of consolidation in the industry. Arcelor of Luxembourg and ThyssenKrupp of Germany are involved in a $4.7bn battle for Canada’s Dofasco.Earnings are released after the close from Intel, the chipmaker, IBM, the computer company, and search engine Yahoo. Yahoo closed up 0.5 per cent at $40.11, Intel was off 1 per cent at $25.52 and IBM was down 0.2 per cent at $83.00.
75;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-24T22:41:20+0000;In pursuit of Guidant;;More than a year has passed since Johnson & Johnson first agreed to buy Guidant, the medical devices company, for over $25bn in cash and stock.

76;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-17T20:00:47Z;Lex: Boston Scientific/Guidant;;Affairs of the heart have a nasty habit of clouding people’s judgement. The same, it seems, is true for medical companies. Boston Scientific’s generosity in its blow-out $80-a-share bid for Guidant, maker of cardiac defibrillators, is as excessive as Johnson & Johnson’s tight-fistedness when it cut its original bid by 16 per cent to $64. That misjudgement let Boston into the fight. Now J&J will probably have to swallow its pride and go back above its original $76 offer if it wants to win.That is hard to justify. Guidant’s market share in defibrillators was already eroding as J&J went through the antitrust process. The business then took a big hit to earnings and market share after the recall of some of its products in the middle of last year. J&J’s reputation for financial discipline would take a hit if it went back above its original price.Instead, J&J could watch for a while. Boston has cleverly raised its bid without stretching its balance sheet, largely by raising new equity from Abbott Laboratories – which will buy part of Guidant if Boston wins. But there remains a possibility that Boston could breach its new collar, 6 per cent below the current share price. That could erode the value of its bid and give J&J an opening. Otherwise, Boston will be hard to match. Boston’s slow growth arguably meant it needed to do something. But, with limited cost savings available, such an aggressive price puts too much faith in the strategic benefits of a deal.
77;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-17T16:27:16Z;Boston raises Guidant offer to $27bn in bid war;;Boston Scientific, the medical devices group, on Tuesday raised the stakes of the takeover battle for Guidant by offering its shareholders $80 per share in cash and stock, a 12.7 per cent premium over the Johnson & Johnson bid that its board had accepted late last week.Boston’s fresh offer, worth $27bn, comes after Guidant’s shareholders on Friday voted in favour of a sweetened $24.2bn offer from J&J, which was forced to give up most of a discount on its initial bid for Guidant, negotiated in the wake of some problems for the company.To top Boston’s latest offer, Johnson & Johnson would have to exceed the $76 per share price it originally offered Guidant in late 2004. J&J negotiated a 17 per cent discount from that price after threatening to walk away from the deal amid Guidant’s product recalls and earnings warnings last summer.Guidant on Friday justified accepting the lower bid by saying J&J, which is ten times larger than Boston Scientific, offered more certainty in the long run. J&J is keen to consolidate its leadership in the $9bn-per-year implantable heart-device market.Boston’s latest bid offers Guidant shareholders $42 per share in cash and $38 per share in its own stock. The company said Guidant shareholders will own about 36 per cent of the combined entity. They would own about 5 per cent of J&J if they accept that bid.“Our $80 per share offer for Guidant is compelling,” said Pete Nicholas, the chairman of Boston Scientific. “We are providing Guidant shareholders with certainty of completion, significant upside potential and substantially more value today than the Johnson & Johnson transaction. By any objective measure, our offer is clearly superior to Johnson & Johnson’s.”Guidant investors appeared to welcome the offer, bidding Guidant shares up 7.7 per cent to $76.31. Bostong Scientific shares, meanwhile, eased 4.8 per cent to $23.98 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. J&J shares inched up 0.2 percent to $61.92.The new offer also includes a 7.9 per cent price increase for the planned sale of some of Guidant’s businesses to Abbott Laboratories to address regulatory concerns. Boston said Abbott agreed to pay $4.1bn for Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular businesses, up from $3.8bn.Abbott will partially finance the transaction with a $900m loan to Boston, up from $700m previously announced. Pending completion of the deal, Abbott agreed to purchase about $1.4bn of Boston Scientific stock, or 4 per cent in the combined company.Boston sought to allay concerns it was over-extending itself financially by saying the new bid does not alter its credit profile or affect its investment-grade rating.Boston’s latest offer expands the collar for the stock portion of the bid, offering protection against a drop in its stock price as far as $22.62, or $1 lower than its previous offer.In addition, Boston raised by 10 per cent its interest payments on the cash portion of the bid, offered to Guidant shareholders in case the transaction fails to close by the end of March. It will pat 1.32 cents per share a day from April 1st until the completion of the deal, up from 1.2 cents per share a day.Guidant’s board has until 5pm Eastern Time (2200 GMT) on Tuesday to consider the offer. If it deems it superior to J&J’s, the latter has five days to respond.
78;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-15T19:43:41Z;Lex: Guidant/Bid battles;;Modesty is rarely a winning a trait during takeover battles. Lately, however, several bidders have won board recommendations, despite offering less than a rival. That can sometimes be justified.Take Guidant. A week ago, Boston Scientific had a bid outstanding of $72 a share. Johnson & Johnson replied with a revised offer of just $68. By refusing to recommend Boston, Guidant forced it to raise its offer to $73 and address regulatory risks. That in turn prompted J&J to raise its price to $71 on Friday – not too far off the original $76 bid it made in 2004 but controversially withdrew.No board would admit to recommending a lower bid for purely tactical reasons. However, there are other justifications. The risks of bids are critical. Given the political mood, Unocal was probably right to choose Chevron’s bid over CNOOC’s richer one. Regulatory and political factors are hard to model. Boards also need to assess how much a bid’s equity component might be worth at closing. Where a bidder is desperate or stretched, a discount is justified. That was arguably the case when Qwest failed to win MCI, despite offering 13 per cent more than Verizon.For Guidant, the risk profiles of the rival bids are similar. This explains why J&J reduced the gap between its bid and Boston’s. However J&J’s decision to raise its cash component to $41 a share, compared with Boston’s $37, looks astute. Boston’s size and balance sheet capacity cannot match J&J’s.Although it could still raise its offer to a level clearly higher than J&J’s, its ability to do so without increasing the risk profile of its bid is starting to look limited.
79;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-13T22:45:58Z;Wall St chugs higher despite earnings alert;;"Wall Street ended the week modestly higher on Friday as investors shrugged off disappointing news from the corporate earnings front to continue their new year rally.The Nasdaq Composite once again paced the gains, rising 0.5 per cent over the five sessions, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, finished the week almost unchanged. The index made headlines earlier on Monday after it marched past the psychologically important 11,000 mark for the first time in four and a half years. But the blue chip index dipped back below the milestone benchmark as general profit taking pared its gains.The weekly advance came in spite of Friday’s lacklustre trading session. The Dow and the Nasdaq closed relatively unchanged at 10,959.87 and 2,317.04 while the S&P nudged up 0.1 per cent to 1,287.61.Disappointing news from Dow component Alcoa, the alumininium smelter, and DuPont, the chemicals company, saw the first-quarter earnings season off to a nervous start.Alcoa’s earnings came in below expectations while DuPont slashed its guidance in half. Alcoa and DuPont fell 4.2 per cent and 6.6 per cent over the week respectively.Nervousness about the outlook for US corporate earnings was further compounded by Tyco International, which lowered its first quarter earnings per share outlook to $0.38 from its previous guidance of $0.40 to $0.42 per share.Tyco shares slumped 9.5 per cent over the week amid news that its board had approved a plan to dismantle the $58bn conglomerate into three separate publicly traded companies. .Lucent Technology shares also fell 4.3 per cent this week after it lowered its revenue forecast for fiscal 2006. The telecommunications equipment maker cited weak sales in the US and China for the revised guidance.But despite the weaker-than-expected earnings results, Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research, said the week had been positive overall.“The market was obviously due for a break to avoid being overbought,” he said. “The volatility we saw this week is actually good because it shows that not all the sideline money has been allocated to the market. This means there is room in the market for the indices to move higher once the real earnings season gets underway next week.”That view was shared by Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, who said that the shaky start to the earning season was in no way a harbinger of worse news to come.Away from earnings, General Motors saw its mini-rally from last week faded after its shares fell four days out of five to end the week
2.1 per cent lower.Shares had initially surged on Monday following an upgrade from Goldman Sachs but tumbled again on concerns about bankruptcy, which have continued to dog the ailing carmaker.On the deal front the takeover battle surrounding Guidant intensified after Boston Scientific raised its bid for the medical device maker to $73 a share.The sweetened offer values Guidant at about $25bn, or $2bn more than rival Johnson & Johnsonrevised bid.Shares in Boston Scientific and J&J fell 4 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively this week, while Guidant jumped 5.2 per cent.On the Nasdaq, Apple Computershares hit a series of all-time highs this week after Steve Jobs, chief executive, told the MacWorld show in San Francisco that the fourth quarter would be better than expected because of strong demand for its iPod personal music players in the run-up to Christmas.UBS and Bear Stearns responded with upgrades for the stock. The latter said Apple was “at the centre of a digital lifestyle revolution”. Apple shares surged 12.2 per cent over the week to become the S&P’s second best performer.Shares rival computer maker Hewlett-Packard also rose 5.5 per cent this week after Goldman Sachs added the computer maker to
its list of “outperform” stocks.However, IBM traded 2.1 per cent lower after the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had launched a formal investigation into disclosures surrounding the company’s first-quarter earnings statements."
80;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;J&J puts its heart into battle for Guidant;;The bidding battle for US heart devicemaker Guidant now teeters on one simple question: how much is Guidant worth to Johnson & Johnson?The fight is over Guidant’s implantable heart devices, particularly ones that can shock the heart back into proper rhythm.Despite a damaging recall last year of 100,000 devices, Guidant is number two in the heart device market of defibrillators and pace-makers worth up to $9bn a year. It also has a historically innovative business in coronary stents – tiny wire-mesh tubes that keep coronary arteries open.By winning a deal for Guidant, Boston Scientific would transform itself into powerful heart device company. Guidant would allow it to diversify from its reliance on drug-coated stents, securing Boston Scientific potential strong profit growth into the future.J&J seeks a player in the fast-growing implantable heart devices sector to offset a creeping weakness in pharmaceuticals, its most profitable unit, and to strengthen its own drug-coated stent business.Now J&J must decide what that is worth, not only in terms of money but also in terms of pride.Late last year, a year after it agreed to a deal with Guidant, J&J thought it was the only dog in the fight.It forced Guidant to take a new price of $21.5bn, down from about $25.4bn agreed originally, the product recalls that hurt Guidant’s near-term profits, helped competitors and hurt its reputation.But Boston swooped in with a surprise $25bn offer, or $72 a share.J&J had called its offer “full and fair value” for Guidant. But it now has changed its tune. Yesterday J&J raised its offer for Guidant to $23.2bn in cash and stock or $68 a share.Guidant accepted the latest offer but Boston is expected to counter. It has already offered $25bn or $72 a share.Analysts say Guidant has leaned so far to J&J’s offer because, among other things, it wants an end to the protracted battle.Matthew Dodds, analyst at Citigroup, says: “Clearly, J&J wasn’t as tied to its guns on its $63-$64 [a share] bid as we had imagined. But nonetheless the company is certainly still trying to play hardball by counter-bidding at just $68 per share versus Boston’s $72 offer.”J&J’s hardball negotiating has soured a friendly deal that many analysts and investors had seen as a dream match for nearly a decade.Announcing the deal in December 15, 2004, William Weldon, J&J chairman and chief executive, said Guidant would now be in the “Johnson & Johnson family”.But the family get-together soon turned to bickering. In June, it became more adverserial after Guidant’s recalls of products that had been involved with a few patient deaths over a number of yearsIn October, J&J threatened to walk away, unless it got a better price to reflect these serious problems in Guidant.Guidant filed a lawsuit seeking to force J&J to go through with the original price. But the company later bowed to J&J’s pressure and the lower price.Nevertheless, in making a higher offer yesterday, J&J has signalled that it is willing to pay more.Moreover, Boston might actually need Guidant more than J&J, driving it to pull out the stops in its attempt to secure it.So far shareholders are lining up behind Boston’s bid, and a higher one could win over Guidant too – unless J&J changes its mind again.
81;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios.

Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers.

82;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-13T00:41:41Z;Boston Scientific raises offer for Guidant;;Boston Scientific on Thursday night raised its offer for Guidant to $73 a share, valuing the US medical devices company at about $25bn and giving it a deadline of 4pm EST to respond.In a further attempt to sweeten its offer, Boston Scientific also said it would divest all overlapping assets and pay interest to Guidant shareholders if the deal closed after March 31.The improved bid was a response to the decision by Guidant’s board to accept a rival offer from Johnson & Johnson, which raised its offer to $23.2bn earlier this week.Boston’s offer is now almost $3bn higher than J&J’s, keeping the closely fought battle for control of Guidant finely balanced.Boston’s move was not unexpected: earlier on Thursday major shareholders in Guidant had expressed disappointment at the board’s willingness to back J&J’s bid.J&J argues that its offer, worth $68 per share, although lower, is justified by the certainty of closure, given that it has already received regulatory approval.But some of Guidant’s largest investors disagree. John Paulson, who runs Paulson & Company, a New York hedge fund that owns about 7.7m Guidant shares, said: “The valuation gap is still too great. Boston Scientific has given us the protection of a collar, agreed to divest some businesses and are paying $4 more a share. That’s a lot of money and we are not going to give that up.”Elliott Associates, which owns about 3m Guidant shares, wrote a letter to the company’s board saying it was “appalled” at the board’s “failure to stand up for the shareholders you are charged to represent”. Elliott said it would vote against the J&J deal at a special shareholder meeting. J&J may now have to increase its offer further if it is to be certain of securing control of Guidant, a company it has been pursuing since December 2004.Boston Scientific, which indicated last month that it was interested in taking over Guidant, made its $25bn offer formal on Sunday in documents that included a side deal to sell certain businesses to Abbott Laboratories for $4.3bn. per share.For some analysts, this might not have been enough to satisfy Guidant directors that it had removed any risk of the deal being blocked or delayed by antitrust regulators.“ Guidant is openly expressing doubt over Boston’s ability to close the deal in a timely fashion and without any regulatory mis-steps,” wrote Matthew Dodds of Citigroup. The formal offer from Boston Scientific was followed on Tuesday by an approach to Guidant by J&J, which had until then held back on renegotiating of $64 per share.Guidant shares, which have see-sawed over the past three months as investors reacted to developments in the takeover battle, fell 0.1 per cent to $70.40 in New York.
83;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-11T18:44:25Z;J&J and Guidant discuss higher buy-out offer;;Johnson & Johnson has entered talks with Guidant about raising its $21.5bn offer for the US medical devices maker, raising the pressure in the takeover battle against Boston Scientific.The move by J&J was described by people close to the situation as a last-ditch attempt to salvage an acquisition that the company had been pursuing for more than a year.This week, Guidant’s board had been expected to abandon its recommendation that shareholders accept a bid from J&J, and instead vote in favour of a higher counter-offer from Boston Scientific, a rival medical devices group.The prospect of a defeat in the Guidant boardroom led J&J to inform Guidant that it was willing to raise its bid. However, the price to which J&J was willing to go, and other terms, were not specified. Boston’s offer, which was formally tabled on Sunday, values Guidant at $72 per share, or $25bn, while J&J’s proposal is worth $64 per share.One person familiar with the discussions said Boston was assured that it would be given a chance to raise its offer before Guidant decided to accept a revised deal from J&J.Guidant’s directors were expected to meet on Wednesday afternoon to weigh the competing offers and receive an update on the negotiations.The battle between Boston and J&J is over Guidant’s implantable heart devices, particularly ones that can shock the heart back into proper rhythm. In spite of a damaging recall this year of 100,000 devices that triggered J&J’s lower offer, Guidant is number two in the heart device market of defibrillators and pacemakers worth up to $9bn a year.J&J seeks fast-growing implantable heart devices to offset a creeping weakness in pharmaceuticals.
84;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-09T21:57:21Z;Dow closes above 11,000 to hit 4 ½ year high;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the talk of Wall Street yesterday after the blue chip index broke through the 11,000 mark for the first time in four and a half years.The Dow ended the session 0.5 per cent higher at 11,011.90, powered by a sharp rally for General Motors. The other indices also extended their gains from last week. The S&P 500 added 0.4 per cent to 1,290.15 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,318.69.Analysts agreed that the importance of the milestone was chiefly psychological. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said continued profit growth would be the main catalyst for the market this month.“What is important is that earnings continue coming through above expectations,” he said.The Dow would not have broken through the 11,000 mark without GM, whose 7.7 per cent advance accounted for nearly 13 points of the index’s 53 points advance.Shares in the ailing carmaker surged $1.60 to $22.41 after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs.Noting that GM lost more than half of its market value last year, analyst Robert Barry said his “long-term view of GM fundamentals remained squarely negative”.However, he added that “a Chapter 11 filing [was] very unlikely anytime soon, upcoming catalysts could improve sentiment and allay bankruptcy fears” and he said that GM shares could rebound to the mid-$20 range in the first half of this year.American Express, up 2.5 per cent at $53.99, and Caterpillar, up 1.5 per cent at $61.34, also lent support to the Dow.Alcoa, which kicked off the earnings season yesterday, provided the rally with extra steam, rising 1.6 per cent to $30.68.Meanwhile, positive sentiment surrounding the Detroit motor show gave the wider auto sector a lift, with Ford gaining 2.6 per cent to $8.74.GM’s rally helped offset losses in fellow Dow component IBM, which slipped 1.8 per cent to $83.46 after JPMorgan cut its rating on the computer maker and lowered its price target for the stock.JPMorgan also downgraded Amazon, driving the online retailer 2.7 per cent lower to $46.59.Elsewhere, reports that Tyco International was considering a break up of its $60bn business sent the conglomerate up 3.3 per cent to $30.96.On the deal front, Guidant rose 2.4 per cent to $68.99 as Boston Scientific made a formal bid to acquire its rival medical device maker for $25bn, or $72 a share. Shares in Boston Scientific lost 1.7 per cent to $25.79.Elsewhere, financial heavyweights JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch rose 1.2 per cent to $40.50 and 1.4 per cent to $69.68, respectively, after an upgrade from Prudential. The broker said that merger and acquisition activity in 2005 should lift earnings.
85;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-09T20:21:35Z;Lex: Boston Scientific;;Boston Scientific still has a few hurdles to clear before it can consummate its purchase of Guidant. So far, however, it has done remarkably well in keeping up the momentum of its eleventh-hour bid to buy its battered medical device rival. Having swiftly completed its due diligence, it has put a firm offer on the table, with a price tag about 12 per cent above the revised one from Johnson & Johnson.That will make it hard for Guidant’s board not to endorse Boston’s proposal. While they probably dislike the asset sales now envisioned, board members might also recall J&J’s bullying tactics that led to a lower price and created the opening for Boston. By lining up Abbott Laboratories as the buyer for Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular businesses, Boston should be able to speed up antitrust approvals. The unexpectedly favourable terms of the side-deal might even leave it a little bit of wriggle room to increase its offer, if that proves necessary.A proper bidding war remains unlikely, however. J&J has sought to reassure investors that it remains committed to the deal and teasing comments are sometimes the truest signs of love. But with the latest string of discouraging news in the aftermath of Guidant’s defibrillator recalls, J&J would certainly struggle to justify again raising its price.Boston, moreover, arguably needs the deal much more urgently. Already, the deal-making frenzy has proved a welcome distraction from its own lacklustre performance. Its position in coronary stents will probably continue to erode, as the market share losses of its Taxus unit mount. Buying Guidant might add integration, litigation and financial risks. It says a lot about current market moods, however, that investors have instead focused on its enchanting, but fairly uncertain, growth implications.
86;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2006-01-08T23:55:19Z;Boston plans $4.3bn sell-off if it wins Guidant;;Boston Scientific, the US medical devices group, has pledged to sell two businesses to Abbott Laboratories for about $4.3bn in cash if it emerges victorious in the takeover battle over Guidant, the maker of heart stents and defibrillators.The deal with Abbott should help Boston Scientific’s chances of gaining quick regulatory approval for its $25bn offer for Guidant which was made formal on Sunday night after the Massachusetts-based company spent several weeks studying Guidant’s confidential financial information.Boston Scientific is attempting to break up an agreed offer for Guidant to be taken over for $21.5bn by Johnson & Johnson, the largest player in the industry, which is now likely to face the pressure of deciding between raising its offer, potentially igniting a bidding war, or walking away.The outcome of the due diligence performed by Boston Scientific was anxiously awaited on Wall Street. Last year, Guidant experienced a series of product recalls, leaving many analysts and investors guessing about the company’s health.“We had a chance to look under the hood and we didn’t find anything that surprised us,” said Jim Tobin, Boston Scientific chief executive. “Guidant’s long-term value is still intact.”Boston Scientific’s preliminary offer of $72 per share in an equal mix of cash and stock – tabled before access to Guidant’s books in early December – remained unchanged.However, Boston Scientific included measures to make sure Guidant directors and investors were persuaded the deal would close quickly and that the combined company’s financial position would remain strong.The deal with Abbott involves the sale of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular businesses for $4.3bn in cash.Guidant’s board is expected to meet in the coming days to consider whether the proposal from Boston is “superior” to the J&J bid.
87;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-12-27T22:09:35Z;Wall St in red on bond inversion;;Wall Street kicked off the last trading week of the year mired in negative territory on Tuesday after developments in the bond market set off a fresh round of uncertainty on the outlook for the US economy.Any lingering hopes for the fabled year-end rally were dashed as the main indices suffered from their sharpest one-day selloff in two months.After an initial rally on the back of lower energy prices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated sharply to close down 1 per cent at 10,777.77. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also ended the session off 1 per cent at 1,256.54 and 2,226.89 respectively.Analysts said the market was reacting to a combination of factors – including a slight inversion of the yield curve.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said the inversion was a sign that the US economy might be slowing down in 2006.“Historically, an inverted yield curve heralds the start of a slowdown in the US economy,” he said. “There is no reason to think this time would be different.”Energy stocks, which fell along with crude prices, weighed heavily on the Dow. Crude futures on the Nymex pulled back after forecasts for milder weather in most parts of the US buoyed expectations that there would be sufficient stockpiles of heating fuels to meet winter demand.Exxon Mobil led the sector decline, dropping 2.2 per cent to $55.87 while the Amex oil index was knocked back 2.8 per cent.Airline and transport stocks benefited, however, from the lower crude prices. The Amex airline index traded up 1.5 per cent and the S&P transport index rose 0.7 per cent.Elsewhere in the market, retailers were in focus after Amazon.com skid 1.3 per cent to 48.56. In spite of reporting record holiday sales this year, shares in the online retailer fell on concerns that its offer of free shipping might dent its bottom line. Net income for Amazon has dropped in each of the past three quarters, in part because higher shipping costs have cut into profit margins.Profit concerns also plagued the wider retail sector, with consumer electronic retailers all in retreat even though high-tech goods such as flat-screen televisions, digital cameras and MP3 players were among this season’s top-selling items. Radioshack fell 1.8 per cent to $20.90 while its rival Best Buy dropped 1.4 per cent to $43.69.Apple Computer was among the few stocks to have resisted the downward trend. Its shares rose 1.2 per cent to $74.23 after Amazon said the computer maker’s iPod music players were among its best-selling items.Guidant, the cardiac device maker, slashed its fourth-quarter guidance by more than 50 per cent following the recall of its defective defibrillators earlier this year. But Boston Scientific said it would proceed with its $25bn offer to buy its rival. Guidant fell 3.4 per cent to $64.69 while Boston Scientific dropped 3 per cent to $25.07.
88;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-12-27T18:47:28Z;Guidant receives safety warning;;"Guidant, the US maker of heart defibrillators at the centre of a bitter takeover battle, has been sent a formal warning by US regulators concerned over the safety of its manufacturing procedures.The Food and Drug Administration said it would not grant requests for export certificates or approve certain other licensing applications until further
remedial action was taken by the company.The warning letter – received on December 23 but revealed on Tuesday – turns up the heat on Guidant, which is struggling to regain the confidence of investors and customers after product recalls and related legal action.Late on Friday, the company also announced a profits warning, including estimates of fourth-quarter sales of $790m-$820m compared with Wall Street expectations of $916m.The disappointing financial performance was blamed on Guidant’s slow progress in regaining market share following the recalls and bad publicity for some of its products.The company put a brave face on the FDA news, saying it would “promptly respond to the warning letter and believes that it can fully address the concerns of the FDA without a material impact to its business.“Guidant has taken a broad, thorough and systemic review of its quality system and has made substantial steps toward addressing all of the [FDA investigator’s] observations,” the company said.It said it was providing the FDA with monthly updates on its progress and had completed 90 per cent of the commitments made after the regulator’s initial inspection of manufacturing facilities in September.But the timing remains awkward for Guidant, which is in the middle of a bitterly contested takeover battle.Boston Scientific, which trumped a rival bid from Johnson & Johnson with an offer worth $25bn, is expected to agree formal details with Guidant in late December or early January.It stuck to this plan on Tuesday saying: “We continue to move forward in our due diligence with the goal of reaching a definitive agreement with Guidant.”Boston’s half-cash, half-stock proposal would see it expand into implanted heart devices and create the largest cardiovascular device manufacturer in a profitable and growing market.Guidant shares fell 3.1 per cent to $64.90 in early New York trading."
89;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-12-09T22:34:25Z;Wall St hopes of Santa Claus rally fade;;Wall Street’s year-end rally sputtered to a halt this week as rising energy prices and lingering concerns about further interest rate increases kept buyers on the sidelines.The three main indices fell for a second week in a row, having rallied for five weeks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.9 per cent over the five sessions, dragged down by losses in chip maker Intel and troubled drugmaker Merck. The S&P 500 was off 0.5 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7 per cent.“The market is still in a consolidation phase after the big upswing we had in November,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co., of the falls.“Historically, when the market has a good run in November, December tends to be flat. It will take a significant macro catalyst to take the market out of this sideways action.”Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, also blamed the purging of the overbought level in November. However, he expected the rally to resume towards the end of December.“That is the time of the year when portfolio managers dress up their portfolio,” he said. “They tend to buy the best-performing stocks so that they can show ownership at the end of the year. This in turn should push the market higher.”The week’s losses would have been heavier but for a small recovery on Friday.The Dow, helped by General Motor’s 4.2 per cent rebound, closed up 0.2 per cent, or 23.46 points, at 10,778.58.The S&P 500 edged 0.3 per cent, or 3.53 points, higher to 1,259.37, while the Nasdaq added 0.5 per cent, or 10.27 points, to 2,256.73.The market’s concern about monetary tightening was underlined by the record high gold prices.But another rising asset - energy - threatened to dash any lingering hopes of a Santa Claus rally.The Amex oil index rose by as much as 1.7 per cent this week after prices of natural gas, heating oil and crude oil all climbed in response to the season’s first winter storm, which swept across the US mid-west and north-east.Sliding inventories and tight supplies also helped drove up prices. Close to 30 per cent of the natural gas production facilities in the Gulf Coast remain closed as a result of Hurricanes Rita, Katrina and Wilma.The index finished the week almost unchanged after crude prices pulled back sharply yesterday.The short-lived rally was enough to boost the energy sector (up 0.7 per cent on the week), while energy-sensitive stocks, namely transport and airline shares, suffered, the former falling 1.3 per cent.Retailers also retreated, falling 0.6 per cent on fears that higher heating bills would drain money from Christmas shoppers’ pocketbooks. Department store operator Kohls fell 2.1 per cent to $46, while luxury jeweler Tiffany slid 2 per cent to $40.22.Elsewhere, chipmakers fell victim to the adage “buy on the rumour, sell on the news”, after a rosy mid-quarter update from Texas Instruments on Thursday prompted more sell-offs in the semiconductor sector.The pull back was largely expected. Chipmaking has rallied strongly in November on anticipation that seasonal demand for consumer electronics goods would drive up sales.Overall, the Amex semiconductor index shed 3.3 per cent over the week, with Texas closing 2.2 per cent lower at $33.37 and Micron Technology down 6.7 per cent at $13.41.Sector heavyweight Intel also took it to the chin. Its shares sold off 4.9 per cent to $26.08 on the week, after it narrowed its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to $10.4bn to $10.6bn.On the deal front, a surprise $25bn bid from Boston Scientific sent shares in troubled medical device maker Guidant 8.7 per cent higher for the week at $67.20.Boston Scientific and rival bidder Johnson & Johnson both slumped on the news. But St Jude Medical gained 6.3 per cent to $51.32 on the week following speculation that the company might become an acquisition target for the loser of the Guidant deal.Meanwhile, investors paused to take profit on recent winners. Google fell 2 per cent to $409.20 for the week.
90;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-12-05T21:37:56Z;Wall St weaker as crude prices rise;;Boston Scientific’s surprise rival bid for troubled medical device maker Guidant provided Wall Street with its main talking point on Monday, while higher crude prices and a jump in bond yields sent investors scrambling out of equities.Guidant shares surged 10 per cent to $67.98 after Boston Scientific, the world’s largest maker of cardiac stents, approached the company with a $25bn, or $72 a share, buy-out offer in cash and stock.The bid tops Johnson & Johnson current proposal of $21bn, or $63.43 a share, which was reduced from its original value of $25.4bn in mid-November after Guidant announced product recalls and worrying earning results.Boston Scientific’s bold move did not please its shareholders, however. Its shares slumped 3.6 per cent to $26.35, while J&J eased back $0.16, or 0.3 per cent, to $61.10 as traders awaited for the consumer product giant’s next move.In the meantime, investors are turning their attention to St Jude Medical, Guidant’s chief rival in the implantable heart-defibrillator sector. St Jude jumped 4.7 per cent to $50.56 on speculation that the company might become a bid target for the loser of the Guidant deal.For all the excitement, the flurry of merger and acquisition activity failed to lift the leading indices, which fell after a jump in crude prices sparked concern that higher energy costs would put a damper on holiday spending.Oil prices rose back above $60 a barrel on reports that a snowstorm would hit the US north-east – the world’s largest heating fuel market – later this week.The Amex oil index gained 1 per cent on the news, while the S&P transportation index, which is sensitive to the oil price, fell 1.6 per cent.Retailers, hurt by lingering concern about holiday sales, were also off. Target fell 2.3 per cent to $52.61 while Wal-Mart lost 1.7 per cent to $47.14.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.4 per cent, or 42.50 points, to 10,835.01, while the broader S&P 500 shed 0.2 per cent, or 3 points, to 1,262.08. The Nasdaq Composite, hurt by losses in chipmaker Intel (down 1.9 per cent to $26.90), dropped 0.7 per cent or 15.73 points, to 2,257.64.Deal talk continued to swirl round US Steel, which rose 18 per cent last week amid rumours that it would become an acquisition target after Arcelor announced a $3.7bn hostile bid for Canada’s Dofasco. Its shares closed up 5.2 per cent at $50.60.On the downside, Ford Motor added to its recent losses, dropping 1.1 per cent to $8.06 despite unveiling plans to close eight of its assembly and parts plants in North America.Elsewhere, investors paused to take profits on recent winners. Apple Computer fell 1.1 per cent to $71.82 while Google dropped 2.8 per cent to $405.85.Sears Holdings slid 2.3 per cent to $116.71 after the department store chain announced plans to buy the 46.2 per cent stake in Sears Canada it does not already own for $719m.
91;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-12-05T21:24:38Z;Lex: Guidant;;"Johnson & Johnson drove a hard bargain. Retrospectively, it also appears to have overplayed its hand. By shaving almost $4bn off the original price it negotiated for Guidant, J&J created an opening for Boston Scientific, its arch-rival in coronary stents.Boston’s non-binding bid of $72 a Guidant share is 13.5 per cent above J&J’s revised offer and just $4 short of the initial one. For Boston, bidding $25bn is audacious; its own market capitalisation is just $22bn. But Guidant’s net cash position of about $2.5bn, as well as various divestures, should push the net price below $20bn. Agreeing to sell Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular businesses, while largely offloading its drug eluting stent programme, is also likely to speed up competition approval.All this would leave Boston with a better story to tell. After all, Guidant would have allowed J&J to ratchet up the pressure on Boston’s Taxus stents unit, the key to its success, but also the main cause of investor concerns. In stents, competition has already started to erode earnings.The same may eventually happen to Guidant’s defibrillators and pacemakers. Add enhanced litigation and integration risks and this is not a deal for the fainthearted to buy into. Along with the embarrassment of yet another U-turn, this should also deter J&J from again raising its price.When a man steals your wife, there is sometimes no better revenge than to let him keep her."
92;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-12-05T19:55:08Z;Boston Scientific in $25bn move on Guidant;;Boston Scientific moved to torpedo Johnson & Johnson’s vexed takeover of Guidant with a surprise $25bn counterbid that would create the largest maker of heart devices by revenue.A deal – at a price $3bn higher that J&J’s – would mark a big strategic move for Boston and call into question J&J’s tough renegotiation of its agreement with Guidant following the recall of nearly 100,000 of its implantable heart devices earlier this year.Boston’s offer is backed by two loan facilities of $7bn each from Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.The bid is close to the $25.4bn initially offered by J&J and exceeds Boston’s market capitalisation of $22bn. Boston said the $72 a share offer, in cash and stock, was a 14 per cent premium to J&J’s revised agreement.J&J last month agreed a cash and stock bid of about $63 per share – 7 per cent lower than its original offer of $76 a share a year ago.Guidant said its board would consider the takeover proposal. Johnson & Johnson did not immediately comment.By the close of trading on Monday, Guidant’s shares had jumped nearly 10 per cent to $67.98. Boston Scientific’s had slipped 3.58 per cent to $26.35 and J&J’s had fallen 0.26 per cent to $61.05.Tao Levy, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a research note that the proposed transaction made significant strategic sense and “better reflects Guidant’s value than J&J’s proposed price”.The product recalls – and potential liability from Guidant’s knowledge of problems with its devices a few years ago – have created uncertainty about the long-term strength of its business.J&J called the recalls “serious” issues and invoked a “material adverse effect” clause in its merger contract in order to get a better price.But Boston said it felt “positive” about Guidant’s problems, which it saw as “manageable” after a thorough review of the public information on the matter.It trumpeted its offer as superior not only in terms of price but also as a strategic fit. Boston could offer Guidant a better future as a larger company dedicated mostly to cardiovascular devices, adding pacemakers and ICDs to its coronary stents business.Paul LaViolette, chief operating officer, said: “If you took out a blank sheet of paper, this is the combination you’d come up with.”Boston pledged to close a transaction in the first quarter and to make necessary divestments to gain regulatory approval.Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns advised Boston.
93;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-07-05T20:27:53Z;Wall Street undeterred by higher oil prices;;Shares rallied in New York yesterday despite rising oil prices as retail stocks rose on better-than-expected results from Wal-Mart.Stocks stalled in early trade as investors returning to work after the Fourth of July holiday had to consider the immediate impact of oil creeping back up towards $60 a barrel after sliding from a record high set last Monday. The price of crude oil for August delivery climbed $1.20 to $59.95 a barrel on the Nymex market in the wake ofwas lifted by news of a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico that could disrupt fuel supplies.But the main stock indices recovered and at the close the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent at 1,204.99 and the Dow Jones gained 0.7 per cent at 10,371.80. The Nasdaq climbed 1 per cent to 2,078.75.With earnings season fast approaching, there was some good news from Wal-Mart. The group said on Saturday that it estimated June sales rose a better-than-expected 4.5 per cent at its US stores open at least a year, which could mark its biggest monthly gain in 13 months. Wal-Mart rose 3.2 per cent to $49.80. The S&P food and staples retail index gained 2.4 per cent.Gordon B Fowler Jr, chief investment officer at the Glenmede Trust Company, said despite some concerns that the forthcoming earnings announcements would underwhelm investors, there was enough good news to keep the market happy.“There is a tremendous spread between earnings yields and bond yields. People are looking at the bond yields and the competitive rate of return that stocks offer and are concluding that there is something attractive about equities at this point.”There was mixed news from the technology sector. Apple Computer climbed 4.1 per cent to $37.98 after JP Morgan lifted its third-quarter earnings forecast on the company.Boston Scientific continued to gain ground. The group rose more than 10 per cent in extended trading hours on Friday after a Federal jury in Delaware found that Johnson & Johnson had infringed two of Boston Scientific’s patents on drug-coated stents. Johnson & Johnson fell slightly, while Boston Scientific rose 6.4 per cent, taking it to $28.60.Shares in Advanced Micro Devices gained 3.4 per cent to $18.04 following a report in Barron’s that suggested the chipmaker could see its share price soar if it wins its battle with rival Intel, which gained 1.8 cent to $26.68.Alvarion was the Nasdaq’s biggest loser, falling 22.5 per cent to $8.88, after the Israeli broadband wireless issued an earnings warning.KB Home, one of this year’s star performers on the stock market, fell 1 per cent to $75.00 after Credit Suisse First Boston reduced the homebuilder from “neutral” to “underperform”. CSFB said the company was highly exposed to the potential bubble markets of Las Vegas, Phoenix and parts of California.It had similar things to say about homebuilder MDC Holdings, which fell 0.9 per cent to $80.75.
94;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-06-21T18:39:31Z;Boston Scientific guilty of patent infringement;;A US district court on Tueday found Boston Scientific, maker of the best-selling Taxus stent, guilty of infringing on patents held by a unit of rival Johnson & Johnson.Cordis Corporation, which is owned by J&J and develops interventional vascular technology, had charged Boston Scientific with using its balloon-explandable stent technology in three products.Awards will be decided in August.“Today’s findings of infringement against the Taxus, Liberte and Express stents - together with previous findings of infringement by Boston Scientific’s NIR stent - reinforces the strength of Cordis’ deep patent estate on balloon expandable stents,” said Nick Valeriani, the company’s chairman of cardiovascular devices and diagnostics.Boston Scientific said it planned to appeal against the Delaware jury’s decision.Stents - metal mesh devices used to prop open the arteries of heart disease patients - came under scrutiny earlier this year after several studies showed drug-coated brands made by both Boston Scientific and J&J caused complications and deaths.Global sales of stents are expected to rise to an annual $6bn by 2008.
95;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2005-02-10T18:35:04Z;Galway gets to the heart of the matter;;"From the vantage point of the famous Galway racetrack, it is easy to see how this west of Ireland city is now described as one of Europe's leading industrial clusters.""Over there, we've got the world's biggest maker of cardiovascular stents,"" says Ian Quinn, who runs a family-owned business supplying the big multinationals with specialist parts. ""And on that side, we've got the second biggest.""Boston Scientific and Medtronic have Galway factories making stents, the tiny metal device which, when it was invented in the 1980s, revolutionised the treatment of coronary heart disease, replacing open-heart surgery with a minimally invasive technique that applies the principles of plumbing to let a surgeon clear furred-up arteries.Galway boasts three of the top four companies in this field, with Abbott the latest arrival, inheriting a stent plant as part of its 1995 takeover of Bio-Compatibles, a UK company.Together with local companies, there are now 28 medical devices companies in Galway, employing more than 5,000 people - 350 of whom are engaged in leading-edge research and development. Cluster theory, which was first described by Michael Porter in his book The Competitive Advantage of Nations, holds that when similar companies locate in the same place, they can achieve economies of scale without losing the flexibilities enjoyed by smaller organisations.Fifteen years ago, Digital, the US computer company, was Galway's biggest employer. It closed in 1993, moving to Scotland. ""Everyone said that when Digital closed, Galway was finished,"" says Bernard Collins, a well-known figure in Galway's medical devices industry. ""Quite the opposite was the case.""Many of the Digital engineers are now working for the big US medical device companies, which in the mid 1990s were starting to expand abroad, overcoming concerns about quality control and nervousness over the lack of protection for inventions.""What was happening was that many of the new medical device products were coming from Europe. Maybe it was the lower risk of litigation. Maybe doctors here are more adventurous. But US companies felt they had to capture that,"" says Mr Collins, who set up Boston Scientific's Galway operation in 1994, in a factory vacated by Digital, which a decade earlier had made tennis rackets for Wilson, the US sports equipment company.Creganna, Mr Quinn's company, was originally set up as a supplier to the local electronics industry. But in 1997, it was persuaded by Boston Scientific to start making catheters, the delivery device that carries the stent into position inside the heart. Now the world's largest catheter manufacturer, it has sales of €26m ($33m), employs 270 people in Galway and has a new design and development centre in Boston, Massachusetts.In the early days, one of the missing ingredients was the lack of R&D facilities. But in March last year, Boston Scientific's Galway facility was responsible for the launch of the company's latest innovation - a drug-coated stent that reduces unwanted patient reactions and inhibits the return of plaque to the arteries.Galway University works closely with the companies in areas such as materials testing. Last year, it was given a €19m government grant to set up a regenerative medicine institute, which is part funded by Medtronic and is looking to develop a new generation of devices that can deliver stem cells to rebuild damaged organs inside the body.Frank Barry, lured back from the US to run the institute, says his research scientists are in daily contact with R&D experts at the US company's Minnesota research laboratories.Roy Green, the university's dean of commerce, who is studying the Galway medical devices cluster, suggests that the Galway phenomenon is likely to continue. This is because the R&D operations of multinational companies need to be closer to their customers than to their corporate headquarters.""The days when you had one centre for R&D are over,"" he says. ""With the life cycles of medical devices products so short, it is vital to be close to your customers to keep ahead of competitors."""
96;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2004-12-07T21:37:53Z;US stocks lower as Fed rate decision looms;;"Wall Street stocks pulled back from a tentative midday rally on Tuesday as investors struggled to find action amid a murky economic outlook and a looming decision on interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to end the day at 10,441.76, while the S&P 500 fell 1.1 per cent to 1,177.14. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7 per cent to 2,114.83.More than 1.5bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange where declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly four to one.The three main US indices slumped even as the oil price fell to a fresh three-month low. Shares have stumbled since Friday, confounding bullish investors' hopes of a sustained rally in the run up to Christmas.Michael Driscoll, block trader at Bear Stearns, said he was still optimistic that this year's post-election rally could continue until the end of the year.Hopes for a renewed bounce have been bolstered by falling oil prices. Oil futures resumed their slide on Tuesday, closing down $1.52 at $41.46, following a rally on Monday that reversed a week of sharp decline.Optimism over oil was kept in check by government figures showing that business productivity in the third quarter had grown more slowly than expected. The US Labor Department said non-farm productivity had grown at a 1.8 per cent annual rate from July to September, a two-year low.In an otherwise slow week for economic news, instability in the Middle East and concerns about oil supplies ahead of a meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday continued to weigh on sentiment.Concerns that Opec might decide to cut oil production were compounded by official US data showing that average oil output by Opec members fell by 400,000 barrels per day in November.Christmas fortunes will hinge in part on next week's meeting of the US Federal Reserve, which must decide whether to raise interest rates amid this month's flurry of sometimes conflicting news about the state of the US economy.Todd Leone, head of listed trading at SG Cowen, said that the dithering on Wall Street was due in part to concerns over interest rates.""We've had a tremendous rally, up almost 700 points from the bottom,"" he said. ""People are really afraid to buy stocks because they are worried about the Fed [raising rates].""Johnson & Johnson fell 2.3 per cent to $60.43 following reports that the healthcare group was in advanced merger talks with Guidant, a leading maker of stents used to combat cardiovascular disease. Shares in Guidant jumped 5.3 per cent to $72.41 on news of the deal, which would strengthen both groups' positions against rival stent makers Medtronic and Boston Scientific. Medtronic fell 0.7 per cent to $48.94, while Boston Scientific shares fell 1.2 per cent to $34.10.Colgate-Palmolive shares rose 8.2 per cent to $50.07 after the consumer products company announced that it would make sweeping workforce cuts and close one third of its factories as part of a restructuring programme.IBM slipped 1.7 per cent to $96.06 amid continuing talks about selling a majority stake in its PC division to Lenovo, the Chinese computer group, for as much as $2bn.Elsewhere in the computer sector, Hewlett-Packard shares fell 1.3 per cent to $21.05 after Carly Fiorina, the chief executive, declined to comment on the company's progress in meeting financial targets.The S&P Insurance index fell 0.8 per cent to 311.91 as investors digested a New York jury's decision to consider the hijacked airliner attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center on September 11 2001 as two separate events. The decision, which came after the close of trading on Monday, means that Larry Silverstein, the ground zero leaseholder, could get twice the payout from his policies.Shares in the St Paul Travelers Companies, the parent company of Travelers Indemnity and Gulf Insurance, two of the nine insurers involved in the decision, fell 1.3 per cent to $36.83, while shares in Hartford Financial Services, the parent of another WTC insurer, fell 0.7 per cent to $65.12.Kroger, the grocer, rose 1.6 per cent to $16.26 as it reported its quarterly earnings, which fell short of analysts' expectations.Sirius Satellite Radio, the satellite radio group, shot up 11.4 per cent to $9.01 on news of a new distribution deal with Toyota.Sirius's rival, XM Satellite Radio, which also has a Toyota deal, rose 1.8 per cent to $38.41."
97;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2004-10-19T21:01:06Z;Insurance probe spooks Wall Street;;"Wall Street stocks closed lower on Tuesday as Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, gave markets an early taste of Halloween with his broadening probe of the insurance industry.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to 9,897.55 while the broader S&P 500 index eased 1 per cent to 1,103.23. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite lost 0 .7 per cent to 1,922.90.On the anniversary of the 1987 market crash, fears that worse was yet to come in Mr Spitzer's investigation of insurance brokers and health insurance groups chilled any early optimism from a falling crude oil price and encouraging results from several leading companies.Arthur Hogan, chief US markets analyst at Jefferies & Co, said: ""We're seeing the Spitzer effect on the insurance stocks, where the market is throwing the baby out with the bath water . Then there is the election …we don't like it being so close with two weeks to go, we're a forward pricing mechanism and we don't know what to price now.""He added that the sell-off was likely to be exaggerated and a rebound likely once markets got a clearer picture of the effects of Mr Spitzer's latest campaign against alleged corporat e malfeasance.Health insurance shares saw broad selling after one company confirmed it had received a subpoena from Mr Spitzer's office. The insurer in question, Cigna, saw shares trim 10.3 per cen t off their value to $59.73 as UnitedHealthcare lost 9.3 per cent to $66.50 while Aetna fell 11.8 per cent to $86.17.The insurance groups initially cited by Mr Spitzer continued to suffer as Marsh & McLennan was 5.8 per cent off at $24.10 while ACE lost 6.4 per cent to $33.10.The ""Spitzer effect"" trumped comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who said that ""household finances appear to be in reasonably good shape"". Some bearish market wa tchers have long warned about excessive household indebtedness in the US and a possible retrenchment in consumer demand.Among the key stocks battling the downward pressures on the the market yesterday was IBM, the world's biggest computer company, which saw shares rise 4 per cent to $89.37 after it reported after the market close on Monday. Flat net profit was eclipsed by the company's optimistic outlook, as net revenue rose 9 per cent in the quarter. Excluding costs associated with a legal settlement, net profit was b etter than forecasts.Texas Instruments,which also reported after the close on Monday, beat expectations with its quarterly earnings and its shares rose 6.9 per cent to $22.55.EMC shares rose 1.1 per cent to $12.28 after the data storage company reported an in-line 37 per cent rise in third-quarter profit as it gained market share.Ford Motor announced higher-than-expected quarterly profit as gains for the company's finance division offset losses at its auto unit. The company raised its full-year earnings outlook and the shares edged off 3.4 per cent to $12.93.Ford's news came after rival General Motors announced sharp cost-cutting decisions at its European operations in a bid to stem losses there. GM shares were 2.3 per cent lower at $38 on the Dow.Shares in McDonald's, another component of the blue-chip stock gauge, eased 0.7 per cent to $29 after the restaurant operator reported a 42 per cent rise in profits.Leapfrog Enterprises cut its quarterly earnings outlook and sent shares 34.1 per cent lower to $11.99 as the educational toy company cited a challenging industry environment.Boston Scientific shares lost 5.6 per cent to $35.71 as investors were disappointed by its guidance even after earnings grew amid strong demand for the group's medical devices.Economic news gave a mixed reading of the recovery in the US. Consumer prices rose by 0.2 per cent last month, taking the annualised inflation rate in September to 2.5 per cent, but a sharp jump in lodging costs pushed core inflation up a surprise 0.3 per cent.Stephen Gallagher, the chief US economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said the data were unlikely to cause the Fed to interrupt its course of steady increases in interest rates. He added that employment trends would be more important in that process."
98;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2004-09-01T20:40:41Z;Wall Street drifts as summer torpor continues;;US stocks were lacklustre on Wednesday as Wall Street dealt with one of its slowest weeks of the year. The main focus was on monthly employment data due out on Friday.The few market watchers who were not on summer vacation attributed the late rise in the Tuesday session to the so-called “window dressing” of portfolios by fundmanagers at the end of August.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had eased less than 0.1 per cent to 10,168.83 while the S&P 500 index was 0.2 per cent higher at 1,105.92. The technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent higher at 1,850.41.Blue-chip stocks were stoic in the face of news that manufacturing activity slowed in August slightly more than expected. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity fell to 59 last month, from 62 in June, to a level that still shows expansion for the industrial sector.While some economists said the data suggest growth in manufacturing has peaked, others noted that they still pointed to an expansion in industrial employment last month.Stocks also appeared to shrug off a sharp rebound in crude oil futures, focusing instead on their other obsession the jobs report due on Friday. The job creation data are expected to drive trading once investors return from their holidays next week. Amid evidence of slowing growth in the US, economists hope for a rebound in hiring after two disappointing months for job creation.Not only are the jobs data expected to set the tone of trading on Wall Street but also that of economic debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, his challenger. The two enter a decisive phase in their electoral campaign with Friday''s data being the second-last jobs report before the poll.On the corporate front, Fairchild Semiconductor added 3.7 per cent to $12.78 after the power-management chipmaker reiterated its sales outlook for the current quarter. While Fairchild said it expected no growth, the news assuaged fears of a slowdown in sales for the semiconductor sector.The outlook from Fairchild lifted Intel's shares 0.7 per cent to $21.43 on hopes the world's largest semiconductor company would also give an upbeat mid-quarter update to analysts and investors after Thursday's close.In the same sector, National Semiconductor added 1.8 per cent to $13.57 while Advanced Micro Devices was 2.4 per cent higher at $11.70. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 0.9 per cent.In the auto sector Ford Motor eased 1.5 per cent to $13.90 after it reported a 13 per cent decline in sales during August and announced a 6.8 per cent cut in fourth-quarter production. General Motors, which announced a 7 per cent drop in sales and its own output cut of 6.8 per cent, closed 0.2 per cent lower at $41.21.Declining auto sales follow news of declining consumer confidence and cast a pall over hopes that US consumers would continue to spend at a time when US businesses show no willingness to invest even though they have the capital to do so.Elsewhere, the shares of Forest Laboratories fell 8.4 per cent to $41.98 after the company said its experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease failed to produce results in clinical trials.Meanwhile, Boston Scientific shares added 7.1 per cent to $38.28 after the maker of medical devices said it regained market share in the wake of a recall of its Taxus heart device.Among its competitors, Medtronic added 0.4 per cent to $49.99 and Guidant put on 3.1 per cent to $61.66.In the internet sector Ebay rose 1.3 per cent to $87.63 after the online auctioneer announced it had bought the part of its South Korean affiliate it did not already own for about $530m in a bid to expand its presence in Asia.Verizon Communications shares moved 0.6 per cent higher to $39.50 amid reports by US media that the company was selling its Canadian phone directory business to Bain Capital for more than $1bn.
99;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2004-09-01T14:22:28Z;Boston Scientific reclaims market share;;Boston Scientific eased investor concern that its key new product was damaged from recalls this summer, saying the Taxus coronary stent reclaimed dominant market share levels seen before the recalls.The US medical device maker yesterday said August sales of its drug-coated Taxus stent accelerated and showed signs of recovery. It estimated that its US market share at the end of August was more than 65 per cent, compared with 56 per cent in July when fallout from the recall hit hardest. Total August Taxus sales fell to $200m from $207m in July.Sales forecasts for Taxus stents, small wire-mesh tubes inserted to prop open closing arteries, and permeated with a drug to help keep them from reclosing, also looked stronger than some analysts expected. Boston Scientific forecast Taxus sales of $594m-$608m in the third quarter, and $643m-$686m in the fourth quarter.?We believe the key metrics surround Taxus sales and market share - both of which are recovering nicely since the height of the recall,? said Tao Levy, analyst at Deutsche Bank.Investors breathed a sigh of relief, sending Boston Scientific's shares 6 per cent higher, or $2.04, to $37.77, in New York lunchtime trading.Since June, Boston Scientific issued several recalls for Taxus and another stent, Express 2 which is not drug-coated. Inserted by angioplasty using a balloon that inflates and expands the artery, the stent was recalled because some procedures hurt patients when the balloon did not deflate and became stuck.Boston Scientific reports one death and about 22 serious injuries related to balloon deflation on Taxus.It said it had identified and recalled the bad batches of stent systems, but US regulators at the Food and Drug Administration are investigating.The recall appeared to open the door for Johnson & Johnson, whose Cypher drug-coated stent was the first to market but was quickly overtaken by Taxus.Nevertheless, Boston Scientific warned on Wednesday that earnings per share this year would be $1.60-$1.65 per share, lower than Wall Street's expectations of $1.68. It estimated total sales at $5.5bn-$5.68bn, lower than expectations.But David Lothson, analyst at UBS, said the pace of Taxus US sales had returned. He said US sales averaged about $7.4m per day last month, compared with $7.6m per day in June, prior to the recall. ?We view the recovery of Taxus sales following the recall as excellent,? he said.
100;BSX;Boston Scientific Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
