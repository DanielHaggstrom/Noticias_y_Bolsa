0;ADI;Analog Devices;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Analog Devices to buy Linear Tech for about $14.8bn;;Analog Devices said on Tuesday that it will buy Linear Technology in a cash-and-stock deal that values the group at about $14.8bn.The deal marks the latest tie-up in the semiconductor industry. It comes just more than a week after Japan’s SoftBank said it would buy the UK’s Arm Holdings, a maker of smartphone chips, for £24.3bn.Last year, Singapore-based Avago acquired US rival Broadcom for $37bn in the largest acquisition seen in the technology sector since the late-1990s dotcom bubble, while Intel made its largest takeover after it acquired Altera, a maker of programmable processors, for $16.7bn.Analog Devices, which makes analog chips that convert real-world stimuli into digital signals that can be processed by computers, will pay Linear Technology $46 a share in cash and 0.2321 a share of its own stock — the equivalent of $60 a share. That compares to Monday’s closing price of $48.47.The shares had rallied as high as $62.49 on Tuesday after Bloomberg first reported that a deal could be imminent.
1;ADI;Analog Devices;2016-07-26T18:54:07Z;Linear Technology jumps on Analog bid approach;;Merger mania is hitting the chip making sector once again.Shares in Linear Technology surged by as much as 33 per cent to $64.42 a share on news that larger rival Analog Devices is in advanced talks to buy the company.Prior to this afternoon’s price movement, Linear had a market valuation of about $12bn compared to Analog’s $19bn.The bid approach – first reported by Bloomberg – sent shares of other semiconductor companies up sharply. At pixel time:Linear is due to report results after the market closes on Tuesday.
2;ADI;Analog Devices;2014-06-29T16:19:26Z;AMS / Dialog: poison Apple?;The companies don’t stand to gain much from this union;There must be something in the air for semiconductor companies. Cirrus Logic and Wolfson Electronics got together in April. Analog Devices and Hittite Microwave in June. Now AMS and Dialog are thinking about tying the knot.The couple have things in common: Dialog is a fabless chipmaker that sells power management chips used in iPhones and iPads. AMS, based in Austria, designs and produces semiconductors, with a focus on sensors. The companies bill this as a “merger of equals” in which AMS would potentially buy Dialog and incorporate its management. The bride price has not yet been agreed.Aside from their sheer desire to be together, the companies do not stand to gain much from this union. Sure, Dialog looks desirable, with revenue growing 40 per cent annually over the past three years, and an operating profit margin of 11 per cent. AMS is growing more slowly – with revenues up 22 per cent a year on average over the past three years – but it has nice fat margins and a deal would shrink these. Analysts are touting “diversification”, since there is little overlap between product lines. But this also means that cost savings are minimal. UBS estimates synergies of €20m in corporate costs, but a mere €5m from research and development. If cost savings were €25m, the deal would only be accretive to AMS shareholders if it were to buy Dialog at no premium.That doesn’t sound great for Dialog, but there is a reason the chipmaker might sell: customer diversification. Three quarters of Dialog’s revenues come from Apple components, versus one quarter for AMS. But a combined company would still be exposed, drawing 50 per cent of revenues from Apple. And investors are better at diversifying this risk anyway (by buying other stocks) than companies are.Talks between Dialog and AMS broke down once before – earlier this year when Dialog held out for a 10 per cent premium. It’s hard to see why they should sell themselves now for anything less.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex

the second quarter of this year.“The company has been buying its own stock high and is now selling it low. It’s not exactly a textbook strategy from a capital management perspective,” said Barton Crockett, an entertainment analyst at Lazard Capital.Elsewhere stocks fell on Tuesday, as a downward revision to US third-quarter growth figures put paid to hopes of a rally after Monday’s sell-off.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,188.04, stuck below 1,200, a level it breached for the first time in a month on Monday.With trading volumes light, Colin Cieszynski at CMC Markets warned the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday could drive further losses. “Getaway day traders may have closed out positions and be unwilling to take on new positions over an extended weekend,” he said.The Nasdaq Composite index was off just 0.1 per cent to 2,521.28, given ballast by Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, which was up 2 per cent to $376.51, after Jefferies said Apple had not cut orders to suppliers for iPads by as much as other research firms have suggested.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent per cent to 11,508.97.Hewlett-Packard closed down 0.8 per cent at $26.65. The computer maker fell as low $25.25 in early trading as investors reacted with dismay to the company’s pessimistic outlook for 2012.A downward adjustment to fiscal 2012 guidance had been widely expected, but the scale took analysts by surprise: new chief executive Meg Whitman predicted full-year earnings per share of $4, well below the $4.56 median analyst prediction, with the company downbeat on both consumer and business demand.Jeffrey Fidacaro, a computer analyst at Susquehanna, said HP had at least frontloaded bad news.”We believe this could provide a conservative floor to prudently set up the stock for estimate increases from here,” he told clients.Strong earnings boosted Medtronic. Shares in the medical research group surged 4.5 per cent to $34.75, after profits for the quarter ended October 28 jumped 50 per cent compared with the same period in 2010.Declining soup sales knocked Campbell’s, which fell 5.3 per cent to $31.84, as quarterly profits fell 4 per cent year on year.Starwood Hotels and Resorts slipped 4.7 per cent to $45.39 after Nomura analyst Harry Curtis, lowered earnings estimates, citing the company’s strong exposure to Europe. Starwood derives as much as 12 per cent of total earnings from the continent, twice as much as rivals such as Marriott International.Nvidia continued to benefit from widespread reports that it will supply semiconductors for the next generation of Apple MacBooks. Shares rose 3.1 per cent to $15.08 putting the stock up 8.3 per cent for the week, and only 3 per cent off for the year.Fellow semiconductor stock Analog Devices fell 3 per cent $33.32, after the company revealed the extent of the fall in orders through the third quarter.Gilead Sciences bounced back somewhat from its 10 per cent fall on Monday, as investors got over the initial shock of the $11bn price tag it agreed to pay for Pharmasset.The stock traded 6.9 per cent higher at $38.76, as analysts weighed up the long-term potential of the acquisition. “We believe that this makes a lot of sense and will provide Gilead with a highly synergistic asset with a very long tail,” Yaron Werber at Citigroup wrote to clients.Groupon fell 14.9 per cent to $20.07, within touching distance of its $20 debut price, with options traders buying puts for the right to sell the stock for as little as $13.Gold miner Newmont Mining prospered in market volatility yet again, up
0.8 per cent to $65.79, with bearish investors possibly seeking exposure to gold.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent, but the big US banks avoided hefty losses.Jefferies, whose European exposures and funding model have come in for intense scrutiny, was down 1.4 per cent to $10.06.The IntercontinentalExchange was up 1.5 per cent to $115.91, as the derivatives exchange benefited from negative sentiment towards its larger rival the CME Group.The CME was partially responsible for regulating MF Global, the broker-dealer which filed for bankruptcy at the start of the month. CME shares were 0.4 per cent lower at $240.57."
4;ADI;Analog Devices;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Energy and materials lift Wall Street;;Strong earnings from Dell buoyed related technology stocks and helped lift sentiment on Wall Street, pulling the wider markets into positive territory for the first time in three sessions.Dell was up 5.4 per cent to $16.75, making the stock one of the best performing on the S&P 500, after the company reported a 177 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.The better than expected jump in earnings came thanks to growth in sales to large businesses, which outweighed the weakness in sales to retail customers.Dell raised its earnings and revenue outlook for the year, in contrast to Hewlett-Packard, which lowered its forecast in the previous session as the weakness in consumer markets ate away at earnings.Shares in HP were down 9.7 per cent this week after falling another 1.1 per cent on Wednesday to $36.49.The results from Dell boosted related stocks in the computer hardware sector. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was up 2.5 per cent to $53.61, while Western Digital added 1.4 per cent to $36.82.Apple, the second most valuable company in the world by market capitalisation, gained 1.1 per cent to $339.87.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,340.68, its best day of trading in nearly a month. The index was helped higher by energy and materials stocks, which benefited from a rise in commodity prices.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 3.8 per cent to $48.62, helping the S&P materials index up 2.1 per cent. Marathon Oil, the energy group, added 3 per cent to $51.53 as the wider S&P energy index put on 2 per cent.The gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.7 per cent to 12,560.18 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 1.1 per cent to 2,815.The markets saw little reaction to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting in April which yielded no major surprises.The markets have been in a correctional phase since the beginning of the month, with the S&P 500 falling 1.7 per cent in the past few weeks. Sentiment has been weighed down by commodity price swings, European debt woes and worries about the end of QE2.The concerns have led to a classic “risk off” trade, with investors rotating away from cyclical stocks and into more defensive sectors.The S&P healthcare and utility sectors are up 3.2 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively this month while the energy and materials sectors are down 7.4 per cent and 5 per cent.The utility sector saw the day’s worst losses as the broader markets ticked up, prompting commentators to suggest this defensive rotation was coming to an end.“The defensive names have been overbought in the past few weeks and the riskier names have been oversold,” said Quincy Krosby, strategist for Prudential Financial.The retail sector was in focus after mixed results.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen fashion retailer, were up 3.4 per cent to $75.69 after the company reported a bigger than expected swing in first-quarter profits as margins and international sales improved.The stock is up more than 30 per cent so far this year.Target, the discount retailer, reported a 2.7 per cent rise in first-quarter profit thanks to better than expected results in its credit card businessBut the stock was 1.6 per cent lower to $49.96 as investors worried about the softer sales at its stores.Shares in Staples were hit by a strong reaction to the office-supply company’s first-quarter earnings.The stock was down 15.4 per cent to $16.63 after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results and lowered its full-year earnings forecast by 15 cents a share to $1.35-$1.45.Staples posted a profit of 28 cents a share or $198.2m, short of the 32 cents expected.The S&P retail sector was down 0.3 per cent.Shares in Analog Devices were up 5.9 per cent to $42.60 after the chipmaker reported a 45 per cent jump in second-quarter earnings and lifted its forecasts for the current quarter above expectations. The company raised its dividend.John Deere, the top manufacturer of farm equipment by revenue, reported healthy earnings and raised its full-year outlook due to growing demand for tractors from farmers benefiting from the commodity boom. But investors were hoping for more, and the stock was down 0.5 per cent to $86.50.
5;ADI;Analog Devices;2010-04-20T23:47:13Z;Enterprise promotion: profile of YTKO’s Bev Hurley;;“You helped me break the cycle of shit that has plagued my family”: it is not the most elegant plaudit to repeat to others about what you do. But, explains Bev Hurley, that was one single mother’s sincere expression of her feelings about a start-up programme run by Ms Hurley’s company, YTKO.The young woman’s own family had been beset by problems and relied on benefits, but she wanted to start a cleaning business. The YTKO scheme showed her how to get started and provided information, mentoring and a tiny amount of seed capital. Now that woman employs several other people, says Ms Hurley, who sees it as a test of success in business creation.“I am motivated by making a measurable difference – sometimes it is transformational for the individual, sometimes it is a bottom line impact in increased market share and sales,” says Bev Hurley.Ms Hurley is chief executive of YTKO, a Cambridge-based private company that specialises in commercialising innovation, especially in science and technology. Its clients include big high-technology companies such as Analog Devices, the semiconductor company, but under Ms Hurley’s leadership YTKO has also developed its expertise in supporting start-ups and entrepreneurs looking for growth.Compare the cleaning company founder’s words about the support she received with those of Helen Philippou, for example. She is a highly-educated scientist and the idea she wants to commercialise could save lives by reducing the harmful side­effects of anti-coagulants. Participating in the Yorkshire Enterprise Fellowship programme, run by YTKO to help turn the intellectual property generated among the region’s universities into business ideas, “changed my life”, she says. “I went from just thinking like an academic to thinking about commercialising my work.”“The point about both these women is that they have been transformed,” says Ms Hurley. What their different backgrounds shared was a lack of understanding of the commercial world, she adds. Ms Hurley, winner in the enterprise promotion category, says success in business “boils down to selling things to other people. As a country, we are fantastic at ideas, but people don’t ask: ‘Who will buy this? At what price? Will the business be sustainable and scalable?’”It is to YTKO’s advantage in enterprise promotion, Ms Hurley believes, that it is a commercial entity. “We can say to all our clients: ‘We understand what you are trying to do, because we are a thriving privately-owned company and we’ve been there ourselves’,” she says. In the public sector projects, she believes it is important to “know what works in a business sense, and we know how to work with people, not do things to people”.Her own personal career is stamped with entrepreneurialism – from setting up several companies, starting with a property developer, to working for a gold mining company in Canada. “It was like a mini­Klondike …exciting and very entrepreneurial,” she says.That experience stood her in good stead for her own ventures back in the UK and for thinking of creative ways to encourage others to be entrepreneurial.Setting up the Enterprising Women network, which was named by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills last year as one of the three best-practice programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, was one such project. “We have created a community at the heart of it, both face-to-face and online, so the portal offers resources ranging from mentoring, peer-support and ‘ask the expert’ to high-growth programmes,” she says.The innovative ideas generated for Enterprising Women are being transferred to other YTKO schemes. “We deliver information sessions and training in what people would think are really unlikely places – but it is where the client groups feel at home,” says Ms Hurley. Venues may include the pub or the Salvation Army as well as job centres and mum and toddler groups.YTKO’s Plymouth team will shortly be dressing up in long-life lightbulb outfits and giving away bulbs – representing the “lightbulb” moment of having a business idea – in the main shopping centre to raise awareness there.Ms Hurley’s busy schedule also includes operating as a business angel and voluntary activities including judging business plans and mentoring.“I really enjoy being able to help people develop their business ideas,” she says.
6;ADI;Analog Devices;2009-05-21T02:37:21Z;BofA capital raising lifts mood on Wall Street;;US stocks rebounded on Wednesday morning following moderate losses during the previous session as investors welcomed the news that Bank of America has successfully raised $13.5bn in recent days through issuing new stock.The bank’s shares fell overnight on reports that it was offering an extra 825m shares at $10 each, but rose again in early trade after the company said it had been successful in selling a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last Friday. This will go towards making up the $33.9bn in extra capital the government has asked the company to raise following the stress tests on bank balance sheets. After half an hour of trade, the stock was up 8 per cent at $12.15.Other banking stocks also performed well. Citigroup climbed 4 per cent to $3.92 while JPMorgan advanced 1.7 per cent to $36.40.PNC, meanwhile, rose 0.4 per cent to $43.44 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money, but would do so “over the next couple of years”. This came in contrast to moves from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days to pay back the government as soon as possible.But Wall Street was less encouraged by the news that Regions Financial wanted to raise $1.25bn through offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s tests. Investors worried about stock dilution and the shares fell 3.8 per cent to $5.04.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global warned the stellar rises seen in financial stocks since the rally began in March might not last. “The bank shares have lost a catalyst to rally near term as news on TARP repayment may not be known until June 8, and the credit card bill of rights is likely to become law and create a headwind to profits,” he wrote.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.6 per cent to 92251 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 8,576.56 points and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 1.5 per cent to 1,760.7 points.The markets were also supported by energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel. In early trade, US crude was $1.61 higher at $61.26 per barrel. Shares in Chevron gained 1.4 per cent to $66.80 while Exxon Mobil picked up 0.9 per cent to $71.12.Hewlett Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after it reported earnings that were in line with analysts’ estimates. Its shares fell in early trade, losing 3.7 per cent to $35.22 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below what Wall Street is currently expecting.Its rival Dell also suffered the effect of the negative outlook for the computer sales industry, and its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $11.51.But chip manufacturers lent strength to technology stocks after Analog Devices beat Wall Street’s estimates with its quarterly profits, and said it would also make more profit for the full year than currently predicted. The company said there had been strength in sales to telecoms infrastructure customers, and its shares jumped 13.5 per cent to $23.35.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 9.2 per cent to $13.55 and 7.9 per cent to $4.74 respectively.Wall Street was also watching for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJ’s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits.Target’s shares gained 4.6 per cent to $43.85 after it made $0.69 in earnings per share on the back of tight cost controls and a profitabkle credit card business. Consensus estimates were for $0.60.BJ’s beat analysts’ predictions with its profits and raised its full-year profit outlook as consumers looked to cut costs by buying staples at wholesale prices. But the shares slipped 1 per cent to $37.70 as the company said it expected second quarter sales to fall.Procter & Gamble added to confidence over future consumer behaviour after Barclays upgraded the company, saying its sales stood to recover as and when the economy improved. The shares rose 2.4 per cent to $54.23.This gave some relief to the sector after figures released on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence unexpectedly fell last week.Meanwhile Deere & Co, which makes agricultural equipment, lost ground despite beating analysts’ expectations with its second quarter profits, after the company was forced to lower its full-year profit outlook as construction sales continue to drop. The shares were 4.9 per cent down at $45.96.European stocks were up early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was edged 0.1 per cent higher to 872.63 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, as the FTSE Asia-Pacific index gained 0.5 per cent to 189.19 points.Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 2 basis points to 0.867 per cent while that on the 10-year Treasury note was flat at 2.243 per cent.The dollar continued to fall against major currencies early in New York, losing 1 per cent against the euro to $1.3766.Gold was trading $1.43 higher at $938.24 per troy ounce.
7;ADI;Analog Devices;2009-05-20T20:30:06Z;Fed forecast sours Wall Street mood;;"US stocks suffered a late sell-off on Wednesday as a downward revision to growth figures and the progress of a bill to overhaul credit card lending helped tip the markets into negative territory.Banks led the selling after the Fed’s open market committee released the minutes from its last meeting, in which it lowered its predictions for GDP and raised those for unemployement.They saw another dip on reports that President Barack Obama was ready to sign the credit card bill, which would limit fees and impose new restrictions on when lenders can raise interest rates for risky customers.American Express lost 3.3 per cent to $23.98, while JPMorgan, which also has a sizeable credit card lending arm, gave up 3.5 per cent to $34.55.Oher banks also fell back after participating in the early rally.Regions Financial said it wanted to raise $1.25bn by offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s stress tests on banks.Investors worried about stock dilution and its shares fell 6.7 per cent to $4.89.PNC, meanwhile, fell 2.8 per cent to $42.06 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money but do so “over the next couple of years”.This contrasted with statements from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days that they would pay back the government as soon as possible.The falls reversed earlier earlier gains after the market took confidence from higher commodities prices and Bank of America’s success in raising capital.Bank of America’s shares rose after the company said it had sold a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last
Friday. The stock closed up 2.1 per cent at $11.49.“Bank of America’s rise is a kneejerk reaction and we are not seeing that replicated across the banking sector,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.5 per cent to 903.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average list 0.6 per cent to 8,422.04. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,727.84.Broader support came from energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel following Department of Energy figures showing US oil inventories fell last week.Schlumberger gained 1.9 per cent to $55.04, while rival ConocoPhillips picked up
0.6 per cent to $46.19.A rise in general commodity prices and the falling dollar also boosted materials companies. Newmont Mining, which produces gold, gained 4.5 per cent to $45.55, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines gold and copper, rose 1 per cent to $50.Hewlett-Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after reporting earnings in line with analysts’ estimates.Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.67 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below current consensus predictions.Its rival, Dell, also suffered from the negative outlook for the computer sales industry and its shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $11.18.But chip manufacturers lent strength to the technology sector after Analog Devices’ profits beat Wall Street’s estimates and the company said it would earn more for the full year than currently predicted.The company said there had been strength in sales to telecommunications infrastructure customers and
its shares jumped 15.7 per cent to $23.80.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 6.6 per cent to $13.23 and 2.5 per cent to $4.50, respectively.Investors also watched for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJâ€™s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits. Target’s shares gained 2.4 per cent to $42.94 after it beat expectations on the back of tight cost controls and a profitable credit card business.BJ’s also beat predictions as consumers looked to buy staples at wholesale prices. But its shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $36.37 after the company said it expected second-quarter sales to decline.On a quiet day with low volumes, however, most investors were not overly worried by the losses.“It looks like there has been a continual but moderate consolidation of the big gains on Monday,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo advisers."
8;ADI;Analog Devices;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
9;ADI;Analog Devices;2007-05-25T20:30:19Z;Wall St buoyed by deal activity;;US stocks tested record territory this week, only to falter as the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year dimmed.Blue chips and the S&P 500 established their first weekly decline since March, while technology stocks accrued a third week of losses.The S&P rose 0.55 per cent to close at 1,515.73 on Friday, a fall of 0.5 per cent this week.It traded above its March 2000 record close of 1,527.46 on the first four days of the week but could not maintain the bullish momentum.Higher bond yields hurt utility stocks, down 4.3 per cent this week but still up 11 per cent this year.Technology stocks were also laggards as the semiconductor sector closed lower for the week.Analysts at Bespoke In­vest­ment Group said a positive close for the S&P on Friday would entail “entering the summer months with a set-up that has typically been the most positive for stocks”. Since 1950, the index has had an average gain of 6.28 per cent by September and only one down period out of nine after rising on the Friday before Memorial Day. In contrast, when the S&P has closed lower ahead of the holiday, “the average return over the summer was -1.23 per cent”.On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.75 per cent to 2,557.19, for a fall of 0.05 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent higher at 13,507.28 on Friday, having set an all-time intra-day peak of 13,624.55 on Thursday. For the week, the Dow was down 0.4 per cent, having risen in each of the previous seven weeks.Concern that the S&P’s rally since late March had come too far, too fast was apparent in the price action underpinning stocks this week. The June S&P futures contract set its closing high for the week of 1,527.90 on Monday.
