0;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2019-11-22T05:00:13Z;Don’t be fooled by the growth in global datacentre companies;The specialist groups risk being sidelined when big cloud companies start talking to each other;You know the way serious money thinks. Pick a big trend, such as protectionism, the dollar’s overvaluation, gold or data moving to the cloud. Then use the financial markets to have the trend make money for you, say by picking an ETF or the best-rated securities in a sector.Take, for example, data and applications moving to the cloud. You could buy one of the big tech names, say Amazon or Google. The smarter thing to do though, is to pack your portfolio with one, or several, of the top datacentre companies that major companies or governments use when they move to the cloud. Why, even Facebook and Apple turn to specialised providers rather than keep their apps and data on-premises. You would be profiting from the future.No, no and no. Remember, the point of financial markets is not to make you money, but to devise ever more elaborate ways to take your money. The more clever you are, the more intricate your mistakes can be.Having said that, the growth of the global datacentre companies is a real trend. Take two of the top specialists, Equinix and Digital Realty. Both take the form of US real estate investment trusts or Reits. So they pay out about half (adjusted) cash flow from operations as dividends, after paying for maintenance, however they define that.As the companies invest more in their businesses, with the certainty or hope that Facebook, Ford or Acme will “migrate” their data and apps to servers in the datacentres, they raise more funds with equity offerings or debt issues. The base rent they charge is quoted in kilowatts, a reference to their huge power requirements.The major users are gradually concentrating their IT spending in the largest and most capable datacentre companies, which have global “offerings” and the most possible interconnectivity with multiple telecoms providers. So the market share of the top groups is increasing.This is reflected in equity prices and debt ratings. Over the past year, Equinix has had the better performance, with its shares up about half. It is more focused on “retail”, or service and interconnexion-intensiveness. Digital Realty was the investment grade datacentre, serving “wholesale” customers, sophisticated users who just want cheap data warehouse space.The two are leapfrogging each other’s competitive advantage with big customers. Equinix cracked the investment grade barrier last month and has already exchanged debt costing up to 5.75 per cent with new notes, some yielding just 2.625 per cent. On October 30, Digital Realty counter-attacked Equinix’s stronger European market position by striking an $8.4bn deal to buy Interxion, a Dutch datacentre company.Demand for capacity has been shifting from “co-location” customers, mostly traditional corporations who want to move their own servers next to others in the warehouse, to “hyperscale” cloud-based companies.What a fun multiplayer online war game. Is there anything that could go wrong?Yes. If you are a public investor, your money is getting a commission to be a hero — probably a dead one in the end. Do you think Mark Zuckerberg is renting your datacentre so he can make you rich?According to real estate services firm CBRE, in the US in the first half of this year, the secondary market price for datacentre megawatts declined in Boston, Seattle, and Minneapolis, and was already down to a dirt-cheap $100-$130/MW in the giant Northern Virginia market. No wonder Equinix and Digital Realty are battling over the less developed European market.A lot of presently valuable leases will need rolling over by the time those investment grade notes mature in the middle of the next decade. If those customers want to use AI applications, you may need to install up to ten times the power access.As for the demand from co-location space bought by IT departments, well, that may largely go away. “Co-location is only temporarily driving demand for datacentres. It’s a holding area. Eventually that will move,” says Sid Nag, a vice-president for cloud research at Gartner Group.And what about the fast growing requirement for “edge” datacentre space outside the main hubs? According to Mr Nag: “The edge issue has always been about latency [the response time lag caused in part by distance]. The dark hole there is the provision of 5G mobile service. The [mobile providers] are going to create some tectonic shifts in the edge cloud.” And under your shiny, almost-new edge datacentre.Also, the large cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft have been using the expensive interconnexions offered by datacentres to connect to each other. Eventually, Mr Nag says, “the cloud providers will talk to each other, without the datacentres’ interconnexions.”Hey, sorry about your investment in datacentres!
1;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2018-10-19T10:30:00Z;Data in the cloud falls back to earth;;Any child can tell you the data world is moving to the cloud. The cloud has to live somewhere, as in a datacentre. Not all of those are owned by Amazon, Microsoft, NTT or China Telecom. So if I am an infrastructure or property company, how do I get into such a high-growth business? It does sound better than a European bank headquarters in the City of London, or high-end apartments on East 57th Street.As luck would have it, there are people ready to sell you their datacentres, such as telecom companies or the smaller independent owners of co-location services. They know that, while the past decade has seen an extraordinary boom in IT capex, the corporate world is reining in tech spending.The past few years have been good for co-located datacentre companies, which rent serviced rack-and-cage space to server owners. The scramble to find such space has benefited companies such as Equinix and Digital Realty Trust, the two largest independent co-located datacentre companies.Both were run as real estate investment trusts, which in a declining rate environment was a cheap way to raise the gobs of capital consumed by the trade. For a while that worked well. Equinix shares rose about 10-fold in the 10 years to November. If you had bought Digital Realty post-crisis, by this August you would have made more than 3.5 times your investment. And, of course, as Reits, both pay out post-capex cash flow as dividends.Over the past 12 months, though, despite both companies still having double-digit revenue and cash-flow growth, their equity has been weak. Equinix’s share price has declined by 12 per cent and Digital Realty’s is down a tenth. You could ascribe some weakness to the rise in interest rates affecting income vehicles such as Reits. Considering, though, that Equinix yields just 2.22 per cent and Digital Realty 3.64 per cent, and that Reit prices generally have increased, we should look beyond the yield curve.The truth is datacentres are a demanding business. As one industry veteran says: “This is capital intensive and you have to deliver service to a customer at “five nines” reliability (99.999 per cent). You need access to (property) in the right place, electrical substation access and redundant connectivity to lots of (telecoms) carriers. You also need co-location with ‘hyperusers’ such as Amazon and Google.”That is a fair description of what a few companies such as Equinix and Digital Realty are able to offer but investors seem worried about future revenue growth.According to Gartner, the growth in total spending by IT departments on datacentres will decline from 6 per cent this year to 1.6 per cent next year. This should accelerate industry consolidation as smaller datacentre providers lose market share.Datacentres can be thought of as similar to shopping centres. Hyperusers such as Amazon or Google can demand favourable pricing as “anchor tenants” for smaller corporate customers who want low latency in their interaction with the cloud giants. Many customers are also willing to pay for access to multiple telecommunications providers, or even direct connections within the centres to other customers, such as major suppliers, banks or distributors.That is why US telecoms companies such as AT&T and Verizon have arranged to sell their in-house datacentres to independents who can offer interconnection neutrality and co-location with other customers. AT&T, for example, has agreed to sell its datacentres to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners and, in turn, is outsourcing some of its requirements to Oracle.In time these trends should favour larger independent operators, which should, ultimately, benefit from buying smaller companies that cannot charge premium prices.The challenge will be to generate the capital to get to that promised land. In the first half of this year, for example, Equinix earned $840m in net cash from operating activities, but spent $910m on all property, plant and equipment, along with $830m on business acquisitions.This is not as dire a situation as that which the owners of “dark fibre” optical cable faced in the years after the dotcom bust. The better datacentres are running at 85 per cent or 90 per cent of capacity.As data and applications become more portable across platforms, large users will migrate to the most effective points of the cloud. Those will include independent datacentres with the densest interconnections, most desirable co-tenants and low latency for the customer.It will not include interlopers such as garden-variety private equity and infrastructure funds. You have to know what you are doing.
2;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2020-04-24T21:25:54+0000;Verizon to sell 24 data centres to Equinix for $3.6bn;;Equinix said on Tuesday that it will buy two dozen data centres from Verizon Communications, the US telecoms group, for $3.6bn.The all-cash deal consists of 29 data centre buildings across 15 metropolitan areas, spanning from Bogotá to New York.“This unique opportunity complements and extends Equinix’s strategy to expand our global platform. It enables us to enhance cloud and network density to continue to attract enterprises, while expanding our presence in the Americas,” said Equinix chief executive Steve Smith.Data centres play a fundamental role in the modern internet by allowing companies to host servers at geographically-important locations without needing to open their own facilities.The move by many consumers and businesses to shift their software usage from desktops into the cloud has further bolstered the importance of such centres.The market is highly-competitive, with groups like Rackspace, Amazon and Google all competing. The deal that is expected to close in mid-2017 will bring Equinix’s global footprint to 175 data centres.Shares of Verizon and Equinix were little changed in pre-market trading.
3;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2016-02-10T11:54:42Z;Relocations to rough-edged challenger cities is on the rise;Expats coping with second-tier city assignments share experiences and tips on frontier life;"When Vandana Saxena Poria moved to India to found Get Through Guides, a professional education company, she checked out the obvious locations in which to start a business — Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore — only to settle upon little-noticed Pune. It was a choice that baffled her family and even the British High Commission. But, standing on street corners observing motorcyclists whizzing by, the British-born accountant sensed that, with its large student population and burgeoning tech base, Pune was a city on the rise.A decade on, Pune continues to progress. Power cuts, once a daily annoyance, are a fading memory and the opening of several well-equipped hospitals has made finding high-quality healthcare straightforward. Yet in some respects, this city of 5.5m people is still playing catch-up.“Among expat parents, the quality of schools is the number one complaint,” says the mother-of-two: families posted here are looking for an international curriculum. “It’s as though the teachers are still learning, because they don’t have the experience of teachers in Delhi and Mumbai.”Yet Pune and cities like it play an outsized role. About 400 emerging market cities will contribute almost half of growth in global gross domestic product before 2025, analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute finds.On the frontline of development, these challenger cities are advancing, yet retain rough edges. They may lack the cosmopolitan populations and amenities of first-tier cities: world-class hospitals, international schools, robust power supplies, and places where expats can stock up on favourite foods or hang out with compatriots.Expats, returnees and global mobility managers agree that frontier working has its pleasures and pains, which can be a culture shock for those who have not anticipated the lack of home comforts.“If you imagine wanting to grab a meal, or a beer, or even watch a TV programme, all those things are impossible unless you can speak and read Chinese,” says one British automotive executive, recently returned from a third-tier manufacturing city in China. By contrast, in Shanghai, he knew where to find western brands and English-speaking sales assistants.Ms Saxena Poria found she could manage with English and some Hindi, but without Marathi, the local language, Pune’s culture eluded her. So she took lessons from her staff in order to experience the local Marathi theatre for which Pune is renowned.It is not only language skills that divide leading cities from their neighbours, their mores may differ too. Sam Sawers, an auditor with PwC in London, contrasts the domesticity of Chennai, where he spent two years, with cosmopolitan Bangalore. “In Chennai, a lot of socialising revolves around family and the temple. Drinking alcohol is a bit of a taboo.” Such nuances should be heeded, says Tim Willis, a director at security specialists International SOS and Control Risks. “In a main city you may be able to get away with things which in a secondary city could cause difficulties.” Examples include wearing a skimpy sundress or displaying affection as a gay couple.Will the secondees adapt? Before sending staff to emerging cities, it is crucial to ask: “Does this person have the cultural agility, as well as the business skills, to succeed?” says Max Newbigging, global mobility manager at Old Mutual Group.In Chennai, Mr Sawers missed having the freedom to jump on a tube train and head out after work. The patchiness of Chennai’s public transport and its gridlocked traffic made “travelling even small distances totally frustrating”. So he adopted a new routine: cooking chapatti suppers and immersing himself in novels and podcasts. Gradually, these quiet evenings became a pleasure that left him freer — and with funds — to explore South Asia at weekends.Back at base, networking is key. Knowing people in the know — about where to find a lawyer or a hairdresser capable of putting highlights in blond hair — can make a strange city feel less strange. As a business owner, Ms Saxena Poria advises newly arrived companies to join their national chamber of commerce or business group. If none exists, start one, as she did.Virtual communities come into their own in cities that lack sizeable expat populations, and linking employee diasporas digitally can help lone secondees feel less isolated, says Tracy Figliola, who heads global mobility at Equinix, a data centre company.And relocation experts say one size never fits all. When designing expat packages for rising cities, it is important to reflect the local reality, not simply apply a template devised for bigger cities in the region.For Jacqui Gray, a retail sourcing professional, the gulf in clinical standards between well and less developed cities became stark when a hospital in Dhaka, where she was working, proposed a treatment that would have left her son permanently lame after a broken leg.A frantic search uncovered an airline that allowed him to fly flatbed to Bangkok, where his leg was repaired. Otherwise, Ms Gray would have faced chartering a plane, as her insurance did not include medical evacuation. “Without the right level of insurance, your recovery can be compromised,” she reflects.Organisations must balance their duty of care with consideration for personal preferences, which is why it is important to allow secondees to visit unfamiliar destinations, says Ivette Rohrbach, who heads talent mobility at Grant Thornton International.She cites a British employee and his fiancée who were moved to Belize by the business. Initially they had planned to live in the company’s compound, which resembled a country club. It was only when they visited that they realised its location would prevent the fiancée from working and limit her social circle to other spouses, most of whom were stay-at-home mothers. “So they found less fancy accommodation in town that allowed her a life of her own,” Ms Rohrbach says.On the upside, Professor Nick Miles, recently returned from running the University of Nottingham’s China campus in Ningbo, notes that organisations shape the cities they inhabit. While in the port city south of Shanghai, he met local officials who were keen to discuss actions the city could take, such as recruiting English-speaking doctors and nurses, to attract global companies.For some, participating in a city’s growing prosperity and sophistication is reward enough. As he says goodbye to his wife and six-year-old daughter in Johannesburg for a stint in Kinshasa, Tichaona Makonese, a managing director with Old Mutual, is buoying himself up with the knowledge that he is going into an insurance market that until now has operated as a state monopoly.“That’s an opportunity that comes once, if at all, in a lifetime,” he says.For Ms Saxena Poria, who has Indian heritage, the desire to be part of
Pune’s ascent is both personal and commercial. “For me, being part of India’s rise is the most exciting opportunity on the planet.”"
4;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2015-05-29T16:24:45Z;Telecity and Equinix: plugged in;Data centres have become key utilities for the world’s businesses;This week’s new members of the “this tech boom is different” club: data centre operators. They were around last time, of course, overexpanding at the turn of the century before anyone really knew what to do with the Internet and cloud services were still a dream. But today cloud services are everywhere, and big businesses of all kinds — not just in the tech sector — want data storage near their offices.So a land grab for data centres is under way. On Friday US-listed Equinix said it would acquire Telecity of the UK for £2.3bn in cash and shares. The latter had considered a merger with its Dutch rival Interxion.But combining with the larger Equinix makes more sense as Telecity’s shareholders receive the consolidation benefits, plus access to the US market. The two fit reasonably well as there are not many geographic overlaps. Equinix, meanwhile, will enhance its position in the UK, Finland and Italy. Regulatory issues may be less of a problem than how quickly Equinix, recently converted into a tax-efficient real estate investment trust, can shift Telecity’s assets into this structure.Telecity shareholders will bag a 35 per cent premium to the undisturbed share price, equivalent to 28 times this year’s estimated earnings (which are already near seven-year highs) plus some cash up front. That certainly trumps the risk of earnings dilution from Telecity’s mooted all-share combination with Interxion.Data centres have become key utilities for the world’s businesses. Equinix is betting that this time really is different.E-mail the Lex team at lex@ft.com
5;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Equinix to buy Telecity for £2.35bn;Demand for cloud computing sparks latest in string of mergers among data centre operators;Equinix, the largest US data centre group by value, is set to win a key battle over the future of Europe’s cloud computing market by acquiring the equity of UK’s Telecity in a deal worth £2.35bn.The cash-and-shares deal will create the largest data centre company in Europe and comes three months after Telecity had agreed to merge with Dutch competitor Interxion in a £2.2bn deal. On Friday, Telecity said it had abandoned talks with the Dutch group.Data centre companies are competing to tap into soaring demand for new internet services and storage, fuelled by the surge in mobile devices and cloud computing.The bid gives each Telecity shareholder 572.5p in cash and 0.03 of Equinix shares per Telecity share.The deal represents a premium of 34.9 per cent on Telecity’s closing share price from February 10, the last business day before Telecity announced its proposed merger with Interxion.Telecity shareholders will own about 10 per cent of the combined entity.John Hughes, chairman of Telecity who will join the Equinix board, told the Financial Times that a merger with its US rival presented the better option for its shareholders.“It’s like getting married, you need both parties to be ready at the same point in time,” he said. “Somehow, somebody has to ask the other.”“We’ve spoke extensively to all of our major shareholders and there is a great groundswell of support for this transaction.”Stephen Smith, chief executive of Equinix, said his company had also considered making an offer for Interxion, but decided that Telecity provided a better fit.“We’ve always known the customer base, the asset quality, the team and culture fit, the complimentary locations and the brand recognition of Telecity were superior to Interxion,” said Mr Smith.$15.3bnMarket value of Equinix after 35% share price rise in 12 months“Quite frankly, they have both been on the game board for us for some time. Once we decided the timing was right to extend ourselves and make ourselves bigger and broader in Europe, we felt it was the right time [to bid for Telecity].”Analysts echoed this view. Cavendish wrote in a note that this “looks a deal for both sides”, while analysts at Megabuyte said it was “no great surprise that Telecity should plump for a bid from Equinix over the Interxion merger given the share price premium on offer”.Both added that given the wave of consolidation in the sector, Interxion could become an acquisition target for other large data centre groups such as Digital Realty of the US.Cavendish suggested that Equinix may itself look again at the Dutch group. “You would expect Equinix to be thinking hard now about further European consolidation with the for-now jilted Interxion perhaps returning as a target in the near future,” it said.Data centres have become key utilities for the world’s businessesContinue readingTelecity was founded by Mike Kelly, an academic at the University of Manchester who left the company in 2007. It expanded through acquisitions under Mike Tobin, its former chief executive, who quit the company abruptly last year.For big global groups such as Equinix, the UK company represents one of the few remaining routes to increasing market share in Europe.Equinix, founded in 1998, makes a significant proportion of its revenues from providing data storage for financial services companies, a sector that Telecity had been reluctant to push into under the management of Mr Tobin.The US group already holds a strong position in Europe, operating critical data centres in places such as Slough, southwest of London. Telecity will give it inroads into financial centres including London’s Docklands district and Amsterdam.Shares in Equinix have risen 35 per cent over the past 12 months to give the company a market value of $15.3bn.It recently changed its corporate structure to that of a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which gives it substantial tax advantages over many of its international rivals.Telecity’s Mr Tobin was credited with transforming the company, which took shape through the mergers of three small British data centre companies in the late 1990s, into a significant global player.Known for an unconventional leadership style, he once published a management book entitled Forget Strategy. Senior executives have described corporate events that involved being “kidnapped” by former KGB agents, swimming with sharks and spending a night in an ice hotel.Mr Tobin now holds only a 0.3 per cent stake in the group, with banks and asset managers comprising its main shareholders, according to Bloomberg.
6;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2015-05-07T22:27:51Z;Equinix / Telecity: clear connection;Consolidation among data centre companies will favour the biggest;"Who put the “inter” in internet? It is not a rhetorical question. Interconnection companies operate the data centres that connect one network to another (say, Comcast to Verizon). This allows the seamless exchange of data across the interwebs, to use a non-technical term. Interconnection is hot right now: companies are growing fast and commanding rich valuations and the sector is undergoing a fiercely competitive round of consolidation.Equinix, one of the biggest global interconnection companies, has now jumped in the ring by bidding £11.45 per share for Telecity, a UK-based rival. Equinix is already bigger (in terms of sales) and faster growing than Telecity, but its bid could break up Telecity’s planned merger with a third company, Interxion, which would have created a formidable European rival. Equinix’s previous acquisitions have been advantageous, such as its 2009 purchase of Switch and Data, which helped expand its data centre footprint overnight. Still, Equinix shareholders seem underwhelmed by its Telecity play. It is expensive, valuing the smaller rival at $4bn, or 14 times this year’s expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. But the deal would be accretive to shareholders of Equinix in 2016, even if there were no cost savings, according to Evercore.The board of Telecity has two options: accept the deal, or reject it and proceed with the Interxion merger. The Equinix offer is 55 per cent cash so it offers the certainty of immediate reward and upside if the acquisition is a success. If the board goes with option two, acquiring Interxion in an all-stock deal, the value creation occurs further in the future. Oppenheimer calculates that Telecity-Interxion would be valued at $6bn and trade at 11.5 times 2015 earnings; whereas Telecity-Equinix would be worth $23bn, nearly 15 times earnings. The latter seems a safer bet for Telecity. As consolidation makes these companies even more interconnected, bigger may be better.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
7;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2015-05-07T19:07:12Z;Equinix crashes Telecity’s warehouse party, leaving bid door ajar;UK group’s Dutch data merger has been disrupted by US player;Lombard once visited a data centre and found it had a row of boulders along its frontage to deter ram raids by saboteurs. But it is a lot easier to gatecrash tie-ups between the security-conscious companies that run these server warehouses, as the US group Equinix looks set to prove. It has offered £2.3bn in cash and shares for Telecity, leaving the UK company little choice but to abandon its plans to purchase Interxion, a Dutch group of equal size, for £1.6bn.Equinix’s hard-driving boss Steve Smith disapproves of that transaction. Well he might. As Milan Radia of Jefferies points out, the deal would confine Equinix to “a distant number two spot in Europe”. A company that services the world wide web needs a worldwide network of its own.However, by disrupting Telecity’s tie-in with Interxion, Mr Smith has increased the chances of a rival bidder pitching for the UK group. Telecity could fill in gaps on the European map for several other data centre operators, in addition to Equinix. Its prize asset is a data centre in Docklands that provides a low latency base for the servers of high-frequency securities traders.For rivals of Equinix, such as Digital Realty of the US, another option is bidding for the jilted Interxion, rather than participating in a pricey auction of Telecity led by Goldman Sachs.Telecity’s four advisers, meanwhile, should be able to work out between them that the price of £11.45 a share offered by Equinix is a full one. It represents a forward earnings ratio of about 29 times. US data centre companies boast bigger multiples. But as Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has understatedly remarked, US equities are “quite high”.About 46 per cent of the consideration would be in Equinix’s stock, the rest in cash. A takeover would both validate and conclude Telecity’s bumpy career as an independent company, which began in the pioneering data labs of the University of Manchester. The company hosts processing power capable of launching rockets and supplying the world with videos of funny cats. But, absent a competing bid, saying yes to this offer should be a no-brainer for the board.Mine hostFictional mine owner Ross Poldark is not the only heartthrob to have made a bob or two from copper. Byronic boss Gavin Patterson has flogged £29m of the stuff, helping BT Group beat forecasts with headline earnings of £6.3bn in 2014-15. But what set investors’ bodices heaving was an 18 per cent jump in the earnings of BT’s consumer division.That suggested Mr Patterson had not merely indulged a passion for football by blowing hundreds of millions on sports rights. The chance to see a selection of games has encouraged customers to sign up to BT Broadband. And more of them are sticking around to brave a service that can sometimes feel slower than an 18th-century hay wagon.BT shares have risen 18 per cent since Mr Patterson succeeded Ian Livingston as chief executive in September 2013. But three clouds on the horizon are as darkly brooding as Messrs Poldark and Patterson. First, the £12.5bn purchase of mobile operator EE will look expensive unless BT can prove that consumers want their telly and telecoms bundled. Second, BT is under pressure to lift stagnant sales. Third, Ofcom is to review BT’s ownership of Openreach, the utility that gives most telcos access to customers’ homes.Openreach is a gold mine, in contrast to Poldark’s Wheal Leisure, which yielded copper. The division produced 38 per cent of BT’s 2015 profits. No wonder rascally wreckers such as Vodafone are urging Ofcom’s Sharon White to split it off. There is a good case to do so — competition could benefit. If she proceeds, BT shares will retreat and Mr Patterson will really have something to smoulder about.Commodities 101Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg has made a discovery. Apparently, supplying more of a product reduces its price if demand is constant. He has tried to share this insight with the likes of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. But they won’t listen. Sam Walsh, the boss of Rio, might reasonably be expected to have independently identified the “Glasenberg Principle”, as we shall call it, given that he has been in business for about 40 years. It is almost as if the two large, efficient miners don’t mind taking a bit of pain, so long as weak prices hurt competitors more.All most frustrating for Mr Glasenberg. According to one yarn, insult was recently added to injury when the South African-born tycoon told an Australian executive that holding a passport from the Lucky Country made him an Aussie himself. “It’s good for a man to have an ambition,” the Antipodean replied, conceding nothing.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
8;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Senior executives described corporate events that involved being “kidnapped” by former KGB agents, swimming with sharks and spending a night in an ice hotel.Mr Tobin now holds only a 0.3 per cent stake in the group, according to Bloomberg, with banks and asset managers comprising its main shareholders.New York-listed Equinix confirmed its approach in a separate statement, saying a deal “would create a more compelling combination than the proposed merger with Interxion and would deliver greater value for Telecity shareholders”.Lombard once visited a data centre and found it had a row of boulders along its frontage to deter ram raids by saboteurs. But it is a lot easier to gatecrash tie-ups between the companies that run these server warehouses — as the US group Equinix looks set to prove, says Jonathan Guthrie.Continue readingEquinix makes a significant proportion of its revenues from providing data storage for financial services companies including trading firms and exchanges.It already holds a strong position in Europe, operating critical data centres in places such as Slough, the southwest London suburb. Adding Telecity to its portfolio would give it new centres in locations including London’s Docklands financial district and Amsterdam.However, Equinix’s bid may face some antitrust questions, analysts warned.In February, Telecity had announced plans to acquire Dutch group Interxion for £1.6bn, in a deal structured as a merger but giving Telecity shareholders 55 per cent of the combined company. Its offer valued Interxion shares at a 15 per cent premium and the combined group would have had a market value of more than £3bn.Analysts at Jefferies warned that a tie up between Telecity and Interxion would leave “Equinix . . . confined to a distant number-two spot in Europe. The enlarged business would compete with Equinix not only within Europe, but also for US order flows and for acquisitions. Why would Equinix not choose to nip this rival M&A in the bud?”At the time, Telecity also announced a £400m share buyback programme over three years. “If, heaven forbid, something were to preclude this merger, we are absolutely committed to this buyback,” chairman John Hughes said.Under UK takeover rules, Equinix has until June 4 to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Telecity.Shares in Equinix have risen 38 per cent over the past 12 months to give the company a market value of $14.6bn. It recently changed its corporate structure to that of a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which gives it substantial tax advantages over many of its international rivals.
10;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2015-03-02T16:53:22Z;Japan’s NTT buys Germany’s E-shelter as data competition deepens;European digital storage and services competition intensifies;Competition in the European market for data storage and services is intensifying with NTT, the world’s largest telecoms company by sales, agreeing to pay €742m for a majority stake in German data centre provider E-shelter.The deal follows the announcement last month that Telecity, the UK-based data centre operator, would buy competitor Interxion, creating a European business valued at more than £3bn.Japan’s NTT said it would acquire 86.7 per cent of E-shelter’s shares, through NTT Communications, the subsidiary that handles the group’s networking business.Companies that host servers are positioning themselves for a boom in computing power and data services, driven by the projected growth in gadgets such as smartphones and sensors, and by businesses moving their software to the “cloud”. Sales from cloud computing are projected to have grown nearly 18 per cent in 2014 to $153bn, according to Gartner, a research group.“We are in a round of intensifying consolidation around the world,” said Milan Radia, analyst at Jefferies, an investment bank. “Enterprises and technology players are wanting to buy data centre suppliers across regions so they can have a common methodology and approach.”E-shelter is Germany’s biggest data centre operator and manages nearly 90,000 square metres of data centre space. The acquisition would put NTT towards the top of the European market along with Telecity, Equinix, and Telehouse, which is owned by KDDI, another big Japanese telecoms group.“The Asian heavyweights are very much into acquire mode,” said Mr Radia. “I think this is a warning signal to say that if you think KDDI is going to sit on the sidelines while this merger between Telecity and Interxion goes ahead, think again.”Data centre operators are also responding to growing concern from European businesses and regulators about how data are managed. The European Commission is working to unify the region’s rules about data protection by 2016, while revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about widespread eavesdropping by US intelligence agencies has made some businesses nervous about where the servers that hold their data are based.“Snowden means if you’re a German company and you want to outsource your IT, you’re going to want to know where your data are being held,” said Philip Carse, analyst at Megabuyte, a UK-based research group.The trend towards “hybrid cloud” — where companies combine in-house servers with data hosted by third parties — also means there is an advantage to telecoms companies acquiring data centres so they can offer both networking and data storage, analysts say.The price values E-shelter at about five times the company’s latest sales figures. By comparison, Equinix trades on the Nasdaq at about six times 2015 revenues, while Telecity trades on the London Stock Exchange at about six times revenues.
11;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2013-06-07T17:53:38Z;US Reit conversions face IRS scrutiny;Shares knocked as regulator reconsiders eligibility standards;"The Internal Revenue Service is scrutinising a provision that permits US companies to qualify as real estate investment trusts, a special structure that allows businesses to pay lower corporate taxes while returning more income to investors.The revelation came from several companies seeking Reit status, knocking back their shares and raising questions about whether US tax authorities will narrow the definition for which enterprises qualify.Timber producers, mobile phone tower operators, prison groups and data centres have all made the switch to Reits – which trade off lower corporation taxes in return for paying out at least 90 per cent of taxable income as dividends.Companies ranging from Equinix, the world’s largest data centre provider, to Iron Mountain, which rents storage space to businesses, and Lamar Advertising, a billboards business, fell sharply in Friday trading as analysts said it could delay their conversions.The IRS is assessing whether to revise the legal definition of real estate for the purposes of converting to a trust and has convened a working group to consider the matter, these companies disclosed in filings. The IRS did not respond to multiple requests for comment.A company must invest at least 75 per cent of its assets in real estate and derive at least 75 per cent of its gross income from rents, interest on mortgages, financing property or from sales of real estate to qualify, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.Iron Mountain, the paper and online records storage company, said it had received a “tentatively adverse” ruling from the IRS relating to its Reit conversion, sending shares down 15.8 per cent to $28.95. The IRS is questioning whether its warehouses filled with stacks of servers constitute real estate.“The company believes that under current legal standards, the company’s racking structures are ‘real estate’ for Reit purposes; however, the company can provide no assurances that the IRS will agree,” Iron Mountain said.Meanwhile, Equinix, which operates data centres for companies such as AT&T and Amazon, said it “cannot predict when the IRS working group will complete its study or what the outcome of the study will be”.It added that it would continue to move forward with its plans to convert to a Reit, but that it did not expect the IRS review to delay its plans to pursue the status by 2015.Lamar echoed this statement, saying it had no reason to conclude that it will not be able to convert into a Reit by January 1.Shares in Equinix dropped 5.5 per cent to $192.57, while Lamar lost 4.2 per cent to $43.62.CBS, which said in January it was moving towards Reit status for its US outdoor advertising unit in 2014, dipped 1.7 per cent to $48.03 as analysts said the plan may be slightly delayed but was unlikely to be derailed.While industry watchers doubted that those companies seeking conversion will ultimately be denied, analysts at Citi said they expected the Reit conversion process to become “bumpier and longer”.“We expect the market to reassess the probability for successful Reit conversions,” they said in a note to clients."
12;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2012-11-02T22:56:23Z;New York scrambles to reconnect;;Jock Percy, chief executive of Perseus Telecom, points to a pair of white steel doors. A low roar emanates from behind them and the smell of gasoline is palpable. “This is where the generator lives,” he says.Mr Percy’s data centres, on an upper floor of 60 Hudson Street, have been running on generator power since Monday night – when an explosion at Consolidated Edison’s electricity station on 14th Street knocked power out to a swath of lower Manhattan. “It looked like lightning,” says a Perseus employee who saw the blast as flooding from superstorm Sandy overwhelmed the plant.Since Monday’s electricity outage, the telecoms companies who keep their systems at New York’s two main technology hubs, 60 Hudson Street and 111 Eighth Avenue, two giant art deco brick buildings, have been scrambling to keep power flowing into the city’s vital telecommunications nerve centres.“This is where all the transatlantic cables come into,” Mr Percy says outside of 60 Hudson Street. “This and 111 Eighth Avenue are the two most important buildings in the US. They’re probably the busiest now too.”Outside the brick and brass façade of 60 Hudson Street, a series of gas companies ferry emergency supplies to the building. For the first two days after the storm, workers carried buckets of gasoline up the stairs by hand to hungry power generators. Now that one of the building’s elevators is working, they move barrels of gas to the building’s upper floors, then take the stairs back down to conserve power.Among those that suffered setbacks at the site were larger companies such as Equinix, the data centre operator. The company, which serves internet heavyweights such as Google and Facebook, says a generator failure this week at its 60 Hudson suite impaired service for several customers.Equinix also says it suffered at least three power outages due to generator failures at 118 Eighth Avenue, a building purchased by Google for $1.9bn two years ago.The two New York buildings are known as “carrier hotels” and they house the telecoms systems that connect everything from proprietary trading firms and popular websites to outside networks. Mr Percy’s company counts hedge funds, large global banks and companies such as eBay among its clients.“Some financial technology operators have generator back-up and switched over immediately and seamlessly. We were in that group and are very fortunate,” says Mr Percy. Like many telecoms specialists, his company has struck deals with fuel suppliers that give them priority over other businesses. The company’s fuel tank has over 2,000 gallons of gas. “So we’re OK,” he says.Others were not so lucky. Some gambled that the four feeds from Consolidated Edison which run into 60 Hudson were unlikely to go out simultaneously. When the electricity failed they relied on battery back-up and when the batteries ran out they too went dark. Many of the rooms at 60 Hudson Street are eerily quiet.The havoc wrought by the storm has exposed the complex telecoms infrastructure which runs through much of lower Manhattan and especially through the financial centre near Wall Street.While downtown retail and residential centres such as Soho and the West Village have largely emptied, the city’s financial centre is a hive of activity as it attempts to recover from power outages and flood waters.On Friday morning, a fleet of Con Edison trucks was parked just off Battery Park.Spools of new fibre optic cables, housed in bright orange plastic tubing, were being rolled out to replace lines damaged in the floods. Verizon vans and industrial-sized power generators lined the area’s winding streets.From the roof of 30 Vesey Street the hustle was obvious. Construction workers at the new World Trade Center site were busy pumping water. Street crews swept up the leaves and debris that clogged gutters and drains. Goldman Sachs, on the island’s western edge, has remained bright thanks to its own generators.Unlike some of the area’s largest institutions, many smaller companies operating out of lower Manhattan were unable to rely on multiple routing alternatives as electricity and telecommunications infrastructure was overwhelmed by the storm. Some are now pondering whether lower Manhattan is a suitable place to house the infrastructure and technology that has become vital for their business.“The question is whether it is worth it to change the structure of the entire US trading industry to prepare for what averages out to be a one or two day event every ten years,” says the head of stock trading at one bank.Across New York, data centre and connectivity drama was still unfolding.Data operator Zayo warned customers that 75 Broad Street, a carrier hotel just feet from the southern tip of Manhattan, had “effectively ‘gone dark’ and the landlords are unreachable”. The company, which provides high-speed wiring for financial firms among other things, says it has a “limited presence” at the location but has still been making efforts to enter the building.Outside 60 Hudson Street, which has grown from the former Western Union headquarters to its current “carrier hotel” status, Mr Percy muses about the repercussions of housing crucial telecoms networks in Manhattan.“You can have all of your back up in the middle of nowhere but you still have to deliver it to your customers,” he says. “It’s why finance companies still want to be in New York. People still want to work and play in New York. You can’t move your entire operation to somewhere people don’t want to go.”
13;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2012-09-13T21:53:31Z;Equinix seeks Reit status to aid growth;;Equinix, the world’s largest data centre provider, which counts companies such as Google and Facebook among its customers, plans to become a real estate investment trust by 2015 to reduce its tax burden and help it expand.Shares in Equinix jumped as much as 13 per cent in early trade in New York, valuing the company at nearly $10bn.Equinix said the decision to convert into a Reit, which must payout 90 per cent or greater of its taxable income to shareholders, came as it faced the prospect of a slowdown in its rapid rate of sales growth.There has been a boom in demand for data centres over the past decade as the amount of information on the internet has increased. Operators provide companies with facilities to host their servers, in turn allowing them to expand their global reach and speed of transactions.However, companies such as Equinix have seen their growth rates slow as competitors have joined the market. Technological advances have meant each data centre can handle more information than before, and some investors have questioned how long high stock market valuations can be sustained.Still, Equinix reiterated its target of $3bn in annual sales, nearly double its current figure, by 2015 when it would elect Reit status.Equinix warned that the move is not guaranteed as there “are a number of hurdles yet to be cleared given the operational complexities to be addressed prior to conversion”.If completed, Equinix said it expected its entire US business, which accounts for about 60 per cent of revenues, and portions of its international operation to qualify under the new status.If approved by the Internal Revenue Service, the move could yield between $700m and $1.1bn for shareholders through a special distribution in accordance with tax rules applicable to Reits, the company said.Some of the world’s most influential internet companies rely on Equinix’s data centres as they seek to reduce the load time on their websites, which can impact billions of dollars in potential revenues.Global bourses and trading companies also gain significant advantages by increasing the reducing the so-called “latency” of their transactions by colocating at facilities that are run by companies such as Equinix.Steve Smith, chief executive of Equinix, said: “We have already seen several of our peers in the data centre industry operate under a Reit structure, and we believe that this tax-efficient structure will enhance shareholder value and enable us to be even more competitive.”The move comes as some of Equinix’s rivals – Digital Realty Trust, DuPont Fabros, CoreSite Realty Corp – already operate as Reits and benefit from tax benefits under the classification.CyrusOne, a data centre operator run by telecom provider Cincinnati Bell, has filed to raise up to $300m in an initial public offering and said it intended to classify its business as a Reit.Shares in Equinix finished 7.5 per cent higher to $200.50.Gray Powell, analyst at Wells Fargo, said that while the decision for Equinix to become a Reit had been under consideration for sometime, the move came sooner than investors had expected.
14;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2012-09-13T20:28:46Z;BofA gains as financials given impetus;;Bank of America led the shares in some of Wall Street’s biggest banks higher on Thursday, rising sharply after the Federal Reserve said it would take additional measures to stimulate the US economy.The decision, which was followed by a strong rally in financial sector equities and other cyclical sectors, came after weeks of speculation that the central bank would extend its bond buying operations.Stocks in the S&P 500 financial index rose 2.6 per cent as Bank of America climbed 4.8 per cent to $9.40.Other bulge bracket banks also recorded strong gains. Shares in Citigroup were 4.2 per cent better at $34.45, while JPMorgan Chase gained 3.7 per cent to $41.40.Analysts at S&P Capital IQ said the Federal Reserve’s decision to purchase an additional $40bn of agency mortgage-backed securities should lead to lower mortgage rates, giving a further boost to the US housing market and in turn, improve JPMorgan Chase’s revenues and credit quality.The S&P 500 closed 1.6 per cent higher at 1,459.99 to reach its highest level in nearly five years after, rallying strongly after the announcement.“Overall, the Fed has done all the markets were asking for,” said Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. “The problem is that we doubt it will be enough to get the economy on the right track. It’s only a matter of time before speculation begins as to when the Fed will raise its purchases from $40bn a month.”The S&P 500 has risen 16.1 per cent higher from the start of the year.Until the announcement just after midday eastern time in the US, trading in stocks had been muted as investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve board meeting.The S&P 500 materials index gained 2.6 per cent as miners Cliffs Natural Resources rose 6.3 per cent to $43.18 and Freeport-McMoRan moved 4.2 per cent higher to $41.79.Elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.3 per cent to 3,155.83. Shares in Facebook fell 1 per cent to $20.71 on Wednesday recording its biggest single daily rise since its debut in May. Still, Facebook’s stock has fallen 45.5 per cent since its initial public offering.Equinix, the global data centre company, climbed 7.5 per cent to $200.50 as its board approved plans to convert the company into a real estate investment trust.Todd Weller, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said: “After coming under some pressure in recent days following the company’s cancellation of its appearances at two investor conferences, the stock is rebounding on the news.”Apple shares hit a new high as investors weighed the impact of its newly unveiled iPhone on the consumer electronics company’s revenue prospects.Shares in Apple, already the world’s largest company by market value, jumped 2 per cent to $682.98.Analysts said many of the changes to its latest iPhone product were expected but that, nonetheless, the launch would be successful for the company’s overall business.Ben Reitzes, analyst at Barclays, said: “Wednesday’s announcement marks the beginning of a unique holiday season for Apple.“We are impressed by the faster-than-expected rollout of the iPhone 5, which should help performance in December and March quarters.”Meanwhile, others said the improvement to the device as well as other Apple products would continue to help its business.Kulbinder Garcha, analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “The continued innovation in hardware, software and the services ecosystem will allow Apple to sustain its competitive advantage and drive smartphone share gains.”Mr Garcha said he expected Apple to continue to expand its market share in the smartphone market.The company’s shares have risen more than 68.6 per cent since the start of the year, outpacing gains from the S&P 500 information technology sector.The tech sector index, which was up 1.5 per cent on the day, has risen 22.6 per cent in the year to date.Best Buy shares fell 1.4 per cent to $18.32 as the consumer electronics retailer said it would reassign 2,000 store employees to join its in-store sales force.Economic data released on Thursday showed that rising food and energy costs sent wholesale prices in the US up the most in three years last month.Separately, fresh labour department data said more Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits than expected by analysts.
15;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2012-08-20T16:29:22Z;Data centre companies ride internet boom;;When Usain Bolt ran in the men’s 100m final at the London Olympic Games, there was a 30 per cent spike in demand for the BBC’s online iPlayer service, as people unable to get to a TV screen watched the event on desktop PCs and mobile devices. Much of this internet traffic came through Telecity, whose data centres host iPlayer.The Olympics have served to highlight, once again, the explosion of mobile and internet use that is taking place in people’s daily lives, from deskworkers watching video streams of sports events to spectators uploading pictures of themselves at the stadium on to sites such as Facebook. All these videos and images must pass through or be stored on servers in data centres somewhere.Hence there is little surprise that this month Telecity reported a 22 per cent rise in its first-half revenues, while Interxion, its Amsterdam-based rival, reported a 13 per cent rise in sales. Last month Equinix of the US saw an 18 per cent year-on-year rise in second-quarter sales. Revenues for Telehouse, which is owned by Japan’s KDDI, grew 13.9 per cent last year.As enthusiasm for Facebook and Twitter has grown among consumers, so the share prices of the data centre companies have pushed ever upwards. Interxion, which listed in New York last year, has seen its value increase 60 per cent the past year. Equinix and Telecity shares have both quadrupled in value since 2009.The sharp run-up has left investors asking how much longer this boom can last. The data centre industry suffered a collapse and multiple bankruptcies when the dotcom bubble burst in the early years of the last decade, and investors with long memories wonder if the same could happen again.“Right now, data centres are in a sweet spot, but is that demand sustainable?” says Milan Radia, analyst at Jefferies.Cisco has predicted that internet traffic will quadruple over the next four years, so the demand for data is unlikely to wane any time soon. However, there is a great deal more supply coming on to the data centre market, which could mean that companies such as Telecity and Equinix may not be able to command the same price levels they once did.Part of this is through technical advances, which mean more data can be processed with less power. Widespread use of new, ultra-low power servers, currently being developed, could constrain earnings for data centre companies that charge customers for the number of kilowatts of electricity they use per year.New competition is another threat.“The idea that we can’t build data centres fast enough is just not true” says Tim Anker, founder of the Colocation Exchange, which brokers deals between data centres and their clients. “A lot of new entrants are coming into the market. Five years ago there were just a few Telecity and Telehouse sites in the Docklands available but now there is a lot more choice.”Private equity-backed companies such as Virtus, which is supported by Frogmore and Brockton Capital, and Infinity, which is backed by Rothschild, have recently come into the market. Infinity, Volta – a joint venture between Apollo Global Real Estate and Glebe – and Gyron, recently bought by Japan’s NTT Com, are all planning new data centres in London to tap the growing demand.Prices at some of these newer facilities, especially if they are a little further from the centre of London, can be half those of Telecity or Interxion, Mr Anker says. Telecity’s results indicate that pricing may already be under some pressure, with increases slowing from 20 per cent in 2007 to about 3 to 5 per cent this year.That said, most analysts believe Telecity, Interxion and Equinix will continue to retain an advantage over any upstarts. Their businesses are not just about having a lot of data centre capacity – they are about having it in the right, central location where many telecoms companies are already connecting to each other.Telehouse, the first data centre of its type in London, still houses two-thirds of London’s internet exchange, making it one of the key internet hubs in Europe.An established Telecity data centre has direct connections to hundreds of telecoms operators, and content companies want to be in these locations to make sure they get the fastest, most direct route to viewers.This is why companies such as Amazon, or Facebook, which have their own sprawling data centres, usually in rural locations, still need to route data through Telecity and Equinix’s highly connected hubs.“Amazons want to be near Apples and so they all want to be in these highly concentrated, central London data centres,” said Andy Bryant, analyst at Cenkos. “There may be excess supply in the suburbs, but the established data centres can still command a premium.”
16;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2012-05-01T19:22:26Z;Equinix to expand hubs for world’s bourses;;Equinix, the data centre operator, is developing a network that will allow more of the world’s stock exchanges to place trading hubs abroad, allowing them to compete for business around the world.The Nasdaq-listed group is spending tens of millions of dollars creating a platform of connection points, known as nodes, and is testing the system with a couple of exchanges. It has already signed up BT as one of its telecommunications providers.The move could allow some of the world’s smaller global exchanges to vie for investors’ business on a more equal footing with some of the largest bourses as the industry struggles with a deep slump in trading.In recent years stock exchanges have exploited rapid improvements in technology to push at the boundaries of physical geography. Large exchanges have been keen to lure investors with co-location services, in which traders place their computer servers next to an exchange’s matching engine in a data centre. The move will shave crucial milliseconds off the time it takes for trades to be done.Some exchanges, such as NYSE Euronext, CME Group and Nasdaq OMX, have looked to exploit that demand by building their own data centres and charging customers for rent. Data message rates have soared in recent years as exchanges blast out updated prices in fractions of seconds for customers.However other bourses have suffered as their matching engines have been far from the main market liquidity pools. They also lack the funds to spend on building their own data centres, particularly as trading on global markets has remained weak. Equinix is hoping its network, based on Ethernet, will effectively outsource the role, cutting the heavy IT burden allowing other exchanges to sell their market data to investors.“The matching engines will stay in the local market, but they’ll be able to open up a point of presence in a foreign market,” said John Knuff, general manager of global financial services at Equinix, told FT Trading Room. “We’re going to see more and more of this in coming years. We’ve made some pretty big bets. We think it’s the future.”RTS-Micex, the Russian exchange, and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange have already announced plans to open a point of presence in Equinix’s Slough data centre near London. ASX, the Australian exchange, has a similar hub in Chicago to attract the city’s futures traders.“Points of presence suggest a commoditisation in the market,” said Terry Keene, chief executive of iSys Integration Systems, a capital markets consultancy. “You’re at the classic buy-or-build dilemma.”Mr Knuff said that the project would not turn Equinix into an exchange, a connectivity provider or market data reseller. “Around 80-90 per cent of markets don’t need the lowest latency possible. They’re looking for economical access to local markets. It will make it less expensive for market data vendors and resellers for these exchanges,“ said Mr Knuff.Around a fifth of Equinix’s $1.6bn revenues comes from financial services. It counts Direct Edge, ICAP, BATS Chi-X Europe and JPMorgan as customers.
17;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2012-04-08T03:09:05Z;Private equity chances in Brazil’s mid-market;Valuations in the large-cap market are rising and competition is fierce;Overtaking the UK as the world’s sixth-largest economy in 2011, Brazil has a surface area more than twice as big as Europe and a population over three times that of the UK. Since 1990, poverty levels have halved, with 40m people joining the middle class since 2003. Despite GDP contracting in the third quarter of 2011, the International Monetary Fund continues to make fluctuating predictions of a GDP growth between 3 and 5 per cent for the coming years.In a market that continues to be this dynamic, it is easy to see why Brazil has warranted such attention from investors looking for returns in a turbulent financial crisis. And the private equity world has not been exempt from scrutiny. Brazilian private equity has enjoyed a significant renaissance since the late 2000s when international investment managers re-entered the market, attracted by the prospect of strong returns and a proven resilience to the global financial crisis of late 2008. The period saw such landmark events as Carlyle’s first Brazil office opening, Blackstone’s acquisition of Patria Investimentos, JPMorgan’s acquisition of Gavea Investimentos, the establishment of BTG Pactual and Vinci Partners, and the launch of a Brazilian team for TPG Capital.Despite drawing short of the totals of the other emerging markets comparable to its size, private capital raised by Brazilian private equity funds leapt 500 per cent to over $3bn in 2010, driven predominantly by the greater participation from the mega funds. More than 90 per cent of the capital raised in 2010-11 poured in to only six funds in Brazil, with a few notable examples of billion-dollar-plus funds closing in 2011.Just take a closer look at the resulting evidence: more than 80 per cent of the private capital available in Brazil is chasing deals from among a small pool of only 3,000 large companies in the country (those with sales of more than $200m). And those few big companies have more alternatives for their capitalisation – which means deal flow tends to be scarce, competitive, and relatively expensive. Conversely, the mid-market private equity sector is underfunded – representing less than 15 per cent of the total private equity money available in the country – with over 14,000 companies with sales of between $30m and $200m representing the sector. The picture is clear: the deal opportunity versus the investment equity ticket available is grossly mismatched.As a direct result, valuations in the large-cap market are rising and the space is becoming overcrowded. Anyone monitoring the Brazilian private equity market could therefore be forgiven for believing the resulting hype that it has reached a critical mass and the opportunities are rapidly disappearing. But institutional investors could benefit from a closer look.Recalibrate your focus from the large cap onto the mid-market and the opportunity is most certainly still there, and will be there in the long term. Whereas the large companies have an enterprise multiple (EV/Ebitda) around 10x, the middle market companies are showing multiples below 8x, illustrating that they could well be undervalued and have the potential to produce better returns. What is more, the mid-market, as a broader sector of investment, is more resilient, more dynamic, and more mobile. In the Brazilian mid-market, there is an ocean of companies ready to emerge that are underserved and without access to alternative sources of capital. It is probably the sweetest spot – adjusted to underlying risks – for investments in the world today.The opportunity is best illustrated with examples. Alog Data Centers, a data centre company based in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and firmly placed in the mid-market, was sold in 2011 following three formal bids to the joint bid presented by Equinix (a Nasdaq-listed data centre company) and Riverwood (a fund based in Menlo Park, California) for 18x capital in dollars. Later in the year, Maestro, a well-run fleet manager of corporate cars with more than 2,500 vehicles, received a control investment with a 50 per cent valuation discount to the market leader. These markers are silently proving the trend, demonstrating that Brazil is an economy established over an ocean of mid-sized companies.Alvaro Goncalves is Managing Partner and CEO of Grupo Stratus. He is also a representative of Brazil to the boards of both Emerging Markets Private Equity Association and LAVCA

The visually unremarkable Slough site has become one of Europe’s most sought-after locations to conduct trading because it sits on the telecommunications pathways between London and New York, but is also close to Europe’s financial centre.It is also the home of BATS Europe, which is planning to buy Chi-X; Icap, the interdealer broker, and Thomson Reuters, the data information provider, as well as more than 650 other financial services customers.NYSE said the hub would complement its own purpose-built data centre on the eastern side of London, at Basildon and allow investors to access its network, known as the Secure Financial Transaction Infrastructure (SFTI).However the Equinix site location, 30 miles west of London, means that trades and messages can be sent and received from US investors far faster than from sites based in the heart of London’s central financial district.The development also comes three months after complaints by a lobby group representing 17 of the largest electronic trading companies claiming that the Basildon site was restrictive to third-party technology vendors in terms of access, as well as costly for many market participants. NYSE rebutted the claims, saying there had never been discrimination between technology vendors and members at Basildon.“Equinix has built a strong community of trading firms in the [Slough] campus, including a number of existing SFTI customers that will benefit from even greater market access, reduced connectivity costs and enhanced performance through this new access centre,” said Don Brook, head of infrastructure at NYSE Technologies."
19;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2011-09-29T22:43:04Z;CBOE acquires National Stock Exchange;;The CBOE Stock Exchange has acquired the National Stock Exchange, consolidating two of the US’s remaining independent stock markets.Though the number of exchanges in the US has been on a steady decline over the last 20 years, as regional exchanges shuttered or converted to electronic markets, only to be bought by larger competitors like NYSE Euronext or Nasdaq OMX, the advent of the national market system has given a role to small exchanges.As volumes have fallen over the past three years, stock exchanges now often compete on the basis of pricing schemes to attract new types of trades, such as high-frequency strategies that make money by taking advantage of rebates offered by exchanges to place or execute against orders on their market.Exchanges globally have been in a rush to merge to gain scale and competitive advantage, though many of those mergers – such as the Nasdaq’s bid for NYSE – have been blocked by regulators and antitrust authorities.The CBSX, which is co-owned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and a group of nine-market making firms, including Cowen and Interactive Brokers, was founded five years ago to cater to floor options traders who wanted to also trade stocks. But the exchange has since moved from Chicago to the Equinix servers in New Jersey.It now caters to brokers and trading firms that take advantage of high rebate fees or use its relatively shallow order book to quickly rise to the top of the trading queue, said David Harris, chief executive. CBSX earlier this week announced a new pricing scheme, raising the rebate it paid to traders who executed against orders.The NSX was formerly the regional Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which was founded in 1885. It became an all-electronic exchange in 1980 and moved to Chicago and changed its name in 2003.Its primary business is printing and displaying trades executed by broker-owned platforms, such as Citigroup’s Lavaflow and Credit Suisse’s Light Pool, that are not regulated exchanges, so that they can meet requirements to trade at the national best bid and offer.Mr Harris said the merger gives the CBSX its own exchange license – previously it traded under the CBOE’s license – and two markets that use different pricing, a strategy that has aided the development of new independent exchanges, such as Direct Edge and BATS Global Markets. Nasdaq also cited a similar strategy when it presented its proposed merger with NYSE.The move allows CBSX to operate independently of CBOE, adding to its value, Mr Harris said. It also gives the CBSX access to NSX’s broker-dealer, which will allow it to route trades to any market.“We are in a real transition. It’s like we’re starting over,” he said. “We want to be focused on serving customers rather than generating volume. We would be responsive to anybody who has a market structure problem to solve.”Together, the two markets will execute less than 1 per cent of total US market volume, though Mr Harris said the CBSX was profitable last year and can continue to do so with little volume.The terms of the transaction between the two private companies were not disclosed.Though the CBSX operates in the same data centre as CBOE’s electronic options exchange, C2, the two exchanges do not operate together. A spokesperson for CBOE said the merger would not affect its own business.The only remaining independent regional exchange is now the Chicago Stock Exchange. Over the past two years Nasdaq OMX acquired the other remaining regionals, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Boston Stock Exchange.Other regional exchanges have long since become part of global groups, such as the Pacific Exchange, a roll-up of the San Francisco and Los Angeles exchanges. It merged with electronic platform Archipelago in 2005, then with the New York Stock Exchange.
20;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2011-08-02T09:09:33Z;NYSE buys Metabit in Asia tech push;;NYSE Technologies, the trading infrastructure services arm of the exchange group, has acquired Japanese group Metabit as it seeks to establish a foothold to supply trading technology in the fast-developing Asian market.It is the most recent in a string of acquisitions and announcements that NYSE Euronext hopes will propel its nascent trading technology operations into a $1bn business and a big contributor to its profits as declining volumes and stiff competition challenge its core trading business.It comes as Asian markets are beginning to fragment. Rival alternative trading platforms and “dark pools” – where large orders get sent for execution anonymously – are increasingly taking business that was historically conducted on exchanges. Increasing use of algorithms for high-frequency trading is also reshaping the trading landscape in the region.As local markets look to adapt, NYSE is in a battle with rival exchange operators such as Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange to supply trading technology to other exchanges. At the same time a clutch of competing groups such as Equinix, BT Radianz and ConvergEx are also seeking to provide such services to asset managers and hedge funds via their own “clouds”, networks and data centres in the US, Europe and Asia.These companies see an opportunity as buyside groups and large global banks hope to relieve the tremendous pressure to cut costs, as expensive investments in technology and new connections to the fragmented global market system eat into already thin trading margins.NYSE is seeking to augment its central business of connecting investors and brokerages to the exchange by also consolidating the disparate technology networks that connect investors to brokerages.Stanley Young, chief executive of NYSE Technologies, told FT Trading Room that this deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, would allow NYSE to offer its services to Japanese banks and funds that were clients of Metabit’s network.“It would take a number of years for us to penetrate a market like Japan,” said Mr Young. “[This] is a small deal, but it’s another building block on the journey to connect markets, connect sellsides to markets and connect buyside to sell-side and directing that flow into our community.”NYSE Technologies’ efforts to expand its trading technology business began with the 2009 acquisition of Nyfix, a US group that enabled communications between traders and brokers. It subsequently built large data centres in London and New Jersey to attract investors and brokers to a “virtual exchange”. An agreement in June with US technology groups EMC and VMware to create a “cloud” will allow customers to share vast quantities of data and trading infrastructure.NYSE has not yet detailed how its impending merger with Deutsche Börse, which will create a global technology group under Dominique Cerutti, a former top IBM executive in Europe, will affect these efforts.Mr Young said that rather than compete with other providers, NYSE was “encouraging them, and would like to work with them to build their applications on our network, within our cloud and our fabric”.He added that NYSE was not seeking to build any new data centres in Asia, as it had in the US and UK, but would partner with exchanges such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange or existing data centres to provide “co-location” services to traders and brokers.The deal is not anticipated to have a material affect on NYSE’s earnings.
21;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2011-07-13T22:00:49Z;Eurex to press ahead with tech upgrade;;Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, is pressing ahead with plans to upgrade its infrastructure, even as the group could face a technology overhaul if its planned merger with NYSE Euronext succeeds.A technology road map has been distributed in a circular to trading members and confirms the German exchange operator’s plans to continue with a long-standing plan to move the matching engines for trading to a single hub.The project’s future had been thrown into doubt after Deutsche Börse agreed to a merger with NYSE Euronext in February, with the deal going before the German group’s shareholders after being passed by NYSE Euronext shareholders. The two parties have pledged that more than a quarter of the $400m cost savings will be in technology, although they have not detailed which platform they will use.The plan is complicated by vastly differing approaches to technology infrastructure. NYSE Euronext has made extensive and high-profile investments in two data centres in the US and UK, while Deutsche Börse has favoured using a third party data centre operator.Deutsche Börse’s commitment also comes as NYSE Euronext is facing increasing questions about its technology in the wake of four technical glitches that have hit its trading systems in the past month.The bourse, like rivals, is in intense competition to attract lucrative fees from high-speed traders by offering superfast computers and superior telecommunications links. However the growing technological complexity has led to outages at Chi-X Europe, an alternative trading platform, and the London Stock Exchange.The circular confirms the German exchanges operator plans to move its matching engines of Eurex and Xetra, the German cash equities market, in October to a single site run by Equinix, the US data centre provider. It has also set a date of November 7 for the release of a software upgrade.The project is important to Deutsche Börse as it allows them to attract high-speed traders to its platforms. At present the matching engines are situated at two data centres and the move is expected to shave around 0.12 – 0.15 microseconds from the round trip of an order. The site will serve as the new main data centre for Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt.The vote before Deutsche Börse is the second of the three hurdles. The most difficult is expected to be a review by European antitrust authorities, which is expected to match the level of scrutiny seen among global regulators that has scuttled a series of exchange mergers this year.As of late Wednesday afternoon, Deutsche Börse had received acceptances for takeover from 60.16 per cent of shareholders.
22;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2011-07-13T18:33:33Z;Swedish watchdog raids stock exchange;Data centres emerge as battlegrounds;"Swedish regulators have raided the country’s stock exchange as part of an investigation into whether Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange operator, is trying to suppress competition from rival trading platforms in the Nordic region.Verizon, the US telecommunications company, is also involved amid claims it helped Nasdaq OMX defend its dominant position in Sweden by excluding rival exchange operators from an important data centre.The Swedish competition authority said it had visited multiple companies in a search for evidence of “possible anticompetitive co-operation or abuse of dominant position” in the sector, without identifying Nasdaq OMX or Verizon.Data centres are becoming battlegrounds between exchanges and freshly established rivals, often backed by banks and brokers.Nasdaq OMX operates exchanges in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland and has four rivals in the region: Burgundy, a trading platform backed by Nordic banks and brokers; London-based Chi-X Europe; BATS Europe, operated by Kansas City-based BATS Global Markets; and Quote MTF, a Hungarian-regulated platform based in London.Data centres are crucial to market structures as exchanges, banks and brokers compete to build the fastest, most efficient systems with transactions measured in split-seconds.Exchanges and rival platforms allow electronic traders to place their computers in data centres to be as close as possible to their own trading systems. Being close to an exchange or trading platform’s systems – usually a matter of less than a metre – helps shave microseconds off trades.Data centres are operated by exchanges but also by independent operators, such as Verizon, Nasdaq-listed Equinix and Interxion, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.The case stems from a complaint last year by Burgundy after it was refused access to a Verizon data centre used by Nasdaq OMX and most of the big Swedish banks and brokers.Olof Neiglick, Burgundy’s chief executive, told the Financial Times on Wednesday he was “very happy” the competition authority was taking the complaint seriously and said it could set a precedent for similar cases elsewhere in Europe.“This goes way beyond Sweden because it undermines the whole idea of competition between exchanges if someone can dictate who gets into which data centre,” he said.Nasdaq OMX confirmed its Stockholm premises had been visited by the Swedish competition authority and said it was co-operating with the inquiry. The raids took place last month but only publicised this week.Burgundy claims that by barring other exchange operators from its Swedish data centre, Verizon allows Nasdaq OMX to execute transactions more cheaply and faster for banks and brokers with servers in the facility. “If I cannot get into the data centre with my main competitor and largest clients, my competitive edge is . . . diminished,” Mr Neiglick said. “Speed [is] so critical that if we have to use a data centre 5km away, it [costs] milliseconds which increase the risks for our clients.”Nasdaq OMX had no comment on Burgundy’s complaint. Verizon said it was co-operating with the competition authority, but had no comment."
23;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2011-05-26T12:53:07Z;Tech Beat: London calls in liquidity rush;;"“Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough! It isn’t fit for humans now,” the English poet John Betjeman once wrote. Yet it’s perfect for high-frequency traders, inter-dealer brokers and market information providers, it seems.BATS Global Markets has earmarked the town, situated just underneath the flight path to the US out of Heathrow airport, as the site for its key operations in creating Europe’s largest share trading platform by volumeOnce it has received regulatory approval for its planned merger with Chi-X Europe, the US group plans to keep Chi-X Europe’s data centre at Slough. The site, hosted by US data centre provider Equinix, matches trades on the Chi-X Europe platform and BATS will switch its main trading book and “dark pool” trading platforms from London Docklands to the Berkshire town.In doing so it will be moving a large part of its operations, which are currently situated close to its City and Canary Wharf customers, to a site more than 40 miles away.So why would a fast-growing company eager for more business move away from its customers? The answer lies in what facilities can be provided and increasingly, the shape equity markets are taking.Data centres have proliferated as the world’s economy goes online but they are not all built equal. They have ratings much like hotels and Equinix’s Slough facility has been pitched by the company as a five-star establishment, albeit one that won’t be advertised in any guide book.Even if you stumble across it, you have to be James Bond to get in. Entry to the building is via a secure car park, fingerprint scanners, mantraps and thick steel doors. The control room has bulletproof glass; closed circuit television is everywhere. Individual customers’ servers are partitioned off in cages.The key issue for running a data centre is securing sufficient power to maintain the servers and the air conditioning that cools them. Its availability in the south-east of England, especially in London, has been severely constrained, at least until the 2012 Olympics. Data centres located outside the M25 are able to use more power from the national grid, whilst still providing low-latency connectivity into the city. At the Equinix site, back-up generators and extra fuel is ready should all power fail. As a test, once a week Equinix does the unthinkable; turns the power off to see it all works.The building is a testament to Equinix’s meticulous paranoia, even down to the sticky mats that take dust off the soles of one’s shoe. All in all, it gives the impression that it would withstand those bombs Betjeman called for.But Equinix’s attention to detail is really only a reflection of the sensitivities of its clients. Millions of trades are centred on servers miles from their operations.“Around 60 per cent of European cash equities are automated trades – speed and execution are key. The distance between the exchange platform and the bank matching engine matters,” says Terry Quigley, head of financial services sector at Colt, the telecoms services group.He points out that Mifid has fostered fragmentation, in the form of new multilateral trading firms. “Now we’re seeing consolidation, such as with BATS and Chi-X. We’re also seeing a consolidation of liquidity.”Yet the site, like the NYSE Euronext one in Basildon, is preparing for evolution of the market. As Michael Spencer, chief executive of Icap, the inter-dealer broker, and a client of Equinix at Slough, pointed out last week: “I expect to see high frequency trading move into derivatives.”“We try to provide infrastructure or a place where it all could come together,” acknowledges Eric Schwartz, president of Equinix Europe.Location increasingly matters. Yet customer demands for the best latency and a bank’s desire to be fairly close to its equipment means the data centre cannot be located too far from the UK capital.Market participants estimate that the furthest distance one can locate a data centre from a trading floor is around 40 miles, which explains why many of the largest operators for financial services firms have sought new facilities around the M25, the motorway ring road that circles London.NYSE Euronext moved east to Basildon in Essex, Sungard has found another facility at Hounslow near Heathrow airport and LSE has set up a proximity hosting service with Colt near the City.While the exchanges and trading venues chase lucrative business from high frequency traders in the US and Europe, the happy accident of geography makes London the first major financial centre when crossing the Atlantic eastwards.It illustrates how technology is increasingly able to move to the best environment to operate. And the physical trading hubs are moving out ever further away from the City, they are reinforcing London’s position as Europe’s key infrastructure hub for trading. The combined Deutsche Börse- NYSE Euronext bid, if it is approved by regulators and shareholders, is likely to concentrate trading German stocks in addition to the trading of Portuguese, Dutch, French and Belgian stocks in London.The London Stock Exchange has moved its Turquoise multilateral trading facility to the same central London hosting centre as the group’s UK and Italian cash markets, and its new EDX derivatives markets will be based there. The upgrade of trading platforms for Norway and South Africa using technology provided by the LSE could add new customers.It stands in contrast to the option taken by other domestic exchanges such as Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq OMX, SIX Swiss Exchange and Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME) which have chosen to locate their data centres locally.In the past, those opting to keep their primary market local have argued that the platform was faster relative to others because the sheer physical distance to London added extra crucial milliseconds’ worth of latency. However they are in danger of being overshadowed by the sheer number of firms around the UK capital.“London is becoming increasingly important as a main liquidity centre. It’s draining liquidity from other locations,” says Mr Quigley."
24;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Matterhorn invests in two data centres;;Matterhorn Capital, the property investment vehicle run by Anthony Lyons and Simon Conway, is entering the growing data centre market, investing £250m ($416m) in two sites in south-east England.Matterhorn – which also has a property joint venture with Sir Philip Green’s stepson Brett Palos – has been eyeing the data centre market, which is posting a sharp increase in demand from companies eager to outsource their data storage. The move follows Matterhorn’s sale last year of Earls Court and Olympia to Liberty International.In a stark change from a decade ago after the dotcom crash when data centre providers were renting out their facilities as warehouses to stave off bankruptcy, leasing data sites is seeing a revival as more companies are adopting “cloud computing”, where data are stored in large centres rather than on computer hard drives and company servers.Financial trading, online shopping and downloading content such as music and video are also leading to a rise in demand for places to house large servers.Telecity, one of Europe’s biggest data centre providers, has gone from being valued at £4m to more than £1bn, while the market capitalisation of Equinix, its bigger US peer, has risen to $4.7bn.Many of the data centres that were built more than a decade ago need refurbishment, while more property groups are looking to invest in new facilities.Matterhorn’s sites in Bury Green, Hertfordshire, and Chesham, Buckinghamshire, will house more than 180,000 sq ft of data storage space.There has been a rise in demand from London-based companies, especially large financial institutions. According to recent research by Microsoft, the area immediately surrounding Greater London represents the largest single data centre market in Europe.While areas such as the Docklands are still highly coveted for the proximity they offer to data users, more customers are asking whether such a high price needs to be placed on servers’ location and are looking to locations in the south-east, which enable their data to be quickly and easily backed up in an emergency.Cities such as Glasgow, Newport and Cardiff are also expected to grow as data hubs. Highbridge Properties, the UK-based property developer, last week announced it had secured £263m of funding to expand its Cobalt data centre campus near Newcastle.
25;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2011-04-27T09:21:55Z;Chi-X Australia picks Equinix data centre;;Chi-X Australia, a unit of alternative trading venue operator Chi-X Global, has picked Equinix as its main data centre ahead of a planned launch in the fourth quarter.The development is the latest at Chi-X Australia since the collapse of the planned takeover by SGX, the Singapore exchange, of ASX, the Australian exchange with which Chi-X will be competing.Chi-X Australia has a staff of 10 based in Sydney and, like its affiliates in Japan, Europe and Canada, plans to use low overheads, fast trading systems and cheap fees to compete against the ASX.It is a subsidiary of Chi-X Global, itself a unit of Instinet, a broker owned by Nomura of Japan.The ASX exchange has used the time it has taken for Chi-X to gain an operating licence to overhaul its systems and introduce new services in anticipation of competition. Last year it picked an Equinix data centre in Chicago to provide access to its markets for traders based in the US city.Chi-X said the choice of Nasdaq-listed Equinix, one of the world’s largest operators of data centres for the trading community, would give its customers access to “low latency proximity hosting options”. This means that traders wanting to access Chi-X can do so by placing their computer servers in the Equinix data centre.Peter Fowler, Chi-X Australia’s chief operating officer, said: “With the help of Equinix, Chi-X Australia will deliver the type of low latency, high performance, stable and resilient trading system that the Australian market demands.”Chi-X Australia has no chief executive.The company has yet to finalise a plan for clearing Australian stocks that are traded on its platform. Industry observers say one likely option would be LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearer.Last month LCH.Clearnet announced its first customer in Australia, saying it had agreed “initial terms” with Financial and Energy Exchange Group (Fex),to clear energy, commodity and environmental derivatives listed on the Fex Exchange Traded Derivatives Market, subject to regulatory approval.The Fex Group is owned by a consortium of energy and financial market participants, traders and investors, including mainland Chinese energy and investment groups, Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, AMB Holdings of Western Australia and private equity group Iron Mountain.

The deal, which values BATS at $1.2bn, is awaiting clearance from regulatory authorities.While most corporate merger and acquisition integration timetables are kept confidential, the number of trading firms in the market and the complexity of the technology means platform operators make switchover dates more public.BATS plans to keep Chi-X Europe’s data centre at Slough, hosted by US data centre provider Equinix, for matching trades and to switch its main trading book and “dark pool” trading platforms from its London Docklands site to Slough.Chi-X Europe’s Park Royal data centre in west London will be used for backup. However BATS plans to keep operating both the BATS Europe and Chi-X Europe main trading books and “dark pools” – venues that do not display their trades.As these switchovers are essentially IT projects, technical glitches are not uncommon. The past few months have seen the London Stock Exchange suffer repeated problems as it moved its operations over to its new electronic trading system, culminating in a four-hour outage at the exchange last month.There will be two dress rehearsals for the BATS switchover, in August and September, and a contingency go-live date in September. BATS will also make a superfast telecommunications link between Slough and London’s Docklands, where BATS’s trading operations are hosted, available from May.

Colt is hoping to tie-up a deal in time to announce with its full-year earnings on Friday, two people familiar with the matter told FT Trading Room.Instinet, a broker owned by Nomura, has been looking to streamline Chi-X Global and focus on developing alternative share trading platforms in Asia and Latin America. MarketPrizm’s chief executive, since September, is John Lowrey, formerly chief executive of Chi-X Global.Trading firms are increasingly outsourcing business as costs and complexity of trading infrastructure rises. Companies such as MarketPrizm manage and monitor such as high speed communications networks and market data.Hosting of financial trading is one of the fastest growing areas within the technology sector. Last November Equinix, the world’s largest data centre provider, estimated financial services would rise nearly 50 per cent for a second consecutive year and now accounted for more than a fifth of its business.Although it began as a corporate telecoms provider, under its chief executive Rakesh Bhasin Colt has pushed further into data centre hosting, buying the freehold of its main European site at Welwyn near London last year for £49m. In January it also agreed a deal to provide “ proximity hosting” services for traders wanting to connect to the London Stock Exchange’s data centre.Proximity hosting is where traders who choose not to place their servers in an exchange’s data centre can do so in a data centre operated by a third party, usually physically located not far from the exchange’s data centre.Colt said it did not comment on market rumour or speculation. Its shares were unchanged at 155.5p.
28;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2011-02-21T10:04:03Z;Tech Beat: Fancy trading German stocks in Essex?;;Imagine, for a moment, that trading in German and French stocks was run out of Essex.That’s one of the real possibilities thrown up by last week’s proposed merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.When two large companies agree a takeover, information technology often tops the list of potential savings. Chief executives see the chance to do away with duplication and a complex web of software programmes amid ever rising hardware and data centre costs.Suffice to say, it rarely works out that way as executives realise it’s not that easy to pull together systems that in all likelihood run on different technology and may well be incompatible. What was striking about the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal was the relative paucity of cuts from technology from the beginning.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, and Reto Francioni, his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, told analysts and investors that just over a quarter of the $400m cost savings will be in technology. More savings are expected to be made in market operations and almost as much in eliminating duplicate operations like administration.What was equally striking about last week’s deal was how much remains to be worked out. In a briefing at the Financial Times last week, the two men were cautious about giving details, pointing out they were still to explain some things to employees.But some tough decisions still have to be made, which could be political, and revolve around technology.Choices over whose software to use are a little simpler. NYSE Euronext largely uses systems based on Unix or Linux computer operating systems while Deutsche Börse’s main matching engine, Xetra, runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based servers. It’s not ideal but some commonality on computer systems should ease the transition.The really interesting issue revolves around the technology infrastructure, in particular the two companies’ data centre operations. In the past two years both have taken rather different approaches.NYSE Euronext has made extensive and high-profile investments in technology infrastructure. Most notably were the two huge specialist data centres at an estimated cost of $500m, at Mahwah in New Jersey and Basildon, just outside London. The latter now serves as the location for all its matching engines for European markets.By fitting them out with the latest telecommunications piping, server cabinets and security, the group has also been hoping to sell co-location services to trading firms wanting to place their servers right by the exchange’s servers. In essence it is hoping to create a virtual trading hub which pulls in other trading firms and specialist support services.In addition to that, NYSE Euronext last week announced a deepening partnership for proximity hosting with Interxion, the Dutch data centre operator. As Stanley Young, chief executive of NYSE Technologies put it: “This enables us to offer hybrid solutions both within our own facility and also at this prime location for customers wanting to reach other venues.”It also has a commitment in place with Goldman Sachs to build and support SigmaX with hosted services from Basildon.This approach is very different from Deutsche Börse’s approach. The German group has earmarked this year as one in which it will use a third party data centre operator – in this case, Equinix – as its main hub for its electronic trading platforms. Not only that, the same site is intended to be the central co-location site for customers of Eurex, its derivatives exchange, and Xetra, the cash market of Deutsche Börse. Equinix also provides similar services in Chicago and New York.The approaches leads to an awkward question: how will Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni harmonise these two different approaches?It seems they have three choices. The first would be to end Deutsche Börse’s outsourcing deal with Equinix and move Xetra cash market and Eurex derivatives market to Basildon. Amusing as it might be to imagine the German and French stock trading run out of a London commuter town, for it to be politically acceptable may take some serious lobbying.Alternatively, they could choose to move everything to Frankfurt, which could leave a rather redundant Basildon site. The most likely outcome of that option would be the sale of the site and Equinix would likely be a very interested party.The final option would be to leave operations largely unchanged. It would be politically the most acceptable option but less likely to deliver cost savings and puts the pressure on to rapidly increase revenues. That option leaves executives open to awkward questions from shareholders.Mr Niederauer said his previous experience in merging Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange gave him comfort on integrating the two companies. However he never had to deal with the integration of two European companies, each with their own extensive infrastructure, on this scale before. It will be fascinating to see which option they choose.
29;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2011-01-28T18:07:36Z;Quick View: Interxion IPO shows data centre sweetspot;;So now we know how US investors value data centres: pretty highly.Interxion’s debut as a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday saw its shares soar as much as 18 per cent. That was even after the company increased the size of its float and pitched its offer at the top of a $11-$13 price range.Investors have bought into the Dutch data centre operator’s story. The company specialises in co-location services, in which brokers place their servers next to the exchanges’ servers to shave crucial milliseconds off the time it takes for trades to be done.Co-location has become one of the hottest businesses in the world of trading as technology sweeps away old style trading practices, reinventing what it means to be an “exchange”. That has put data centre operators in arguably the sweetest spot of market structures.At the same time Verizon, the US telecoms group, this week announced a $1.4bn deal for Miami-based Terremark at an eye-opening 35 per cent premium to its closing price, to help companies adopt cloud computing and hosted IT services.The Verizon-Terremark deal has less of a direct impact on the financial services market – although it does offer co-location services – but nevertheless strengthens the bullish sentiment running through the data centre market. Analysts are expecting US groups such as Equinix and Savvis to see their earnings multiples rise.That US investors place a higher valuation on technology companies is a well worn argument but it is only a few months ago that the market sliced 20 per cent off the value of Equinix, the largest data centre operator, following a profits warning in October. That has been largely forgiven, it seems. Even Equinix’s share price has clawed back half its losses.Perhaps we should not be surprised why Interxion decided to list in New York. Its key shareholders are Americans, as is its chief executive. Nevertheless it is a blow to Europe and London in particular. The region encompasses all of Interxion’s business while the UK capital is home to one of its most important data centres and its closest peer, Telecity.But it reinforces the perception that the US is not only the place to go but where the market is understood. As Asia and Latin America build out their trading networks, expect US money and knowhow to be at the forefront of development.
30;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2010-12-13T15:59:27Z;Burgundy makes Verizon complaint;;Verizon, the US telecommunications group, has been reported to Sweden’s competition authority over allegations that it has barred a rival of Nasdaq OMX, the New York-based exchange operator, from its network infrastructure.Burgundy, a Stockholm-based trading platform owned by several of the biggest Nordic financial institutions and which competes with Nasdaq OMX’s Nordic stock exchanges, said Verizon was “choosing sides” in the trading industry by allowing Nasdaq OMX exclusive access to a data centre in Sweden.The dispute highlights how data centres are becoming controversial parts of market infrastructure amid a technology arms race in share and derivatives trading. This is intensifying as exchanges, banks and brokers compete to build the fastest and most efficient trading platforms in an era when transaction speeds are measured in split seconds.Traders locate their computer trading systems in data centres in order to be close to an exchange’s trading system, shaving crucial microseconds off the time taken for trades to be done. Regulators are trying to ensure that operators of data centres allow access to them free of discrimination between types of market participant. While exchanges operate their own data centres, many are also run by independent operators such as Verizon, Nasdaq-listed Equinix and Interxion, a large European data centre specialist.The use of data centres for this purpose is a relatively recent development. But the phenomenon is growing amid the rise of “high-frequency” trading, where traders use computer algorithms to trade in and out of shares and derivatives at high speed.Verizon’s data centre, near Stockholm, is not only used by Nasdaq OMX but also by most of the country’s biggest banks and brokers, allowing them to connect directly to Nasdaq OMX’s trading platform.Burgundy claims that by barring rival operators from the facility, Verizon is allowing Nasdaq OMX to execute transactions at a lower cost and higher speed. “We have been forced to find an alternative data centre 5km away from our customers and, in high-frequency trading, 5km is an eternity,” said Olof Neiglick, Burgundy’s chief executive. “It could be the difference between offering a competitive service and being left out.”Mr Neiglick said Verizon was initially keen to accept Burgundy’s business and the pair signed a contract in September. But the US company later cancelled the deal and informed Burgundy it had a “one exchange” policy in its data centres.He said he could not prove Verizon had come under pressure from Nasdaq OMX but noted that the US exchange operator was a big customer of Verizon in North America and Europe.Verizon and Nasdaq OMX declined to comment. People familiar with Verizon said it would be unusual in the exchange industry for more than one operator to share the same data centre.Burgundy, whose owners include large Scandinavian banks such as Nordea, SEB and Danske, was launched last year as a challenger to Nasdaq OMX, which dominates the Nordic trading landscape.Mr Neiglick said Burgundy would meet competition regulators this week to press the case that Verizon is abusing its position as the main data centre provider to Sweden’s trading community.“With high-frequency trading it is becoming more and more important for an exchange to be physically close to its customers’ machines,” he said. “Verizon is choosing sides on who can compete. If this is the new norm, data centres need to be regulated.”Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London

Whirlpool said sales growth had slowed significantly in the third quarter, while Electrolux warned about rising raw materials costs.Analysts also noted news that Hollysys, a Chinese engineer, would begin supplying its own specification of control systems to the nation’s nuclear industry.“Invensys, which has signed orders for six Chinese reactors to date, is faced with a potential tough new competitor,” said Unicredit. “Foreign automation suppliers will continue to be squeezed out of what is becoming the world’s largest nuclear market.”Hollysys in 2005 formed a joint venture with China Guangdong, the state-owned nuclear power corporation, to develop proprietary automation systems. The groups said on Wednesday they had completed development of Hollysys’s own technology that “meets or surpasses all the functional matrix compared with foreign systems”.Invensys, which is due to report interim results on November 4, makes about $400m from its contracts with China Nuclear Power Engineering, Unicredit said.Miners led the wider market lower as a stronger dollar weighed on metals prices.

US competitor Equinix, which warned on profits earlier in October, said overnight that European growth had nevertheless remained robust.A Morgan Stanley upgrade helped lift Halfordsby 4 per cent to 425¾p. The shares are at a 31 per cent discount to the retail sector and offer a double-digit cash flow yield, which puts them on a similar valuation to HMV even though Halfords does not face similar structural challenges, Morgan Stanley said.Vague bid speculation helped squeeze Croda, the speciality chemicals maker, up 1.3 per cent to £15.15. Continued takeover hopes also helped Catlin, the Lloyds insurer, which was up 0.6 per cent to 350p.CSRlost 10.3 per cent to 309½p after the bluetooth chipmaker warned that its loss of smartphone market share would hit revenues for the fourth quarter and into 2011.

32;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2010-08-03T00:41:01Z;Telecity spurred on by data contract wins;;Telecity has pledged to increase its profitability further after beating the margin targets it set at its flotation three years ago.Mike Tobin, chief executive, said the second half would see a “slightly higher growth rate than the first” after “outstanding” contract wins in June and July.Sales of Telecity’s data-centre services rose 14.7 per cent to £93.7m ($148.8m) in the first half of the year, adjusted for currency fluctuations.Financial services customers have been a large source of growth, buying capacity for commodity- and energy-trading platforms. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 were broadly flat at £14.3m, after a £200m debt refinancing cost the company £10.3m.Earnings per share fell from 7p to 6.4p.On an operating basis, margins rose to 40.4 per cent, from 35.7 per cent in the same period a year ago.Telecity’s shares closed 2p higher at 435p.● FT CommentTelecity’s shares had a strong run leading up to these results, which came in slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts, as rumours resurfaced of a bid from Equinix, its US rival. Mr Tobin declined to comment on the speculation. Telecity’s valuation prices in much of the continuing improvement promised by the company. It trades at 18.6 times Citigroup’s 2011 forecast earnings. Analysts at Jefferies said an Equinix bid was “unlikely in the near term” as it integrated an earlier acquisition.
33;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Moving closer to speed up trade;A trend is taking hold for co-location and proximity hosting to speed up trade;In trading, it’s distance that matters, not size.Being as close as possible to the action in a trading pit was how traders got the best prices and overheard the best information.Now, in an electronic age, a race is on as exchanges look to get traders as close as possible to the action in a different way: by offering them space in custom-built facilities where they can place their computer trading systems – or “black boxes” – next to the exchange’s computer trade matching system.Known as “co-location”, the practice helps cut milliseconds off the time it takes for buy or sell messages to be sent into and back from an exchange.Recent weeks have seen a flurry of announcements by exchanges in Australia, Singapore, Canada and Switzerland that they are either building or expanding facilities that allow co-location and a similar service called “proximity hosting”.Co-location facilities are simply data centres filled with racks for rows of computer servers. NYSE Euronext has built a hangar-sized centre 30 miles outside London, matching a similar sized facility in New Jersey, with floor space covering three football fields.The latest to embrace the concept was TMX Group, operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, which this month said it had completed a facility with 200 co-location spaces allowing connections to its equities and derivatives platforms simultaneously.The trend is taking hold in less developed markets too. Earlier this year the National Stock Exchange of India launched co-location, a few months after the Mexican bolsa and its derivatives subsidiary, MexDer.Most of the demand is coming from high-frequency traders trying to execute trades faster than rivals. They are a rich new source of revenue for exchanges, which benefit by the added volume generated as well as from charging for renting out rack space.The cost of renting a data centre rack ranges from £2,500-£6,500 a month, depending on whether power connections and other services are included.However, co-location has been swept up in the wider scrutiny of market structures by regulators scrambling to get up to speed with technological advances and the way they have changed how participants access markets.Regulators insist that co-location facilities – also operated by independent companies such as Nasdaq-listed Equinix and Interxion of the Netherlands – must offer the same level of access, so as not to allow discriminationbetween trading firms.Earlier this month the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures markets watchdog, proposed new rules for colocation requiring that it be available “to all qualified market participants willing to pay for the services”.Stanley Young, chief executive of NYSE Technologies, says that the group is working on the assumption that regulators will insist that prices are made public too. It has already ensured that no trader gets trades done faster than others merely by being a few feet closer than someone else’s black box.“The obligation will be on the exchange to ensure equality of access.”
34;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
35;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;SIX betters access for high-frequency traders;;"The Swiss exchange on Monday became the latest bourse to improve access for algorithmic traders, upgrading the system that handles incoming orders, abolishing a charge levied to customers for using additional order-handling capacity and adding Equinix and Interxion as extra “proximity hosting” service providers.SIX Swiss Exchange has for some time used Colt for proximity hosting, a process where trading groups place their servers not next to an exchange’s servers – as with “colocation” – but in a separate building usually not far from the exchange.It is now adding US-based Equinix and Interxion of the Netherlands.Christian Katz, chief executive of the exchange, said the provision of choice would appeal to “remote” exchange members – that is, members outside Switzerland – whether they be high-frequency trading groups, banks that use high-frequency strategies or others.The Swiss exchange operates two “gateways” through which orders come: the “capacity trading interface” (CTI), generally used for large amounts of orders and typically used by groups using high-frequency trading strategies; and a standard gateway known as STI.The exchange previously allocated extra capacity to members using the CTI, depending on their liquidity commitment levels, but charged them for that. The charge has been dropped.Mr Katz said: “It basically allows members who need more capacity to have that available to them without paying additionally for it.”The exchange said the developments marked “an important step in the exchange’s continuous roadmap to satisfy an ever-growing need for higher turnover and lower latency”.“Further measures will include improvements to the trading interfaces to even better support automated trading and direct market access and will be made available in the second half,” the exchange added.Last week the ASX exchange in Australia and SGX in Singapore made similar upgrades to their systems."
36;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2010-05-03T15:37:32Z;Equinix chief gives reassurance on pricing;;The largest independent operator of data centres with fast internet connections would not raise prices after completing the acquisition of its nearest US competitor on Friday, Steve Smith, Equinix chief executive, told the Financial Times.Mr Smith’s pledge should provide reassurance to Equinix customers who had complained to the US Justice Department about the concentration of power in quality co-location centres, where companies rent high-security computer storage and pay for electricity and their choice of telecommunications connections. Regulators had asked for a second tranche of information about the $689m acquisition of Switch and Data Facilities announced in October before approving it a week ago.While little-known outside of the technology world, Silicon Valley-based Equinix delivers traffic for the largest content companies on the web, including Google’s YouTube, social networking groups such as Facebook and Twitter, and Amazon and other top electronic commerce providers.Unlike “server farms” that store massive amounts of data in often remote and less expensive areas, Equinix has downtown facilities that act as peering exchanges, where big carries such as AT&T and Verizon come together and pass data on to one another.In part, because those facilities can move information out over the internet fastest, Equinix charges more than other data storage operations, including Florida-based Switch and Data.“It’s like real estate. Everyone wants to be where everybody else is,” said Stephan Beckert, analyst at TeleGeography.Smaller companies provide high-end competition for Equinix in cities such as London, Frankfurt, New York and Los Angeles, but none can offer as many facilities worldwide, Mr Beckert said.Mr Smith said that Equinix has raised prices by between 3 and 5 per cent annually as customer contracts come up for renewal and that rather than accelerating the pace with Switch and Data, “some day that will flatten out”.Equinix is especially strong with electronic trading operations, which need to send and receive information as rapidly as possible, and it is benefiting from the booms in video and social gaming. In the most recent quarter, it reported a 25 per cent jump in revenue to $249m and net income of $14m, depressed by its continuing new construction.Equinix shares rose to $100.65 on Friday, for a market capitalisation of $4bn, from a 52-week-low of $63.69 last May.The company expects to get more business from cloud computing, since its infrastructure can connect rapidly to hosting services run by Amazon, Microsoft and others.Mr Smith said that his next big ambition was to capitalise on the demand for data delivered to smartphones and other mobile devices.That could take the company from a predicted $2bn in annual revenue within five years to $3bn, he said, adding: “Mobile data is a huge opportunity.”
37;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2010-02-11T10:58:34Z;‘Colocation’ race as Equinix expands;;The explosive growth of so-called “colocation” services was highlighted on Thursday when Equinix, a Nasdaq-listed technology company, said it had opened two new data centres in Germany.Colocation allows traders to physically place their computer servers next to an exchange’s matching engine to shave crucial milliseconds off the time it takes for trades to be done.A technology arms race is under way in the equities and derivatives trading markets as traders – especially high-frequency traders – seek to get trades done as fast as possible. Colocation has emerged as a popular way to do this, with exchanges offering colocation and specialist data centre operators like Equinix doing the same.Equinix said it was opening a new “international business exchange” (IBX) data centre in Düsseldorf, a second in Frankfurt and expanding an existing data centre in Frankfurt.The moves were billed as part of a $1.4bn global expansion plan.Deutsche Börse has offered colocation, which is also called “proximity hosting” since 2006. In November it said 100 trading firms were using it.Equinix said it had started opening its second IBX centre in Frankfurt, known as FR4, in an investment worth $30m (€21m). Located south-west of the German financial centre, it has 6,000 square metres of data centre space, which will be expanded to 12,000 square metres.In the north of the city, the planned $18m expansion of the existing, FR2 centre would add 2,500 square metres of data centre space, with capacity for about 660 cabinets, where computer servers are stacked on top of each other. The FR2 expansion would be completed in phases, between April and September, Equinix said.The expansions were being done because Equinix was seeing “significant growth in demand to participate” in its data centres.The company described the IBX concept as “a community of execution venues, buy- and sell-side firms and technology utilities” operating in data centres “to optimise trading operations”.Equinix operates four data centres in Frankfurt, all of which are directly linked, “enabling all Frankfurt-based customers to interconnect as if they were in the same physical location”, the company said.Eric Schwartz, president of Equinix in Europe, said: “Equinix is seeing strong demand for colocation and interconnection services in Frankfurt, with significant growth coming from the city’s financial services industry.“Demand for premier data centre services continues to outpace supply across all major European metro regions,” he added.
38;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Telecity at 16-month high on soaring demand;;Increased demand for data storage has boosted shares in Telecity after the group revealed trading for the first four months of the year ahead of market expectations.The Docklands-based group said revenue growth to May across its European market had been sustained at the 36 per cent growth level seen in 2008, adding new customers such as MTN, the African mobile phone network, and Zain, the Middle Eastern telecoms group.Demand for space from Telecity’s data centres has been so great that the group has already announced plans to increase capacity in London, Amsterdam and Paris, while the previous quarter saw it open new facilities in Milan and Stockholm.The news pushed shares up 22p to 287½p on Tuesday, more than double their price in January. Telecity was the last major technology flotation on the stock market before investor appetite turned against new issues, in October 2007 when it listed at 220p.Telecity’s comments about the market echoed similar results last week from US rivals such as Equinix, with companies looking to cut costs from expensive in-house data centres.Mike Tobin, chief executive of Telecity, said he expected customers’ spot prices to rise another 3 -5 per cent in the coming year, in line with industry rivals.
39;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2008-04-24T02:21:37Z;IT & Telecommunications: Home for technology giants and minnows;;The past 20 years have seen the Thames Valley develop from a relative backwater to become a vital European hub for the telecommunications and information technology industries.Almost 80 per cent of inward investment to the region in 2006-07 was within the IT, software and communications sector and so vital has it become that it is sometimes nicknamed “Europe’s Silicon Valley”.It is home to both extensive operations of the world’s largest names and the ambitions of start-up companies alike, with Vodafone, Siemens, Hutchison 3G and Ericsson just some of the many companies based there. Only this February, Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry mobile e-mail device, opened its European headquarters on Slough Trading Estate.Sometimes the region’s nickname appears to take on a literal meaning as 50 per cent of new investments to the region comes from US west coast technology companies looking to expand into the UK and the rest of Europe. Microsoft, Oracle, Dell and Cisco Systems all have large research and development centres.Smaller start-up companies from Europe, including France and the Czech Republic, are also attracted by the region. According to the annual investment review for the area published by the Thames Valley Economic Partnership, 54 foreign-owned, high-growth businesses have invested in the region for the first time in the last year.Companies from around the world have been attracted by a skilled, mobile workforce, the transport hub of Heathrow, the proximity to London, competitive tax breaks and – especially for North American companies – an English-speaking population.“More than 1m UK jobs depend on the success of the ICT sector which generates more than 6 per cent of GDP. Its importance to our economy is unquestionable,” says Lord Digby Jones, the former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. “It is no coincidence that many ICT firms have their European HQ as well as their research and development operation based here,” he adds.“The Thames Valley has been a feeding ground for ideas rather than a manufacturing centre,” says Karl Havers, head of Ernst & Young’s UK technology practice, and based at its Reading office.The increasing convergence between technology and telecom worlds has created a wealth of opportunities that are being filled by small, dynamic companies.The software industry in particular is rapidly growing as it evolves to become the “brain” within technology hardware. Last year saw 67 per cent of the investors looking to expand into the UK offering software related products and services.As in previous years, companies from North America accounted for around 60 per cent of the new investment, but companies from the Asia Pacific region are also moving in. Japan’s Just Systems, which provides XML and service oriented architecture, is locating its European headquarters in Slough.A virtuous circle has also been created in which companies are finding it easier to look for skilled local talent. According to the Thames Valley Economic Partnership, 55 per cent of the UK’s software workforce in the south-east is based in the Thames Valley.Markets are also being created for ancillary and infrastructure services. Small companies, such as France’s Mobilgov, are striving to improve corporate and organisational security, both online and against the threat from the use of unauthorised equipment, such as PDAs, smartphones, USB sticks, and external and internal hard drives.New datacentres are being built to contain the vast consumption of data from telecoms companies and internet service providers such as O2, Vodafone and Orange. IX Europe, bought last year by its US peer Equinix, will relocate its largest London datacentre to a new £15m ($29m) centre built in Slough.Other companies in the region include Newbury-based Micro Focus, which supports and extends the life of legacy software based on Cobol software coding that still performs vital functions in large companies.All have realised that it is vital to be physically located close to partners and resellers of their technology.Yet the region’s fortunes remain closely tied to the world’s technology and telecom world. Old-timers remember that many US companies pulled out of the area in the wake of the dotcom slump, while even as recently as 2005, there was a surplus of office space.Despite fears about a slowdown in global technology spending, there is little evidence of large-scale pull-outs, according to Mike Baker, partner at Strutt & Parker, the property consultants. Although overall office take-up for the region was down from 1m sq ft a year ago to 623,000, the computer and technology sector’s market share remained the same. “The sector is more than holding its own,” he says.But Mr Havers at E&Y warns that the evolving nature of technology means companies also have to change, particularly in the type of staff they recruited.“If you need to work across cultures, you need to get it right,” he cautions. “You will get all sorts of partnerships. If you’re selling a product, you’ll also need to sell the best service. You’re talking about trust and relationships.”
40;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2006-09-08T16:38:24Z;Starts-ups may be lovelier the second time around;;When Jay Adelson was asked to speak at an internet conference in the Netherlands in July, he had a problem since he was still in San Francisco. But for the conference organisers this was no difficulty. They put Adelson, the chief executive of digg, a news-ranking site, on an “ichat” videoconferencing service and interviewed him in front of 200 people in Amsterdam while he sat in his office.Although the audience could see him, he couldn’t see them. But that didn’t matter. Many used their mobile phones to photograph Adelson, 35, and uploaded the pictures to Flickr, the new online public photo-sharing site. “You could see every line on my face,” Adelson says.Digg is one of the most successful of the new wave of start-up companies whose activities and services have given the internet a fresh lease of life after the crash of 2000. But how do investors get involved with what has been called Web 2.0? Unlike the internet entrepreneurs of the 1990s who rushed for stock market listings and guzzled investors’ cash, the nature of the business the new companies are in – digg’s news sharing rather than Amazon’s expensive e-commerce – means they may not be looking for outside millions in such a hurry. In spite of the immense buzz and excitement surrounding companies such as Flickr, digg, MySpace and Bebo, the opportunities for ordinary investors to take part may be limited.The principle behind Web 2.0 is that millions of internet users come together in cyberspace to be part of online communities. This is driven by the ubiquity of the internet – a billion people are now online and many have access to relatively cheap high-speed internet.There has also been a generational shift. Young people have grown up with the web and are willing to socialise and share personal information online. Some of the first new online communities were sites for people seeking to meet other people, such as MySpace or Facebook. But the latest tend to involve people socialising while they are doing something else. Flickr users share some of their most intimate photographs. On del.icio.us, they swap internet bookmarks. YouTube users post home video clips for a potential audience of several million. On digg, people post their favourite news stories and the site’s community votes on them.About 4,000-5,000 articles are posted on digg daily. The 450,000 registered users who have created online profiles can vote for – or “digg” – a story they like. They can also press a button to “bury” one they don’t.The most popular stories rise to the site’s front page. At first, digg focused on technology but it has recently opened to all news. “Digg uses the collective wisdom of the crowd to filter news,” says Adelson. “You are giving choice. Instead of giving someone a limited view, you are allowing them to choose what the media should say. We expected a few hundred people. Now there are 450,000 registered users. They get most of their news from digg.”Sites such as digg, Flickr and YouTube are free. Digg’s business plan is to make money from advertising. The reliance on advertising is helped by what some of these entrepreneurs see as a new generation of advertisers. Services such as Google’s Adsense have given people who would not have advertised on the web before a means to do so.“It went from being traditional online ad agencies and media buyers to a broad base of advertisers, everyone from cat breeders in Minnesota,” says the chief executive of one of the new businesses who prefers not to be named. “It is not just traditional advertisers but it is also all of the people who never thought of advertising. Now they can do that by going to Google Adsense and putting in their credit card.”While the companies are benefiting from what they see as a revolution in advertiser behaviour, they are also supported by the fact that the costs of the new companies are lower than they were in the first internet boom. Compared with a decade ago, the cost of computing power has fallen dramatically. “To start a business 10 years ago, something that is so dependent on telecommunications would have certainly been an expensive proposition,” says Adelson. “One in 100 ideas could get funded. Today it costs almost nothing.”With Ning, a site that allows users to mix and match tools and build their application, the costs fall to zero since Ning hosts the site for nothing. It has about 17,500 applications running on it.In addition, the companies do not need the big workforces of the previous wave that were once hired by the likes of Amazon. They are not setting up complicated online retailing operations. Typically the users do most of the work. On digg, for example, it is the users who post stories, sort them, and create the home page for others to see.All this means the new companies’ thirst for outside capital has been modest. In October when digg looked for funding, it turned to a small group of high-profile angel investors, including Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, a business networking site, and Marc Andreessen, Netscape co-founder, and two venture capital firms, Greylock Partners and the Omidyar Network, led by one of the founders of Ebay. Digg raised a fairly small $2.8m.Adelson says: “People were like, ‘Why don’t you raise $12m? You could, you know.” But I have got 17 people at digg. That is all it takes, I feel. If you are an information peddler, what are the economics of information and what is the cost of doing it when your workforce is the primary user?”Not only are they not turning on the taps of venture capital, the new companies are avoiding the stock market. Many of the entrepreneurs in the latest boom were around during Nasdaq’s collapse after 2000 when investor confidence in the technological sea change – which appeared to be coming from Silicon Valley and which had built up spectacularly in the late 1990s – suddenly evaporated.This has made them wary of initial public offerings. Adelson was the founder of Equinix, a data centre provider, which listed on Nasdaq. He says getting a listing distracts young companies from innovation and growth. “Nobody wants to do an IPO any more,” he says.David Sze, general partner at Greylock, says: “The financing environment for these companies is overheated now relative to these realities,” He concedes there will be “a large number of failures”.But he believes there are differences compared with the first internet bubble. He says companies need much less capital and fewer people, so less capital will be wasted in the failures. Also, he says, the models for generating revenue are more defined and successful, there are far more users with higher-bandwidth connections spending much more time online and there are big public companies looking at strategically partnering and acquiring the new breed of Web 2.0 companies.Thus when companies have sought more funding or an exit strategy, they have preferred a corporate sale. Among those sold, Flickr and del.icio.us were bought by Yahoo. MySpace went to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation last year for $580m.The diminished thirst for funding and the avoidance of the stock market may limit the opportunity for smaller investors to take part directly in Web 2.0. For the time being, the best way for investors to become involved is as angel investors – if they can – or to buy into venture capital funds that are specialising in this field.All this may change as the new companies expand and their ambitions grow. Memories of the Nasdaq crash could dim. The corporate exit route may become more difficult as most of the likely purchasers such as Yahoo have already made big acquisitions.Of course, investors may not want to get involved. Since the threshold cost of starting new companies is lower, bad ideas may get through more easily. Some of the new companies such as Bebo and digg say they are profitable but many of the new generation are yet to break even.Even for those companies that are profitable, it is possible that the millions that have flooded to their sites will be fickle and move on to the next fad. And, even if online social networking is here to stay, it is not clear whether users will remain loyal to any one particular site.Friendster, for example, was once the leading social networking site but dramatically lost ground to MySpace. And even if they stay loyal, will all those users actually buy anything? If not, the advertising revenue will dry up.At present, business optimism about the new sites is predicated on a sharp rise in online advertising spending. But that expectation may be wrong. Some investors may be wary that Web 2.0 could follow the previous internet cycle and become Bust 2.0.Digg will be trying to prove them wrong. For his part, Adelson is clear that, just as the new companies are different from last time round, investors have to take a different approach too. “You have to be willing to make much longer-term investments,” he says. “It is not a one-year return on investment. It is a five-year return on investment.”
41;EQIX;Equinix Inc;2006-06-13T00:40:54Z;Funds sue amid probe into timing of options;;Shareholder anger over US executive compensation practices spilled into the open on Monday as two big US pension funds sued companies involved in an investigation into the timing of stock-option awards.Darren Robbins, a partner at Lerach Coughlin, said his San Diego law firm was also representing pension funds in Europe and Australia that were preparing similar action.“People are very upset about this. There have been at least five pension funds that have filed cases in the last 72 business hours in court houses from California to Boston,” he told the Financial Times.McAfee, a software security maker, was sued on Monday in federal court in the Northern District of California by the Heavy & General Laborers’ Pension and Annuity Funds, alleging “constructive fraud” through the backdating of stock options.Juniper Networks, a technology company, was hit with a similar complaint by the Employer-Teamsters Pension Health and Welfare Funds. Neither McAfee nor Juniper were immediately available for comment.Mr Robbins said his firm had been directed to take similar action by clients “in at least 34 different situations”.Four separate companies revealed on Monday that they were being investigated by regulators over their options grants. More than 40 companies have become ensnared in one of the widest criminal and regulatory investigations into white-collar compensation in recent years. The probe is emerging as a test of years of executive compensation practices and has started to draw the anger of unions.The AFL-CIO said last week that the stock option backdating scandal “shares many similarities to the after-hours trading of mutual funds, where favoured insiders received preferential terms that were hidden from public investors”.Four companies – Broadcom, Equinix, Applied Micro Circuits and Cyberonics – said they were the subject of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Monster Worldwide, the operator of an online recruitment site, said it had formed an independent committee of directors to conduct an internal review of all stock options grants made by the company.Investigations are focusing on the award of stock options to executives on dates that immediately preceded a sharp rise in the companies' share prices.Such a move would immediately have put the options “in the money”, requiring proper disclosure to shareholders. Some companies have been hit with class-action lawsuits from public pension funds alleging that no such disclosure was made and that shareholders were defrauded.The focus of investigations is in the years before 2002, when tough Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance rules limited the scope for backdating of options.New accounting rules requiring options expensing were introduced last year.
