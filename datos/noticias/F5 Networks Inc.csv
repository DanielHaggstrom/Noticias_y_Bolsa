0;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2016-02-22T05:00:24Z;How to keep your mobile phone safe from cyber criminals;More than 1m malicious programs are targeting phones;"Mobile malware took off in 2011. That is when hackers began serious attacks on mobile phones, says David Emm, principal security researcher, at Kaspersky Lab, a cyber security company.“At that point, the data became worth stealing, and since then growth has been exponential,” Mr Emm says. He estimates 1m new malicious codes were found on devices by 2015. “The actual number of attacks is much bigger than this because each program tends to be used many times.”Early attacks focused on causing handsets silently to call premium rate numbers. Then hackers diversified into phishing — creating spoof websites that trick people into revealing account numbers and login details.Phishing still accounts for the overwhelming number of attacks on mobiles, says Mr Emm, although ransomware — locking data and demanding payment for its release — is also big, accounting for 17 per cent of the total across all platforms, according to Kaspersky’s research.Most phone attacks are on handsets that use the Android operating system because of its large market share and flexible, open technology. Apple’s iPhones use proprietary technology which is more difficult to breach.“Android is like having a room with lots of doors as opposed to a cave with a single entrance,” Mr Emm says. But Apple is not immune.In 2015, many app developers unwittingly downloaded a malicious version of Xcode — Apple’s official tool for building apps — from a file-sharing website. Among scores of apps infected were WeChat, a messaging app popular in China, and CamCard, a popular business card reader in the US.Although Apple vets the apps sold through its app store, the infected programs were not initially detected. They were made available and widely used.Mobile phone security is challenging because devices are designed to connect in many different ways, says Ben Johnson, chief security strategist at Carbon Black, a security software company. “Whether it is a text message, email, web browsing, Bluetooth or near-field communication (NFC) connectivity, each method of communication is a potential attack route.”The next battleground will be biometric data such as thumbprints, iris or voiceAs human interaction is the main purpose of a mobile device, Mr Johnson adds, there are more chances to trick users. “People are much more likely to click on malicious images or videos sent to a mobile phone than to a PC, because it feels more familiar and natural.”Phones are also often set to connect automatically and display quick preview images, data or text. “This makes it possible to exploit a system without the recipient opening or ‘clicking’ anything,” Mr Johnson says.Media companies worried as ad blocking goes mobile
Software companies are accused of running an ‘extortion racket’Pharma companies looking at using video games for healthcare
Neurological conditions such as autism, ADHD and depression may respond to ‘digital therapies’The media sector is worried as ad blocking moves to mobile phones
Software companies are accused of running an ‘extortion racket’Defending against the most serious attacks is difficult, says Ian Evans, a vice-president and managing director at VMware Airwatch. “If the main source of the threat is a nation state agency, you’re best to just throw your phone away.”However, simple steps can help against more common hackers. You should use a passcode or complex PIN on your device to protect it in case of loss or theft, says Mr Evans. “And it is best to avoid connecting to public WiFi networks. If the WiFi is not encrypted, somebody could intercept data including passwords. If you have to do so, make sure you always use a virtual private network to connect to sensitive resources.”Also, do not “jailbreak” your mobile devices, he says. This is a process whereby users remove operating system restrictions so that they can customise their phone and download apps not normally allowed. “Jailbreaking negates your warranty and exposes you to more potential malware,” says Keiron Shepherd, senior security specialist at F5 Networks, a cyber security company.Phones with hardware-based encryption tend to offer stronger protection than software encryption, says Mr Evans. “The encryption key is stored on a chip, which acts like a safe.” But Android handsets continue to lack dependable hardware-based encryption, Mr Evans says.Sometimes phones are compromised during production, as happened in 2014 when a factory-installed “Trojan horse” was found on the Star N9500 Android smartphone, made in China and sold by companies such as Amazon and eBay. It enabled hackers to operate the phone remotely and, being embedded at the factory, could not be removed.The next battleground between hackers and phone owners will be biometric data such as thumbprints, iris or voice profile. At present, hackers rarely use biometrics to circumnavigate security because there are many easier paths, says Mr Shepherd. “This is likely to change. The problem is that if your password is discovered you can quickly change it, whereas once biometric data are compromised, that’s it.”This article has been amended on February 24 to reflect the fact that 1m new malicious codes had been found on mobile devices by 2015, rather than in 2015."

Today, it might be better to think of it as the thing that knows the most about you.Drive a new car out of a showroom and hundreds of sensors, scanners and cameras begin tracking every aspect of your driving, as the car’s communication systems link you to the outside world.These systems make you safer and help you reach your destination more easily. But they also open up previously undreamt of revenue streams for carmakers, insurers and telecoms companies. And they present a privacy and security minefield.“Data transmitted from a connected car could tell someone a lot about the driver,” says Prasad Satyavolu, head of innovation at Cognizant Technology Solutions. “How fast [and how well] they drive, where they are, what routes they take, what times they typically drive, even what music they listen to.”Mr Satyavolu, whose company builds connected car systems for a range of manufacturers, says: “There are benefits to carmakers and insurers from the data, but with consumers more aware of data privacy than ever, it is important that there is transparency on which data are shared, with whom and why.”Electronics appeared on the dashboard in the 1930s with the first in-car radio and cassette players arriving 30 years later. General Motors introduced emergency services monitoring systems in 1996, while satellite capability first appeared commercially in the 1980s.Today’s cars can boast iPad applications, full mobile communication systems, and technology that allows for complete remote monitoring of telemetry and component status, such as engine temperature or reporting a broken windscreen wiper.That means drivers can check their emails, stream music, call home and spot the nearest McDonald’s, while also benefiting from safety alerts, fuel efficient route recommendations and automated scheduling of parts servicing.A car thief can open some of the most modern cars just by using a computer and radio equipmentGM is now leading the rollout of camera technology that can track eye movements and spot distracted drivers, while Ford is close to commercialising car seats that detect potential heart attacks.Having access to data from cars could be lucrative for almost all in the automotive revenue chain. Carmakers could use in-car data to see which functions are used and those that are ignored, helping them fine-tune future features.Insurance companies could find out how safely cars are driven, or tailor policies according to how often a car is serviced. The number of insurance policies in the UK tied to telematics, or a monitoring device in the car, trebled between 2011 and 2013 to 300,000.Advertisers could also use time and route information to discover what offers would be most relevant to drivers.“As long as consumers have the ability to opt in and can see the benefits of sharing their data, and manufacturers are putting in place measures to anonymise and store data safely, then it should be down to the individual to determine the line between cost savings and their data use,” says Mr Satyavolu.The demand seems to be strong. According to a survey of developed car markets by Accenture, 56 per cent of drivers would like to read and dictate emails while at the wheel and 52 per cent want cars that identify traffic signals, accidents and traffic congestion.The pace of innovation – and a race between carmakers to be seen as the most cutting-edge – has pushed forward the implementation of always-connected technologies into today’s cars, while regulators have encouraged their adoption for safety reasons.The EU has implemented rules mandating the installation of an “eCall” system in new cars by the end of 2015, which wirelessly sends airbag impact sensor data with GPS information to emergency services if there is a crash.The eCall system will mean that wireless information gathering tools will be installed in almost 7m cars in Europe by 2016, according to research from the GSM Association of mobile telecom companies.The other side of the boom in wireless communication technology in cars concerns security. Hackers have shown that communication systems, such as tyre sensors, can be accessed and used to control other parts of the vehicle.“Currently, there is little or no security in cars,” says Gary Newe, director of field systems engineering at F5 Networks, a data networking and security company. “A car thief can open some of the most modern cars without a key, just by using a computer and radio equipment.”He adds: “The fact we are starting to connect these cars to the internet, and share data between consumers, manufacturers and others, should concern everyone.”
2;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2013-04-05T20:28:21Z;Wall St stocks hit by slowing jobs growth;;US stock indices recovered some of the early losses on Friday but recorded the steepest weekly declines this year after disappointing jobs data raised concerns that federal budget cuts are beginning to affect the economy.The US added just 88,000 jobs in March, far less than economists expected and the slight drop in the unemployment rate to 7.6 per cent was largely explained by the diminishing labour force.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,553.28 and recorded a 1 per cent drop on the week, the sharpest decline this year.Over the past week, materials and technology stocks were the worst performers, while investors sought solace in defensive stocks, such as healthcare and telecoms, which registered modest gains.“It is too early to say if the weak numbers are solely due to sequestration. It could be a payback for strong job growth in January and February,” said Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector research at Charles Schwab.“Markets had a very good run so far this year and we would view pullbacks, even deeper corrections, as buying opportunities, as we think markets will continue to rise in the longer term because our economy continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace,” he added.Technology stocks were among the worst hit, with the S&P 500 subsector index down 1 per cent and shedding 2.9 per cent over the week.F5 Networks was the worst performer, shedding 17.8 per cent on the week to $73.21, after a 19 per cent fall on Friday, after the maker of network equipment and seller of information technology cut its outlook for the first quarter, citing disappointing results from its North American business.The move prompted several analysts to cut their ratings on the stock. Piper Jaffray, Topeka Capital and Citi downgraded the stock as a result.The rating of rival Juniper Networks was lowered to “equal weight” by analysts at Barclays, and stock in the company fell 3.1 per cent to $17.55, adding to a 5.3 per cent weekly decline. Cisco Systems shares fell 2 per cent to $20.61 and were 1.4 per cent lower on the week.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 3,203.86 and was down 0.8 per cent on the week.Shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, fell 0.9 per cent to $423.94 and lost 1.9 per cent over the week.Other large technology companies were also hit. Over the past week Oracle lost 0.9 per cent to $32.03 while Google shed 1.4 per cent to $783.05.Struggling PC maker Hewlett-Packard shed 7.8 per cent of its value trading at $21.97 this week, after losing 1.5 per cent on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, fell 0.3 per cent to 14,490.41 and lost 0.1 per cent over the week.Healthcare stocks were one of the best performing sectors this week, after the US government announced it would not cut a key Medicare payment rate but increase it instead. Insurers benefited, recording solid weekly gains.UnitedHealth Group gained 8.5 per cent to $62.10 over the week. Humana, even after falling 1.7 per cent on Friday, stood 13.2 per cent higher on the week.Shares in Aetna added 5.6 per cent to $53.99 over the week, although they lost 1.1 per cent on Friday.Even though energy stocks were largely shunned this week, natural gas producers rallied on Friday after data showed inventories decreased and were 1.8 per cent below five-year average levels, due to colder weather and less drilling.WPX Energy shares rallied 5.2 per cent to $15.87, recording a 0.8 per cent weekly gain. Cabot Oil and Gas rose 5.1 per cent to $66.53 and was 0.5 per cent higher on the week.Chesapeake Energy rose 2.2 per cent to $19.75, but still lost 3.2 per cent over the past five days.The rise in gold prices following the disappointing jobs figures boosted gold miners in early trade, however rally was short lived.Newmont Mining closed 0.6 per cent higher to $39.37, while Goldcorp shares added 0.7 per cent to $31.79.JC Penney shares rallied 2.4 per cent to $15.45 after analysts at Gilford Securities upgraded the stock to “neutral”.
3;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2013-03-26T23:18:49Z;Trend for personal IT devices is a challenge for finance chiefs;Companies taking the bring-your-own-mobile route need strong policies in place to protect data, reports Paul Taylor;Finance directors in many companies will play a pivotal role in dealing with the two biggest trends sweeping through the business IT world: consumerisation – the use of products designed for the consumer market in corporate IT systems – and bring your own device (BYOD).A Gartner survey last December found 33 per cent of respondents’ organisations already had policies for mobile devices, while 70 per cent plan to have BYOD policies in the next 12 months to allow employees to use personal mobile devices to connect to corporate (known as enterprise) applications.Dionisio Zumerle, principal research analyst at Gartner, says: “Shifting from an enterprise-owned mobile device fleet to having employees bringing their own devices has a big impact on ways of thinking and acting about mobile security.“Policies and tools initially put in place to deal with mobile devices offering consumer-grade security must be revised to deal with these devices being under the ultimate control of a private user, rather than the organisation.”Ben Fried, Google’s chief information officer, agrees. “The consumerisation of IT is an unstoppable force sweeping through businesses and can drive considerable cost savings and innovation,” he says. “Enterprise users can’t be kept as a captive audience of the IT department, because alternatives to their in-house offerings are already running on their home computer, or are a click away in their web browser.“Successful chief information officers will have to give serious thought to the questions ‘is my service better than what my users already use at home? Is it good enough that my users would want to pay for it themselves?’”Mr Fried says his company “believes staff should find the technology they use at work inspiring and enable them to do their jobs without technical restrictions”. He adds that a BYOD approach can make sense provided the user is willing to allow their employer manage the device and apply corporate policies to it.For many companies, the BYOD trend began when senior executives brought mobile devices from home to the office and asked IT departments to link them to corporate networks. Chief financial officers in particular recognised the advantages of being able to access financial data and metrics from anywhere using mobile devices and secure web-based dashboards or dedicated apps.Vincent Geake, director of secure mobility at BAE Systems Detica, an information security company, says: “Businesses must acknowledge they cannot and should not prevent their chief financial officer from accessing key business metrics on his or her smartphone and tablet.“Instead, they need to assess the risk to the information on the device as they would with any other highly valuable asset, and implement the necessary security controls, since it will likely include some companies’ most sensitive information.”Google’s Mr Fried adds: “If organisations choose to go down the BYOD route, they need strong policies in place, from enforcing pin or screen locks, to putting the right diagnostics in place to know the identity of the device and who is using it.”Fernando Alvarez, head of mobile solutions at Capgemini, the IT services provider, says question a chief financial office should be asking include: “What assets are in use? What do we need to do to protect our company data? Is our intellectual property sufficiently protected? How do we manage the complexity of multiple mobile platforms in a single environment? How do we manage the bigger issue around governance and the wall between company and personal data?”And he warns: “Many of these questions have been overlooked because companies have not yet properly assessed the risk that BYOD brings.”Mr Geake says: “To be effective, BYOD policies must meet senior executive needs in a flexible and non-intrusive way, while giving full consideration to how to best manage the associated security risks.“In the days of the PC, the enterprise was able to mitigate this risk by implementing industry standard security across each desktop computer, providing a known level of protection using proven products on devices which they controlled and locked down.”Now, he says, employees work on a range of personal devices, so a company must assess the risk from devices that hold the most important information and consider whether they have invested in the necessary security measures to protect that information. Measures should include a combination of technology, usage policies and training.For Andy Travers, in charge of UK, Ireland and sub-Saharan Africa sales at F5 Networks, the appeal of BYOD is obvious: “Allowing employees to access their data on personal devices, from any location at any time, provides a number of benefits. They are likely to work more flexibly and efficiently, as well as gleaning more satisfaction from their jobs.“On the flipside – and the concern that’s held many businesses back – is the numerous security issues it raises as employees demand access to sensitive corporate data on unmanaged and potentially unsecured devices.”But he cautions that chief financial officers expecting to save money may be disappointed. “The concerns chief financial officers should have around BYOD should focus on the potential reputational damage a data breach or data loss could result in. It’s not simply a question of whether BYOD saves money, but the potential for lost revenue if they don’t have the right policies in place to protect their organisation. “Benjamin Alleau, vice-president of Capgemini Consulting, agrees. “A BYOD initiative need not always be cost effective, especially since additional investments are needed to support the use of personal devices in a business environment such as virtualisation or security reinforcement.“The business benefits, instead, appear to lie elsewhere [such as] employee satisfaction, employee mobility and productivity.”Mr Alvarez says that, while BYOD can increase worker flexibility and cut costs, the additional risk and operational burden on organisations needs to be considered. Overall, though, he believes the model “should be considered for creating business value that goes beyond cost savings”.
4;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2012-01-20T22:03:33Z;S&P 500 on cusp of bull market territory;;A week dominated by fourth-quarter results saw tech companies drive a rally that was belatedly joined by bank stocks and left the S&P 500 on the cusp of a bull market.Linear Technology sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks on Wednesday as the company said orders for circuit products had picked up in December and January, paving the way for a strong first quarter of 2012.Linear surged 10 per cent to $33.06 over the week while rivals Advanced Micro Devices, up 13.4 per cent to $6.42, and Jabil Circuit, which climbed 9.3 per cent to $23.00, benefited from the improved sentiment.“Historically, [Linear] has generally been right in guiding investors through the cycle bottoming process …usually seeing changes in demand before peers,” John Pitzer at Credit Suisse told clients.Wireless networking companies joined the rally on Wednesday. F5 Networks defied falling revenues from government clients to beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations.F5 climbed 12.6 per cent to $120.27, while rival Juniper Networks was up 9.2 per cent to $22.99, though some analysts were cautious about excessive valuations.“At over 24 times our full-year 2012-expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep [F5] moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.The tech rally accelerated at the end of the week as larger companies reported. Old tech appeared to dominate new as IBM, up 5.2 per cent to $188.52, and Microsoft, up 5.2 per cent to $29.71 outperformed Google, which slid 8.4 per cent on Friday alone to $585.99.On closer inspection, the contrasting share price performances were a result of very different factors.Google shares had climbed 2.3 per cent to the close on Thursday in anticipation of strong fourth- quarter results while Microsoft’s gains came in spite of a 6 per cent fall in sales at its core Windows business: analysts had simply been braced for worse.The tech rally left the Nasdaq Composite index up 2.8 per cent for the week to 2,786.7 while IBM and Microsoft helped the Dow climb 2.4 per cent to 12,720.48.The S&P 500 climbed 2 per cent over the week – now up 4.6 per cent for the year – and is on course for its best January in 15 years. The benchmark index has now climbed 19.7 per cent since its close on October 3, just short of the 20 per cent gain that would indicate a bull market.The CBOE Vix index of volatility in the S&P 500, commonly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, closed below 20 for the first time in almost six months on Thursday before falling to 18.4 on Friday, in a further indicator of bullish sentiment.But market participants warned against excessive optimism, noting high inflows into exchange-traded products that profit from a rise in volatility.“Risk assets have had a nice run of late but at least some investors are hedging their bets,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex.Bank earnings hugged the headlines over the week with investment banks the clear winners as Goldman Sachs climbed 9.9 per cent to $108.74 and Morgan Stanley climbed 10.6 per cent to $18.39 while there was one clear loser – Citigroup slumped 3.6 per cent over the week to $29.27.Investor enthusiasm for investment banking stocks was somewhat surprising, given the abysmal fourth-quarter trading volumes reported by most banks. Morgan Stanley was the one bank to buck the trend, however, while Goldman impressed investors by cutting deeply into costs by reducing staff and pay.“Expectations about pay in the industry have changed but clearly cutting headcount is not something that can be done every quarter,” said JJ Kinahan at TD Ameritrade. “Eventually, US banks need a kinder interest rate environment to generate sustainable earnings growth.”Bank of America climbed 7 per cent to $7.07 over the week, its highest close since October, as it reported a second successive quarter of profit, despite losses at its investment banking business.Credit card companies were the laggards of the financial sector with American Express virtually flat for the week while Capital One fell 5.9 per cent to $46.03 as the company spooked investors with higher than expected costs that pushed profit far below most analyst expectations.Goldman Sachs analysts said “further outperformance” by credit card companies was unlikely, despite several companies reporting an increase in outstanding loans and improving lending margins in the fourth quarter.“Spend volumes decelerated and expenses were elevated,” Goldman told clients.Overall, with 77 companies S&P 500 companies having reported by Friday afternoon, only 55 per cent have beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, one of the lowest rates in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“The market reacts positively to bad news [and] terrible earnings reports are ignored: [these are] signs of a bull market,” worried Mark Ivanhoff at Ivanhoff Capital.The rollercoaster ride continued for investors in Sears Holdings. The department store chain’s market capitalisation halved in the last two months of 2011 after the company announced store closures.But shares rose 46 per cent to $49 this week as an analyst suggested Edward Lampert, Sears’ chairman and a big shareholder, may take the troubled department store chain private, buying out other shareholders. Mr Lampert had increased his personal stake in the company last week.Marathon Petroleum climbed 12.5 per cent to $37.17 over the five day period as activist investor Jana Partners disclosed a 5.5 per cent stake in the refiner and promised to push for reforms to increase shareholder value.
5;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2012-01-19T22:09:43Z;Tech stocks shine as S&P 500 consolidates gains;BofA climbs on fourth-quarter profit;A strong day for tech stocks helped the S&P 500 consolidate gains to close above 1,300 for a second consecutive day, hitting a five-month high.F5 Networks rose 10.6 per cent to $120, after the computer network provider narrowly beat analyst expectations for fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a strong start to 2012, despite falling revenues from government clients.F5’s market cap has now increased fivefold since the start of 2009, leaving some analysts cautious about the potential for further gains. “At over 24 times our full year 2012 expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep the stock moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.F5’s result provided a fillip to other networking and software companies. Juniper Networks advanced 6.1 per cent $23.88, while Cisco Systems was one of the best performers in the Dow Jones index, putting on 1.3 per cent to $19.79 ahead of results.Semiconductor manufacturer NetApp was up 8.3 per cent to $37.51 on reports it could be a subject of takeover bids.Cloud business software developer Salesforce.com rallied 6.3 per cent to $114.51 as Canaccord Genuity analysts said the company’s recent weakness on new billings, could prove temporary, “and not necessarily indicative of [the] firm’s outlook”.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,788.33, but Google, the second most heavily weighted stock in the index, plunged 10 per cent to $581.35 in after-hours trading, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a large margin.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced just 0.4 per cent to 12,623.98. The S&P 500 finished 0.5 per cent higher at 1,314.50, a gain of 4.5 per cent for the year.The benchmark index is set for its best January since 1997, but analysts warned a disappointing start to the earnings season could weigh on the index. Of the 59 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday afternoon, only 49 per cent had beat expectations, the lowest level in 10 years, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“Investors are now faced with losing the catalyst that strong earnings growth typically provides during reporting season,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Bank stocks continued to rally, as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America beat analyst expectations with fourth-quarter results, but materials, the other star sector of this year’s rally, sold off as profit fell at copper miner Freeport-McMoRan and Newmont Mining lowered its 2012 copper production forecast.BofA eked out a fourth-quarter profit on strong loan growth, although a lossmaking quarter for its investment banking unit weighed on performance, continuing the trend set by JPMorgan and Citigroup.Morgan Stanley declared a loss, but one that was much smaller than expected by analysts, as the investment bank bucked the trend to report an increase in trading revenue.BofA closed up 2.4 per cent to $6.96, after breaching $7 for the first time since the end of October in the morning session. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.4 per cent to $18.28. Other big bank stocks also rallied, except for Wells Fargo, which slipped 0.3 per cent to $30.15.Regional bank Huntington Bancshares fell 4 per cent to $5.79 as its average return on assets fell slightly despite a surge in lending, as the low interest rate environment appeared to take a toll.Freeport-McMoRan opened 2.5 per cent lower, before paring losses to end the day off just 0.2 per cent to $44.37. Fourth-quarter profit of $640m was less than half the figure for the same period in 2010. But many analysts had predicted worse results, after labour disputes hit production at its Indonesian mines in the fourth quarter. Newmont Mining fell 1.2 per cent to $59.60, after raising its forecast for gold output, but lowering guidance on copper extraction.Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies continued their torrid 2012, after natural gas futures, which have been plummeting for some time, hit a decade low.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 6.5 per cent to $63.09 and Range Resources fell 4.1 per cent to $54.06. Cabot is now off almost 17 per cent year to date.Ebay climbed 3.9 per cent to $31.51, as the company beat fourth-quarter estimates, thanks mainly to heavy usage of its PayPal electronic payments site. But some analysts focused on the less than stellar performance at Ebay’s core internet auction website business.“We continue to question the sustainability of the recent mid-teens core general merchandise volume growth rates heading to 2012,” said Brian Nowak at Nomura.Car parts manufacturer Johnson Controls slumped 8.4 per cent to $32.60 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 as the company lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing weakness in demand from Europe.But the aircraft part supplier Rockwell Collins climbed 5.5 per cent to $59.96 after the company said it was doubling production of parts for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner this quarter.First Solar slumped 10 per cent to $38.70, on reports the German government will cut subsidies for solar energy. The solar industry remains heavily dependent on support from eurozone governments for demand.Eastman Kodak, the company that invented the handheld camera, ended a prolonged share price slide by filing for bankruptcy. The shares were last trading at 36 cents.
6;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2011-12-20T22:25:22Z;US data boost homebuilding stocks;;Homebuilders led a strong rally in US stocks as the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day so far in December.PulteGroup rose 10.4 per cent to $6.17, DR Horton was gaining 5.7 per cent to $12.43 and Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $19.68, as construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November.Home improvement retailers were boosted, with Masco rising 8.9 per cent to $9.82 and Home Depot adding 4.3 per cent to $41.93.Some analysts were cautious, however, noting that much of the rise was due to building works starting on apartment blocks, which hit a three-year high.“The report doesn’t signal any turn in fortunes for the lion’s share of the market – single family homes,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Activity there rose by just 10,000 units to a 447,000 annualised pace and the highest in only five months.”Other analysts warned that Tuesday’s gains could be reversed by a change in sentiment, noting the high volatility of homebuilder stocks. All three large US homebuilders had fallen on Monday, in spite of a confidence survey rising to its highest level of the year.Broader markets bounced with the S&P 500 adding 3 per cent to 1,241.30 after its best day of the month. However, the benchmark US index remains in negative territory for December, traditionally one of its strongest months.The financial sector of the S&P 500 recovered ground after Monday’s sell-off. Bank of America climbed back above $5, a level that it had breached on Monday for the first time since 2009. BofA shares closed up 3.7 per cent to $5.17.Morgan Stanley climbed 4.5 per cent to $14.80 and Citigroup was up 4.6 per cent at $25.95.Jefferies surged 22.9 per cent to $14.50, its highest close since October, as the investment bank revealed quarterly earnings that were not as bad as expected.Profit fell to $63m, 23 per cent lower than last year, but many analysts had expected worse. The bank faced intense scrutiny of its exposure to eurozone sovereign bonds in November, but fees from investment advisory services rose year on year.“The results are better than expected but the share price reaction is overdone,” said Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga Securities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.9 per cent to 12,103.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.2 per cent to 2,603.73.AT&T lagged behind the market, but was still up 1.3 per cent to $29.01, despite calling time on its attempt to acquire T Mobile USA.That was a fillip for its equipment suppliers. Juniper Networks climbed 8.9 per cent to $19.74 and F5 Networks was up 6.7 per cent to $109.39.“We believe this development is a short-term positive for equipment vendors,” said George Notter at Jefferies. “We believe that AT&T in recent months had significantly dialled back fourth-quarter spending in order to apply leverage in its fight with regulators.”Rival network Sprint Nextel also took cheer, closing up 9.3 per cent to $2.36.BlackBerry handset manufacturer Research In Motion suffered another day of heavy selling.Shares fell 2.9 per cent to $12.52, the latest losses apparently triggered by reports that as many as 5,000 of its PlayBook tablets had been stolen from a freight truck.CVS Caremark rose 8.9 per cent to $39.80. The pharmacy chain boosted its quarterly dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.Eastman Chemical jumped 8.1 per cent to $38.70 after announcing it had broken ground on a new facility to produce acetate in China.Red Hat fell 8.9 per cent to $41.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500.

But Peter Nesvold at Jefferies said investors were overreacting to the overspend on product launches in the fourth quarter of 2010.“Product launches slated for this year are much lower, and I don’t think margins are going to be squeezed by that as much as investors think,” Mr Nesvold said.The S&P 500 ended the day up 1.1 per cent to 1,242, after a late spurt fuelled by reports that French President Nicolas Sarkozy will talk to his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao today about contributions to the eurozone crisis fund.“A favourable outcome to the Europeans negotiations seems to be increasingly priced into the markets,” said Channing Smith at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “But its all talk for now, and without concrete plans we’re unlikely to buy into the rally.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.4 per cent to 11,869.04, helped by a good day for Boeing. The Seattle-based aircraft and defence group jumped 4.5 per cent to $66.56 after it said it would take a profit from the first 1,100 sales of its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Fears that the expensive Dreamliner would take some time to reach profitability had weighed on the stock.The Nasdaq Composite index lagged behind the other two principal indices, up only 0.5 per cent to 2,650.67, as shares in online retailer Amazon, one of the biggest components of the index, plunged 12.7 per cent.Amazon closed at $198.40 after the company said it might report a loss in the fourth quarter due to expenditure on product development. Amazon has been profitable since 2002, but R&D expenditure has more than doubled from $300m at the start of 2009, forcing the company’s operating margin down from above 4 per cent to under 1 per cent over the same period.A relief rally in shares of solar panel manufacturer First Solar sent the stock up 6.6 per cent. The company rushed out quarterly results to calm investors following the unexplained departure of chief executive Rob Gillette on Tuesday afternoon. Results were poor, with earnings per share of 70 cents for the quarter down almost 50 per cent from the previous quarter and almost two-thirds from the same quarter of 2010But shares rallied as much as 15 per cent before closing at $46.11. That leaves the stock off 7.9 per cent for the week, after the company lost 25 per cent of its market capitalisation on Tuesday.“There were all kinds of rumours around when the chief left suddenly,” said Jeff Osborne at Stifel Nicolaus, “this gives some visibility to investors.”Lockheed Martin, the defence conglomerate, fell 3.2 per cent to $76.35, despite increasing its full-year earnings guidance as it announced healthy quarterly results.The company said 2011 profit would be between $7.40 and $7.60 a share. That was an increase of 5 cents at both ends of the range compared with the forecast made in July.But Lockheed said profit in 2012 would be flat at best, with pension costs posing downside risk.Oil refiner Valero was up 15.2 per cent to $25.11 on reports larger rivals may bid for the company. That put the stock marginally in the black for the week, after heavy selling on Monday and Tuesday, in response to a narrowing of the spread between WTI crude oil and Brent. The narrower spread erodes the margins Valero earns by sourcing some of its oil from cheaper sources.For-profit education provider Devry fell 16.8 per cent to $38.36 after the company saw profits fall 22 per cent compared with the same quarter in 2010.

8;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2011-08-03T21:19:02Z;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
9;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

While not confirmed, the rumours cheered markets.Also on the economic front, eyes were on a possible European deal to help bail out Greece with the aid of private sector bond holders. Despite the agreed bail-out, some analysts were not sure it was enough to cure risk fears.“Discussions with officials suggest policymakers understand how serious the situation is,” Credit Suisse analysts said. “We think an effective solution to private sector participation in the Greek bail-out is not sufficient to ease markets’ fears.”E*Trade gained for the second straight session, adding 4.8 per cent to $15.43. The online broker gained nearly 14 per cent in Wednesday trading following news that Citadel, a fund that is a shareholder, asked for two board members to step down.“The hedge fund injected $2.55bn of cash into E*Trade back in November 2007 so that it could avoid bankruptcy, and that hasn’t turned out to be a winning investment so far,” noted Canaccord Genuity.A $29bn pharmaceutical deal boosted the sector 1.5 per cent despite Eli Lilly reporting a drop in quarterly earnings.Express Scripts agreed to a $71.36-a-share offer in cash and stock to buy Medco Health Solutions in a deal that will make it the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the US.

The cloud computing software maker reported third-quarter profit climbed 54 per cent.Ebay results exceeded expectations, registering a revenue gain of 25 per cent. The online auction company’s shares gained 0.8 per cent to $33.44.“Despite the strong quarter, the company’s updated 2011 guidance was disappointing … We believe the guidance is likely conservative – all key businesses are experiencing acceleration, and there is upside to guidance, even if they stayed at current growth rates,” said analysts at Collins Stewart.Traders were looking ahead to Microsoft’s results after Thursday’s close, which many expect will include warnings about sluggish PC growth.In consumer results, Safeway, the US grocery chain, fell 9.4 per cent after reporting weak same-store sales and lowering forecasts for the same group. Citigroup analysts were positive about Safeway’s forecast that same-store sales will gradually increase, but said investors were still “disappointed”.PepsiCo shares also suffered after the company’s second-quarter results missed expectations. The beverages division was hardest hit and sent shares down 3.4 per cent to $66.17.In its first report after activating its online paywall, the New York Times reported losses weighed down by print costs. Reports that more than 220,000 people subscribed to the digital model cheered investors sending shares 1.9 per cent higher to $9.14.

Earnings per share were $7.79, well above the consensus forecast of $5.87.The shares hit $396.27, an all-time high in early trading, before closing at $386.90, still up 2.7 per cent on the session.The sector was not cheered by the news, falling 0.43 per cent, after seeing its biggest one-day gain in a year earlier in the week.“Technology as a sector …is starting to splinter,” Nicholas Bohnsack, sector analyst at Strategas Research Partners, said. “Apple is a bellwether of a different stripe, generating the lion’s share from consumers. It speaks in part to consumer and discretionary shares have held up well over past several weeks. Apple is a very momentum, growth-driven stock …with a very specific product set that not generally a bellwether.”Citigroup analysts raised their one-year price target to $480 for the second time in a week, expecting “a steady stream of new product introductions and peak seasonal demand”. Apple is expected to release a new version of the iPhone before the holiday season. Goldman Sachs analysts raised their target to $525 a share.Sales of the iPhone exceeded estimates, with 20.3m units sold in the quarter.

It raised its full-year earnings forecast to $13.25 a share, versus the $12.31 that analysts had been anticipating.IBM shares were up 5.7 per cent at $185.21. It led the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which added 200 points, rising 1.6 per cent to 12,587.42.There were hints of caution, as IBM explained that many of the sales of servers were delayed refreshings of existing equipment rather than new sales.But tech traders drove shares of other IT infrastructure groups higher.

The shares were up just 0.8 per cent on Tuesday.But strategists at Bespoke Investment Group say that should not prevent big gains if Apple tops estimates of $5.87 in earnings per share for the quarter.“History has shown that the stock has actually done better on report days when it has been overbought than when it has been oversold,” they said.Kevin Pleines, Birinyi Associates analyst, noted that Apple never issues guidance above what Wall Street expects, and so has easily beaten expectations in every quarter since 2004. During trading the day before it reports, Apple has registered gains 71 per cent of the time.The financial sector is lagging, up 1.4 per cent on the session, due to mixed trading among its biggest members.Bank of America reported a one-time writedown of $8.8bn related to settlements of mortgage fraud accusations.But the rest of BofA’s businesses earned 33 cents a share, which topped estimates of 28.7 cents.

That was its highest price since 2007.Avery Dennison was the worst performer in the index, falling 13.7 per cent to $32.65 after the designer of business equipment warned that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations.
13;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2011-02-10T23:09:39Z;Cisco results weigh on Wall Street;;Lacklustre quarterly earnings from Cisco Systems dragged on technology stocks but, in the wider markets, a stronger materials sector balanced out losses.The networking equipment maker tumbled 14.2 per cent to $18.92 after reporting that its profit margin had fallen because of its push into new markets.In spite of the decline in margins, Cisco’s overall revenue for the second quarter was $10.4bn, or 37 cents a share, above Wall Street’s expectations of $10.23bn, or 39 cents a share.Cisco has seen an average fall in price of 6.9 per cent in the past four quarters after releasing their earnings results, according to Whisper Numbers, an equity research firm.The weak results weighed on the technology sector, which was the worst performing in the session. The S&P technology index was down 2 per cent to 473.51.The S&P 500 closed fractionally up at 1,321.87 as losses among techs were balanced out by stronger materials stocks on reports that Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian president, might step down on Thursday evening.The S&P materials index was up 0.3 per cent. Among the winners was Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coalminer, which gained 2 per cent to $88.45.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent to 12,229.29, ending a eight session winning streak, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,790.45.Confidence on Wall Street was not helped by mixed earnings reports.PepsiCo reported core earnings per share of $1.05 per diluted share compared with Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $1.04, excluding the impact of its takeover of its two largest bottlers.Its shares fell 1.6 per cent to $63.36. The news weighed on related stocks. Dr Pepper Snapple was down 3.5 per cent to $33.96 while the S&P beverage sector lost 0.5 per cent.NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, softened slightly after jumping 14 per cent in the previous session on news that it was in advanced-stage merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.NYSE was down 0.8 per cent to $37.80 but the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s primary options-trading venue, rose 5.3 per cent to $26.87.
14;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2011-02-04T21:48:47Z;Wall St shrugs off weak jobs data;;Wall Street edged higher led by tech stocks as investors shrugged off weak January employment data.The S&P technology index was up 1.1 per cent to 472.98 headed by JDS Uniphase after the company posted forecast-beating second-quarter earnings.The maker of communications equipment for telecom and cable companies was up 29.9 per cent to $22.75 after reporting revenues up 38 per cent and earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations.Related technology stocks were lifted by the news. F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 4.6 per cent to $123.64 while Juniper Networks, the world’s second-biggest maker of data networking equipment gained 4.1 per cent to $40.06.But the key event concerning the markets was the January non-farm payroll figures, which showed that only 36,000 new jobs had been created last month. Economists had expected 136,000.Traders were left unsure which way to turn for much of the day, however, after the data also showed that the unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest level since April 2009. Unemployment was expected to rise slightly, but instead fell to 9 per cent from 9.4 per cent. This was partly caused by a fall in the size of the labour force, however. Many commentators were quick to point out that the headline 36,000 figure was not as bad as it seemed as the adverse weather conditions during the sampling week would have skewed the data.Ira Jersey, a US interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse, said: “The results were not as bad as they seemed. At best, the results were expected and at worse they were a little below consensus,” Mr Jersey said.Equities were in negative territory for much of the day, but rallied in late trade as investors finally concluded that the data was an aberration. “We discounted today’s headline employment figure because of the poor weather during the sampling week,” said Bob Baur chief global economist at Principal Global Investors.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,310.87, helping the index gain 1.9 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to close at 12,092.15, the first time the index has ended a week above 12,000 since June 13, 2008. The index was up 1.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent in the session to 2,769.30, a rise of 2.6 per cent over the past five days.Also preventing the markets from losing ground over the employment numbers on Friday was the fact that the whole week had seen promising economic data. The ADP employment survey on Wednesday estimated that 187,000 non-farm private jobs were added in January. Figures from the Labor Department on Thursday showed job increases last month, and other reports showed strong manufacturing and service sector growth in the US economy.In other earnings news Las Vegas Sands posted disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares in casino stocks lower. The global casino group saw profit and revenue jump in the quarter, helped by growth in its Macao and Singapore operations, but investors had hoped for greater revenues and so the shares tumbled 8.5 per cent to $46.03.This weighed on related stocks. Wynn Resorts, another US casino operator, was down 1.1 per cent to $118.06 while MGM Resorts was 2.2 per cent lower at $14.81.Elsewhere, Power One, which makes power converters, were down 21.2 per cent to $9.26 after giving a weak first-quarter revenue outlook. This came despite the company posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.Coinstar, the vending machine and DVD rental kiosk operator, was down 11.9 per cent to $38.96 after saying that its first-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street’s expectations.The week on Wall Street began with a rebound following the sharp 1.8 per cent losses seen at the end of the previous week.This was helped on Monday by near record quarterly profits from Exxon-Mobil and news on Tuesday that Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, reported a threefold rise in quarterly profits. ExxonMobil was up 3.2 per cent to $83.28 over the week while Pfizer added 5.9 per cent to $19.30.Strong economic data also lifted sentiment. Solid data on consumer spending, manufacturing and employment gave investors cause to be hopeful about the pace of the US recovery.After healthy gains on Monday and Tuesday, however, Wall Street stalled.The S&P kept just above the 1,300 mark while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just above 12,000.
15;FFIV;F5 Networks Inc;2006-11-28T00:25:25Z;General counsels feel stock options heat;;Senior lawyers at least 12 US companies have left their jobs as a result of a growing investigation into stock options backdating that has jolted corporate America.Recent departures include leading in-house lawyers, or general counsels, at a range of companies, from housebuilder KB Home’s Richard Hirst and United Health’s David Lubben to technology company lawyers Jonathan Draluck of iBasis and Joann Reiter of F5 Networks, according to a list compiled by Corporate Counsel magazine.Monster Worldwide announced last week that it had terminated the contract of Myron Olesnyckyj, its general counsel, “for cause” after an internal investigation revealed the company had used incorrect grant dates to enhance executive compensation.One senior lawyer has faced criminal charges. William F. Sorin, former Comverse general counsel, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges this month.The departures so far may be the tip of the iceberg. More than 160 companies have acknowledged that they are facing regulatory inquiries or carrying out internal investigations into the way they handed out stock options. Academic studies suggest the issue may affect hundreds more.Lawyers have always been at risk during investigations – William Rosoff, the general counsel of Marsh & McLennan, resigned after the firm’s insurance brokerage arm was accused of rigging bids in 2004. Stephen Woghin, the former senior lawyer at Computer Associates, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and misleading investigators.What makes the options backdating scandal stand out is that boards have been quicker to part company with chief legal officers than in previous financial scandals.Analysts say this is partly because some of the ousted general counsels personally profited from the backdating.But the turnover is also evidence of a sea change in corporate attitudes.Fred Krebs, president of the Association of Corporate Counsel, said: “If something goes wrong in an organisation, the Securities and Exchange Commission looks at the general counsel and says if you didn’t stop it, you’re at fault.”The Sarbanes-Oxley legislation on corporate accountability and guidelines on federal sentencing have also forced executives and directors to put a higher premium on ethics.Directors are anxious to show regulators they take their responsibilities seriously.
