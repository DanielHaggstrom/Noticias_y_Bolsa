0;DVA;Davita Healthcare Partners Inc;2012-11-23T21:52:34Z;Baxter revives Gambro takeover ambition;;Baxter International is seeking to boost its kidney dialysis business by reviving a long-held ambition to take over Sweden’s Gambro for about $4bn.Gambro, which is owned by a private equity firm and holding company connected to the Wallenberg family, Sweden’s most powerful dynasty, has been seen since the start of the century as a potential target for Baxter, a US medical devices group.Investor and private equity firm EQT, Gambro’s owners, and Gambro both declined to comment. But people familiar with the situation on both sides of the Atlantic said a deal was being discussed, although talks could still break down.The deal would signal fresh consolidation in the fast-growing dialysis market, which includes such other leading companies as DaVita and Fresenius. Baxter has long specialised in home-based dialysis, and the acquisition would expand its influence in hospital-based care.The discussions come at a time of continued acquisition by healthcare companies, which continue to generate substantial cash and borrow cheaply despite the global economic slowdown.A takeover would be among the larger transactions in recent months in the medical sector, with most companies focusing on “bolt-on acquisitions” rather than more disruptive and costly large scale takeovers.Baxter specialises in medical devices and treatments for conditions including haemophilia, immune disorders, infectious diseases, kidney disease and trauma. In February it bought Synovis Life Technologies for $260m net of cash, boosting its biosurgery and regenerative medicine expertise.Gambro, which was founded in 1964, is a leading provider of kidney and dialysis equipment. At the time of previous speculation over a bid in 2000-2001, its largest shareholder was Investor, the Wallenberg holding company, which teamed up with EQT in 2006 to buy out the company for SKr38bn. EQT took a 51 per cent stake.Gambro has since sold several businesses, making the current bid not comparable.Baxter reported third quarter income of $583m on sales of $3.5bn including $629m from renal products. The group offered guidance of $4.51 to $4.54 per diluted share for the full 2012 year on continued sales growth ahead of exchange rate changes of 4 to 5 per cent.Unveiling the results last month, Robert Parkinson, chairman and chief executive, said: “Our company’s strong financial position provides continued flexibility to invest in innovation, advance our new product pipeline, and pursue new business development opportunities to enhance future growth.”Additional reporting by David Gelles in New York
1;DVA;Davita Healthcare Partners Inc;2012-05-21T21:09:51Z;Buffett-backed DaVita acquires HealthCare Partners;Cash-and-stock deal worth $4.42bn;DaVita, a US company that runs dialysis clinics, is to acquire HealthCare Partners, which operates physician groups in several US states, for $4.42bn, marking the latest merger in the rapidly consolidating healthcare sector.The cash-and-stock deal will give DaVita, in which Warren Buffett has a stake, a way to broaden its reach beyond its core dialysis business.HealthCare Partners operates in Florida, Nevada and California and oversees medical care for more than 600,000 patients. The private company generated $2.4bn in revenues last year.DaVita has been working to expand its dialysis business, as a growing number of people with diabetes are expected to need treatment for their kidneys.The acquisition comes as US healthcare companies have been seeking more “integrated” approaches to treating patients and have been seeking greater scale.“DaVita currently executes on its integrated care mission with thousands of physician partners across the country for specialised kidney care services,” said Kent Thiry, DaVita’s chief executive, on Monday. “HealthCare Partners executes on that same mission across a full and deep array of healthcare services in three geographic markets. This combination will create a unique patient and physician-focused organisation.”The broader US healthcare sector has been rapidly consolidating in recent months, as drug companies look to cope with patent expirations and other parts of the industry work to find ways of reducing medical care costs.Last week Agilent Technologies, the US medical device company, said it would acquire Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics group, in a $2.2bn deal that would increase its presence in the life sciences industry.AstraZeneca recently spent $1.3bn to purchase biotechnology group Ardea and companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and Roche have been seeking new targets.Les Funtleyder, healthcare analyst at Miller Tabak, said that the DaVita deal could be risky because similar combinations were unsuccessful in the 1990s and because the “post-healthcare reform” landscape remains murky.“A number of companies are taking steps to transform their business models to take advantage of the post reform era,” Mr Funtleyder said. “The risk is that we don’t have good visibility of what that will look like.”“This is a popular area for a legitimate long-term reason,” Mr Thiry said. “Payers increasingly realised that they need to have integrated care if they’re to bend the trend in costs.”DaVita’s deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter of the year and the combined company will be called DaVita HealthCare Partners.DaVita is paying $3.66bn in cash along with 9.38m shares of its common stock to acquire HealthCare Partners. JPMorgan Securities was DaVita’s financial adviser.Shares in DaVita rose 4.9 per cent to $84.80 in midday trading on Monday.
2;DVA;Davita Healthcare Partners Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;NHS favoured big kidney dialysis bidders;;A National Health Service tender for kidney dialysis services sought bidders with a turnover two hundred times the value of the basic contract, raising concerns that smaller and UK-based companies were put at a disadvantage.Kings Health Partners, on behalf of London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, recently issued a tender for renal services that gave a 15 per cent weighting in judging the winner to bidders with an annual turnover in excess of £400m.The action appears to contradict ministerial pledges to encourage smaller British businesses to bid for government contracts at a time when the economy is struggling to grow.The high turnover figure contrasts with the initial request in the tender to take over two existing dialysis services, in Sidcup and Forest Hill, with annual running costs of about £2m.A second stage added the possibility of investment in modernising the two dialysis centres, which one industry executive estimated would cost a further £1.5m-£2m. The tender document also held out the prospect of a further partnership thereafter.The higher £400m turnover threshold contributed to at least one smaller UK-based supplier withdrawing from the bidding, leaving only large foreign companies in the running for the contract.At least one provider has lodged an official complaint with government ministers because of the £400m revenues hurdle rate imposed by the Trust.The companies likely to be competing for the final stage of the contract are all large non-UK corporations: Davita of the US, Fresenius Medical Care of Germany and Diaverum of Sweden.Guy’s and St Thomas’ said: “This tender intends to create a partnership…and sought capital investment, so it was appropriate to include this criteria.”It said that turnover was “not the key consideration”, with those seeking to win the contract able to do so based on other factors. It said: “The short-listed bidders were stronger on a range of pre-qualification criteria.”It also stressed it had “an excellent track record of encouraging local small businesses to bid for work and supply services”, citing its work with the Cross River Partnership working with local companies, and a web portal and quotation system.David Worskett from the NHS Partners Network, representing suppliers, said: “If a procurer thinks there is a likelihood of further development I can see why you might want to do it like this.”He added: “There is a general problem around NHS contracts for smaller contractors, who find it difficult to get over barrier to entry. These sort of obstacles do not make entering the NHS market easier.”Mr Worskett highlighted the apparent gulf between government rhetoric on opening up procurement and outsourcing, and “what has become a rather restrictive approach in the NHS which desperately needs to squeeze out the best value”.The government has promised to work with Whitehall to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises were able to bid for work, including breaking up large contracts.
3;DVA;Davita Healthcare Partners Inc;2011-08-02T08:54:10Z;Fresenius acquires dialysis rivals for $2bn;;Fresenius Medical Care, the world’s largest provider of dialysis products and services, has agreed to acquire two dialysis-related companies for a combined $2.09bn as the sector comes under pressure to make efficiency improvements in the US.The German company said it planned to acquire Liberty Dialysis Holdings, a US holding company comprising Liberty Dialysis and Renal Advantage, for $1.7bn including assumed debt, adding about 260 dialysis clinics and $1bn in sales to FMC’s portfolio.In addition, FMC said it had agreed to acquire American Access Care Holdings for $385m. AAC operates outpatient centres catering to dialysis patients’ vascular needs. The transactions will be financed from cash flow from operations and debt.FMC is the dominant player in the US dialysis market. At the end of last year approximately 490,000 Americans required dialysis treatment, of which FMC treated about 140,000. The acquisition would add another 19,000 patients. Its biggest rival DaVita serves approximately 128,000 dialysis patients.“Like all dialysis companies, what Fresenius needs to do is have the biggest possible footprint and to act as a market consolidator. Getting a larger footprint in the north American market is a good move,” said Stefan Muehlbauer of Silvia Quandt Research.“By acquiring new clinics, not only are they able to make more treatments, but they are also able to get the clinics to use FMC equipment.”FMC said the merger was subject to clearance under US antitrust law and that it anticipated possibly having to divest certain facilities in order to secure regulatory clearance.US dialysis care practitioners are under pressure to deliver efficiency improvements after Medicare – the federal government’s healthcare programme for the elderly – introduced a bundled payment system, instead of paying for each product and service.Regular observation and treatment is particularly important for dialysis patients as vascular access is prone to infection. The US government is set to consider the frequency of such infections in its dialysis reimbursement calculations by 2014.“Our acquisitions …are important steps in our strategy of expanding our service network to achieve excellent patient care in a more cost-effective integrated model,” said Ben Lipps, FMC chief executive.FMC’s first-half net revenues rose 7 per cent to $6.2bn compared with the same period a year ago, while net income attributable to FMC increased 5 per cent to $481m. Earnings per share for the six-month period were 4 per cent higher at $1.59. The company confirmed previous guidance that revenues were expected to exceed $13bn in 2011.

5;DVA;Davita Healthcare Partners Inc;2006-06-02T16:33:06Z;Investors back Gambro deal;;Sweden’s powerful Wallenberg family on Friday completed its $5.4bn takeover of Gambro, the medical technology group, after more than 90 per cent of shareholders approved the deal.The successful takeover by Investor, the Wallenberg family’s holding company, and EQT, its private equity firm, means Gambro will now be delisted in Sweden’s largest public to private transaction.Approval of the deal brings to an end two months of furious activity during which activist Gambro shareholders, including hedge funds and long-only fund managers, successfully lobbied the Wallenbergs to increase the offer price.There was also a last- minute threat to the deal after it was announced the day before the deadline for investors to accept the bid that Gambro had lost its largest customer, DaVita of the US. But it was announced on Friday 92.8 per cent of Gambro’s shareholders backed the deal, surpassing the 90 per cent trigger level at which the offer becomes mandatory.Shareholders will receive SK113.7 a share compared to the SK109.7 offered initially. The higher bid was kept in place by the Wallenbergs despite broader market weakness and the loss of the DaVita contract.Now that it has gained control of Gambro and can privatise it, the Wallenberg family plans to leverage its balance sheet more aggressively and implement a more efficient capital structure.It argued during the bid that a private entity is able to raise new capital more efficiently and quickly than a listed entity.
6;DVA;Davita Healthcare Partners Inc;2005-05-04T19:45:47Z;FMC acquires US rival Renal Care Group;;The $50bn-a-year global dialysis market witnessed its second major acquisition in six months on Wednesday, with news that Germany’s Fresenius Medical Care will buy the fourth-largest US player and thus cement its pole position in the industry.FMC is acquiring Renal Care Group for $3.5bn, or $48 a share, adding to its own 87,000 patients in the US the more than 30,000 of the Tennessee-based group.This catapults FMC back to number one in the world’s largest healthcare market, ahead of DaVita, which in December agreed to pay $3bn for the US dialysis clinics of Sweden’s Gambro.FMC and RCG combined will have a 36 per cent share of US dialysis services, compared with about 30 per cent for DaVita/Gambro, giving the joint entity improved bargaining power with US health authorities.This, combined with RCG’s profitability and its relatively high proportion of lucrative private patients, helps explain the high price FMC is prepared to pay.At $30m-$40m in 2006, and $40m-$50m a year from 2007, expected synergies are modest, and Oliver Kämmerer, analyst at WestLB, estimates FMC is paying about $116,000 per RCG patient, well above the $70,600 DaVita paid per Gambro US patient.“However, [FMC] gains access to a company that currently has the highest revenue per treatment ($316) in the US, which should lead to margin expansion,” Mr Kämmerer said.A good geographical fit with FMC’s existing clinics, meanwhile, means it expects to only have to divest 1-2 per cent of clinics in the US for antitrust reasons.FMC will finance the deal, one of the biggest cross-border acquisitions by a German company in the past few years, by replacing a $1.2bn credit agreement with a $5bn senior credit facility.The deal could trigger a credit rating downgrade, though FMC said it expected to reduce its leverage fairly quickly over the next 3-4 years using the strong cash flows of the combined company.In the meantime, FMC has bolstered its leeway for further investments by a move, also announced on Wednesday, to convert its preference stock into ordinary stock.“The beauty of this new corporate structure is that it gives us the ability to finance strategic expansion with debt and equity. If another big opportunity came along, we would still have the ability to move,” Lawrence Rosen, chief financial officer, told the FT.The conversion will also improve liquidity for the ordinary shares and, by raising the free float, improves FMC’s chances of remaining in the blue-chip Dax index.Globally, FMC and RCG will have total annual revenues of $7.5bn, and serve more than 156,000 kidney patients in 2,000 clinics. US-based Genzyme agreed to buy Bone Care International in a $600m deal that will expand its line of treatments for kidney disease, reports Reuters in New York. The deal would give Genzyme, which sells the drug Renagel for late-stage kidney disease, Bone Care’s Hectorol line of vitamin D2 pro-hormone products used to treat secondary hyper-parathyroidism in patients on dialysis.
