Particularly when aggressive activist Elliott Management is a major shareholder. On Wednesday, the US power plant operator NRG Energy announced a long-anticipated restructuring plan. It had been a leader in building out a large renewable generation fleet alongside its legacy gas and coal-fired assets. But the architect of that effort was deposed as chief executive two years ago. Sustained low power prices and a $19bn net debt load have weighed on NRG, while its market value has since fallen to $5bn.Elliott and an ally firm announced a near 10 per cent stake this year with the intention of eventually putting three people on the board. Its aim was straightforward: NRG’s empire needed paring back. Among various initiatives, NRG has decided to sell potentially all its stake in its listed renewables subsidiary NRG Yield, along with its renewables portfolio. Shareholders for now are enthusiastic, tacking on $1bn in market value on Wednesday.By cutting operating costs and shrinking the business its net debt should shrink to just $6bn. Cash flow would ultimately increase via reduced overhead and unit costs. NRG’s overall leverage would halve to around 3 times debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.A new-look NRG, management said, would then only invest in projects that returned 12 to 15 per cent with a payback period of less than five years. Otherwise, excess cash flow would go to shareholders. It is not clear where, besides renewables, such returns could be found.With its key backers more financially attuned, NRG’s new strategy can work. Analysts expect there will be strong demand for its renewable fleet. Assets belong with the management teams most capable and interested in them.The bigger question for NRG is whether it will miss a key industry shift towards renewable energy. Perhaps Elliott will have sold by then. Green means different things to different people.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly Best of Lex email at www.ft.com/newsletters.

1;NRG;NRG Energy;2017-04-09T16:53:36Z;Activists clash over direction for NRG Energy;Funds’ push for performance shake-up is questioned by New York City comptroller;Two competing models of shareholder activism are clashing over the future of NRG Energy, the second-largest US electricity producer. Investors are being asked to choose between an activist fund’s performance-driven push to shake up the company, and a call from New York City’s chief financial official for it to retain its renewable energy investments and dismiss a director for his views on climate change. In February, Elliott Management and Bluescape Energy Partners, another investment firm, agreed a deal with NRG under which two new directors joined its board and were given seats on a “business review committee” seeking ways to improve performance, including cost reductions and possible asset sales. Elliott controls 6.9 per cent of NRG and Bluescape has a further 2.5 per cent. Most of NRG’s capacity is gas or coal-fired, but it has been investing in wind and solar power, and in 2014 it set a goal of halving its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Mauricio Gutierrez, chief executive, defended that strategy in a letter to shareholders last month, saying NRG was committed to “increasing our mix of newer, cleaner energy sources,” but analysts have suggested that the business review could lead to some or all of its renewable energy assets being sold. However, Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller who has responsibility for the city’s pension funds, has written an open letter to NRG’s shareholders, praising the company’s performance since Mr Gutierrez took over in December 2015, and questioning the need for further cost cuts and asset sales. Mr Stringer, who controls about 0.4 per cent of NRG’s shares, argues that “Elliott/Bluescape’s short-term orientation . . . [is] on a collision course with NRG’s strategy to maximise long-term shareowner value”. The letter also takes aim at Barry Smitherman, a former energy regulator in Texas who is one of the two newly appointed directors at NRG, over his opinions on climate change, citing a 2013 email in which he said he had been “battling this global warming hoax for 6 years now.”Mr Stringer argues that Mr Smitherman’s views are incompatible with NRG’s strategy, and is calling for investors to vote him off the board at the company’s annual meeting on April 27. Elliott rejects Mr Stringer’s framing of the debate over NRG as a dispute over climate change, and says it is agnostic between different energy sources, seeking only to maximise value. It says NRG chose Mr Smitherman for its board because of his deep knowledge of Texas, where the company has about a quarter of its generation capacity and is the largest competitive retail energy provider. In the year before Mr Gutierrez became chief executive, NRG delivered a negative total shareholder return of 64 per cent, compared to a loss of 5.8 per cent for the S&P 500 utilities index, according to Mr Stringer. In the 13 months between Mr Gutierrez’s appointment and Elliott’s interest becoming public, however, NRG delivered a positive total shareholder return of 36 per cent, outpacing the 21.3 per cent for the utilities index.
2;NRG;NRG Energy;2017-03-29T17:00:31Z;Donald Trump’s power plan: Why US coal jobs are not coming back;New plants are more likely to use cheap gas, even as the US president seeks to dismantle carbon emission regulations;"The New Castle generating station is a power plant that has risen from the dead. A foundation stone by the entrance dates the building in Pennsylvania to 1938 and its cramped spaces inside give the feel of the engine room of a steamship. Back in 2014, new pollution regulations might have doomed the old coal-fired plant, which is in an area that voted heavily for Donald Trump in last year’s election.But some fat yellow tubes draped over the antique equipment are evidence that this ageing facility still has a role to play. Instead of shutting New Castle, the company that owns it — NRG Energy — decided to convert it and two similar coal-fired plants to run on gas.The decision saved New Castle and about 40 of its jobs. “The outlook for some of these [coal-fired] plants was pretty bleak,” says Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG’s chief executive. “Now they are very successful investments for us.”As well as reducing emissions, switching fuels has kept the plants competitive against other generators, thanks to the low-cost gas that flows in abundance from the Appalachian Basin’s Marcellus Shale, America’s largest gasfield. Yet the good news for workers at New Castle holds a bleaker message for US coal miners. For decades, the plant was a reliable customer for American coal, with a steady flow of trucks arriving to deliver fuel. That demand has gone, and is never coming back.New Castle represents a trend that has swept across the US since natural gas prices started to plunge in 2008: the closure of coal-fired plants and their replacement by gas-fired alternatives, or renewable energy including wind and solar power. A glut of gas released by the shale revolution has kept prices low, meaning that gas-fired generation is often more competitive than coal-fired plants. In 2010 the US generated almost half its electricity using coal. Last year, that was down to 30 per cent.Mr Trump  campaigned hard on reviving the US coal industry. “You watch what happens if I win: we’re going to bring those miners back,” he told a rally in West Virginia in May.On Tuesday, Mr Trump signed an executive order to make good on that promise. It set in motion procedures for dismantling much of the framework his predecessor Barack Obama had put in place for addressing the threat of climate change. In particular, it took aim at the Clean Power Plan, the regulations intended to cut carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation, which were expected to accelerate the pace at which coal-fired plants are closing.“You know what it says, right?” Mr Trump asked the group of miners assembled to attend the signing. “You’re going back to work.”The reality, however, is that nothing in Mr Trump’s announcement is likely to bring back any coal mining jobs. At best, his moves to strike down regulations might arrest the industry’s decline for a while. If the administration really wants to turn coal mining round, it will probably have to adopt ideas now cropping up in some US states, and start using regulations and the law to attack renewable energy.Coal has been mined in western Pennsylvania since the 18th century, and it is still one of the few industries that brings revenue into the rural areas of the state, as well as being the source of most of the best-paying jobs. This is also solid Trump country, one of the areas that delivered the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania for the president. “Coal has fed us all here for years and years. It’s the nucleus of everything,” says Larry Mostoller, whose family runs a convenience store, restaurant and petrol station in Somerset County, in the south-west of the state.“I really believe Trump’s energy policy is going to help the coal industry,” he continues. “I don’t know that Trump is the number one answer, but we were unhappy with what we had . . . And we need to get rid of over-regulation.”The prospects for the coal industry in Somerset County have started to look up, although it has had little to do with Mr Trump. Corsa Coal, a Toronto-listed group, is opening a mine to capitalise on an upturn in the market for coking or metallurgical coal used for making steel. Prices have been declining this year, but are still roughly double what they were a year ago.Corsa has dug about 90 feet into a hillside and is close to exposing a seam of high-quality coal that can be mined for at least two miles underground. The decision to invest was taken in October and the mine is scheduled to be in production in mid-May. The Acosta Deep mine will employ about 40 miners initially, rising to about 75 once it is in full production. But those gains are small compared with the sector’s recent losses. Five years ago PBS Coals, which Corsa bought in 2014, employed about 1,500 in northern Appalachia. Now Corsa has jobs for just 400.Metallurgical coal generally accounts for less than a tenth of the output of US mines. The great majority of US production is thermal or steam coal, used for power generation, and that market has shown only a modest upturn.Since 2010, US power generators have shut down 251 coal-fired power stations, often smaller and older ones where it was uneconomic to fit equipment to cut emissions of mercury, arsenic and other pollutants, as required by the Obama administration’s regulations. But even without those rules, new coal-fired plants are unlikely to be commercially attractive. The US Energy Information Administration calculated in 2015 that the average all-in cost of electricity from a new conventional coal-fired power plant would be $95.10 per megawatt hour, 31 per cent higher than the cost from an advanced combined-cycle gas-fired plant of $72.60 per MWh.The closures of old coal-fired plants continue. In February the utilities that own the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona, the largest coal-fired plant in the western US, announced that they planned to shut it down at the end of 2019. Salt River Project, the Arizona state-owned utility that operates the plant, said it had an obligation to its 1m customers to keep costs down, “and the higher cost of operating NGS would be borne by our customers”. Last week, Dayton Power & Light, a subsidiary of AES Corp, announced it planned to shut two coal-fired plants in Ohio next year.Mr Gutierrez of NRG says that whatever action the Trump administration took, he did not expect it to stop the shift in the US industry towards sources with lower emissions. “Of course it [the Trump administration] makes a difference. We will take it into consideration. But any investment decisions we make are for 15, 20, 30 years into the future,” he says. “More and more we are going to rely on natural gas and renewables.”The plunging costs of solar and wind power are making them potent competitors against coal. Moody’s, the rating agency, said in a report last week that in the Great Plains states east of the Rocky Mountains, wind power costs about $20 per MWh, compared with about $30 per MWh for just the running costs of existing coal-fired plants. The report raised the possibility that many US coal plants could become “stranded assets”, uneconomic long before the end of their lives.The EIA projected last year that if the Clean Power Plan were implemented as Mr Obama had wanted, it would lead to a continued decline in US coal production after 2020 and sustained growth in renewable energy. Without the plan, the EIA thinks that coal production will rebound a little until 2020 then stabilise and remain roughly at present levels until 2040, while renewable energy will continue to grow but at a slower rate.The EIA has frequently underestimated the growth of renewable energy in its forecasts, however. Jules Kortenhorst, chief executive of the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental group that works with businesses, says he thinks a reduction in US emissions is “largely locked in”, because of the shift away from coal and towards gas and renewables. “My hunch is that the outcome will in the end beat the [Obama] Clean Power Plan’s objectives,” he says.On the other side of the argument, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which represents coal-fired power generators, commended Mr Trump’s order on Tuesday, describing the Clean Power Plan as “the poster child for regulations that are unnecessarily expensive and have no meaningful environmental benefit”. But it is clearly on the defensive. Paul Bailey, the ACCCE’s chief executive, says that since 2010 generators have announced the closure of about 99,000MW of coal-fired capacity, or roughly a third of the fleet. Of that 51,000MW has already been scrapped but a further 23,000MW or so of capacity is scheduled to close over the next four years, and that is the slice that the ACCCE hopes can be saved by the Trump administration.“We see an opportunity to make a case for reliable baseload electricity, and the central role of coal in providing that,” Mr Bailey says. In some states, coal advocates have decided that the sort of supportive deregulation pursued by Mr Trump is not enough, and have been calling for tax and regulatory changes to attack renewable energy. Wyoming has a small tax on wind generation, and Oklahoma’s governor Mary Fallin has proposed one at a much higher rate. In North Dakota, an attempt to put a two-year moratorium on new wind farms made some progress before being rejected by the state’s senate. However, there are many more states that have policies favouring renewable energy, adding to the difficulty of resuscitating coal.A further twist is that even if demand could be revived, the principal beneficiaries would likely be the lowest-cost mines: the vast open pits in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana. The differences in productivity there are staggering. In 2015 mines in Pennsylvania produced on average 3.61 short tons of coal per worker per hour. Miners in the Powder River Basin produced more than eight times as much, at 29.3 short tons per person per hour source, the EIA says. Even allowing for transport costs and differences in quality, that is a huge disadvantage for the Appalachian mines, and another reason why Mr Trump’s promises are unlikely to be fulfilled.Amanda Laucher, one of the leaders of Mined Minds, a group that retrains miners and other workers in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to become software developers, says she has some sympathy for the president. “People will see that the coal jobs are not coming back. And at that point they will blame Trump,” she says. “But nobody could have brought those jobs back.”Marvin Laucher decided to jump from the coal industry before he was pushed. In 2013 he had been a miner for only four years when his employer Consol Energy announced that it planned to cut back its coal business.“We had four rounds of lay-offs,” he says. “I made it through, but a bunch of my buddies didn’t, some of them with 35 years’ experience.”It was obvious that he needed to look for an alternative career. At a July 4 party in 2015, he talked to his sister Amanda, a software developer, and she decided she could help. She launched Mined Minds, a group that teaches miners how to write code, with Mr Laucher as one of her first students before he became an instructor himself.It was an unexpected life change; becoming a miner had been a long-held ambition. When he was finally hired by Consol in 2009, he was paid in his first year more than double what he had been earning in factory work. With overtime, he was making more than $100,000 a year. “When I went in, I thought: ‘I’m set for life’. And then the downfall started,” he says.Miners had long experience of programmes that ranged from well-meaning but ineffectual to outright scams. In an attempt to avoid training that leads to a dead end, everyone who graduates from Mined Minds is given work on software projects including app design. The idea is not that the retrained miners will take on Silicon Valley developers, who can earn $250,000 a year, but that companies thinking of outsourcing work to India or Ukraine will see the benefit of using coders in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, who could earn $50,000 a year. “There are perceptions out there that miners are either old or dumb,” Ms Laucher says. “And both of those are blatantly untrue.”Her brother has no doubt that he has made the right move, in spite of the election of Donald Trump.“If Hillary [Clinton] had won, it would have been more extreme. But even now there are coal plants closing down,” he says. “Coding is the future: there’s a need for it everywhere.”"

But the sign hanging outside the field of play, “NRG Stadium” itself is a symbol of another contest. Other than electricity customers in Texas, few will have heard of NRG Energy. But the company, whose market cap is $5bn, is the largest independent power producer in the US with operations in Texas, California and the US Northeast. Its sprawling businesses — a big renewables fleet and “yieldco”, a retail unit that sells powers to end customers, and a separate ring-fenced producer called GenOn — have drawn questions about whether it should temper its ambition.NRG’s grand vision called for developing renewables and was the brainchild of former CEO, David Crane. He was suddenly sacked in 2015. The new regime has been implementing its own cost-cutting plan as investors worry about its bloat (including various sports deals). But now two activist investors, Elliott Management and Bluescape Energy Partners who own about one-tenth of the company, seemingly want bigger cuts.NRG shares are down 35 per cent in the past two years. Independent power producers are unlike regulated utilities who are assured by authorities of prices that meet their cost of capital. IPPs, instead, wager on rising or volatile commodity prices. Stagnant electricity demand and low natural gas prices in recent years have hurt NRG and its peers (such as Calpine, and Dynegy), all of whom are highly levered.Supporters of the company’s strategy say its retail unit is a nice hedge against volatile power prices. Statistics that show twice the operating costs of NRG’s rivals, they say, are more a function of accounting labels. But the broader fight is about whether a once progressive energy company can survive modern investor demands. Regardless, expect the Houston stadium to have another sponsor the next time the Super Bowl comes to town.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
4;NRG;NRG Energy;2017-01-10T15:13:35Z;World’s biggest carbon capture project on schedule;Petra Nova covers its costs by using the gas it captures for oil production;The world’s largest project capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power generation has come into service in the US on time and on budget, pointing the way towards a potentially viable future for the technology as a way to curb greenhouse gas emissions.The $1bn Petra Nova project, a joint venture between NRG Energy, the US electricity group, and JX Nippon Oil & Gas of Japan, is capturing the carbon dioxide from the equivalent of 240 megawatts of power generation, and covering its costs by using the gas for oil production. The pace of development of carbon capture has been slower than its supporters had hoped. In 2009, Stephen Chu, then President Barack Obama’s energy secretary, said he hoped the US would have up to 10 coal-fired plants with carbon capture in service by 2016. As it has turned out there will be just two in early 2017, with no others on the horizon. But the use of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — squeezing more crude out of mature oilfields — has opened up a path to commercial viability for a technology that has been struggling to make headway. Petra Nova is intended to capture about 1.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide per year at the WA Parish coal-fired power plant near Houston, sending it down a pipeline 80 miles to the West Branch oilfield, which is jointly owned by NRG, JX and Hilcorp, the US exploration and production company. There it is pumped into the reservoir to push out more oil, and the project partners are paid by selling the oil they produce. The US Department of Energy gave a $190m grant — a little under one-fifth of the project’s costs — but apart from that the project is entirely run on commercial terms, and can cover its costs at today’s oil prices of about $50-$55 per barrel. “Of course the project works much better when crude is at $100 instead of $50. But at least it puts us in a place where we can test the technologies,” says Mauricio Gutierrez, NRG’s chief executive. “And keep in mind that this is a project that was done on a competitive market structure. It was not a utility-sponsored [regulated] rate-based project.” By contrast, the other large carbon capture project now nearing completion in the US, Southern Company’s Kemper plant in Mississippi, a regulated market, has gone way over budget and behind schedule. In 2010, its budgeted cost was agreed with the state’s regulators at $2.88bn. Now, with start-up scheduled for the end of this month, it is estimated at about $7bn. Kemper is an innovative Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle plant, which turns the coal into gas and captures the carbon dioxide before combustion. It is the first of its kind to be built using Southern’s own IGCC technology, and is also about twice the size of Petra Nova, with the capacity to capture about 3m tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. By contrast, Petra Nova is fitted at a standard coal-fired unit, capturing the carbon dioxide from the flue gases using a process from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries that has been in use since 1999.NRG and JX have not revealed the cost of capture, but Jesse Jenkins of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that it works out at about $70 per tonne, unsubsidised. That is already lower than at the world’s first large-scale carbon capture project at a power plant, at Boundary Dam in Canada. Completed in 2014, it cost more than Petra Nova, about $1.3bn, and captures less carbon dioxide at 1m tonnes per year. Costs are likely to continue to fall. Robert Watson, then chief executive of SaskPower, which runs Boundary Dam, told the MIT Technology Review in 2014 that a second project of the same type could be delivered at a 20-30 per cent lower cost, and NRG’s managers have similarly learned lessons from Petra Nova that they can apply to future investments. “In renewables — wind and solar power — prices have come way down with the help of government incentives,” says Jeff Erikson of the Global CCS Institute, a body backed by governments and companies to support the development of carbon capture technology. “The cost of carbon capture will fall the same way.” Mr Jenkins said scaling up and making incremental improvements could cut the cost of capture to $35 per tonne of carbon dioxide, which would make it “quite competitive with other low-carbon options available”. The world’s oilfields cannot soak up all the emissions from power generation, and there is a paradox in trying to fight climate change by boosting fossil fuel production. But the total US market for carbon dioxide for oil recovery has been estimated at 20bn tonnes, or 1,400 years of output from Petra Nova, suggesting there is still plenty of demand that could be met. The oil industry could play an important role in supporting this technology that could be the future of fossil fuels.
5;NRG;NRG Energy;2016-09-06T20:35:19Z;US financials slip on fading rate hopes;But investors chase sectors favoured for their dividends;Financial stocks fell on Tuesday as sectors favoured for their dividends rallied, contrasting one of the trends that defined Wall Street in August, after a gloomy US economic report dimmed expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates this month.September rate rise odds dropped on Tuesday by 10 percentage points to 22 per cent, Bloomberg data show, after the Institute for Supply Management reported that growth in the American services sector cooled in August to the lowest level since early 2010.The report came just days after the ISM revealed that the factory sector, which has long been struggling under the weight of a strong US dollar and a cutback in spending by energy groups, unexpectedly contracted last month for the first time since February.The data on the services sector, which is far larger than the factory industry, were “likely to give policymakers pause as they consider raising rates at the September [Fed] meeting”, said Andrew Hollenhorst, a strategist at Citi Research.The more subdued expectations marked a turn from late August, when the probability that the Fed would increase rates after its September 20-21 meeting jumped on the back of remarks from top Fed officials who suggested the economy was likely strong enough to withstand higher interest rates.The financials sector logged the steepest drop on the S&P 500 index on Tuesday, with the banks index skidding 0.8 per cent.The banks industry group had jumped 7.1 per cent in August as investors bet higher rates would help lenders increase their profit margins by widening the spread between their funding costs and rates they charged on loans.Bank of America and Wells Fargo, two of the biggest American banks, fell 1.4 per cent and 1.1 per cent on Tuesday, to $15.78 and $49.99, respectively.Stocks seen as bond replacements because of their consistent dividend streams had the opposite reaction. The telecoms and utilities sectors rallied 0.9 per cent and 1.1 per cent, respectively.The two sectors were the worst performers on the S&P 500 last month as the spectre of higher interest rates weakened their allure.NRG Energy, a power group, rose 1.4 per cent to $12.15 as blue-chip telecoms Verizon Communications climbed 1.2 per cent to $53.51.Elsewhere, Spectra Energy led the S&P 500 energy sector higher.Enbridge of Canada on Tuesday said it would acquire the group for about $28bn in a deal that would create the largest oil and gas pipeline company in North America.Spectra rallied 13.4 per cent to $41 on Tuesday. Other groups in the sector were in the black as well: EOG Resources, an exploration and production company, rose 6.7 per cent to $94.83, while ExxonMobil, the biggest US energy company, climbed 1.3 per cent to $88.57.At the close, the S&P 500 had advanced 0.3 per cent to 2,186.5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by the same margin to 18,538.1, and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.5 per cent to 5,275.9.
6;NRG;NRG Energy;2016-08-30T20:51:05Z;US banks rally as rate rise hopes grow;S&P sector index is top performer of any industry group in August;US banks have jumped this month, contrasting with a broader lack of volatility that has descended over Wall Street, as Federal Reserve policymakers primed investors for a rate rise potentially as soon as next month.The S&P 500 banks index, a gauge that includes America’s biggest lenders, has climbed 7 per cent in August, marking the top performance of any industry group and outpacing the broad S&P 500 that has ticked up by less than two-tenths of a per cent.Lenders have struggled this year as the Fed has dramatically pared back its plans to increase interest rates as volatility in the financial markets, slower than expected economic growth and trouble abroad has frustrated policymakers.However, Janet Yellen, Fed chair, Stanley Fischer, vice-chair, and other high-ranking officials said at the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium last week that the case for adding to the December 2015 rate increase had been bolstered recently by upbeat economic data.Investors have taken notice, sending the implied odds of a 2016 rate rise up to about 60 per cent on Tuesday, from just 35.7 per cent at the start of the month, according to Bloomberg calculations based on federal funds futures.That has come as good news for bank investors since lenders earn profits on the difference in the rate that they charge for loans and their own funding costs — a margin that has been depressed by low interest rates.Indeed, the advance has helped the banks index trim its year-to-date decline to 2.7 per cent from 9.1 per cent at the end of July.Among the gainers has been Bank of America, seen as particularly sensitive to rates because of its large domestic retail business, which has climbed 11.7 per cent to $16.19. Citigroup, another large bank, has advanced by 9.3 per cent to $47.90.If the economic reports that are due for release this week, including Friday’s monthly US job figures, paint a rosy picture, it could spark further gains for financials, said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group.“The impact on financials will be efficient and positive,” he said.On the opposite side of the spectrum, the utilities sector has dropped by 6.4 per cent in August, cutting its year-to-date rise to about 11.4 per cent.NRG Energy, a power company, has been the worst performer, dropping 11.9 per cent this month to $12.19 while American Water Works has fallen by 10.4 per cent to $74.03.The sector has been among the biggest gainers in 2016 as investors have sought consistent dividend streams with bond yields tumbling to historic lows.The spectre of higher rates in the US, combined with concerns that valuations may have become stretched, has tarnished some of the sector’s appeal.“We advocate reducing popular positions where prices have moved beyond fundamentals,” said Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, referring to utilities and other assets that mimic bonds.At the close of trade on Tuesday, the S&P 500 had dipped 0.2 per cent to 2,176.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 18,454.3 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.2 per cent to 5,222.9.
7;NRG;NRG Energy;2016-01-15T20:18:02Z;There are still some good things one can say about yieldcos;John Dizard considers some interesting pieces of wreckage from the green-energy panic;Wrecking, or looting the washed-up debris of shipwrecks, was a big industry in Cornwall in the south of England in the 19th century.Then along came the spoilsports with their lighthouses and closer policing of the coast and the seaside people had to get by with honest trades, most of the time anyway.Just as the wreckers looked forward to stormy nights, some energy assets are looking interesting to investors who do not mind doing serious research and getting cold and wet.Take “yieldco” securities, which are the green first cousins of the oil and gas master limited partnerships. Yieldcos were sold as a way for portfolio investors to earn growing dividends from captive entities sponsored by renewable energy developers.The developers, on completing a wind or solar project, would “drop down” or sell the now-earning asset to the yieldcos, which would pay for the energy farms with sales of new equity and debt.Since renewables assets in the US can take advantage of very rapid depreciation to shelter cash flow from the taxman, the payouts could be even fatter than those from oil and gas MLPs.The risk-seeking general partners at the renewables developer would then use the cash from the drop down to start new projects, in a nice, clean, repeating cycle. It was, in a way, like the happy world of mortgage securitisation before 2007.Nothing lasts forever, and the yieldco model did not really get through a full market cycle before breaking down. The first yieldco to be listed was NRG Energy’s NRG Yield in July 2013. By August 2015, the whole mini-boom was over with a rapid decline in prices for the entire group.The common wisdom is that the then-developing decline in MLP prices, thanks to the hydrocarbon crash, led to a panicked loss of confidence in the comparable renewables.Then everything seemed to go wrong at once. The Spanish parent of Abengoa Yield began a legal process that now threatens to put it into receivership.SunEdison, the parent of yieldco TerraForm, drew shareholder rage with dilutive transactions and made the acquaintance of David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, a tough activist investor. NRG Yield’s parent, NRG Energy, fired its green-friendly chief executive and started formulating break-up plans.There was a moment of sunshine, so to speak, when in mid-December the US Congress unexpectedly approved a five-year extension of the special tax treatment for renewables.In one day, SunEdison shares were up 25 per cent, TerraForm’s 6.5 per cent, NextEnergy Partners 8 per cent, and NRG Yield’s 12 per cent. Some of this was fast short covering, but some was a real, if momentary, revival of hope.Unfortunately, the acrimony and investor distrust quickly resumed. By Thursday, NextEra Energy Partners’ shares had registered a year on year decline of 28.3 per cent, NRG Yield was down 49.8 per cent, Terraform 67 per cent and Abengoa Yield 44.6 per cent. So much for offering the “de-risked” end of renewables assets.There are still some good things one can say about the yieldcos. Their revenues are not as subject to the vagaries of the commodity energy markets. For the most part, they are based on contracts with investment-grade counterparties that stretch out up to 20 years. And the shareholder and bondholder rebellions are forcing some of the parent companies’ managements to show a bit more fiduciary responsibility than they have in the past.The green-energy panic has led to some interesting pieces of wreckage floating on to the surf-pounded beach. Some of the junk bonds issued by the yieldcos are now trading at yields higher than those of the riskier traded equities. Since the equities no longer have much of an accepted growth story, this means that there is a pricing arbitrage that the careful investor could exploit.Terraform B- rated junk bonds were, on Thursday, yielding between 9.7 per cent and 9.8 per cent, Abengoa Yield B+ rated bonds are yielding 10.9 per cent, and the NRG Yield bonds will give you 8.5 per cent. That is noticeably better than what you can get from the high-yield index products, and with better security than most junk provides.Part of the current undervaluation, in my view, is created by the widespread suspicion that the renewables developers have engaged in abusive related-party transactions.As Hugh Wynne, utilities analyst at Bernstein, the brokerage, says, “One of the things that worries me about the [yieldco] scheme is that it creates an enormous incentive to play three-card monte with the shareholders. Nobody knows the real value of the wind farms and solar projects they are selling to the yieldcos.”And the renewables financing structures have just had too many moving parts that make it difficult to value the securities in illiquid markets. As with so many other securitisations gone wrong, they were dependent on the issuers having continuous access to the equity and debt markets. That was a mistake.The green-energy industry had better come up with a simpler, more transparent set of financing models than it has.

This year’s submissions to FT North America Innovative Lawyers have shown law firms playing an increasingly central role in unlocking investment and enabling deals and projects to be financed.In Greenland, the financing for the new national port, via the US private placement market, was helped by Morrison & Foerster partner Brian Bates, who led a team structuring the arrangement. The deal was unique in that it was a financing of specific assets — a harbour, quays and cranes — done in a way that gave the investors prior security in those assets, along with assignment of the lease from the port operator.Greenland’s laws do not have the concept of land ownership, so investors are unable to take a security interest in the underlying property rights. The laws of the country, which is an autonomous Danish dependent territory, are also unknown to most international investors.On offer were “secured notes which are secured by mortgages on the buildings to be built at the port, a collateral assignment of the lease between the company and the port’s principal operator, Royal Arctic Line, and a security interest in certain cranes which shall be installed at the port by the company following construction of the port”, all without a government guarantee or land ownership, according to the firm.Freeport LNG, creating in Texas one of the world’s largest natural gas liquefaction and export facilities in the world, hired White & Case to structure the complex funding for the project and to handle equity and debt financings for each of three liquefaction trains — liquefaction and purification facilities.“When the multi-owner structure was created the financial markets were still recovering from the global financial crisis,” the firm says. “A straightforward structure with a single project company was not a viable option.”By creating a system where there were multiple owners, FLNG was able to tap multiple financing sources, though it also created “an incredible amount of substantive and procedural complexity”, says the firm, for which the deal was led by New York partner Jason Webber. “Simpler solutions that might have been acceptable to equity investors of the liquefaction owners were flatly unacceptable to their lenders or to FLNG, and vice versa.”Another example is Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer’s advice to KfW IPEX-Bank on the financing of the world’s first flex steel mill plant, at $1.3bn the largest private investment ever in Arkansas. Investors included secured and un-secured commercial banks, hedge funds, government lenders and grant providers.“Many investors could only invest if certain conditions were satisfied, which often conflicted with the interests of other investors,” according to the firm. “With over 50 parties involved in the project, success relied on innovative inter-creditor arrangements that satisfied conflicting interests.”The varying interests ranged from clawback rights if job creation targets were not met, working capital lenders’ need for first-priority security over accounts receivable and conditions around the order in which certain loans would be funded, among other issues. Some were required by the investor, others by the law.Many investors could only invest if certain conditions were satisfied, which often conflicted with the interests of other investorsThe work was KfW’s largest financing in the US and may create at least 500 jobs, according to Freshfields. Partner Melissa Raciti-Knapp led the team on the project, which involved more than 50 parties.“The arrangements were so successful that they made for a strong bankable project,” the firm says. “Despite challenges along the way, including a lawsuit from a competitor before closing, not a single lender or other credit provider failed to honour its commitment to the project.”Other examples of North American legal teams playing a larger role in complex financing structures include Chadbourne & Parke’s work representing NRG Energy. The deal was a tax-equity financing of a $2.65bn portfolio of wind farms spread across eight states.The challenge was to find a way for NRG to make the most competitive bid for the portfolio in the midst of the Edison Mission Energy bankruptcy.Hogan Lovells also tackled similarly complex funding structures in its advice on the first securitisation of revenues from oil and gas royalties in Brazil, on behalf of BB Securities and BNP Paribas for the Rio Oil Finance Trust. The $2bn deal was the largest structured bond ever sold by an emerging markets issuer, according to the firm.
9;NRG;NRG Energy;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
10;NRG;NRG Energy;2015-12-01T14:29:41Z;Yieldcos: creating a monster;An accident waiting to happen has spooked shareholders;"Imagine the corporate equivalent of Frankenstein’s monster: stitched together from parts acquired in a leverage-fuelled acquisition binge; fuelled by commodity prices; a payer of large dividends and therefore very sensitive to interest rates. “It . . . is . . . ALIVE!” exalts the mad scientist (or rather banker) as the creature lurches unsteadily out of the lab.This is no horror film. It is an only mildly hysterical description of renewable energy “yieldcos”. Prominent yieldco sponsors include NRG Energy and Abengoa SA (the latter went bust last week). SunEdison, the alternative power project developer, listed its first yieldco, Terraform Power, in July 2014. Terraform Global followed a year later.Yieldcos are simple in principle. When a new power plant is brought online, it is sold to a yieldco, which strikes a purchase agreement with a utility, guaranteeing several years of cash flow. Continuously adding new projects to the yieldco can generate cash flow growth of 20 per cent a year or more, similar to the US “ master limited partnerships” that own oil and gas pipelines. But rising interest rates, weak oil prices and worries about the economics of renewables have revealed risks. After jumping 68 per cent from its IPO price by May, Terraform Power has since fallen four-fifths.SunEdison still owns half of Terraform, and its own shares are down nearly 90 per cent since June. The parent’s $410m margin loan against its shares in Terraform and its $2bn acquisition of rival Vivint Solar have spooked shareholders. Its debts stand at $12bn and it generates no profit. SunEdison says it has recently refinanced the margin loan, is focusing on liquidity rather than growth and has reasserted control over Terraform. SunEdison believes that the asset class, like MLPs and Reits, will be better appreciated in time. It is more likely that the yieldcos, like Dr Frankenstein’s monster, are doomed to inhabit a world where they can never be at home.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
11;NRG;NRG Energy;2015-11-30T21:40:26Z;Financials top S&P sectors in November;Bank shares sought as investors anticipate wider net interest margins;A glance at Wall Street’s leaders and laggards for November illustrates what is dominating the attention of investors: a looming rate increase by the US Federal Reserve.The financial sector posted the biggest gains this month of the 10 major S&P 500 groups, rallying almost 2 per cent.Regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp was one of the standouts, zooming higher by 8.5 per cent to $20.64. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, climbed 4 per cent to $66.81.The sector has been boosted from rising expectations that the Fed will choose to lift short-term interest rates for the first time in almost a decade at its December meeting.In the wake of a robust reading on the US labour market for October, the odds of a US central bank rate rise have remained above 70 per cent as implied by the December Fed funds futures contract.So-called net interest margins, the difference between the rate banks charge for loans and the yield they pay on deposits, are forecast to climb as interest rates rise. Banks have seen their margins squeezed by the Fed’s highly-accommodative monetary policy as the central bank has held its benchmark lending rate near zero per cent since December 2008 in an effort to spur economic growth and higher inflation.On the other side of the spectrum, utilities have suffered from expectations of rising rates. The S&P 500 utilities sector dipped 2.7 per cent in November, making it the worst performer by a wide margin.Among notable laggards, Duke Energy, a large power company, dropped 5.2 per cent in November to $67.76. NRG Energy, a smaller player in the sector, slid 4.2 per cent to $12.36.Utilities are often favoured for their consistent dividend payments, especially during times of economic turbulence. The prospect of tighter Fed policy has pushed yields higher across a wide variety of bonds, from safe-haven Treasuries, to corporate debt. That makes utilities less attractive on a relative basis. Telecom stocks, another sector replete with dividend-paying companies, have also lagged behind during November.Meanwhile, on Monday, energy stocks advanced on the back of gains in crude oil prices. Among the leaders in the energy space was Transocean, an oil-rig operator. Its shares rose 1.8 per cent to $14.37, helping slice its year-to-date loss to 21.6 per cent.Elsewhere, Lululemon, a maker of athletic apparel, skidded on the back of a downgrade from FBR to “underperform” from “market perform”. The report by Susan Anderson warned that while Thanksgiving weekend sales were likely “very strong”, many customers were “buying the significant amounts of clearance (items) available in stores”.The stock dropped 8.9 per cent on Monday to $47.82. That brings its 2015 loss to 14.3 per cent.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent to 2,080.41, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent 17,719.92 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.4 per cent to 5,108.67. The S&P 500 capped November with a gain of around 0.1 per cent.
12;NRG;NRG Energy;2015-09-11T18:12:58Z;Yieldcos have caught some terrible money plague;John Dizard does not believe there was systematic fraud behind this boom;Everybody, by which of course I mean everybody in Wall Street, has been so fixated by the nightmare of the Big One, as in the next global financial crisis, that they have overlooked that we are in the middle of a series of Mini Ones, or crashes in individual asset classes.What makes a crash different from a mere bear market is the high correlation among different individual assets.That is bad if you have to sell in the middle of a crash, but it also means there are probably good values on offer, or, at least good relative values.That appears to be the case right now in the market for yieldcos, which are a way for energy developers to spin off their already completed and contracted renewable energy projects to public equity investors who are, as the name would suggest, looking for stable income flows.As with their close relatives in the capital markets, the master limited partnerships, yieldcos are structured to issue new shares to buy more projects from their development company sponsors, so they can offer growth as well as income.Sounds attractive, yes? And for the two years up to the middle of 2015, they were a fairly successful art form, with 15 yieldcos floated in the US and Europe. They had a total initial value of about $12bn. This was bid up to a peak of almost $28bn. There was talk that the yieldcos were a win-win renewable miracle that would rise to a market cap of $100bn and beyond.There appeared to be sound logic behind the yieldco structure’s division of risk between the active developer and the passive public investor. In a world that has been short of real returns, it seemed that yieldco sponsors had found ways to disclose and balance the inherent conflicts of interest that come with related-party transactions.Then something happened between May and late July. It was as if yieldcos caught some terrible money plague. What particularly caught my interest was how their share prices had become increasingly correlated.For example, from the second week of July the shares of Terraform Power, the yieldco sponsored by SunEdison, have fallen by over 47 per cent. NRG Yield’s class-C shares, sponsored by NRG Energy, have declined in the same period by over 31 per cent. Shares in NextEra Energy Partners, sponsored by NextEra Energy, are off by over 34 per cent.The initial reasoning offered by the sellside as the yieldco crash gathered pace was the depressing effect of a prospective Federal Reserve rate rise. Then there was the renewed decline in oil prices. Then came the supposed trigger effects of particular deals, such as TerraForm’s acquisition of rooftop solar assets, or NextEra Energy Partner’s purchase of some natural-gas pipelines.Perhaps the cruellest moment came on September 10, when Next-Era Energy had to formally put the NextEra Energy Partners yieldco machine into reverse, and commit to raising $700m in new equity units to support the yieldco’s balance sheet. This was not supposed to be the way it worked.Before any political people ask, no, the taxpayers have not been put at any further risk. The tax advantages given to renewable energy assets or pipelines have been in place for a long time. Nobody really saw this one coming. There was no conspiracy of those in the 1 per cent against the 99 per cent. Savagely aggressive American lawyers are already preparing their briefs against the sponsors, but I do not believe there was systematic fraud behind the yieldco boom.There was, though, just too much complexity in the structure of the asset class. Yieldcos have been (I almost said were) an attempt to overcome the inherent riskiness of capital-intensive, highly leveraged, intermittent energy sources that are subsidised by a constantly shifting array of public policies. When you read the documentation, it is amazing that the yieldco structure worked for as long as it did. The good news is that it did not, after all, turn into a $100bn business.The yieldco structures were finely tuned things, polished and perfected in the small hours before being sent off to the compliance people. They were there to take advantage of unnaturally low interest rates, supportive public policy on renewable energy and a buyside that could not be bothered to deal with the endless pages of disclosure.The sponsoring companies and the professionals they hired hope the yieldco crash is a transitory phenomenon, but I have my doubts. The tax advantages for renewable energy will eventually be phased out and less complex credit assets, or dividend-paying equities, will have the long-term advantage of lower volatility.For about two years, the yieldcos’ complexity befuddled a lazy buyside into overpaying for dividends. Now they have been discarded like toys from last Christmas. But there is reliable, undervalued income on the other side of all that overdone documentation.
13;NRG;NRG Energy;2015-09-01T11:33:23Z;US clean energy suffers from lack of wind;Softest air currents in 40 years cut power sales to utilities;A lack of wind is making the US clean energy sector sweat, with consequences for investors from yield-hungry pensioners to Goldman Sachs.Electricity generated by US wind farms fell 6 per cent in the first half of the year even as the nation expanded wind generation capacity by 9 per cent, Energy Information Administration records show.The reason was some of the softest air currents in 40 years, cutting power sales from wind farms to utilities. The feeble breezes come as the White House is promoting renewable energy, including wind, as part of its Clean Power Plan to counter greenhouse gas emissions.“We never anticipated a drop-off in the wind resource as we have witnessed over the past six months,” David Crane, chief executive of power producer NRG Energy, told analysts last month.The situation is likely to intensify into the first quarter of 2016 as the El Niño weather phenomenon holds back wind speeds around much of the US, according to Vaisala, a Helsinki-based weather measurement company.“We do know that the strong El Niño cycle that we are now in tends to be correlated with below-average continental wind resource, and we also know that meteorological expectations are for the El Niño phase to continue,” Moray Dewhurst, chief financial officer of NextEra Energy, said on a recent conference call.US wind farms are increasingly owned by so-called yieldcos, spinoffs from power producers that promise steady payments based on contracted electricity sales. Shares of wind-exposed yieldcos such as NextEra Energy Partners, Pattern Energy Group and NRG Yield, controlled by NRG Energy, have declined this year. NRG Yield reduced its earnings forecast due to what it called “unusually low wind production across the fleet”.Wall Street banks are passive investors in wind farms, often through tax-advantaged financing structures. Goldman Sachs’s holdings include a stake in Cabazon Wind Partners in California, where generation fell 16 per cent in the first half, EIA data show. JPMorgan Chase recently acquired an interest in California’s Alta Wind X facility, which suffered an 18 per cent decline in electricity output.Standard and Poor’s put a negative outlook on bonds issued by two wind farm companies as their revenues tracked wind speeds lower.“Although our current expectation is that the wind resource will revert back to historical averages, at this time it is unclear when that will happen,” the rating agency said.Wind generated 4.4 per cent of US electricity last year, up from 0.4 per cent a decade earlier. But this year US wind plants’ “capacity factor” has averaged just a third of their total generating capacity, down from 38 per cent in 2014. EIA noted that slightly slower wind speeds can reduce output by a disproportionately large amount.Investors and analysts said the lighter wind compels renewable energy investors to own wind farms and solar plants in diverse places.Pascal Storck, Vaisala’s global manager of energy services, said: “You don’t want to have all your eggs in one basket. You don’t want to be all in Texas and not have some mitigation strategy for when wind speeds are below average.”

Conversely, a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed a moderation in activity in the US, although it remained above the trailing 12-month average and indicated the 16th consecutive month of expansion.“The global readings on the manufacturing sector fall into three camps. Activity is humming in North America, stalled in Europe and most of Asia, and dreary with minor declines in most of the rest of the world,” Michael Montgomery, an economist with IHS Global Insight, said.Companies on the benchmark US index, which generate 46 per cent of sales abroad, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, slumped as investors sold off positions in the technology and industrial sectors.Utilities, which are less exposed to currency movements and earn a far lower portion of revenues abroad, advanced.Since the year’s start, utilities have been among the best performing sectors on the S&P 500 – rising 11 per cent, trailing only the 14 per cent gain by the healthcare industry.Shares of Exelon advanced 1 per cent to $34.57, NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $31.19, Entergy rose 1 per cent to $78.04 and Southern Company increased 1 per cent to $44.09.Shares of pharmaceutical companies with potential treatments for the deadly Ebola virus rallied after the Centres for Disease and Control confirmed that the first case of Ebola had been diagnosed in the US on Tuesday.Shares of Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals surged 18 per cent to $24.99, while NewLink Genetics, which received Food and Drug Administration approval last month to proceed with clinical trials of its Ebola vaccine, advanced 7 per cent to $22.95.Lakeland Industries, the maker of protective suits to combat Ebola in west Africa, climbed 30 per cent to $9.01.Shares of fee-based consumer review site Angie’s List, surged 19 per cent to $7.59 after the FT reported that it hired bankers to review strategic options including a possible sale.Angie’s List executives are not tied to the sale, people familiar with the matter said. The stock remains 50 per cent lower this year to date.America’s biggest automaker, General Motors, rose after it unveiled plans to double profit margins to 9 to 10 per cent as measured by earnings before interest and tax adjusted for special items.The Detroit-based automaker also reported that September vehicle sales rose 19 per cent from a year ago. Shares of GM climbed 2 per cent to $32.49.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,946.16 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4 per cent to 16,804.71.

Several economists argued the data would moderate any hawkish shift at the US central bank.Since January, the S&P 500 utilities index has lagged behind only the healthcare sector, rising 14 per cent.The payroll figures moderately lowered expectations that the US central bank would increase rates by March next year, as eurodollar futures for the date rose.“While the data is a significant disappointment, most participants will want to place the numbers in the context of a string of strong numbers,” Alan Ruskin, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said. “Nonetheless, this is the kind of data that staves off risks of a more hawkish Fed at the September Federal Open Market Committee.”Barclays strategists note the utility sector is the most negatively correlated sector to higher interest rates. Investors tend to use utilities as a proxy for the bond market as most companies in the sector have stable dividend yields, Barclays says.NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $30.99, Xcel Energy rose 2 per cent to $32.41, PG&E advanced 2 per cent to $47.90 and American Electric Power increased 1 per cent to $53.68. In afternoon trading, the 30 utility stocks on the S&P 500 were all higher.Strategists with RBC Capital Markets added the strong August rebound, which sent stocks to record heights, was showing evidence of a peak. The benchmark S&P 500, for instance, has struggled for direction over the past four days and has ended lower on most.“Rapid sector rotation is likely to remain the dominant technical theme within the equity market, consistent with the pattern of the last few years,” RBC’s Robert Sluymer said.Michael Kors shares were under pressure after it said Sportswear Holdings would sell its remaining stake in the company.Sportswear was the largest shareholder with a 52 per cent stake when Michael Kors first went public.Michael Kors shares fell 4 per cent to $76.67, although analysts with Wells Fargo said the sale could benefit the company if it chose to purchase its Chinese licensing rights, which are jointly held by Sportwear, Michael Kors himself and chief executive John Idol.“There are fewer conflicts of interest, and it seems less likely the price paid will be biased [to be too high],” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Gap followed Michael Kors lower, declining 5 per cent to $44.29, after the retailer said same-store sales at its Old Navy, Banana Republic and namesake chain missed Wall Street forecasts in August.Overall, same-store sales fell 2 per cent, compared with expectations for a 1.7 per cent gain. The company blamed its Gap brand for the weak results, where comparable sales fell 6 per cent – more than offsetting an improvement at Old Navy.Analysts with FBR Capital Markets warned increased clearance items could weigh on margins, despite new autumn apparel arriving in stores this September.Rival mall-based retailers also declined on Friday. Urban Outfitters fell 2 per cent to $39.27, American Eagle slipped 2 per cent to $14.16 and Abercrombie & Fitch declined 1 per cent to $40.70.US discount retailer Family Dollar slid after it said it had rejected a sweetened $9.1bn bid from rival Dollar General, citing competition concerns.Shares in Family Dollar fell 1 per cent to $79.01, Dollar General declined 3 per cent to $62.67 and Dollar Tree rose less than 1 per cent to $55.26.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,000.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 17,088.09.

16;NRG;NRG Energy;2014-08-07T17:25:27Z;Duke Energy: safety in numbers;Regulated and unregulated US power businesses’ fortunes switched recently, and may again soon;Regulated or unregulated, that is the question for US power investors. The latest salvo in the tussle occurred on Tuesday as Duke Energy and NRG Energy both reported earnings. Duke derives nearly 90 per cent of its revenue from the regulated (read: highly protected) activities of transmitting and distributing electricity. Its second-quarter earnings were 28 per cent higher than last year partially driven by hotter than expected temperatures (utilities and power producers have opposite views on extreme weather than, say, retailers).NRG Energy, the large US “merchant” power producer that sells electricity at market prices, also reported both a strong quarter and reaffirmed its outlook for the year. Yet its shares have fallen a fifth since June. The reason: natural gas prices have also fallen a fifth since June, down to under $4/mbtu.Duke happens to be selling its own unregulated merchant power business in Ohio to cut its earnings volatility. NRG, along with a handful of other independent power producers and private equity firms would love to grab those operations. Generating and selling power at market rates was a good business earlier this year as natural gas prices, which drive electricity prices, spiked due to a brutal winter and dwindling supplies. But the reversal this summer has driven down NRG shares.Natural gas prices may remain depressed for an extended period. But Moody’s has just released a bullish report on the power producer sector. It believes cash flow for merchant power producers will jump 25 per cent year-over-year in 2014. Electricity prices should creep up because inefficient plants will be retired and growth regions such as Texas will demand more power. Not confident in that argument? Then turn your eyes to Duke and its 5 per cent dividend yield.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
17;NRG;NRG Energy;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Yieldco returns in high demand from energy sector;At a time of low interest rates, the dividends are particularly attractive;A new corporate structure is rapidly gaining popularity among US-listed power generators: the “yieldco”, a vehicle that earns stable cash flows and distributes them in dividends, offering a low-cost source of capital for renewable energy.The new vehicles have been in high demand from investors because they offer a combination of a high yield and dividend growth. North American energy companies have raised about $1.8bn from spinning off yieldcos in initial public offerings in the past year, and bankers say several more companies are looking at possible launches.However, they have also raised questions about whether their returns could be sustained in the face of rising interest rates or a slowdown in the renewable energy industry.The yieldco has some similarities to the master limited partnership, a US corporate structure that offers high dividends and has tax advantages, but in the energy industry is available only to oil and gas companies, not for power generation.Yieldcos own assets including wind farms, solar and hydroelectric power projects, and conventional gas and coal-fired plants.The key to their high dividends is having predictable cash flows from selling electricity under long-term power purchase agreements. Renewable energy projects face many uncertainties while they are being developed, but once they are built their cash flows are generally low-risk.At a time of low interest rates, the dividends offered by yieldcos are particularly attractive to investors. Shares in NRG Yield, spun off from US electricity group NRG Energy last July, have risen more than 130 per cent from the IPO price.Abengoa, the Spanish renewable energy group, earlier this month spun off Abengoa yield in an offer that was subscribed for 16 times over.Manuel Sanchez Ortega, Abengoa’s chief executive, said the yieldco offered not only the dividend, but also the prospect of double digit growth.“As we develop new projects, they will be passed on to Abengoa Yield, giving it guaranteed growth in revenues,” he said.Plans to subtract assets from the parent company to the yieldco have not hurt the share prices of the parents, according to Rob Stowe, managing director in equity capital markets at Barclays, because the parents are typically large and spinning off a yieldco is a low-cost source of capital for those assets.NRG Energy’s shares have risen 46 per cent in the past 12 months, almost double the gain in the US power generation sector.Although they do not enjoy the same tax privileges as master limited partnerships, yieldcos can build in tax advantages in other ways. Abengoa Yield is listed in the US but domiciled in the UK, where it pays a lower rate of corporate tax. NRG Yield benefits from US tax credits for renewable energy, and from a high depreciation charge that holds down its tax liability.Other companies have announced yieldco spin-offs. SunEdison said in May it planned one, and NextEra Energy formally launched its IPO last week.Vishal Shah, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note last week that he expected five or six more yieldcos to list within the next 18 months, with increasing numbers from next year focused on markets outside the US, as falling costs make solar power competitive with fossil fuels in an “increasing number of international markets from 2015”.However, analysts and bankers warn that because yieldcos are so new, their performance during a period of rising interest rates has not yet been tested. They also warn that if yieldcos do not manage to secure new projects, perhaps because of a slowdown in the growth of the renewable energy industry as tax breaks and other government incentives are withdrawn, then the companies will not be able to deliver the growth they are planning.
18;NRG;NRG Energy;2014-06-22T15:04:06Z;Yieldco: making it rain;Wall Street’s latest contraption for investors searching for returns;When there is a yield drought, Wall Street invariably conjures up a contraption that can make it rain. Enter the “yieldco” – a drab name for a clever idea. Power producers do not qualify for inclusion in tax-efficient vehicles such as master limited partnerships or real estate investment trusts. But power producers can deliver dependable cash flow, the sine qua non of yield-based securities. All that is missing is legal and accounting wizardry.Yieldcos are straightforward. A power producer creates a yieldco to which it sells plants that have multi-year “power purchase agreements”. Those agreements are long-term contracts with utilities – the latter agrees to buy electricity from the plants at specified prices. The PPAs allow the yieldco to pay a dividend. The yieldco is liable for income tax but because of depreciation costs, it will not earn taxable income in the near future so no taxes are owed.NRG Yield, the offshoot of NRG Energy, debuted last summer – its total return since then is 140 per cent. Not only did it promise a 4 per cent dividend yield, but also dividend growth of over 10 per cent. That comes from buying generation assets from its parent NRG Energy (which owns two thirds of the yieldco) and third parties. It just bought the largest US wind farm, Alta Wind Energy Center, for $900m.The success of NRG Yield and others has inspired copycats. Abengoa, SunEdison and NextEra have announced yieldco spin-offs. Deutsche Bank estimates 5 or 6 such listings in the next two years. As in all fixed-income plays, there is the risk of a rush to the exits when rates tighten. The bigger challenge is growth. NRG Yield has plenty of room to add assets (it has just 2500 MW of capacity where its parent has 50 000 MW). But assets must still be acquired at fair prices to avoid excessive dilution or leverage. No one, however, worries about floods before the downpour starts.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
19;NRG;NRG Energy;2014-04-03T16:23:16Z;Barnes & Noble tumbles as Liberty cuts stake;;"Shares in Barnes & Noble tumbled on Thursday after the company revealed Liberty Media, which at one point held 16.7 per cent of the company, would sharply cut its position in the US bookseller.Liberty Media, the group chaired by John Malone, said it had reached agreements to reduce its investment to roughly one-tenth of its original size by early next week.A source familiar with the transaction said Liberty would hold approximately 1.6 per cent of outstanding Barnes & Noble shares after the sale.The decision is a quick reversal for Liberty, which made an offer for a controlling stake in Barnes & Noble in 2011 before agreeing to purchase its 16.7 per cent stake for $204m.“This is not a good thing near term for shareholders, after an impressive stock rebound the past few months,” Janney Montgomery Scott analyst David Strasser said. “When Liberty bought this stake …it was a strong affirmation of Barnes & Noble, particularly its strategy around the Nook by a renowned investor and partner.”Barnes & Noble chairman Leonard Riggio said the sale would give it more flexibility to pursue other strategic options.“Liberty’s decision to retain a portion of its investment and have active involvement on our board underscores Liberty’s ongoing commitment to Barnes & Noble,” Mr Riggio added.Barnes & Noble shares have shifted sharply over the past 28 months, moving more than 5 per cent on a single trading day some 63 times.Shares in Barnes & Noble fell 13.52 per cent to close at $19.12, its worst performance this year. Liberty Media declined just over 2 per cent to $130.40.NRG Yield, the US power plant operator and vehicle of NRG Energy, rose just under 3 per cent to $41.53 as analysts at Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the company with an ‘overweight’ rating.The investment bank cited the company’s strong growth profile and stable cash flows for its decision, including “strong asset development” in the wind, natural gas and solar sectors.“NRG Yield has robust growth prospects and strong management,” analyst Stephen Byrd said. “As management executes on drop-downs from NRG and illustrates its ability to grow distributable cash per share at 15 to 20 per cent per year or more, we expect NRG Yield will continue to close its valuation discount.”Rite Aid shares climbed 2.04 per cent to $6.49 after the drugstore reported a 0.7 per cent rise in same-store sales in March.The company’s results were lifted by rising sales at its pharmacy, offsetting a 5 per cent slide in front-end same store sales, which includes food and other household products. Rite Aid attributed much of that weakness to a later Easter holiday.Google shares were initially among the top performing on the S&P 500 after the company split its shares into two different classes.Both the newly issued Class C shares with no voting rights – under the ticker GOOG – and the Class A shares with a minimal vote – under the ticker GOOGL – traded higher, although the latter outpaced shares without a vote.The move gives the internet giant a new form of currency when purchasing companies as it does not dilute the voting power of co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page.Both shares finished slightly up on the day; GOOG shares 0.4 per cent higher at to $569.30 while GOOGL ended 0.6 per cent up, at $571.50.Pandora faltered after reporting subscriber growth figures for March, dipping 5.06 per cent to $29.85.Early in the day its shares climbed as much as 7 per cent after the streaming music company said active users rose 8 per cent from a year earlier to 75.3m.Overall, US equities struggled for direction, as separate reports showed a firming in the country’s service sector and rise in unemployment filings.The S&P 500 fell 0.11 per cent to 1,888.77 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended almost unchanged at16,572.55, although it touched an intraday record earlier in the day. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.91 per cent to close at 4,237.74."
20;NRG;NRG Energy;2012-07-22T21:39:08Z;NRG Energy in $1.7bn deal for GenOn;;NRG Energy, the US energy producer, said on Sunday it would acquire GenOn Energy in a stock deal valued at $1.7bn that will create the country’s largest unregulated generator of electricity.With the acquisition, NRG will have 47,000 megawatts of capacity, allowing it to produce about 5 per cent of electricity in the US through a mix of alternative and traditional power sources.Companies such as NRG and GenOn compete with regulated utilities to produce and sell power to commercial and residential customers. The deal will give NRG an expanded footprint around the country.“This is more about regional diversification than it is about technological diversification,” said David Crane, chief executive of NRG, who will remain in his job.Based in New Jersey with a market capitalisation of $4.1bn, NRG operates nuclear, wind, solar and traditional power plants that serve about 2m customers, mainly in Texas.GenOn, based in Houston but serving customers in the northeast US and California, operates more conventional coal and natural gas power plants, and was valued at $1.4bn on Friday. Edward Muller, GenOn chief executive, will become vice-chairman of NRG.Both GenOn and NRG shares have fallen sharply in the last year as the shale boom and warm weather have sent US energy prices plummeting.GenOn shares were off 55 per cent over 12 months as of Friday, allowing NRG to buy the company for a fraction of what it was worth last summer. NRG shares are off 27 per cent over the same period.Last year NRG took a $481m pre-tax charge as it wrote down its investment in nuclear power due to “diminished prospects’’ for a US renaissance following Japan’s crisis.The stock-for-stock merger will be tax-free, with GenOn shareholders receiving 0.12 shares of NRG for each share of common stock. That represents a 21 per cent premium based on Friday’s closing prices.Following the deal, NRG shareholders will own 71 per cent of the company, with GenOn shareholders owning 29 per cent. NRG will control 12 of the company’s 16 board seats.NRG expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to be about $2.5bn to $2.7bn in 2013, and as high as $2.8bn in 2014.The companies said the deal will result in additional free cash flow of about $300m per year through a mix of balance sheet efficiencies, cost synergies and operational efficiencies.NRG was advised by Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, and received legal counsel from Kirkland & Ellis. GenOn was advised by JPMorgan, with legal counsel from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
21;NRG;NRG Energy;2011-12-02T14:11:31Z;Motor vehicles: Houston’s commuters plug into electric cars;Sheila McNulty examines a scheme that aims to wean drivers off petroleum;At a former Hummer dealership on the outskirts of Houston, NRG Energy, a power producer, has established the headquarters of its electric vehicle-charging network, the first in the US to be privately funded.The symbolism of clean, plug-in vehicle technology replacing dirty, gas-guzzling technology is readily apparent. But does it reflect reality? While it is rare to see a Hummer on the streets of Houston, the energy capital of the US, it also is rare to see an electric vehicle.Ironically, the day I went for a test drive in a Nissan Leaf, we spotted a lone DeLorean sports car that had been converted to an electric vehicle, amid the lines of gas guzzlers on the packed highway.”Gas?’’ read a sign on the back. “Where we’re going, we don’t need gas.’’ Indeed, NRG EV Services’ eVgo seven public charging stations have given Houstonians the ability to extend the range of their electric vehicles beyond what their home charger gives them, so they can travel in and around Houston without petrol.NRG plans to spend $25m over five years to link Texas’ three key cities – Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin – with charging stations. The plan calls for 50 stations in Houston, 70 in Dallas, and stations along the highways to link those cities with Austin, which is separately building its own charging network.If all goes well, NRG will take the network national, where it could link up with other infrastructure fuelling projects in places such as California.Subscribers to the Houston network receive overnight chargers installed in their homes, which provide 70 miles of range with the heat or air running and 100 miles with the windows down. The average commute in the US is 31 miles.The home chargers, which cost $2,000, are paid off in monthly instalments of $49. For $89 a month, users also can power up at the seven stations placed outside shopping centres and drug stores around town.Two of the seven plug-in stations in Houston and one in Dallas have the latest, DC chargers, which provide 200 miles of range per hour of charge.So a user can spend half an hour in the HEB grocery store beside one of the DC chargers in Houston and come out to a fully charged Nissan Leaf. The AC chargers at other stations provide up to 24 miles of range for every hour plugged in.“It’s not as fast as filling up at a gas station yet, but we’re not at a gas station – you can do something you need to do,’’ says David Knox, NRG spokesman, after taking on the highway to demonstrate how electric vehicles can keep up with gas-powered cars in the 70 miles an hour traffic.Arun Banskota, president of NRG EV Services, will not divulge how sales are going in the year since eVgo was established, saying the company is not looking for a profit as it builds the infrastructure. Its focus is on growing public awareness, with 60 public events between July 4 and Thanksgiving. ”When people see the electric vehicles, or drive them, they’re sold,’’ he says.Bob Stokes, an eVgo customer in Houston, bought his Nissan Leaf about six months ago. He wanted both to help preserve the environment and also to be at the cutting edge of technology. He signed up for eVgo’s $89 package.“It’s nice to be able to put your car in the garage at night and have it full when you get up in the morning,’’ he says.His commute is a 52 miles round trip, so he uses an outlet in his office building and the public plug-in stations to charge up, if he has several stops to make before heading home.“It’s a little bit challenging as you have to plan ahead,’’ he says.Mr Stokes got stuck once, when he drove outside Houston and found the plug-in station he went to was not working.Nissan towed him home for free, but the experience left its mark. “I wouldn’t want to chance that again,’ he says.He uses his wife’s gas-powered car when he goes on long road trips. But it is an inconvenience that he expects to disappear when the infrastructure is built out: “It’s only going to get better.’’Similar start-ups are being established in different parts of the US, but it has been a slow conversion in the economic downturn, given the initial upfront expense of an electric vehicle, despite the cheaper long-term fuel.Nonetheless, state and federal incentives, with thousands of dollars in rebates or tax breaks, have encouraged the growth of plug-in stations across the country, with large concentrations focused in California and Florida.David Wells, managing director in the Energy Practice at Navigant, the consultancy, says: “I see the electric vehicle market in the US growing slowly for the next several years, with the major opportunities focused in urban areas in the western US, the East Coast and Texas.’.“Overall market growth will probably disappoint the auto industry, but it will allow the utilities time to develop more attractive service offerings and manage impact on the power grid,’’ he says.
22;NRG;NRG Energy;2011-12-01T20:32:47Z;Speculators return in wake of Enron;;"The reverberations were felt up and down the streets of downtown Houston when Enron collapsed 10 years ago, shattering confidence in the energy trading market on which the company had been built.Competitors to Enron, ranging from Dynegy to El Paso, had also diversified into energy trading. They hoped to mimic Enron’s shift growth from slow and steady businesses, such as power production and pipelines, into higher gear and higher risk trading. And it had worked – for a time.“There was a lot of trading for trading sake,” says Mark Williams, a finance lecturer at Boston University’s School of Management, a former energy trading floor executive and author of Uncontrolled Risk about the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Utilities didn’t really understand what they were getting into,” Mr Williams says. “Enron was a high risk hedge fund disguised as a diversified energy company.”Some 500 companies had been approved by regulators to trade energy, he says. And as volumes built up, along with an eagerness to build up ""brag-a-watts"" based on how many trades they executed, so did volatility.Even as investors piled into these seemingly high growth companies, the credit rating agencies downgraded their ratings, red-flagging them as increasingly high-risk, albeit not in danger of imminent collapse.“The trades were creating no economic value except flipping electrons,” Mr Williams says, adding, “All of a sudden, these smaller trading subsidiaries could undermine the credit worthiness of the larger parent companies.” And they did.As Enron’s faulty accounting was revealed, fears about what these energy trading subsidiaries had been built on surfaced. Investors fled the sector, pushing share prices down to below the cost of a cup of coffee.Companies found themselves with billions of dollars in debt and obligations – in Dynegy’s case $14bn – and they were forced to abandon their trading businesses and sell assets to survive. Thousands of people in Houston alone lost their jobs as the sector imploded.“When Enron blew up, it took down, or took out of energy trading, Dynegy, Duke, PG&E, Mirant, Aquila, El Paso,” says Karl Miller, a former El Paso executive and now a managing partner at Newco Energy Acquisition Holdings. “They did not have the credit capacity to stay in the game. And there was market pressure to get out of the business.”Mirant, NRG, NEG and Calpine followed Enron into bankruptcy.Dynegy, which was the biggest rival to Enron and made a failed bid to rescue its competitor, has managed to stay out of bankruptcy for the past decade. But its chief executive, Bruce Williamson, left the company this year after shareholders refused his plan to merge with a stronger partner, leaving its future uncertain.“It has been a slow bleed for a former energy giant that lost its way,” Mr Williams says. “Dynegy's downfall was moving into electricity trading.”A trader at a major commodities dealer says those who continued to trade energy focused mostly on lower risk physical assets, backing away from speculative trading. Banks and hedge funds moved in to dominate the energy trading business.Yet they refused to make a market in every product, as Enron did. “There is no marketplace like that today,” the trader says. “Nobody is as big as Enron was and willing to provide that service to provide liquidity and make markets in many different products.”On top of that, new regulation aimed at limiting another Enron, such as Dodd-Frank, has built more transparency into the system, according to John England, a partner in the oil and gas practice at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm.""I think people have put more systems, processes and controls around energy trading,"" Mr England says.Nonetheless, Julian Dumoulin-Smith, director of equity research in the Electric Utilities & IPPs Group at UBS Securities, says there is a growing queue of groups interested in trades beyond physical assets.Constellation Energy is one name that crops up as showing interest, along with a host of Europeans: Mercuria, one of the biggest energy trading houses in the world; Arcadia Petroleum, the oil trading house; Glencore, the commodities group.Mr Miller, the former El Paso executive, says: “European utilities are starting to step into the US market and flex some of their balance sheets.”RWE, the German power company; EON, Germany’s largest utility; and EDF, France’s state-owned energy group; are showing an interest, he says, as well as Gazprom Marketing & Trading, the US arm of the world’s biggest natural gas producer, majority owned by the Russian government.With the renaissance in US oil and gas production, driven by the unlocking of hydrocarbons from tightly packed shale rock, there will be a growing need to trade and market around energy in the US, Mr Miller says. And as this physical market builds volumes, increasingly speculative trading will grow, as well, he says. After all, that is where the ""real money"" is made – in risky transactions.“We have recently seen some companies going to banks to find a specialised derivatives trader to build out that speculative trading platform again,” the trader from the commodities house says. “It’s almost come full circle.”"
23;NRG;NRG Energy;2011-11-08T20:59:18Z;Dynegy: hedge funds mine rich seam;Coal plants are worth far below what they cost to build but that cannot last forever;Owners of the equity and debt in Dynegy, which strategically placed certain units into bankruptcy, are at each other’s throats over how their assets should be divided. They would not be in this position though if they did not agree on at least one thing – there is ample value in them.A merchant power generator that relies on relatively modern coal-fired units for around two-thirds of its output, Dynegy was felled by a collapsing “dark spread” – the margin it could earn on the wholesale price of power generally set by more flexible natural gas-fired units. After a golden era around the middle of the last decade, the collapse in gas prices as a result of the recession and the shale gas boom along with stricter emissions rules has compressed this spread to the point that older coal plants were shuttered en masse. Last year, about four times as many planned or existing coal units were mothballed as were built from 2000-2008.But markets have a way of overcorrecting. Benchmark natural gas prices, now around $3.70 per million British thermal units, are not only a fraction of those in Asia or Europe but far too low for some shale projects to be economical. With new nuclear construction highly uncertain and carbon-free sources contributing piddling sums, coal’s loss of market share to gas should slow. In the absence of more stringent environmental regulations, the US Department of Energy forecasts that coal-fired generation will rise by a quarter between 2009 and 2035, only slightly lagging overall market growth.That longer-term perspective was in part what enticed the hedge funds now scrapping over Dynegy’s carcass as well as investors in companies such as NRG that remain solvent. Though coal plants are worth far below what they cost to build, that cannot last forever. The spread is always darkest before the dawn.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

JPMorgan rose 6.6 per cent to $30.26 and Citigroup rose 5.5 per cent to $24.39.Regional bank stocks also surged, with Fifth Third Bancorp up 8.6 per cent to $10.64 and Zions Bancorp up 7.8 per cent to $10.64.“It’s good to see a bounce in stocks. It’s been a one-way street for several days now,” said Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “But volatility is so high, it’s unclear which way the market will eventually go.”Utility stocks in the S&P 500 were down 0.5 per cent, the only sector of the S&P 500 to fall.NRG Energy, the power generator and electricity supplier, fell 1.8 per cent to $19.57 after decreasing its revenue guidance for the quarter on Monday evening, citing bad weather in Texas, which interrupted supply to retail customers.Northeast Utilities System fell 2.5 per cent to $31.27 and Edison International fell 2.2 per cent to $36.30.Utility stocks also fell 2.3 per cent on Monday but before that had not had a single day’s fall of more than 2 per cent since early August as investors flocked to defensive names.The reason appeared to be the heavy selling of an exchange traded fund that tracks the S&P 500’s utility sector.The Utilities Select SPDR was down 0.5 per cent to $32.66 after three blocks of more than 300,000 shares each were traded in the morning session.By midday, 10m shares had been traded in the ETF, just short of the full-day average of 11.8m.“It looks like someone is selling off the utilities ETF,” said Angie Storozynski, energy analyst at Macquarie. “Nothing could convince me to sell utilities at the moment, it’s exactly the protection I would want right now.”Some traders speculated that the sell-off was due to an institution raising funds to cover short positions as the broader index tumbled in the morning session.Semiconductor stocks performed strongly with MEMC Electronic Materials up 9.3 per cent to $5.19, Nvidia up 9.2 per cent to $12.90 and the Philadelphia semiconductor index up almost 4.2 per cent.The moves followed the release of semiconductor sales data for August, which was not as bad as expected.Romit Shah, a Nomura analyst, warned unit growth was “sub-seasonal” and predicted “another (and likely deeper) round of estimate revisions” but stocks benefited from a relief rally.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index outperform the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The Nasdaq was up 3 per cent to 2,404.82 while the Dow was up 1.4 per cent to 10,808.18.Apple fell 0.6 per cent to $372.50 on a lukewarm reception for its latest iPhone model, the 4s, unveiled Tuesday afternoon. Jefferies analyst Peter Misek tipped the stock to turn round on Wednesday.“The surface is underwhelming because the 4s looks just like the iPhone 4, but underneath the hood there is a lot to be excited about,” he said. Mr Misek also tipped the lower priced 3gs to become a “global blockbuster,” if it is rolled out worldwide at a low price.The New York Stock Exchange was up 3.5 per cent to $22.75 on reports that the European Commission may block its merger with German exchange Deutsche Börse.Yahoo rose 6.9 per cent to $14.46 on reports that private equity house Silver Lake and Russian group Digital Sky Technologies have joined Chinese ecommerce site Alibaba in its bid for the internet gateway service.Material and energy stocks which had been sold off heavily on Monday and last week, also benefited from the late buying. Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, closed up 8.8 per cent to $17.44. Its rival Cliff Natural Resources also jumped 10.6 per cent to $53.41.
25;NRG;NRG Energy;2011-09-15T16:26:14Z;US energy groups act on natural gas demand;;US energy companies are converting rigs and trucks to run on natural gas, building fuelling stations and launching educational campaigns to increase demand for the domestic fuel that has flooded the market on the back of the shale boom.With technological advances enabling gas production from shale rock, estimates of US supplies of natural gas have risen from 30 to 100 years’ worth, at current usage rates, with the US market now oversupplied.Prices have been hovering at about $4 per million British thermal units, down sharply from 2008’s record of $13.69 per mBtu, and the industry believes they could remain at that level for several years.To jump-start demand, Chesapeake Energy, the second-biggest natural gas producer in the US, is converting 100 of its own rigs, all its hydraulic fracturing equipment and almost 5,000 of its fleet vehicles to run on natural gas.Taylor Shinn, Chesapeake’s senior director of corporate development, said the company was not going to stand by and wait for US demand to catch up with supply.“This is not a technology problem,” Mr Shinn said. “We’re not waiting on an enhanced battery to make this product viable as a transportation fuel. What we’re waiting on is for economies of scale to develop.”Chesapeake has pledged to redirect about 1-2 per cent of its forecast annual drilling budget away from efforts to increase natural gas supply towards projects to stimulate natural gas demand. Over the next 10 years, Chesapeake expects to commit $1bn towards investments to build crucial fuelling infrastructure and bringing gas-to-liquids fuels to market.Chesapeake said converting the company’s medium and light-duty trucks to natural gas would reduce fuel costs by up to $20m a year. Converting drilling rigs and fracturing equipment would cut diesel fuel consumption by about 350,000 gallons a day, saving the company about $230m annually.“The market needs a catalyst,” Mr Shinn said. “We felt it was a critical time for us to step up and provide that leadership for the benefit of our company and our country.”ConocoPhillips also this week launched a campaign to promote the use of natural gas – now 40 per cent of its production – and a nationwide educational campaign.Jim Mulva, ConocoPhillips’ chief executive, said using the country’s natural gas should be a very important part of US energy policy.“It’s a big job creator,” Mr Mulva said. He noted that natural gas sustains 2.8m US jobs, directly and indirectly, with gas being extracted from shale fields in at least 15 states, including New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania – key election states.“We believe that as the US enters the election campaign season, energy policy will be a key point of debate,” he said. “Hopefully, the debate will centre on using energy development, particularly of natural gas, to drive job creation.”Other companies are installing natural gas fuelling stations across the country. US Steel, for example, has one for its vehicles, including a natural-gas fuelled tractor, at a plant in Pennsylvania. The industry notes that such companies can save as much as $2 a gallon compared with diesel.
26;NRG;NRG Energy;2011-04-20T01:22:40Z;NRG Energy set for $481m writedown charge;;NRG Energy, the US power producer, said it would take a first-quarter 2011 pre-tax charge of $481m to write down its investment in nuclear power due to “diminished prospects’’ for a US renaissance following Japan’s crisis.NRG in 2007 filed the first application to build new nuclear reactors in the US in 29 years.The project, to build two nuclear power reactors in Texas, was billed as moving US electrical generation to a cost-effective power that does not contribute to global climate change.But last month Nuclear Innovation North America, the company’s nuclear development joint venture with Toshiba American Nuclear Energy, suspended indefinitely all detailed engineering work and other pre-construction activities, dramatically reducing the project workforce. “The tragic nuclear incident in Japan has introduced multiple uncertainties around new nuclear development in the United States,’’ said David Crane, NRG’s chief executive.That had dramatically reduced the probability that the two reactors planned could be successfully developed in a timely fashion, he said.Nonetheless, Mr Crane said he continued to believe in the “absolute necessity’’ of a US nuclear renaissance.“However, the extraordinary challenges facing US nuclear development in the present circumstance and the very considerable financial resources expended by NRG on the project over the past five years make it impossible for us to justify to our shareholders any further financial participation in the development.’’NRG expects to record the charge of about $481m for the impairment of all the net assets of the joint venture.The writedown consists of $331m of net assets funded by NRG, along with $150m of net investment contributed by Toshiba.NRG said it would not invest additional capital in the project.Going forward, the joint venture will focus solely on securing a combined operating licence from the NRC and on obtaining a loan guarantee from the US Department of Energy – both of which NRG said were “absolutely essential’’ to the success of any future project development.Toshiba will be responsible for funding ongoing costs to continue the licensing process.To support the reduced scope of work, NRG said it would incur one-time costs, related to a contribution to the joint venture, which are not expected to exceed $20m.These costs will be incurred, and expensed, primarily in the second quarter of 2011.NRG said it would co-operate with and support its current partners and any prospective future partners in attempting to develop the reactors.The company owns and operates one of the biggest and most diverse power generation portfolios in the country.
27;NRG;NRG Energy;2010-11-04T18:20:29Z;Dynegy claws its way back from the brink;;"When Bruce Williamson became chief executive of Dynegy eight years ago, the energy company had $14bn in gross debt and was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.Its market capitalisation had fallen to about $250m from a peak of about $9bn a year earlier.The independent power producer had diversified into energy trading and was building a broadband internet service on top of its natural gas business. But Enron’s collapse amid charges of fraud undermined sector confidence.Companies in the sector had too much debt from building too many power plants in an oversupplied market. Share prices fell below the price of a cup of coffee. Several competitors – Mirant, NRG Energy and Calpine – filed for bankruptcy.Mr Williamson was determined to avoid the same fate when he entered the executive suite in the skyscraper then badged with the company’s name. He was the second chief executive to follow Chuck Watson, who had led Dynegy into the Enron-era storm.While Mr Williamson has avoided bankruptcy, Dynegy’s name is off the building; it occupies just eight floors compared with 26 before the crisis.Mr Williamson’s office is littered with plexiglass “trophies,” gifted by bankers to mark debt restructurings. He has reduced net debt to $4bn by selling assets, cleaned up Dynegy’s coal plants and erased questions about ethics relating to the jailing of four former executives.Nonetheless, he believes shareholders deserve better. “The story shouldn’t just be that the company is alive for another year and then more restructuring,’’ he says.On August 13, Mr Williamson announced a deal to sell Dynegy to the Blackstone Group for $4.50 a share – a 62 per cent premium to the share price on the day before the deal was announced.Shareholders are to vote on November 17 whether to approve Blackstone’s all-cash offer of $4.7bn, which values Dynegy’s equity at about $543m.“Blackstone has the balance sheet and the ability, because of that financial strength, to take a long-term view,’’ Mr Williamson says. It is betting power demand will rise with an economic expansion.But last month Carl Icahn, the activist investor, bought a 9.95 per cent stake in Dynegy, saying the buy-out undervalued the shares.Seneca Capital, an activist fund, picked up 9.3 per cent of Dynegy and is considering a proposal to replace two board members.Karl Miller, an energy asset manager and consultant, independently offered to lead Dynegy himself.“There are those executives that are not capable of building a growth company,” Mr Miller says. “It takes combining strategy, execution, capital and confidence of investors. Bruce has never demonstrated the ability to put that together. I can do that.”Mr Williamson insists Blackstone’s offer is the best shareholders will get. No other offer materialised in spite of Dynegy contacting 40 parties during the “go-shop’’ period.Dynegy’s balance sheet will worsen, he says, given future projections for low US natural gas prices: “Forward natural gas prices are the driver of Dynegy’s future revenue stream.’’US natural gas prices have been trading around $3-$4 per million British thermal units (mBtu) in recent months, since falling from a record of $13.69 per mBtu in 2008. “Our portfolio makes or loses $165m for every $1 move in natural gas prices,” Mr Williamson says.“The fundamental move in the natural gas market has driven down our earnings power.”Dynegy’s share price has risen as high as $5.10 since the $2.78 per share it traded at on August 12, the day before Blackstone’s offer was announced. On Thursday it was trading at $4.50.Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis told investors on Thursday that they should reject the takeover in favour of alternatives such as refinancing or buying back debt to lower costs.If the deal is approved, Mr Williamson will lose his job, but walk away with $18.7m in change-of-control payments.The deal stipulates that Blackstone will sell four of Dynegy’s 12 natural gas-fired power stations to NRG, a Dynegy competitor, for $1.36bn, but keep the group’s coal-fired power plants.Critics suggest Dynegy should make the sale itself.But Mr Williamson says selling would trigger the repayment of $1.9bn in debt, a sum the company would be unable to cover with the proceeds from the sale.“We’ve worked really hard,” Mr Williamson says.“We would have liked it to turn out differently. But you have to be dispassionately pragmatic.’’"
28;NRG;NRG Energy;2010-09-16T17:05:41Z;NRG to buy Green Mountain Energy;;NRG Energy, a US power generation company, is to acquire Green Mountain Energy, a retail provider of clean energy products and services, underlining the interest among generators to expand their renewable energy portfolios.The $350m cash deal, announced on Thursday, will add to solar and wind projects already complementing NRG’s traditional fuel sources, ranging from nuclear to coal and natural gas.It will enable privately held Green Mountain to expand beyond the residential and commercial customers it has, mainly in Texas and the New York metro region.This deal marks the second time this month that a US power supplier has bought into the renewables sector. On September 1, Exelon, the biggest nuclear generator in the US, announced plans to buy John Deere Renewables for as much as $900m to gain a foothold in the wind power industry.There is renewed interest in investing in energy, which has been damped for several years by uncertainty surrounding the economy and proposed energy legislation. While that uncertainty has not cleared, the companies with cash are keen to spend and deals are gathering momentum.The Blackstone Group, an investment and advisory firm, said in August it would acquire Dynegy, a US power generator, in a $4.7bn deal, including the assumption of debt. The deal includes an agreement for Blackstone to sell four of Dynegy’s natural-gas fired assets to NRG for $1.36bn cash.NRG also added to its renewables portfolio in June, when it acquired South Trent Wind, a wind farm in Texas, for $111m.“A permanent and fast-growing portion of the American population is seeking to live sustainably across all key phases of their lifestyle, including the energy they use in their homes, at work and in their personal transportation,’’ said David Crane, NRG president and chief executive.“Increasingly, NRG, with our expanding portfolio of wind, solar and biomass initiatives, working with and through Green Mountain, is poised to become the clean energy provider of choice for Americans who want to make a difference for the environment,’’ he said.NRG said the acquisition would contribute $70m to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation annually. The deal is expected to close mid-November.Its operating revenues for the six months ended June 30 were $4.35bn. It had $2.17bn cash on its balance sheet.Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co Securities noted that NRG is not integrating its operations with Green Mountain, which will be run as a standalone business, so there will be no synergies. In a research note, it added, that the firm was “not sure of the value of adding a competing retail brand name.’’NRG shares edged slightly lower to trade at $21.75 at midday in New York.

The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,173.48, down 5 per cent over the five days.Fears about the pace of the economic recovery dominated markets this week after the Federal Reserve downgraded its outlook for the economy.Weak Chinese economic data weighed on the industrials, materials and energy sectors. Data showed on Friday that US retail sales rose less than expected in July,
up 0.4 per cent compared with a forecast increase of 0.5 per cent.Excluding cars and petrol, purchases fell 0.1 per cent, showing that underlying consumer confidence remained shaky.Separate data showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent and by 0.1 per cent excluding food and energy.Lawrence Creatura, vice- president and portfolio manager at Federated Investors, said July was not a significant month in the retail calendar and investors would be focusing on the back-to-school season as well as retailers reporting earnings next week for indicators of consumer confidence.The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose slightly more than expected in August but investors were un-moved by the data. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector declined 1.1 per cent, with the S&P 500 retailers down 1.4 per cent.JC Penney, the department store chain, warned of an “uncertain” outlook for consumer spending and lowered its profit forecast for the year. It projected a profit of $1.50 a share compared with a previous forecast of about $1.64.In the last quarter, revenue met analyst expectations and net income rose to $14m compared with a loss of $1m for the same period last year. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $19.82.Nordstrom dropped 7.2 per cent to $31.05 after it maintained its full-year forecast and said its expenses rose. The chain reported earnings in line with analyst expectations.In other earnings news, Nvidia rose 4.8 per cent to $9.39 in spite of a widening in its quarterly loss.The chipmaker said profit margins would rise in the third quarter because of a new range of products. It was reported that the company was working on a microprocessor for tablet devices that would compete with Intel products. Intel fell 1.5 per cent to $19.15.DeVry, the operator of for-profit further education colleges, enrolled more students, revenue rose and earnings for the fourth quarter almost doubled to a better-than-expected 99 cents per share.But it fell 5.7 per cent to $42.71 ahead of a Department of Education report on its proposed requirements for student loan eligibility.In deal news, Blackstone Group agreed to acquire the Texas power producer Dynegy for $4.50 a share, a 62 per cent premium on Thursday’s closing price.After Blackstone assumes Dynegy’s debt, the acquisition’s value will total about $4.7bn.Blackstone will sell four natural gas-fired assets, owned by Dynegy, to NRG Energy for about $1.36bn in cash. Dynegy surged 59 per cent to $4.42, Blackstone fell 3.5 per cent to $10.63 and NRG Energy was down 2 per cent to $21.96.Vaccine biotechnology company Emergent Bio-Solutions said it had agreed to buy Trubion Pharmaceuticals for up to $135.5m in cash and shares as it tried to expand its product pipeline into oncology and autoimmune diseases.Emergent Biosolutions fell 5.8 per cent to $17.43 while Trubion Pharmaceuticals soared 50 per cent to $4.50."
30;NRG;NRG Energy;2010-07-21T20:35:34Z;US stocks slide on Bernanke comments;;"Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s comments that the economic outlook remained “unusually uncertain” sparked a broad-based sell-off on Wall Street with all major sectors of the S&P 500 falling.The S&P 500 closed down 1.3 per cent at 1,069.56, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 10,120.30, and the Nasdaq was 1.6 per cent weaker at 2,187.33.“The market was looking for a bit more conviction that the recovery remained on track, and certainly conviction was lacking,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. “The Fed chairman continued to forecast sustained recovery but in a subdued way.”Six of the top ten S&P sectors fell more than the index, with energy, financials and consumer discretionary suffering the most.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index fell 1.8 per cent as investors feared a slower recovery would mean shoppers with less money in their pockets. The S&P 500 financial sector, which started the day up on positive results from Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, also fell 1.8 per cent after Mr Bernanke spoke. Bank of America fell 2.5 per cent to $13.42 and JPMorgan Chase lost 3.1 per cent to $38.42.Morgan Stanley soared 8 per cent to $27.23 after it announced adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents, beating analysts’ average estimate of 46 cents per share.Wells Fargo rose 1.8 per cent to $26.37 after its second-quarter profit fell less than expected and losses on consumer and commercial loans were lower than in its first quarter. Net income declined 3 per cent to $3.06bn.The S&P 500 energy sector also suffered after crude oil fell following a government report that there had been an unexpected increase in US supplies and the highest rate of refinery operation in almost three years.The sector dropped 1.4 per cent with Hess Corporation, oil company, down 3.8 per cent at $50.89. Coal producer Massey Energy fell 3.1 per cent to $28.42 and Smith International declined 2.5 per cent to $41.17.Utilities companies also declined with power company Constellation Energy Group falling 2.3 per cent to $32.89, NRG losing 2.2 per cent to $22.04 and DTE down 2 per cent at $46.83.Stocks buoyed by positive earnings news earlier in the session remained up. Apple rose 1.8 per cent to $256.53 after it reported after the closing bell on Tuesday. It issued an unusually upbeat revenue forecast, projecting sales of $18bn for the current quarter, higher than analysts’ consensus of $17bn.In the financial sector, BlackRock, the asset manager, fell 2.4 per cent to $145.85 in spite of better than expected results, after clients withdrew money for the second quarter running.Laurence Fink, chief executive, said some clients had had to withdraw money because of concentration issues after it acquired Barclays Global Investors.

31;NRG;NRG Energy;2010-02-18T01:43:46Z;Energy companies fight own emissions corner;;After making common cause for years, the energy companies campaigning for legislation to curb US greenhouse gas emissions are finding that what divides them may be as important as what unites them.On Tuesday, BP and ConocoPhillips, the oil and gas groups, withdrew from the US Climate Action Partnership, which campaigns for climate legislation.They say they need to make their case for themselves as the debate moves from whether an emissions cap is needed, to how it would be implemented.As the details come into focus, oil and gas companies are being split off from the power generators such as Duke Energy, Exelon and NRG Energy, which remain members of the USCAP. The oil and gas companies say they still want an energy and environment bill to be passed, but do not want just any bill. In particular, they are concentrating on lobbying for legislation promoting natural gas as a way to reduce carbon emissions.Oil companies argue that many of the bills that have come before Congress place an unfair burden on motor fuels and offer too many concessions to coal.The Waxman-Markey bill that passed in the House of Representatives last year, for example, allocates 2 per cent of allowances to fuel producers but makes them responsible for 44 per cent of emissions.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, said last year the proposed legislation could threaten the sustainability of the US refining industry, costing US refiners $100bn (€73bn, £64bn) a year within three years. That would hit an industry under pressure from a drop in demand.On top of that, the industry is upset President Barack Obama’s new budget outlines about $80bn in tax increases on the US oil and gas industry.Jim Mulva, chief executive of Conoco, explained the bills in Congress seek unnecessarily punitive measures on the industry while ignoring the “critical role” natural gas could play in reducing carbon emissions. Natural gas is about 50 per cent less carbon intensive than coal.Larry Nichols, chief executive of Devon Energy and chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s national trade organisation, said: “We do not understand how the Obama administration and Congress can advocate subsidies for nuclear energy, wind and solar while calling for new taxes on natural gas.” Mr Nichols said he was not surprised BP and Conoco left USCAP.Royal Dutch Shell, the last remaining big oil company in the USCAP, shares Conoco Phillips’ concerns but the company will stay in USCAP to “remain engaged”.
32;NRG;NRG Energy;2009-07-27T21:35:05Z;M&A;Managers are no longer sheltering from the crisis;"No. That is what you would expect a target company to reply when an unsolicited bidder comes knocking. And “no” is what a series of unwanted bidders have lately got. Bottlers have rejected PepsiCo’s unsolicited offers. Anglo American has snubbed Xstrata. Oil company Venture Production is resisting a £1.3bn bid from UK utility Centrica. Meanwhile, Resolution’s offer for British fund manager Friends Provident has run into the sand. What is noteworthy, however, is that these hostile bids have been tabled at all. Only four months ago, the world was supposedly headed for financial Armageddon.The return of hostility is an encouraging sign. It shows animal spirits are returning to corporate boardrooms. Managers are no longer sheltering from the crisis under the table. Worldwide there are twice as many hostile bids around, as a percentage of total deals, than there have been annually, on average, since 2000. In some countries, there has been an absolute rise too. In the UK there have been more hostile bids so far this year than in all of 2008, even excluding Xstrata/Anglo, according to Dealogic.This makes economic sense. Many industries need restructuring. Companies with strong balance sheets that have weathered the crisis are now taking opportunistic pot-shots at weaker peers. Targets naturally respond that these offers undervalue their “true value”, as they are based on recently depressed share prices.That has put acquirers in a bind. They have been reluctant – or unable – to get the extra financing they need to make knockout cash offers with juicy premiums. That is how US utility NRG Energy effectively rebuffed Exelon. Indeed, the only big mergers and acquisitions restructuring taking place is where government financial backing is available – as in the state-guaranteed loans on offer in the car industry. Hostility has come back, but not credit with it. Until it does, acquirers’ bark may prove worse than their bite.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

33;NRG;NRG Energy;2009-07-21T20:49:08Z;Late rally lifts US stocks;;A late rally for US stocks saw the markets build on Monday’s impressive gains on Tuesday and set new highs for the year, spurred on by signs of growth in global demand from Caterpillar.The machinery maker led the markets throughout the day after it beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings, and said it saw signs of stabilisation.The shares closed 7.7 per cent higher at $39.46 after a dip from even higher opening levels following a warning during the morning conference call that the company might make a loss in the third quarter.Rival equipment maker Deere & Co also rose, climbing 1.9 per cent to $40.54.“Caterpillar is talking about global stimulus looking as if it is beginning to have an effect on demand,” said Quincy Krosby, the market strategist at Prudential Financial.“Investors are starting to look beyond the US consumer for sources of growth.” Late buying saw equities follow Caterpillar upwards, despite earlier caution triggered by concerns over the timing of the Federal Reserve’s exit from quantitative easing and renewed worries over the future of CIT Group.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke was addressing Congress in his semi-annual testimony to lawmakers, but he did not say when the Fed would start to reverse its extraordinary measures used to stimulate the economy.This led to uncertainty and early selling pressure on Wall Street.“Investors are cautious, and I’m not sure that people want to take a position during the Bernanke testimony,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.That nervousness added to fresh concerns for CITafter the struggling commercial lender warned the $3bn finance package it secured over the weekend might not save it from bankruptcy. Its shares fell 21.6 per cent to 98 cents.The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw the sharpest rise, supported by encouraging earnings from several of its component companies.Drugmaker Merck was a strong performer after it beat expectations, helped by a lower effective tax rate and tight cost controls. The shares rose 6.1 per cent to $29.65.Shares in Schering-Plough, the smaller rival Merck has agreed to buy, gained 3.8 per cent to $26.53 after net income jumped 45 per cent on strong sales of an anti-allergy inhaler and arthritis treatment, helping it to beat expectations.DuPont, the chemical maker, also saw cost controls help negate weaker revenues but the shares slipped a fraction to $28.32.The company’s corn and soybean sales improved in its agricultural unit, and that was enough to give a jolt to shares in Monsanto, the market leader in that field, which picked up 4.6 per cent to $80.08.The Dow closed 0.8 per cent up at 8,915.94, while the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index both rose 0.4 per cent to 954.58 and 1,916.20, respectively.Both the S&P and Nasdaq were at new closing highs for the year.Not every Dow component impressed with its earnings, however. Coca-Cola lost 1.3 per cent to $50.35 even after beating estimates as investors focused on disappointing revenues.United Technologies fell sharply after the company cut its forecast for full-year earnings, with demand for its building and aircraft equipment remaining low. The shares gave up 1.8 per cent to $53.97.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, as Regions Financial reported a wider loss than expected, with mounting losses on commercial and real estate taking their toll on the bank. The shares lost 15.4 per cent to $3.42.BlackRock, the asset manager poised to buy Barclays Global Investors, also fell, dropping 0.4 per cent to $184.14 even after it saw profits beat expectations.Meanwhile, profits at UnitedHealth jumped after higher unemployment led more customers to sign up for its government-backed Medicare insurance plans. Its shares were 3 per cent higher at $25.59.Elsewhere, NRG suddenly jumped during the morning after shareholders in effect ended a $7.7bn hostile bid from rival Exelon by rejecting its nominations for NRG’s board. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $24.82.
34;NRG;NRG Energy;2009-07-21T19:39:06Z;Exelon retreats after NRG shareholder rebuff;;Exelon dropped its $7.5bn hostile bid for NRG Energy on Tuesday after the rival US power producer’s shareholders voted to install its own nominees to its board of directors rather than candidates proposed by Exelon.Exelon took its fight to NRG shareholders after NRG’s board rejected its takeover offers repeatedly and refused to negotiate unless Exelon raised its bid substantially. Exelon had nominated up to nine candidates to NRG’s board and proposed to increase the board’s size.NRG shareholders voted down Exelon’s proposals and re-elected four NRG directors, according to preliminary results, and signalled more broadly an unwillingness to sell the company at the current price.Shares of NRG, which has been resisting Exelon’s advances since October, rose 3.4 per cent even as the prospect that Exelon would pay a premium for them evaporated. “We like NRG better as a stand-alone story,” said the research arm of energy-focused firm Tudor Pickering, saying NRG shares were worth $32 without the takeover offer.Shares of Exelon, which said it would cancel its offer if none of its candidates was elected, rose by 2.7 per cent, to $53.32 at midday.“The NRG shareholders have spoken, and Exelon will move on,” said John Rowe, Exelon’s chairman and chief executive, in a written statement after the vote. Exelon said it was “unwilling to raise its price to a level that would undermine Exelon’s own value proposition”.Exelon’s latest offer, which it made on July 2, had comprised 0.545 Exelon shares for each share of NRG, a 12 per cent increase on its initial bid.NRG contended that Exelon’s higher offer still undervalued the company dramatically, and said it set the floor for a broader process to sell the company at too low a level to justify an auction. NRG has tried to rouse other suitors who are willing to pay a substantial premium to Exelon’s bid, but has been unsuccessful.Chicago-based Exelon has suffered a string of failed takeover attempts since 2003, when it scrapped plans to buy an Illinois utility from Dynegy after running into resistance from lawmakers.Three years later, Exelon decided to cancel its $17bn deal to buy Public Service Enterprise Group when lengthy negotiations failed with regulators who were demanding concessions.Mr Rowe said Exelon would now “redouble” its focus on its own growth opportunities, in part by expanding its low-carbon nuclear power generation output.
35;NRG;NRG Energy;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

If its full roster of nine new nominees is elected, Exelon plans to “press forward with determination toward completion of the proposed transaction”.If four new nominees are elected, which would keep the size of NRG’s board at 14 members, Exelon hedged its bets and reserved the right not to continue with its bid.NRG stressed in a letter last week to its shareholders that the four major US proxy advisory firms have recommended they vote for NRG’s four nominees and against Exelon’s proposed nominees and efforts to expand the board.David Crane, NRG’s chief executive, told the Financial Times in a recent interview that other companies were “definitely” interested in buying NRG. However, he said Exelon’s initial bid was so low that it set the pricing floor for a potential auction beneath a level he was willing to entertain.NRG has approached Spain’s Iberdrola, Germany’s Eon and France’s EDF to gauge whether they would substantially exceed Exelon’s bid, according to a person close to the matter, but it has not dredged up a buyer.“NRG continues to believe that Exelon’s hostile proposal is inadequate, highly conditional and does not compensate NRG stockholders for the value our company has created,” NRG said last week.In response to NRG’s efforts to find a “white knight” suitor, Exelon said it found it “odd that NRG engaged in a ‘market discovery’ process for over eight months without talking to Exelon”.Exelon pledged to stay disciplined on pricing but said it was prepared to raise its bid if further analysis indicated that NRG was worth more.
37;NRG;NRG Energy;2009-07-08T23:21:57Z;Wall Street rallies in choppy trade;;"US stocks rallied late on Wednesday to end a choppy session close to where they began as investors waited cautiously for the start of the earnings season, due to open after the bell with results from Alcoa.The aluminium maker gained 1.6 per cent on an otherwise bearish Tuesday after Klaus Kleinfield, the chief executive, said he was “very optimistic” about sales. The stock swung on Wednesday as investors bet on whether the company would beat its estimates, and ended the day 0.5 per cent up at $9.46.It then jumped in the post-market session after the company reported a narrower loss than had been expected.Meanwhile, NRG defied a bearish energy sector as the price of oil continued to tumble after the company rejected a fresh takeover offer from utility company Exelon as too low.The increased bid was made last week, but NRG rebuffed the offer on Wednesday, saying it fell “far short”. NRG gained 5.8 per cent to $23.35, while Exelon closed 1 per cent up at $48.21.Financial stocks also suffered, in spite of the promise of revenues from mortgage purchases, as new mortgage applications were shown to have risen 10.9 per cent last week.Investors were more concerned with predictions from the International
Monetary Fund that the global economic contraction this year would be slightly worse than previous estimates and that the recovery was “likely to be sluggish”.Those words were echoed by G8 leaders, who are meeting in Italy this week. A G8 draft document read: “Significant risks still remain to economic and financial stability.”Citigroup and Bank of America lost 2.6 per cent to $2.62 and $11.84, respectively.“The overwhelming theme is still one of trepidation,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “Moving into earnings season, a lot of people now think those green shoots were at best weeds. There doesn’t seem to be any
reason to buy financial stocks right now.” But the stock market was able to rebound off its lows during the afternoon after a well-subscribed auction of 10-year government debt reassured investors about the state of US finances.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 879.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 8,178.41 and the Nasq Composite index dropped 0.1 per cent to 1,747.17.“There has been a reassessment of the profit outlook as last week’s weak unemployment report suggested consumption is not going to be nearly as strong as stock prices suggested when the S&P was at 940,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.The most significant support came from the healthcare sector, where Amgen surged 13.9 per cent to $59.50 after the company said its lead experimental drug, which helps strengthen bones, performed better than a potential rival in a clinical trial.It was joined in early trade by Amylin, Alkermes and Eli Lilly, which rose after the companies said an application for a jointly developed weekly diabetes drug had been accepted by the Food and Drug Agency.But all three gave up those gains amid the wider sell-off. Amylin ended 1.4 per cent lower at $12.29, Alkermes was down 0.3 per cent at $10.23 and Eli Lilly was 0.2 per cent worse off at $33.42.There was some strength from copper miners after Citigroup upgraded Free-port McMoRan and Southern Copper. Both gained 0.2 per cent to $45.10 and $19.16, respectively.Consumer stocks were more resilient, however, with results from Family Dollar providing a boost.The budget retailer jumped 12.4 per cent to $31.18 after profits surged 36 per cent and the company said fourth-quarter profits would be in line with or above current estimates.But Pepsi Bottling Group fell in spite of beating analysts’ expectations as sales fell short of what investors had hoped. Its shares dipped 0.4 per cent to $33.53.In the technology sector, Google claimed first blood in its latest battle with Microsoft. Google plans to launch a PC operating system to rival Windows and saw its shares climb 1.5 per cent to $402.49. Those for Microsoft rose only 0.1 per cent to $22.56."
38;NRG;NRG Energy;2009-07-08T16:06:56Z;NRG rejects sweetened bid from Exelon;;NRG Energy, which has been fighting off the takeover advances of rival electricity supplier Exelon since last October, rejected a higher offer worth $7bn made by Exelon last week and said Exelon should be willing to pay more.NRG, which claims Exelon’s initial offer “grossly undervalued” the company, said on Wednesday that the higher, all-stock bid still did not recognise NRG’s growth potential and the additional value it has created in recent months.NRG’s shareholders would contribute an average of 30 per cent of the merged company’s cash flows while receiving a stake of just 18 per cent, the company said, and would not be adequately paid for NRG’s assets, including the recently-purchased retail business of Reliant Energy.Exelon said when it sweetened its bid on July 2 that it was including the value of the the Reliant business, along with additional cost savings it expected to extract once the companies were combined. Exelon’s new offer would pay 0.545 of an Exelon share for each NRG share, which valued NRG’s shares at $26.36 at mid-morning on Wednesday.As part of its argument for a higher offer, NRG boosted its liquidity projections and raised its estimate for 2009 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to $2.5bn from $2.175bn.
39;NRG;NRG Energy;2009-07-02T22:14:16Z;Renewed NRG;;"The recession created many motivated sellers – but buyers sometimes need to show more motivation, too. In hindsight, Exelon’s bid last autumn to become America’s largest electric utility by buying NRG was far from the knockout blow necessary to win over shareholders. Eating its words about not sweetening its “very sweet” offer, it justified Thursday’s 12.4 per cent increase weeks before NRG’s crucial annual meeting by identifying further cost savings. In fact, its first offer was opportunistic and it had little choice given the appreciation of NRG stock that had left the original offer at a 4 per cent discount.NRG management’s cool reception last year made sense and served shareholders well. But they should not reflexively reject the latest offer. True, the premium remains modest and is still 40 per cent below NRG’s price a year ago. Much has changed in eight months though, including visibility about power prices. They may stay weak for quite some time based on the forward natural gas curve, reducing the intrinsic value of low-cost coal and nuclear plants. Exelon’s decision to slow down a large nuclear development of its own keeps NRG’s more viable South Texas Project attractive. Financial markets have recovered enough that Exelon’s need to refinance NRG’s debt is no huge obstacle.The divestitures a deal makes necessary still hurt, but the cost savings Exelon touts appear realistic and the advantages of a bigger, better balance sheet are meaningful. Some analysts argue the new offer is still low and too late. Perhaps. But deciding to remain independent is not as attractive as last October. If the original offer was the proverbial bird in the hand versus two in the bush, the new one is more like one and a half in the bush.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

40;NRG;NRG Energy;2009-07-02T20:44:48Z;Wall Street slides on jobs report;;"US stocks took a pounding on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index turning negative for the year as investors reacted to data showing many more people lost their jobs in June than expected.Analysts had far underestimated the number of new non-farm employees who would lose their jobs during the month, and even though the unemployment rate and the number of people claiming jobless benefits on a weekly basis were both better than expected, the market sold off heavily.Consumer stocks were directly hit by concerns over joblessness, and retailers felt some of the worst effects. Macy’s gave up 6.3 per cent to $11, while Best Buy dropped 5.3 per cent to $32.08 and Nordstrom, the clothing retailer, declined 7.1 per cent to $18.63.“The jobless figures were abysmal,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.“We’re now in a malevolent cycle and the risk is that the government will have to issue even more debt. This could lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine the whole V-shaped recovery.”But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, disagreed. “The market is over-reacting,” he said. “The combined loss of jobs for the last two months is only just more than that seen in January. These are the beginning stages of the stabilisation of the unemployment rate.”The S&P 500 closed 2.9 per cent down at 896.42 while the Dow Jones was 2.6 per cent per cent lower at 8,280.74. This was after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extended for 15 minutes after a technical glitch.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7 per cent to 1,796.52.That left the markets between 1.8 and 2.5 per cent lower for the week, which was cut short because of the Independence Day
holiday.Thursday’s selling knocked the markets out of the narrow trading range they had been in all week, which saw the close of the best quarter for the S&P since December 1998.Equities rose and fell with the price of commodities throughout the week, with oil climbing above $72 a barrel only to fall back below $68.But in a week which saw the release of several important pieces of economic data, trading volumes remained thin, with much of Wall Street taking an early break ahead of the long weekend.There was further volatility in commodities on Thursday, and energy producers fell as the price of oil continued the previous sessions’ declines.Schlumberger gave up 3.2 per cent to $52.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $40.96.Elsewhere in the sector, NRG gave up its pre-market gains, which had been made on an increased bid from Exelon after a fall in Exelon’s share price meant there would be less of a premium attached for NRG shareholders.The bid is now $7.45bn, but NRG’s shares fell with the price of oil, dropping 4.8 per cent to $24.80. Exelon lost 4.3 per cent to $49.37.Materials companies also suffered and Freeport McMoRan the copper and gold miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $49.72. Newmont Mining dropped 4.6 per cent to $40.26.Airlines fluctuated as Morgan Stanley reviewed its ratings on some of the biggest US carriers. The bank started coverage on Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest, recommending a price target of $9 after recent selling pressure.The shares climbed 0.5 per cent to $5.88.Morgan Stanley also upgraded shares in Continental Airlines, saying it was a likely survivor from the fall-out in the industry.There was some pressure on the stock from news on Wednesday evening that its revenue per seat may have fallen more than 20 per cent in June compared with a year earlier. But the shares still managed to gain 6.2 per cent to $9.79.Southwest Airlines fell 4.4 per cent to $6.50, however, after the bank downgraded its shares, saying higher oil prices would take a toll on profit margins.Meanwhile Illumina, which makes equipment to analyse DNA, dropped after reporting lower revenues than expected as cash-strapped researchers delayed orders. The shares lost 12.3 per cent to $33.46."
41;NRG;NRG Energy;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Exelon sets out ‘final’ bid for NRG;;"Exelon on Thursday increased its hostile bid for NRG Energy by 12 per cent to about $7.5bn and called the move its “best and final offer’’.The US electricity producer, which has been trying since October to acquire its rival, said it had decided to raise its offer after identifying another $1.5bn in cost savings.These would result from combining the businesses and adding in the benefits of NRG’s recent purchase of a retail business from Reliant Energy.In total, Exelon said it could squeeze out $3.6bn- $4bn in operational synergies by melding the businesses together and transforming NRG.The Chicago-based company said it was confident it could refinance NRG’s $4.7bn of senior notes and other debt and still maintain investment grade credit ratings.NRG has repeatedly rejected Exelon’s earlier offer, which stood at 0.485 of an Exelon share for each NRG share.The new offer raises that exchange ratio to 0.545 of an Exelon share per NRG share.NRG urged shareholders to take no action while its board reviewed the revised offer.NRG has scheduled an annual shareholder meeting on July 21 and Exelon plans to agitate at that meeting for the election of proposed alternate nine independent directors to NRG’s board.Shares in NRG were 2.8 per cent lower at $25.31 in early New York trading, while Exelon was down 2.3 per cent at $50.36.A drop in Exelon’s share price since the offer was made – amid the economic crisis and concerns about the impact of impending carbon legislation on the power industry – had cut into the premium it was offering.In addition, it appeared support for the hostile takeover was declining; Exelon said in June that only about 12 per cent of NRG’s outstanding shares had been tendered under its offer, well below the 51 per cent it had received in February.“This is our best and final offer, and we will use the time leading up to the NRG annual meeting to communicate the value of our new offer to NRG shareholders,’’ said John Rowe, Exelon’s chairman and chief executive.NRG, whose management has resisted the Exelon bid as insufficient, said after the increased offer: “NRG’s board of directors will carefully review Exelon’s revised proposal with its advisers and determine the appropriate response promptly.’’In the event of a change of control at NRG, its debt must be refinanced.Exelon said it had continued to pursue NRG because of the long-term value that could be created by industry consolidation.“This is a done deal, and my money is on Exelon,’’ said Karl Miller, a senior industry adviser.“The NRG board and management are wasting shareholder money fighting a futile effort to entrench themselves.”"
42;NRG;NRG Energy;2009-03-06T22:31:46Z;NRG Energy desperate to stave off Exelon bid;;NRG Energy is becoming increasingly desperate in its efforts to stave off a hostile takeover by Exelon and become the largest US power producer.Its decision this week to acquire Reliant Energy’s Texas retail business, using $287.5m in cash, left analysts wondering why that deal would be better than one with the bigger, more creditworthy Exelon.The answer is that it is not, leading some analysts to conclude NRG’s executives and board are protecting their jobs at the expense of shareholders – a practice that will not be tolerated in this market, particularly in a sector that is ripe for consolidation.Mark Williams, finance and economics professor at Boston University, believes that, with Exelon, NRG shareholders would get a financially strong corporate parent, geographical diversity and stability of cash flow.“We are in a global storm,’’ Mr Williams said. “Yet the acquisition of Reliant is the equivalent of heading out in the storm with an undersized boat.“In a financial [hurricane] Katrina, I would rather be on an Exelon freighter than on an NRG fishing boat pulling the Reliant dingy.’’NRG insists it is being undervalued by Exelon’s offer to buy it for $6.2bn, with the all-stock offer based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG share, representing a value of $26.43 for each NRG common share (based on Exelon’s closing price of $54.50 on October 17).Yet NRG’s share price has continued to fall since then, to below $20, as the economic downturn, combined with insecurity about the cost of carbon emissions under an Obama administration, has worsened.There are more than 250 mid- and large-size utilities and distribution companies in the US, and many of these are carrying substantial debt loads, said Karl Miller, an industry consultant.They cannot refinance, he said, and cash flow from operations to fund debt payments is dropping.Many are being forced to sell strong power and gas assets, a practice he expects will increase through 2009 and 2010.NRG is not opposed to consolidation but wants a “reasonable’’ offer. And while Exelon’s battle for control of NRG has put other potential acquirers on notice that no groups want to accept their values have dropped so far so fast, analysts believe they will be forced to do so.“The industry has to consolidate,’’ Mr Williams says. “It will be market driven, instead of executive driven. These people are going to die on the vine or be swallowed up.’’Exelon already has won support from holders of 51 per cent of the outstanding shares of NRG common stock, leading it to extend its offer until June 26, while seeking regulatory approvals.Shareholders, it seems, are ready to move on, with or without the executives.
43;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-11-27T17:48:44Z;US contractors spur nuclear construction;;Nuclear contractors and vendors, hoping to jump-start construction of the first new US nuclear plants in 30 years, are offering financial support and pledging to assume a larger share of the completion risks.Public concern over the safety of nuclear power has effectively shut down new plant construction for decades. But the US government has been offering incentives to spur development. And now groups that supply equipment to the industry are also moving to offset some of the enormous costs of new construction.The US government has offered $18.5bn in loan guarantees to encourage the construction of 14 nuclear power plants. Last month, it said it had received 19 applications from 17 electric power companies for $122bn in loan guarantees.“The aggregate estimated construction cost of these 14 projects is $188bn,” Standard & Poor’s said in a recent report.The ratings agency considers construction as “the overriding risk” for new nuclear units in the US, noting labour and material cost increases are particularly high for nuclear plants given their specialised labour needs, material intensity and a tight supply chain for key components. These obstacles have been compounded by new technologies which have not yet been used in the US, as well as a new, untested, regulatory process for nuclear plants.While the global financial crisis is expected to ease the costs of construction labour and materials, there are new fears about whether an administration under president-elect Barrack Obama will support the loan guarantee programme given the growing federal commitments to bolster financial institutions and possibly the automobile sector.“While the ongoing financial crisis has many people worried about whether they will get government loans, there is also talk of major nuclear vendors providing some funding,” said Ken Metcalfe, a nuclear electric generation expert and president of the Kenrich Group, a business and litigation consulting firm.NRG Energy, which last year filed the first application to build a new nuclear plant in the US in decades, is combining with Toshiba of Japan, a builder of advanced boiling water reactors, by forming a joint venture to develop and build new nuclear projects in North America.Toshiba will be the main contractor on NRG’s new projects. It also will invest $300m in the joint venture, Nuclear Innovation North America, over the next six years in return for a 12 per cent equity stake.“We’re very positive on the support Toshiba is providing, technically and financially,” David Crane, NRG chief executive, told the Financial Times.The industry has been stunted in the decades following the nuclear accident at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant in 1979, which exposed the region to radiation. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which killed more than 30 people in Ukraine, added to concerns about reactors close to towns and cities. In the US, some projects were subsequently blocked even though they had already been approved.Yet the 103 nuclear power plants now operating in the US are so old they are being forced to get 20-year extensions on their 40-year operating licences. Even though they provide 20 per cent of the nation’s energy, no provisions have been made to continue that supply, much less increase it, once the plants are deemed too old to operate.That is why the Department of Energy has been encouraging a wary nuclear power industry to expand by providing financial incentives to apply for licences to build new plants.The federal loan guarantee programme is an important part of financing these projects, said Tom O’Neill, vice-president of new plant development for Exelon Nuclear. He said Exelon, a major US power provider, “is ready to be in a position to go forward if there is a realistic and favourable assessment of the critical risks”.In Louisiana, officials have invited members of a joint venture being formed by nuclear technology supplier Westinghouse and Shaw Group to build a facility to construct components.
44;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-11-12T03:14:59Z;Exelon goes hostile after NRG rebuffs $6bn bid;Deals looming for US power sector;Exelon launched a hostile takeover battle for rival NRG Energy on Tuesday, after NRG rejected its unsolicited $6.2bn offer to combine the companies into the largest US power producer.The power sector has recently turned into fertile ground for potential transactions.Dynegy, another US power company, also hired Goldman Sachs and Greenhill to advise on its strategic options, an insider said.In addition to the activity surrounding Exelon, NRG and Dynegy, Warren Buffett agreed a $4.7bn deal in September to buy Constellation Energy, a nuclear power producer, and Reliant Energy is now weighing options for its business.Share prices of electricity companies have halved since July but have steadied somewhat since since Exelon bid for NRG last month.A banker said: “These are very capital intensive businesses that have gone through a lot of trauma, and there’s some significant dislocation in terms of value.”Exelon, after being rebuffed by NRG on Sunday, said it would launch an exchange offer on Wednesday for all outstanding shares of NRG at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG share. That offer, which valued NRG’s shares at $26.43 each based on Exelon’s October 17 closing price of $54.50 is unchanged from its original offer of October 19.NRG Energy, which rejected the offer as “risky’’ and “opportunistic’’, said the deal undervalued its business and might not be completed because of the rough financing markets. Exelon refused to bid against itself and raise its price, opting instead to take the matter straight to shareholders.Another insider who expected Exelon’s move to start a protracted battle, said: “I think we’ve got two bulls locking horns.”Dynegy, for its part, may be looking to weigh its options ahead of the expiration in April of a standstill agreement with partner LS Power, which has a significant stake in Dynegy.At that time, LS will have the option to sell its stake or try to buy more, if not all, of Dynegy.Private equity groups such as Texas Pacific, KKR, Blackstone or First Reserve might normally look at Dynegy as a potential investment, possibly in partnership with LS, industry sources said.But the constrained credit markets could make a deal incredibly difficult.“Everyone is running a process, with timing that couldn’t be worse,” one banker said.Dynegy said the company did not comment on “market rumours or speculation.”
45;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-11-09T23:15:57Z;NRG rejects Exelon merger bid as ‘risky’;;NRG Energy, the US power producer, on Sunday rejected as “risky” and “opportunistic” an unsolicited $6.2bn merger bid by Exelon to ­create the US’s largest power producer.After three weeks of considering the October 19 bid, David Crane, president and chief executive of NRG, told the Financial Times the deal undervalued NRG and was at risk of being completed, given Exelon’s difficulties financing the deal.In a rejection letter, sent on Sunday, Mr Crane told John Rowe, the chairman and chief executive of Exelon: “Your obvious difficulties on both the debt financing and credit rating front since your public bid supports our conclusion that, even apart from your proposal’s substantial undervaluation of NRG, your proposal is so highly conditional that it has severe implementation risk for which NRG shareholders are in no way compensated.”Exelon’s all-stock offer was based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG share, representing a value of $26.43 for each NRG common share, based on Exelon’s closing price of $54.50 on October 17.Mr Crane said that was below NRG’s price before the crisis took hold, when Wall Street reflected “true value”.Indeed, Mr Crane said, Exelon’s offer would leave NRG shareholders with 17 per cent of the combined company, while contributing 30 per cent of that combined company’s recurring cash flow in 2008.Exelon’s bid came as the credit crisis hit the equity and debt markets – the power industry depends on these to fund massive projects. While that made NRG a cheap target for Exelon, it also complicates Exelon’s ability to complete the deal.Bankers said that NRG has about $8bn debt which, upon a change in control, must be refinanced. They said Exelon would like NRG to help it refinance: “Exelon doesn’t have the money to do this deal.”In addition, NRG fears its company will not be put to good use within Exelon, given, two days after the bid, Exelon’s corporate credit rating was downgraded and placed on credit watch with negative outlook. It is now one notch from being rated below investment grade. Such a rating would result in incremental costs and collateral posting on their hedges.Mr Crane told the FT Exelon has said it is committed to restoring its company to “solid investment grade”.Yet, Mr Crane said: “We want to be working for the shareholders, not the credit ratings agencies.”That means sticking with NRG’s growth plan instead of building its credit rating. NRG late last year filed the first application to build a new nuclear plant in the US in 29 years.Exelon said: “Our board will review the NRG response and we will determine our next steps.”
46;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-11-02T23:02:21Z;Energy industry is running out of steam;;"The credit crisis has cut off much-needed financing for the US power sector, which equity investors have abandoned en masse, setting the stage for a string of mergers or bankruptcy filings.In the past month, two potential mergers have been announced: Warren Buffett’s bid on Constellation Energy and Exelon offered to take over NRG Energy. Analysts say Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Calpine, AES and Mirant are likely to be next on the list, with investors betting against them in both credit and equity markets.This is similar to the situation these companies found themselves in after Enron, when the US’s biggest unregulated energy trader collapsed in 2001, taking with it confidence in the entire sector. NRG and Mirant eventually sought bankruptcy protection. The others shed valuable assets and restructured to remain afloat.“This feels like 2001-2002 all over again,’’ said Mark T Williams, professor of finance and economics at Boston University. “It’s an environment exactly like what followed Enron; investors have lost confidence and the equity and debt markets have priced this in.’’Bruce Williamson, chief executive of Dynegy, said his company has $2bn of liquidity, including $855m cash, and no significant debt maturities due until 2011. Therefore, he says, the credit crisis should not affect the company.“Everybody has been lumped in together,’’ Mr Williamson said. Yet Dynegy, he said, has a steady cash stream, as it costs it about $25 a megawat hour to produce power and while prices peaked at about $85 per mwh, they are now only down to about $65 per mwh, which still leaves a healthy profit.“It’s important for investors to not take all power companies and lump them together,’’ Mr Williamson said. Yet Boston University’s Mr Williams said the bottom line is Dynegy’s share price is down to $2.5 and is conveying a lack of confidence, indicating suppliers, creditors, trade partners and bankers are positioning themselves to reduce their direct exposure.“The stock, if it remains under the cost of a cup of Starbucks coffee, Dynegy will not stay independent long,’’ Mr Williams said.Karl Miller, founder of MMC Energy and senior industry advisor, believes there will be widespread consolidation among the more than 250 mid- and large-size utilities and distribution companies in the US over the next 12 to 18 months.“People are not going to stop using electricity,’’ said Bill Holloran, a senior vice president at Day & Zimmermann, the largest power operations and maintenance firm in the country.That is why Mr Miller believes large pools of money will flow into the sector in the coming years to invest in the US’ ageing distribution infrastructure and much-needed new capacity. He said private capital will fill the gap developing from companies lack of access to public equity and debt markets, and to meet new energy and infrastructure needs, enabling deals to go through.“This will be a tremendous boom time for the healthy private equity/hedge funds and other private infrastructure funds that have the executive talent, execution capabilities to invest into the sector, consolidate weak energy companies and profit from the overall energy supply/demand deficit across all energy commodity products,’’ Mr Miller says.The key, he says, will be establishing a bona fide physical presence in the sector, with companies focused on managing risk, not just establishing a speculative trading desk as a proxy, which has led to the demise of many hedge funds and financial institutions in energy commodities, in both the crisis of confidence in the sector in 2001-2002 and this time around."
47;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-10-20T20:47:40Z;Bernanke comments give lift to Wall St;;An easing of the strain in money markets coupled with the prospect of a fresh economic stimulus package helped Wall Street begin the week with a strong rally.The market was cheered by comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said he backed more government spending to help stave off a protracted slowdown.After a sharp afternoon rally, the S&P 500 closed up 4.8 per cent at 985.40 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.4 per cent at 1,770.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent to 9,265.43.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 24.3 per cent although, at 53.22, it continued to indicate heightened distress. Last week, the index shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.The energy sector led the rally, up 11.2 per cent overall. Halliburton jumped 13.9 per cent to $20.80 after the energy services group beat Wall Street’s expectations for third-quarter earnings.Weatherford International, which also posted better-than-expected results, gained 15.5 per cent to $16.96. National Oilwell Varco gained 22.2 per cent to $31.26.Oppenheimer upgraded several energy stocks, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, which rose 10.2 per cent to $74.99 and 11.6 per cent to $69.61 respectively. The sector also received a boost from oil prices, which rallied above $74 a barrel.At least 139 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.JPMorgan said that, as of last week, investors’ attention had “seemed to shift to the realisation that the economy is slowing…We are into the throes of earnings season. And on that front the news has not been so hearty.”The bank said that, so far, third-quarter earnings had fallen 35.4 per cent year-on-year, although they had increased 10.5 per cent excluding financials.Early on Monday, financials were the only sector not to find positive territory. They later rallied to stand 2.8 per cent higher, although underperformed the market.Peter Cardillo, market economist at Avalon Partners, said the equities market had a “brighter outlook” now that historic levels of stress in money markets had begun to ease following a series of vast interventions from authorities around the globe.Still, insurers Prudential and Metlife came under renewed pressure after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on the pair due to the possible need for writedowns. Prudential lost 1.5 per cent to $41.15 although Metlife, down earlier in the session, rallied to stand 6.1 per cent higher at $33.03.General Growth Properties was among the biggest drags on the S&P, down 8.7 per cent to $5.59, on reports that the real estate investment trust was trying to sell up to $2bn in preferred shares to lower its debt.Credit card stocks posted modest gains ahead of results from American Express, which added 4.4 per cent to $24.35, due after the market closed. Investors will be keen to hear whether or not the Dow component’s high-income customers have fallen behind with payments or curtailed spending.In the consumer sector, Mattel lost 2 per cent to $14.16 after the toymaker’s earnings fell short of analyst forecasts. Rival Hasbro dipped 4.2 per cent to $28.87 even though its figures topped expectations.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors were up 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.Technology, meanwhile, stood 3.3 per cent higher. Bucking that trend, Yahoo edged down 0.3 per cent to $12.86 after reports emerged that the internet search group may cut more jobs than already disclosed.Cisco added 5.9 per cent to $18.96 after Morgan Keegan raised its recommendation to “outperform”.Texas Instruments and SanDisk added 1.9 per cent to $17.98 and lost 7 per cent to $14.42 ahead of results due later in the day.Elsewhere, Eaton added 1.8 per cent to $45.22 after the manufacturer warned of a “significant slowdown” in demand.Among utilities NRG Energy rose 29.3 per cent to $25 after Exelon, the nuclear power operator, made an unsolicited $6.2bn offer to acquire the group. Exelon added 0.2 per cent to $54.59.
48;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-09-19T19:13:41Z;EDF set to launch bid for US group;;EDF of France is planning to go on the offensive to protect its foothold in the US with an offer for Constellation Energy, the electricity utility that agreed on Thursday to a $4.7bn (€3.2bn) takeover by billionaire investor Warren Buffett.The board of the French utility agreed in an emergency meeting on Friday to back a joint bid with a US partner, as required under US regulations.The bid comes as it puts the final touches to its €15bn offer for British Energy, the UK’s nuclear operator, which owns 50 per cent of AmerGen Energy in the US. British Energy’s US partner is Peco, part of Exelon Generation Company.People close to Constellation said on Friday night that they had not yet received an offer from EDF, but others familiar with the French group’s situation said one was to be made on Friday night. It was possible EDF had found a US partner interested in Constellation’s exploration assets, one person suggested.EDF last year set up a joint venture with Constellation that was to have been its launchpad into the potentially lucrative US nuclear market.The French group’s board met on Thursday to consider a $500m capital injection into the US utility, which has been struggling to stem a crisis of confidence over its cash resources. But it said the conditions had not yet been met for an offer and EDF’s plans were pipped by the bid from Mr Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy group.The French company is determined to secure its position in Constellation, where it has a 9.5 per cent stake. Constellation claims to be one of the biggest suppliers of electricity in the US and has a portfolio of power plants across the country, with a particular focus on nuclear energy.On Tuesday, Constellation scrambled to find a buyer or secure an emergency capital infusion, when it became apparent that its investors were losing confidence in the stability of its commodities trading operations and credit ratings.Mr Buffett, whose investments are seen as high-quality seals of approval, has espoused being “greedy when others are fearful”. He has a history of investing in the US power sector, after buying shares of NRG Energy and lending to Williams, Reliant and TXU at hefty interest rates.Constellation will issue $1bn of preferred equity to MidAmerican at an 8 per cent yield as part of the deal, which was expected to close within nine months.Both companies’ boards of directors have approved the transaction, but it is subject to further financial review and a definitive agreement has not yet been signed.The deal was announced as early as possible in order to calm Constellation’s investors, who had driven its share price down nearly 60 per cent this week.
49;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-09-18T22:12:09Z;Buffett moves too fast for EDF;;The speed with which Constellation Energy’s fate was sealed took most people by surprise, but none more so than Pierre Gadonneix, chief executive of Électricité de France.He was still hoping on Thursday to be able to win his board’s backing for a roughly $500m cash injection into the utility that he hopes will be his bridgehead into the US civil nuclear power market. It was a hard sell to directors already becoming impatient with the French group’s protracted efforts to acquire British Energy in the UK for an estimated £12.4bn ($22.5bn).But Mr Gadonneix’s team worked round the clock to prepare the case to a strongly divided board. In the end, the decision did not come quickly enough and Warren Buffett, the US investor, snapped up the utility that hopes to be one of the leading players in North America’s nuclear revival.Constellation, which claims to be the leading electricity supplier in the US, has a portfolio of power plants across the country, powered by diverse fuels, ranging from coal to biomass. But it has particular focus in nuclear power, which produced 61 per cent of the 8,700MW it generated last year.The group has five operating nuclear reactors at three power stations. It has applied for licensing on two new nuclear facilities, as objections to atomic energy in the US began to abate this past year. According to a recent Zogby Interactive survey 67 per cent of the population now favours the construction of new nuclear power plants.France’s powerful nuclear industry has been quick to spot the potential offered by this shift in opinion and policy in the US, where electricity demand is forecast to rise by 45 per cent by 2030 and capacity is running low.Both Areva, the French nuclear group, and EDF have chosen Constellation as their key partner to spearhead US expansion.EDF has even taken a 9.51 per cent stake in the US group and pledged to invest $625m in a 50:50 joint venture, called UniStar, which plans to build four of Areva’s latest generation of pressurised water reactors.So news of Constellation’s plight, which at one stage had some speculating it could be broken up, clearly shook up EDF management.Constellation has been one of the bright spots in EDF’s recent international expansion strategy, which has over the last year suffered some setbacks in Spain and Belgium. Though roughly 50 per cent of its €60bn turnover comes from abroad, the lion’s share of profit is still derived from domestic activities, where prospects for growth are limited.One analyst, who asked not to be named, said he would have preferred EDF to move quickly on Constellation – whose shares have tumbled sharply over the last year – rather than to push ahead with a deal for British Energy, which could be announced next week.The UK bid “will be expensive and the assets are not good quality,” he said.Nonetheless, EDF insiders were confident on Thursday that the group’s US ambitions would not be hindered by Constellation’s takeover.Mr Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which is acquiring the US group, has said it would continue to support the partnership with EDF. “We have a joint venture and an industrial agreement,” one EDF person said.The French group will also hold onto its 9.51 per cent stake, though it is currently sitting on a paper loss of roughly €500m.“There is no reason to sell,” another EDF insider said. “The only thing to do now is wait and see.”
50;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-08-15T18:11:06Z;Buffett snaps up NRG stake;;Warren Buffett has bought a stake in NRG Energy, the US power producer, and has sold most of his shares in brewer Anheuser-Busch.Mr Buffett’s timely investments have helped the billionaire amass one of the world’s largest fortunes and win the devotion of legions of disciples eager to mimic the Sage of Omaha’s stock picks. NRG’s shares had jumped more than 4 per cent by midday Friday in New York, while Anheuser-Busch was little changed.Mr Buffett, who reported the latest quarterly changes to his portfolio of US stocks in a regulatory filing late on Thursday, also made an undisclosed transaction involving his shares of ConocoPhillips.US securities regulators permit Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Mr Buffett, to omit certain transactions from the quarterly list and report them in a separate, confidential filing.Berkshire has disclosed that it owned 17.5m shares of ConocoPhillips. In Thursday’s filing with the ÛS Securities & Exchange Commission, the stake disappeared from its list of investments. The stock slipped more than 2 per cent.Mr Buffett also added to his positions in Ingersoll-Rand, a maker of refrigeration gear, and Sanofi Aventis, the French drugmaker. Meanwhile, Ingersoll had acquired Trane, another Berkshire holding as of March. Berkshire owned 3.2m shares of NRG on June 30. The conglomerate reduced its stake in Anheuser to about 13.8m shares during the period from 35.6m in March, according to the SEC filing.Anheuser’s shares had surged more than 29 per cent during those three months as Belgium’s InBev made an unsolicited bid for its US rival. The company agreed to the sale at $70 a share in July. The stock now trades at about $68.Berkshire has said that its quarterly profit fell 7.6 per cent to $2.88bn, or $1,859 per class A share, amid a slump in its insurance-underwriting division. Gains from investments and derivatives totalled $610m during the period.Unrealised gains on investments, or the value those securities that Berkshire has not sold, dropped by $10.7bn during the first six months of the year.
51;NRG;NRG Energy;2008-05-22T20:53:46Z;Fall in jobless claims lifts Wall St;;Wall Street stocks rallied modestly in light trading on Thursday after an unexpected fall in the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits cheered investors, but a retreat in some commodities prices hit related stocks and whittled gains.According to the Labor Department, initial jobless claims fell by 9,000 to 365,000 last week, suggesting that while labour markets remain sickly they are not deteriorating. Economists had expected claims to rise moderately. Still, the trend seems clear as the four-week average for claims rose marginally to 372,250.Early momentum helped investors shrug off the latest numbers on house prices from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. House prices fell 3.1 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, faster than analysts predicted. The numbers will reinforce fears that, amid tightening lending standards at US banks and rising foreclosures, the already prolonged housing slump has further to run.After a day of range-bound trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,394.35 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 12,625.62 points. The Nasdaq Composite rebounded 0.7 per cent to 2,464.58.So far this week, equities have been rattled by worrying reports on inflation and squeezed by the relentless rise in oil prices, which threaten to curb consumer spending, hit corporate profits and slow already weak economic growth.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve spooked investors, indicating that it was finished with rate cuts for the moment even as it slashed its economic growth forecasts and raised its projections for inflation and unemployment.Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said: “The market is still looking for some direction. We have had two days of heavy selling, we are heading into a long holiday weekend and I think people are taking a breather and reassessing the situation.”At the open, the broader stock market looked vulnerable to yet another spike in energy prices as oil briefly pushed through $135, driven by a fall in US stocks of crude. But by the close the picture had reversed, as commodities fell back, knocking related stocks but allowing the other industry groups to pull away. The energy sector fell 1.1 per cent while materials lost 0.3.Consumer discretionary stocks wobbled between gains and losses as Ford said it would take longer than forecast to break even due to higher costs and slower sales. Ford fell 8.2 per cent to $7.16 and General Motors slipped 3.6 per cent to $18.43.Limited Brands helped cushion losses, however, after the operator of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain posted estimate-beating earnings. Limited Brands rose 3 per cent to $18.85 while the broader sector added 0.2 per cent.Wendy’s also made ground after William Ackman, the hedge fund manager who is the largest shareholder in the hamburger chain, said the company could increase its value dramatically by selling stores and real estate. Wendy’s shares rose 6 per cent to $29.73.Financials were unlikely winners, but joined a suite of heavily sold sectors that bounced back. They rose 0.9 per cent, led higher by Citigroup and JP Morgan which added 3.1 per cent to $21.72 and 1.5 per cent to $43.05 respectively.The sector advanced despite the fact that a leading banking analyst slashed his 2008 earnings for a number of the big brokerages. Richard Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann suggested selling shares in Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, knocking shares in all three.Consumer staples were the main gainers, adding 1.1 per cent – their biggest rise since the start of April – on analyst upgrades and improved sentiment as investors moved into counter-cyclicals.CVS Caremark, the pharmacy chain, added 1.5 per cent to $42.59 while PepsiCo and Coca-Cola rose 1.7 per cent to $68.38 and 2.9 per cent to $57.27.Deal news was another bright spot. NRG Energy, the second-biggest power producer in Texas, made an unsolicited offer to buy Calpine, the largest producer of electricity from gas-fired plants in the US, for $9.6bn in stock. Calpine rose 8.1 per cent to $23 while NRG slipped 5.1 per cent to $40.35.

They also said Vodafone had been lifted by talk that next week’s annual results could top expectations.JPMorgan was heard telling clients to expect upgrades post the figures, citing a number of positive trends. These included sensible pricing from formerly disruptive rivals.The market was pulled lower by weakness in the oil sector as investors moved to lock in gains.The FTSE 100 ended 16.5 points, or 0.3 per cent, lower at 6,181.6 points with BG, down 3.4 per cent to £13.47, and Royal Dutch Shell, off 1.9 per cent at £21.69, among the biggest fallers. The FTSE 250 moved up 21.1 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 10,186.9 points.International Power was one of several speculative features. Its shares gained 2.6 per cent to 449¼p as rumours of a 550p a share bid approach from a European rival – possibly Suez – did the rounds.Sector watchers said they believed the advance owed more to events in the US, where NRG Energy launched an unsolicited $11bn offer for rival Calpine.Takeover talk also supported confectionary company Cadbury, up 2.4 per cent to 698p. The rumour in the market was that Kraft and Hershey were plotting a break-up bid.J Sainsbury ticked up 1.4 per cent to 344¾p after a block of 33m shares, about 1.9 per cent of the grocer, changed hands.Traders were quick to dismiss rumours of stakebuilding by the Qatar Investment Authority or Robert Tchenguiz. They believe the trade was the “other side” of a derivative transaction executed by Lehman Brothers.Xstrata added 2.1 per cent to £42.24 after Mick Davis, chief executive, declared the purchase of almost £7m of stock. The purchase came just days after Morgan Stanley predicted that the mining sector would suffer a 10-20 per cent correction in the short term.Rio Tinto firmed 0.4 per cent to £66.69 after Bernstein Research set an increased target price of £80. The broker advised clients to keep buying the big diversified mining groups such as Rio and BHP Billiton, up 2.1 per cent to £21.10.“Significant contract price rises in iron ore (70 per cent), thermal coal (100 per cent) and coking coal (a remarkable 200 per cent) put a floor under the earnings of bulk miners,” it said.Royal Bank of Scotland added 1.4 per cent to 244¾p after Dresdner Kleinwort said most of the technical selling associated with its £12bn cash call had been completed. It said a short covering rally was possible.Carphone Warehouse slipped 1.2 per cent to 235½p, but traders said it could rally today as a large overhang had been cleared.Imperial Tobacco shed 4.2 per cent to £20.95. Traders said some investors were selling stock to take up their rights – a transaction known as tail-swallowing – while others were selling their rights because they could not afford to pay for them.Imperial is raising £4.9bn via a one-for-two offering priced at £14.75.Among the mid-caps, housebuilder Taylor Wimpey fell 3.6 per cent to 101p as ABN Amro attempted to place 5m shares for a client. That seemed to unsettle the sector. Barratt Developments slipped 2.9 per cent to 224p.Bodycote gained 6.3 per cent to 244½p on rumours of predatory interest from Sulzer, of Switzerland.

Drax slipped 2.4 per cent to 707p.Condom maker SSL International eased 0.2 per cent to 481¾p even though the Reckitt Benckiser (down 0.5 per cent to £29.06) bid story was given a fresh airing.
53;NRG;NRG Energy;2007-11-18T22:04:29Z;US utilities sceptical over nuclear plants;;After three decades without any applications for a licence to build a nuclear reactor in the US, almost 20 companies are considering applying to build over 30 new plants. In September, NRG Energy of Texas became the first to make an application in 29 years.With US electricity demand set to rise sharply, government incentives for early movers and some environmental campaigners seeing high-emitting coal-fired power generation as a greater evil, conditions seem propitious for a renaissance of nuclear power.“Nuclear power is an essential component of any comprehensive national energy plan,” says Mary Landrieu, a senator representing Louisiana. “It has been 20 years since we have built a nuclear power plant, and it is long past time that we build a new one.”That view is shared by the administration of President George W. Bush. Yet, for all the political enthusiasm, many in the industry believe the nuclear revival will be limited and slow.Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and chief executive of General Electric, one of the world’s biggest nuclear engineering companies, believes at most a third of those planned nuclear power plants will go ahead.Nuclear is important in the US energy mix. There are 103 nuclear power plants, which supply about 20 per cent of the country’s electricity. Yet many of them are so old that they are operating on 20-year extensions on their 40-year operating licences. At the same time as these plants are going out of service, US electricity demand is rising. It could grow by 45 per cent by 2030, according to projections from the US Energy Information Administration.That widening gap should create a powerful case for building reactors. However, it has been hard convincing utilities to take the risk.“If you were a utility CEO and looked at your world today, you would just do gas and wind,” Mr Immelt says. “You would say [they are] easier to site, digestible today [and] I don’t have to bet my company on any of this stuff. You would never do nuclear. The economics are overwhelming.”The US government has tried to win over nervous utilities by combining what were two separate licensing processes for building and operating nuclear plants.NRG Energy is seeking a single licence to build and operate, which may take four years. Under the old system, the process could take 11 years. It was possible for a power company to get a licence to build a plant but then fail to obtain approval to operate it, after pouring billions of dollars into construction. Many in the industry recall a $5.3bn New York plant that, once completed in 1984, could not overcome public resistance and be brought on stream.However, while the new system is supposed to be an improvement, its effects are uncertain. Richard Goffi, a principal at Booz Allen Hamilton, who leads the firm’s public sector energy business, says that because the process has not been tested there is no proof it will work as smoothly as planned. “No one knows how this is going to play out,” he says.The US government has offered incentives to the first companies to build reactors under the Energy Policy Act, including tax incentives, federal loan guarantees and insurance should their projects get shut down.David Crane, chief executive of NRG Energy, says the government “put together precisely the amount of incentives,” to make his planned investment viable.But Mr Immelt believes it will take a much clearer set of incentives, preferably based on an international emissions trading scheme, to give nuclear power the impetus it needs to grow rapidly.GE is a member of the US Climate Action Partnership, a lobby group of businesses and environmental campaigners that advocates emissions trading to tackle the global warming threat.“If ever there is a cap and trade system, then nuclear power is going to get accelerated, because it’s very much favoured in a reducing-carbon world,” he says.Such a system is fiercely controversial in American politics, although Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, has proposed a domestic cap and trade scheme.Mr Immelt argues it is time to start taking action. “We can spend three years fighting it, duking it out, to reach an inevitable conclusion in the fifth year, or we can spend these five years actually about the job of setting up a market and driving change,” he says.
54;NRG;NRG Energy;2007-11-09T04:36:05Z;New nuclear: Reactor opposition softens;;"More than 20 years after the Chernobyl disaster, the question of whether to allow the construction of nuclear reactors remains one of the most controversial in the global energy industry.A growing desire to tackle the twin problems of climate change and energy security, however, means that the prospect of new nuclear power plants is much more acceptable to the public than it has been for some time.Nuclear power’s two main selling points are that reactors do not produce carbon dioxide, unlike fossil fuel-burning power plants, and that fuel costs are relatively low.The main disadvantage is the production of radioactive waste, something for which few countries have found a permanent solution. The nuclear industry also has a poor record of building reactors on time and on budget, making atomic energy a historically costly form of power generation.While the issues of cost, safety and waste still make many people uneasy, worries about how to cut carbon emissions and how to reduce reliance on foreign gas imports has led to a softening of opposition to nuclear power.Against this backdrop, reactors are already being built in Finland and France, while the US, China, India, Japan, Russia, Bulgaria and Romania all have new nuclear projects at various stages of development.In western Europe, Finland’s 1600MW Olkiluoto 3 reactor is due to start generating power in 2011, following a series of delays, while the Flamanville 3 reactor in northern France is scheduled to start operating in 2012.Both projects are based on the latest pressurised water reactor model from Areva of France, dubbed the Evolutionary Power Reactor.Most countries in central and eastern Europe have taken a strongly pro-nuclear stance, in part reflecting concerns about becoming too reliant on gas exports from their powerful neighbour, Russia.Last month saw the opening of the 700MW Cernavoda 2 nuclear power plant in Romania, which uses Candu 6 pressurised heavy water reactor technology from Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL).Nuclearelectrica, Romania’s state-owned atomic energy group, has said it wants the construction of two further reactors on the site, Cernavoda 3 and 4, and that they could be finished by 2014 and 2015.Meanwhile, Bulgaria plans to build 2,000MW of nuclear generating capacity at its Belene site by 2014 to replace four Chernobyl-era units that were shut down as a condition of the country’s entry to the European Union last year.China and the US are likely to be the two biggest centres of nuclear new-build in the coming years.The Chinese government has plans to build up to 30 reactors by 2020, although this would represent only a relatively small portion of the country’s fast-growing electricity generation capacity.Westinghouse, the US-based reactor manufacturer now owned by Toshiba of Japan, is working on the construction of four reactors in China, two each in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, which are due to open in 2013 after a three-year construction period.In the US, nuclear development has, in effect, been on hold since the 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the country’s worst nuclear accident.But this year has seen the first real signs of a nuclear revival in the US and energy companies are now looking at building 20 to 30 reactors across the country.In September, NRG Energy filed the first application to build a nuclear plant in the US for almost 30 years.The New Jersey-based company has applied to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to build two reactors totalling 2,700MW of generating capacity in Texas. NRG Energy plans to bring the reactors on line in 2014 and 2015 to meet the rising energy demands of the south-western US.The companies involved in this burst of activity have pledged to investors that they have learnt the lessons of the past, and will be able to avoid the delays and vast cost over-runs that have blighted the civil nuclear industry throughout its existence.But the fact that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3 project is already running 18 months behind schedule and is costing €700m ($1.02bn) more than the original €3bn budget shows this is easier said than done. As the first of its kind, Olkiluoto 3 is bound to have teething problems, but the delays have drawn attention to the complexity of nuclear projects and the length of the waiting lists for the specialised components involved.Andy White, chief executive of GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, the nuclear joint venture between the US and Japanese companies, says the answer is to have more standardisation and sharing of information and expertise in the global nuclear industry.If there were more identical plants, it would be easier to get spare parts and could speed up the regulatory approval process.“You would not have to design and licence a unique reactor in each country. There are benefits to everyone; costs and timescales come down and there are economies of scale.”"
55;NRG;NRG Energy;2007-11-09T04:36:05Z;US renaissance: A sea change in attitudes;;When Gwyneth Cravens set out to write about nuclear energy, it was going to be an article, not a book. She was against nuclear, first of all, and did not think anyone would want to read a full book about the energy source. That was 1999.This year, she published Power To Save The World: The Truth About Nuclear Energy. In the intervening eight years, not only had Ms Cravens changed her mind about nuclear, but the US had too. “It has been amazing how quick the turnaround has been.”The last time anyone in the US besides the utilities thought much about nuclear energy, it was in the context of the country’s worst commercial nuclear accident, at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant in 1979, which exposed those nearby to radiation. Beyond that, there was the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which immediately killed more than 30 people in Ukraine. Nobody has even sought to build a plant in the US for 29 years.But in September, NRG Energy filed an application for a licence to do just that. The government expects between 20 and 30 other companies to follow suit as nuclear energy becomes the environmentally-correct choice because of its low carbon footprint in a world increasingly focused on global warming.“While viewed unfavourably by many for years, nuclear power is now seen as attractive, since carbon is widely perceived as a greater evil,’’ says Richard Goffi, a Principal at Booz Allen Hamilton, who leads the company’s public sector energy business. “Opponents argue that nuclear plants pose an unreasonable safety risk without balanced consideration for the hazards in all energy supplies. For example, how many people have been killed in coal mines this year?”Nuclear, by comparison, is looking downright safe. There are 103 nuclear power plants in the US – supplying roughly 20 per cent of the country’s electricity – and yet the public rarely hears a peep out of them. Many of the plants are so old they are receiving 20-year extensions on their 40-year operating licences.There are 17 companies considering applying for licences to build power plants, but the problem will be getting labour and parts to follow through. Only one vendor makes the super-heavy forgings required of nuclear power plants, for example, and it has a lead time of several years, Mr Goffi says. More than 20 years ago, nearly 1,000 facilities in the US built nuclear-grade components, he says. Now there are fewer than 100.On top of that, the skilled labour needed to build the plants has been lost for decades. The natural field to look for staff would be oil and gas, but that sector is already short of skills and expecting the situation to worsen in coming years as experienced staff retires.Because of these shortages, George Bilicic, who heads the global power and utilities group of Lazard, says construction and labour costs are hyper-inflated, which makes it difficult to provide an estimate on how much it would cost to build a nuclear plant today. “We wouldn’t be comfortable quoting an estimate to a client,” he says. “They’re all over the place.”Yet, the interest in building them is there. And banks would be willing to lend money to such an endeavor. “We think pools of capital will be attracted around it,” says Mr Bilicic.“The potential for nuclear is fairly significant,’’ agrees Tony Ward, director of transaction advisory services in the energy, chemicals and utilities group at Ernst & Young. He notes that the US Department of Energy projects US electricity demand growth of 45 per cent between 2003 and 2025, in consumption terms.And there is a real push in the US to improve fuel independence by getting away from oil and gas, he says, noting that the US government passed legislation in 2005, providing tax incentives, federal loan guarantees and insurance to the first builders of nuclear power plants.“I would expect to see quite a flurry of submissions,” says Mr Ward.Yet, he believes the companies that do finally apply for licences to build the US’ first nuclear power plants in 30 years are going to find themselves competing with the global nuclear market for parts and labour. There are 30 nuclear reactors under construction globally, Mr Ward says, and another 80 at advanced stages of planning.While the US nuclear industry has been at a standstill, the rest of the world has moved on.
56;NRG;NRG Energy;2007-09-25T21:09:33Z;NRG’s new nukes;;America’s desire for low-carbon electricity meant someone was bound to push the button on new nuclear plants. That NRG Energy, which on Tuesday filed the first application for a nuclear construction license that America has seen in 29 years, was the first to do so might seem odd.NRG is, after all, an unregulated generator rather than a traditional utility which would benefit from regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms. Then there is NRG’s size. Assuming it takes a 40 to 50 per cent interest, alongside partners, in the two new Texan plants, the implied capital expenditure bill is equivalent to between a quarter and a third of NRG’s $10bn market capitalisation.Don’t run for the shelter yet, though. There are specific factors working in NRG’s favour. As a first-mover, it reaps the full benefit of recently enacted federal incentives. Location helps tremendously. After pressure from the green lobby forced local utility TXU to scrap plans for coal-fired stations, Texas needs new low-carbon electricity. Expensive, volatile gas sets the power price in Texas, making nuclear power’s economics more attractive. And NRG is building on an existing nuclear site, which should reduce costs and the risk of local protests.NRG wants to use Advanced Boiling Water Reactors. This is a pre-approved technology popular in Japan. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) is lending its help to NRG. In January, Japan extended trade insurance to domestic companies investing in US nuclear power. If Tepco can be persuaded to take a stake in NRG’s project, that could provide further insurance against any glitches.Above all, NRG may never need to pour a drop of concrete itself. Regulatory approval should come through by 2011. By then, America’s lack of adequate generation capacity should be glaringly obvious and reflected in high forward electricity prices. A pre-approved site in one of the country’s hottest power markets should make a tempting prospect for latecomers.

58;NRG;NRG Energy;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Mirant considering sell-off;;Mirant, which operates power plants in some of the largest US cities, is considering a sale that could value the Atlanta-based company in excess of $13bn.The move represents the latest twist in a tumultuous period for Mirant, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2005 and made a failed attempt to acquire NRG, a rival, last year, attracting intense shareholder scrutiny.As it begins to market itself to potential buyers with the help of bankers at JPMorgan, Mirant could attract interest from strategic buyers as well as private equity groups and banks that have been aggressively pursuing deals in the power sector recently.The largest pending leveraged buy-out is a $45bn takeover bid by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group for TXU, the Texas-based energy group.Mirant, whose shares rose 7 per cent in afternoon trading on Monday, has a market capitalisation of $10.1bn and about $3.1bn of long-term debt.The announcement comes as the company completes the disposal of its Philippines business, six US natural gas-fired plants and its Caribbean business.Mirant said: “In light of the status of the disposition programme, the board will consider in the exploration process whether the interest of stockholders would be best served by returning excess cash from the sale of proceeds to stockholders, with the company continuing to operate its retained businesses or, alternatively, whether greater stockholder value would be achieved by entering into a transaction with another company, including a sale of the company in its entirety.’’The disposal programme, announced in July and August 2006, followed a failed attempt to take over NRG for almost $8bn.Investors thwarted that takeover move by threatening to take action against the power producer’s board if it proceeded.NRG, too, had resisted the takeover, charging Mirant with undervaluing it in the $7.9bn offer.Investors felt Mirant would be taking on more than it could handle, given that the takeover plan was announced just months after Mirant had emerged from bankruptcy.Both Mirant and NRG were forced into bankruptcy by the crisis of confidence in the energy sector following the collapse of Enron and analysts felt neither company was in position to be buying another.
59;NRG;NRG Energy;2007-02-24T00:08:02Z;Private equity duo poised for TXU deal;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group were on Friday night in advanced talks to acquire TXU, one of America’s largest power companies, in a massive leveraged buy-out that could exceed $40bn including debt.People involved in the negotiations on Friday night described a “dream scenario” in which an agreement could be reached as early as Sunday or Monday morning. But they cautioned that a number of issues still needed to be resolved, which could delay an announcement.A takeover of TXU by KKR and TPG would represent another milestone in a global dealmaking spree by private equity groups that have taken advantage of cheap debt to finance such deals.This month, Blackstone closed a $38.9bn deal to buy Equity Office Properties, the US commercial property group, in what ranks as the largest leveraged buy-out on record. The EOP takeover has been described by many as a sign of the growing audacity and power of private equity, with some lamenting it as evidence of an unhealthy boom.In Europe, a fierce debate has erupted between the private equity industry and its critics, including trade union leaders and certain politicians, who contend that buy-outs do more harm than good to their economies.The exact price of the offer for TXU could not be determined on Friday night. At the close of trading on Friday, TXU had a market capitalisation of $27.6bn, after its shares rose 4.1 per cent to $60.02. The company also has long-term debt of about $11bn. Assuming that the buyers would pay a premium to the company’s current value to clinch a deal, the total value of a transaction would exceed $40bn.TXU is one of the US energy industry’s oldest and most powerful companies. Since 2004, it has been led by John Wilder, the chief executive. His role in the buy-out talks with KKR and TPG was unclear on Friday night.In bidding for TXU, KKR and TPG will hope to replicate the success of their 2004 investment in Texas Genco, another Texas-based utility, which they sold only about a year later for $8.3bn including debt to NRG Energy, earning a six-fold return on the investment. Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman also participated in that deal. KKR’s interest in buying TXU was first reported by CNBC.TXU has in recent months been embroiled in a battle with environmentalists over whether to build a string of coal-burning plants. The company says they are necessary to ensure adequate power for the future but environmentalists say they are a quick fix that will damage the environment.
60;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-06-29T20:53:41Z;Record deal cycle may be at peak;;On Monday, Phelps Dodge, a US mining company known for its conservative stance towards acquisitions, broke with that tradition.In an attempt to add a leading position in nickel mining to its vast copper business, the company launched an elaborate $40bn two-step bid to take over Inco and Falconbridge, two Canadian rivals that had already agreed to merge but have since been courted by Teck Cominco and Xstrata, other players in the rapidly consolidating mining industry.The bold move by Phelps Dodge, and the five-way battle for dominance in the North American mining industry, are the best illustration of a key feature in the current boom in global mergers and acquisitions activity.Not only are companies seeking friendly takeovers at a pace not seen since the dotcom boom, but they are also increasingly prepared to break up existing deals and mount competing bids for assets they view as in play.According to data from Dealogic, the aggregate value of the 70 competing bids announced globally in the first half of this year was $315bn, the highest level ever for a six-month period, exceeding the $291bn posted in the first half of 1999.Besides the battle over Inco and Falconbridge, Bayer and Merck, two German drugs groups, have tussled over Schering. In a twist on the theme in the media industry, EMI and Warner Music have been trading competing offers for each other – raising questions about whether industrial logic or executive egos are driving the negotiations.In steel, Luxembourg-based Arcelor on Sunday agreed to be bought by rival Mittal Steel, after a bitter takeover battle that included a late rival offer from Russia’s Severstal.Many Wall Street mergers and acquisitions specialists attribute the rise in competing bids – as well as hostile takeover offers such as Mirant’s $8bn offer for NRG, a rival US energy group, which was later withdrawn – to two factors consistent with a dealmaking cycle that may be approaching its peak.First, growth-hungry chief executives have shed much of the prudence that carried them through the period following the collapse of Enron and WorldCom. Jimmy Elliott, co-head of global M&A at JPMorgan Chase, says: “In many industry sectors there are fewer and fewer independent crown jewels that are available so once the shooting starts CEOs feel compelled to enter the fray.”Pricing discipline remains but there is no stigma in pursuing targets that could be strategic, even if this cannot be done on a friendly basis.The second driver in the proliferation of competing bids is hedge funds.These are often vital allies to second or third-party offers because they jump into an acquisition target, change its shareholder composition, and put pressure on the board to consider alternative proposals that may lead to a higher price.
61;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-06-12T22:03:50Z;Mirant withdraws $8bn bid for rival NRG;;Mirant on Monday withdrew its near $8bn bid for rival NRG after investors threatened to take action against the power producer’s board while Jana Partners made a $1.8bn offer for Houston Exploration.Pirate Capital, one of four hedge funds that objected to Mirant’s hostile takeover of NRG, said it would move for control of Mirant’s board unless Mirant withdrew its bid by Wednesday and put itself up for sale.Jana, which also objected to Mirant’s hostile takeover, focused its energies on Houston Exploration, another of its investments that it said would “continue to be destroyed” by management. The fund offered to buy the company for $62 a share.The management challenges pointed to the increasing power that hedge funds have in the energy sector, where they are becoming primary lenders.“The large hedge funds are becoming almost full-service financial institutions,” said Karl Miller, chairman and chief executive of MMC Energy. “They are going to flex their muscles if the investments they have made are not being optimised.”Pirate’s efforts were followed by an announcement by Mirant that it was withdrawing from the attempt to build one of the US’s largest US power producers.NRG had resisted the takeover, charging Mirant with undervaluing it in the $7.9bn offer.“A long and contested pursuit is not in the best interests of Mirant and its shareholders and, as a result, we are withdrawing our proposal to acquire NRG,” said Edward Muller, Mirant’s chairman and chief executive. “We will continue our efforts to create value for Mirant’s shareholders.”Omega Advisors and Paulson funds had also announced their objections to Mirant’s bid for NRG just months after Mirant had emerged from bankruptcy. NRG, too, had gone through bankruptcy after the crisis of confidence in the energy sector following Enron’s collapse, and analysts said neither was in a strong enough position to buy the other.Mirant filed a lawsuit against NRG the day it announced the offer in an attempt to stop NRG from blocking the deal by claiming Mirant used confidential information in making its bid. NRG filed a motion to dismiss that case.In the case of Jana and Houston Exploration, Jana’s declaration that it saw “tremendous value” in the company helped push up Houston Exploration’s shares, which closed up $3.32 at $57.97.Barry Rosenstein, Jana’s managing partner, said the hedge fund could no longer stand by while Houston Exploration went “blindly ahead with demonstrably wasteful acquisitions. We believe action must be taken now to protect the value of our investment.”
62;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-06-12T20:32:23Z;Lex: Mirant;;Hostile bids take a lot of nerve. But that is not all they require. Mirant’s withdrawal of its $8bn tilt at power producer NRG Energy underscores this in spades. If a management is going to go into battle, it had better have the following lined up: supportive shareholders, a strong acquisition currency and a vulnerable target. But some of Mirant’s own shareholders balked – an understatement in the case of Pirate Capital, which described the proposed deal as a “blatant destruction of stockholder value” and threatened a proxy fight if Mirant did not climb down.As for the stock, it is up over 10 per cent since December, but one can understand NRG investor queasiness in taking Mirant paper, given how recently Mirant emerged from bankruptcy. A longer track record would have been nice, and a far bigger cash component to the offer might have eased some nerves. Lastly, NRG was hardly limping along as the obvious target for an opportunistic bid. Its share price was already up 120 per cent over the past couple of years.Could the deal have been structured in a way to appeal to Mirant’s outspoken investors? In theory, the prospect of consolidation appeals, as it reduces risks for pure generators like Mirant and NRG and also produces savings – some $150m a year estimated by Bank of America research for this particular deal. And Mirant could have feasibly increased the cash component without leaving itself dangerously overgeared. But it would still have had to use some of its own equity.For Pirate, that looks like the wrong way round. The investor is calling for Mirant to put itself up for sale instead. Mirant had better handle this challenge better than its previous one.
63;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-06-02T21:24:41Z;Wall Street mixed as data vie with rising crude;;Wall Street lacked a clear direction this week as investors weighed strengthening oil prices against the potentially soothing implications of benign economic data.Telecommunications and energy services companies were in the news, with Ciena, Qwest and NRG Energy all posting strong gains.Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards and Sons, said market activity was sluggish.“I call it a turtle market,” said Mr Goldman. “A turtle plods along and carries a wall of worry on its back. I think the market is going to plod along and not be a bull or a bear.“There’s enough muck on the ground that the turtle is not going to make much progress.”Economic data this week helped ease fears of inflationary pressures in the US economy. On Friday, non-farm payroll figures showed job growth was significantly weaker than expected, while other figures showed a slowing in manufacturing and construction activity.Markets took the data in their stride, and were unfazed by the release of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s May meeting, which said inflation expectations had risen.Oil pushed higher, with crude for July delivery finishing the week at $72.33 – a three week high – as Tehran brushed off a conditional offer of talks from the US.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 2.51 points, for the day at 1,288.22, a weekly gain of 0.6 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite was flat, shedding 0.45 points, to 2,219.41, a gain of 0.4 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent, or 12.41 points, at 11,247.87, a loss of 0.3 per cent for the week.Communications stocks were the week’s strongest performers, in spite of a precipitous fall for ADC Telecommunications, which sank 23.5 per cent to $17.63 after it announced it would buy Andrew Corp for $2bn.Ciena was in the vanguard of the telecoms rally. The producer of telecoms software posted a far smaller quarterly loss than had been expected, and gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the third quarter. The shares gained 16.8 per cent to $4.65, a seven week high.Qwest followed suit, jumping 7.5 per cent to $7.45, its highest level since April 2002, while a broker upgrade for AT&T sent shares 1.9 per cent higher to $26.73.The traditionally defensive utility sector saw heavy trading as deals news buoyed stocks, sending the S&P Utilities Index up 2.6 per cent on the week. NRG Energy leapt 16.9 per cent to $51.07 after Mirant announced it had made an $8bn cash-and-shares bid for the company. Other power companies rose on the news, with Dynegy up 8.1 per cent to $5.34 and Reliant gaining 4.9 per cent to $12.01.Public Service Enterprise jumped 5.2 per cent to $67.03 after regulators approved the transfer of its licences to Exelon ahead of their upcoming merger.“Defensive growth areas are attracting more attention, as they should do,” said Mr Goldman at AG Edwards.Energy distribution companies were also pulled higher by acquisitions in the sector. Kinder Morgan added 19.8 per cent to $101.10 following news that senior management and private equity groups were launching a buy-out that would take the utility back into private hands. The news pulled Williams up 9 per cent to $23.26 and El Paso added 2.2 per cent to $15.48.NYSE Group rose 6.6 per cent to $65.43 after it signed an agreement to merge with Euronext in a $10.2bn deal.Healthcare stocks staged a rally, with UnitedHealth gaining 9 per cent to $46.98, its best week since November 2004. Cigna added 5.1 per cent to $97.44. Aetna added 5.6 per cent to $40.57.Technology stocks made more tentative gains. Cisco added 0.6 per cent to $20.44, while Sun Microsystems gained 0.9 per cent to $4.46. Cisco has risen 19.4 per cent for the year, outpacing the S&P 500’s Technology Hardware Equipment and Services Index, which has gained 3.3 per cent.Small caps had a particularly strong week, continuing their successful run this year.The Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies added 0.9 per cent to 735.97, putting it 9.3 per cent up for the year compared with a 3.2 per cent rise for the S&P 500, a 4.9 per cent gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 0.6 per cent advance for the Nasdaq Composite.
64;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-06-02T16:45:41Z;On Wall Street: Goldman to roll on after Paulson exit;;"In my former life as an investment banker, everybody was always hoping to catch Goldman Sachs in some kind of error. Pretty much any kind. Yet precious little ever seemed to stick.Little has changed. This week, for example, the famously tight-lipped firm had to publicly fend off accusations that it had improperly used private information collected when it previously worked for NRG Energy in advising Mirant, another electricity generator, on a hostile bid for NRG. Goldman also stepped down from its advisory role to avoid any distraction.Not for the first time, Goldman seemed to be in too many places at once. When the New York Stock Exchange bid for Archipelago last year, Goldman advised both companies, owned a chunk of each, and an alumnus was in place as chief executive of the NYSE.That kerfuffle fizzled out. And the Mirant incident was eclipsed by the attention focused on Hank Paulson, the chief executive, nominated by George W. Bush, US president, on Tuesday as the next secretary of the US Treasury.The revelation surprised many at Goldman, who thought Mr Paulson had turned down the job. The thinking was that the top spot at Wall Street’s most prestigious institution was too good to leave, especially to serve a lame duck president with only about two years left in office.Now, I gather the spin in some quarters is different. The argument goes that Mr Paulson acquiesced only after a personal plea from Mr Bush, and might anyway have done all that could be expected of him (admittedly a lot) and needed to think about moving on.Such efforts to rationalise Mr Paulson’s decision fit with most Goldman bankers’ genuine belief that nowhere is better. This is built around impressive competence, long hours, unusual teamwork, still rarer subservience to the greater good of the firm, huge profitability and an apparently bullet-proof reputation. They are very, very good; they know it; and they know they don’t need to shout about it.These characteristics are what made Goldman so frustrating to compete against. They would be invited to every “beauty parade”. We and other perfectly respectable banks – sometimes better qualified – had to work hard to get that far, and even harder to get on any shortlist. And however hard we worked, it seemed Goldman bankers could summon up a quick call from “Hank” or his then equivalent and the deal would often be theirs, even in the wilds of China in the mid-1990s.With his pedigree and connections, Mr Paulson should be able to garner much more influence and respect at the Treasury than his immediate predecessors. He could even come to be as revered as Robert Rubin, secretary for four years during the Clinton era and another former Goldman executive. To do that, he may have to achieve the feat, rare in recent decades, of staying on under a new president following the 2008 elections.In return, Mr Paulson will forego his multi-million dollar pay packet, sell or ring-fence his $600m or so of Goldman stock and give up the chairmanship of the Nature Conservancy, the huge US charity that is close to his heart. A staunch Republican at mostly Democratic Goldman, his robust green credentials nonetheless earned him a photograph, complete with birding binoculars, in the May issue of the Bush-bashing Vanity Fair magazine.Goldman, meanwhile,
will lose a spectacularly successful leader who saw the firm prosper through its public share offering – controversial at the time – and on to record profits just shy of $6bn last year.But Goldman is also likely to wind up the biggest winner. Once at the Treasury, Mr Paulson may distance himself from his former colleagues but the global influence of the firm – already disproportionately large – and of its style can only increase.The same goes for its reputation as a breeding ground for top public finance officials, another tradition that burnishes the firm’s aura in the market.And when Mr Paulson eventually leaves the Treasury, the Goldman network, among the most effective anywhere, will no doubt find ways to profit from his experience.The rest of Wall Street, many of them no slouches themselves, could be looking on enviously for a while yet."
65;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-05-31T21:01:54Z;Wall St higher as traders shrug off Fed minutes;;"US markets closed higher on Wednesday, recouping some of the losses from Tuesday’s sell-off, but still finished the month significantly lower.Investors pored over minutes from the Federal Reserve’s May meeting, but were able to shrug off the implications for future interest rate rises.“On balance, participants judged that inflation expectations had risen somewhat, a development that would have to be taken into account in policymaking,” the committee’s report said.After the minutes’ release, markets pulled back slightly, only to recover in the afternoon. Markets were also sanguine about a report showing strong manufacturing growth in Chicago.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent, or 10.25 points, at 1,270.09, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent, or 14.14 points, to 2,178.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent or 73.88 points to 11,168.31.The S&P 500 finished the month down 3.1 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite down 6.2 per cent. The Dow Jones Average closed down 1.7 per cent for in May.The S&P 500 had its worst month in two years, while the Nasdaq Composite marked its biggest monthly loss since July 2004.“One of the reasons [May] has been so disastrous is that the first quarter was so good in anticipation of the Fed not raising rates,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.The auto sector was the best performing for the month. Carmakers had a volatile May, with the relevant S&P sector at times down as much as 4.5 per cent, but overall the sector finished the month up more than 5 per cent. General Motors added 17.9 per cent in May.The ailing semiconductor sector was the worst-performing in May, dropping
9.4 per cent. Intel led the plunge, dipping 27.8 per cent over the month to $18.02.Freddie Mac fell 2.5 per cent to $60.04 after the mortgage finance group released 2005 results and said its regulator was considering capping the size of its portfolio.Apple Computer continued its slide, dropping 4 per cent to $58.79. It is now down 30.8 per cent for the year.Oil services performed better, with Diamond Offshore adding 4.8 per cent to $85.74 and BJ Services up 4.9 per cent to $36.65.NRG Energy leapt 15.7 per cent to $49.75 after power group Mirant said it had made an $8bn cash and stock offer to buy the company, which owns and operates power plants. Mirant fell 1.5 per cent to $24.88 and was the heaviest traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The news pushed other utilities higher. Edison International gained 2.2 per cent to $39.24, and Texas Utilities added 2.1 per cent to $57.30.ADC Telecommunications dropped sharply after saying it would buy Andrew Corp in a deal valued at $2bn. Shares in ADC fell 19.9 per cent to $17.92. Andrew rose 3.5 per cent to $10.12."
66;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-05-31T18:33:01Z;Lex: US power M&A;;Most power companies find it notoriously difficult to channel their energy into sensible endeavours. Take Mirant, which has seen its advances rebuffed by rival NRG Energy and is now taking the matter to court. The merchant power generator claims that NRG intentionally obstructed its hostile bid. But whatever the eventual outcome, this looks like an odd way to secure an amicable solution.Buying and selling businesses has long been among the favourite pursuits of power companies, especially when times are reasonably good. In the US, at least, they could lately even make some reasonable arguments to support this.The market remains highly fragmented, due to different regulatory regimes and transmission constraints. In theory, consolidation should spread the risks of generators, as well as securing cost savings. It might also strengthen the industry’s political position by optimising capacity with demand and thus potentially avoiding blackouts. Other utilities would be willing to pay in order to have access to spare capacity.There are several snags, however. For one thing political and regulatory forces can also stall deals. Florida’s FPL Group, for example, has now been forced to delay its integration with Maryland’s Constellation Energy, after local lawmakers failed to agree to a rate increase.Regulatory issues should present less of an obstacle for pure generators, such as Mirant and NRG. Still, Mirant plans to pay half the $7.8bn offered to NRG shareholders with its own, fairly illiquid, stock. Both companies, moreover, are exposed to broadly equivalent risk profiles through their heavy exposure to coal-fired generation. That has been highly profitable lately – but the similarity of their respective portfolios may also limit much of the deal’s possible rationale in terms of risk diversification. NRG should be able to secure a better deal, at least if it sticks to its role as a target.
67;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-05-31T17:58:20Z;Dispute escalates over Mirant bid for rival;;Mirant’s $8bn bid for NRG Energy, a fellow US independent power company, escalated into public bitterness on Wednesday as NRG issued a strongly worded statement rejecting the offer and Mirant took legal action against its rival.The dispute between the two electricity producers, both of which emerged from bankruptcy in recent years after collapsing in the wake of the implosion at Enron, had been simmering for weeks.But tensions moved into the open on Wednesday after Mirant went public with a cash-and-stock offer for NRG pitched at a 33 per cent premium to the company’s share price, in an attempt to create the largest US non-utility power producer.NRG responded by issuing an unusually strong rejection of the proposal. In a letter released on Wednesday, David Crane, NRG chief executive, and Howard Cosgrove, chairman, said it was “the wrong deal at the wrong time”.Specifically, NRG said the bid undervalued the group, that Mirant’s shares suffered from a lack of liquidity and were therefore an “unacceptable currency”, and that industry trends meant this was the wrong time for the company to be sold.Mirant fought back by launching legal action against NRG in Delaware Chancery Court. The complaint claims that NRG is unfairly seeking to block the bid on the grounds that Mirant made use of non-public information about NRG obtained through an unnamed financial adviser.But Mirant said it only studied public information in making the bid for NRG – and in any case the financial adviser in question recently stopped working for the company. JPMorgan Chase is now Mirant’s only banker and has committed to providing an $11.5bn financing package for the bid.The war of words between NRG and Mirant came as both companies studied investors’ reactions to the offer. NRG shares rose 16.8 per cent to $50.22 in morning trading, still significantly below the price of $57.16 per share being proposed by Mirant. This suggests some scepticism on Wall Street about Mirant’s chances of success.Meanwhile, Mirant shares fell 5 per cent to $24 as investors and analysts worried about the ability of the company to digest such a large acquisition so soon after its January exit from Chapter 11.One key constituency in the takeover battle will be the four private equity groups – Blackstone, Texas Pacific Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Hellman & Friedman – that became investors in NRG after selling a large portfolio of assets in Texas to the company in a lucrative deal last year.Mirant’s bid for NRG, which is being advised by Citigroup bankers and Skadden Arps lawyers, comes amid a flurry of deal activity in the US energy industry, helped by the surge in commodity prices. This week, Kinder Morgan, a US oil and gas pipeline group, received a takeover offer worth $13.5bn from its management and a consortium of private equity funds including Goldman Sachs and Carlyle.Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston and Richard Beales in New York
68;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-05-31T01:06:42Z;NRG Energy rejects $8bn offer from Mirant;;"Mirant Corporation, the Atlanta-based electricity producer, on Tuesday night made an $8bn unsolicited approach to take over rival NRG Energy in a deal that would create the largest non-utility power company in the US, dominating the nation’s most populated regions.The cash-and-stock bid from Mirant, which is supported by an $11.5bn financing commitment from JPMorgan Chase, was made public after NRG earlier this month rejected the offer.Mirant is proposing to pay $57.16 per share for NRG in an equal mix of cash and stock.NRG on Tuesday night issued a statement responding to the latest offer, saying it was “not in the best interests of its shareholders.”“Having spent considerable time analysing Mirant, its assets and prospects…we have concluded that Mirant is a company and stock with flat earnings, little to no growth opportunity beyond 2007,” the statement said.Specific terms include the ability of NRG shareholders to receive $57.50 per share, valuing the company at a 33 per cent premium to its Tuesday closing price of $43.01. Mirant shares closed at $25.25.A successful takeover of NRG would position Mirant as the dominant player in non-utility - or merchant and contracted - power generation in Texas, the MidAtlantic region, the NorthEast and California. It would also mark the union of two companies that only recently emerged from bankruptcy. Both collapsed in the wake of the demise of Enron in 2001.The proposal comes as the US energy industry is experiencing a bout of consolidation. On Monday, a consortium of private equity firms offered $13.5bn to take over Kinder Morgan, the oil and gas pipeline company, in deal backed by management. US utilities have also participated in the dealmaking activity, but transactions such as FPL’s $11.5bn takeover of Constellation and Exelon’s $13bn bid for PSEG have encountered stiff regulatory hurdles.Mirant does not expect to be faced with the same obstacles, and believes a deal could close before the end of the year. The company is likely to woo NRG inevstors by describing benefits such as $150m in annual cost savings from corporate level integration; coal purchasing synergies ; and similar approaches to hedging.A takeover of NRG would come only a year after the NRG acquired Texas Genco, the Texas -based power group, in a landmark transaction for the four private equity owners that previously owned the assets and made about five times their money on the deal.These included Blackstone, Texas Pacific Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Hellman & Friedman.Lawyers at Wachtell Lipton advised Mirant, along with bankers at JPMorgan, which provided exclusive advisory services as well as the financing."
69;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-05-31T00:53:20Z;NRG Energy responds to offer;;"NRG on Tuesday confirmed it received an unsolicited proposal from Mirant Corporation regarding a potential combination in letters dated May 10 and 30 2006.Consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its financial advisor and legal counsel, NRG’s board of directors reviewed the Mirant proposal and deemed it not in the best interests of NRG shareholders. NRG shareholders do not need to take any action at this time.The following response letter was sent to Edward R. Muller, chairman and chief executive officer of Mirant Corporation and the Mirant board of directors:Dear Mr Muller:The board of directors of NRG Energy, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, has reviewed and thoroughly considered your May 10 2006 letter. Based upon this review the Board has unanimously rejected your proposal because it is not in the best interests of NRG shareholders. The NRG Board has specifically authorised this response.As discussed below, the Board has found your proposal deficient in at least three key respects: it significantly undervalues NRG; our concerns about Mirant’s value and your stock’s relative lack of liquidity and trading history makes Mirant’s stock an unacceptable currency; and, finally, having taken into account trends and developments in the wholesale power generation sector, we do not believe this is the appropriate time to engage in a sale process.Having spent considerable time analysing Mirant, its assets and prospects - both during the three years you spent in bankruptcy and the four months since you emerged - we have concluded that Mirant is a company and stock with flat earnings, little to no growth opportunity beyond 2007, substantial and imminent environmental capital expenditures, and significant EBITDA exposure to developing country risk. Additionally, with only a four-month trading history and an average daily trading volume of 2.7m shares during those four months, we believe that Mirant’s stock lacks a sufficient track record and liquidity for us to recommend to our shareholders that they accept over 150m Mirant shares as you propose. These factors far outweigh any synergistic benefits that might come from a combination of the two companies.For these reasons, NRG’s Board and management strongly believe that our shareholders would be poorly served by being exposed to Mirant’s challenges through ownership of Mirant equity on the terms set forth in your proposal.We are confident that our stock is poised for further appreciation as we capitalize on the positive industry trends and as the market comes to recognize our embedded growth potential particularly post-2007. In this regard, we note that the premium reflected in your proposal is far less than the annual compound average growth rate of NRG’s share price appreciation….To clarify one point, your letter references past meetings between you and our chief executive officer, David Crane, on the topic of combining NRG and Mirant. Our company’s strategic interest in Mirant predates your tenure there and is well known to anyone who has read transcripts of your bankruptcy hearings. When Mr Crane discussed a combination of the two companies with you last November, it was in the context of NRG acquiring Mirant, since at that time Mirant’s stock was neither listed nor actively traded. Once your company finally emerged from bankruptcy in January 2006, our Board specifically reviewed the possible acquisition of Mirant by NRG. We decided not to do so on the grounds that at $25 per share Mirant’s stock was overvalued, and we were not willing to risk NRG’s reputation for financial discipline on an overpriced bid for Mirant. When you approached Mr Crane in March to propose a “no premium” acquisition of NRG by Mirant, Mr Crane advised you that such a transaction (at the price for NRG’s shares implied by your proposal) was not worth pursuing further given that it would be massively dilutive to NRG shareholders - a point of view which neither you nor Goldman Sachs has ever attempted to refute.As you know, NRG believes that industry consolidation is inevitable, and we expect to participate - either as a buyer or a seller. You should also know that we will only pursue transactions that create unquestionable value for our stockholders. Your proposal is simply the wrong deal at the wrong time.Sincerely,Howard Cosgrove
Chairman of the BoardDavid Crane

70;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-04-02T21:01:15Z;Texas Pacific raises record $14bn for new fund;;Texas Pacific Group will this month tell investors it has raised more than $14bn for its latest buy-out fund, the biggest single pool of capital raised in global private equity.TPG recently contacted investors to say it planned to inflate the size of its new fund beyond its original target, which was initially expected to be in the $10bn to $12bn range.The decision follows a seemingly insatiable appetite from new and former investors, including banks, insurance companies, public and private pensions schemes, university endowments and wealthy individuals, to pump capital into the asset class.Larger amounts of Middle Eastern capital are also flowing into private equity funds.TPG won industry notoriety last year when it agreed to sell Texas Genco, the Houston-based wholesale power generation company it bought barely a year earlier with a team of private equity partners for $3.87bn.The asset was sold to NRG Energy for $8.3bn, including debt, converting the combined equity investment of the four-member buy-out team in Texas Genco of $900m into close to $6bn.TPG has also done well with its investment in Debenhams, the UK retailer, which has already returned twice its equity investment ahead of a planned initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange.However, TPG, which has carved out a speciality in the purchase of distressed businesses, notably airlines, has also faced difficult times with some of its investments.Gate Gourmet, the airline catering business, hit trouble with unions in the UK and US last year, while Grohe, the bathroom products group, was at the centre of a controversy when a German politician compared buy-out firms to the biblical plague of locusts that descended on Egypt.The rate of fund raising in private equity – with a record of more than $250bn estimated to have been raised in 2005 – has surprised many within the industry. Record amounts of capital are also likely to be raised this year.Blackstone, another large US buy-out group, has raised at least $13.5bn for its latest fund, including $11bn for a flagship fund and an additional $2.5bn for a “side-car” fund that charges lower underlying fees to investors.Apollo Management recently raised just over $10bn, while Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the buy-out industry pioneer, is also raising more than $10bn for a new fund, which, when added to a fund dedicated to European buy-outs, could provide it with global firepower of more than $15bn.In Europe, Permira is raising as much as €9.78bn.TPG has more than $20bn of capital under management with a suite of funds covering private equity, venture capital, public equity and debt.It was founded in 1992 by David Bonderman, James Coulter and William Price.The firm declined to comment, citing regulatory restrictions.
71;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-01-13T13:19:57Z;Bond investors retain risk appetite;;Strong demand for new corporate bond issues this week showed that investors had retained an appetite for risk in the new year.Oracle, the US software company, took full advantage of the conditions and issued $5.75bn of bonds in three tranches, more than the $5bn it initially sought, to fund its takeover of Siebel Systems.The increased size showed that investor demand remained strong, despite concerns that the credit cycle is turning and default rates are expected to rise.The sterling market also made a busy start to the year, with companies including Hammerson, the UK property group, GE Capital, a unit of General Electric of the US, and Network Rail, the UK railway operator, all printing new issues.Meanwhile, in the euro market, investor appetite has yet to be tested thoroughly, but that is set to change next week, when Telefónica, the Spanish telecommunications operator, launches a multi-billion deal.The company plans to issue €4bn of bonds with maturities of five and 10 years, as well as £1bn split into maturities of more than 12 and 20 years.Proceeds from the sale will be used to refinance part of the £18.5bn Telefónica borrowed from banks to buy O2 of the UK last year.In the high-yield market, Fresenius Medical Care, the German healthcare group, sold €1bn of bonds yesterday. The company priced €500m of seven-year bonds with a 5 per cent coupon and the same amount of a 10-year tranche with a coupon of 5.5 per cent.The yield on the bonds came down from initial guidance, which is often a sign of strong demand.Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley were the bookrunners.In the US, NRG Energy was preparing a $3.6bn offering, which would be the second biggest high-yield issue in the market on record.Outside the European and US markets, one of the landmark issues of the week was DP Ports’ $3.5bn Islamic bond issue, the biggest of its kind to date.The Dubai-based company, which is involved in a takeover battle for P&O, the UK container ports and ferries operator, increased the amount of funds raised by $700m from the $2.8bn it originally planned to issue.The proceeds could give DP Ports added firepower in its efforts to buy P&O.The company’s £3.33bn offer for P&O was trumped this week by a conditional £3.53bn approach by PSA of Singapore, owned by Temasek, the state investment vehicle.After leaving rates unchanged on Thursday at 2.25 per cent, Mr Trichet sounded an optimistic note about the health of the eurozone economy. These and other comments led investors to think that an interest rate rise was unlikely in February, and sparked a wave of buying.But as they started locking in profits on Friday, bond yields pushed higher. In afternoon trading, the yield on the two-year Schatz rose 0.6 basis points to 2.847 per cent and the 10-year Bund yield added 3.3bp to 3.285 per cent.In the UK, however, yields continued to fall as investors took heart in expectations that interest rates are headed for a cut by the end of the year. The yield on the two-year gilt lost 1.8bp to 4.232 per cent while the 10-year gilt yield fell 1bp to 4.070 per cent.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose 0.5bp to 1.445 per cent on Friday. The yield curve steepened, reversing Thursday’s flattening, as investors took profits on longer-dated 20 and 30-year bonds. The 20-year yield reached a six-month low on Thursday.
72;NRG;NRG Energy;2006-01-10T19:29:51Z;New issues: US corporate avalanche continues;;The flood of investment grade corporate bond issuance in the US since the new year continued on Tuesday, with Oracle, the software supplier, selling $5.75bn of bonds.The deal, increased from the $5bn announced last week, included $1.5bn in three-year floating rate notes priced to yield 23 basis points over three-month Libor, $2.25bn of five-year fixed rate paper at 73bp over Treasuries, and $2bn with a 10-year maturity yielding 90bp over Treasuries.The proceeds would be used to fund Oracle’s $5.85bn purchase of Siebel Systems and for share buybacks and other acquisitions, the company said last week.Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wachovia jointly led the deal.In the high-yield market, NRG Energy, the power generator, was preparing what could be the second-largest junk bond offering in history, at $3.6bn.NRG plans to use the proceeds of the issue to help fund its $8.3bn acquisition of Texas Genco from a consortium including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts – the private equity group whose leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1989 included the largest junk offering ever.Morgan Stanley and Citigroup are leading the three-tranche deal.In Europe, BMW sold $300m of five-year bonds in the German carmaker’s first dollar-denominated issue since 2001.The 2011 issue, which will pay a coupon of 5 per cent, was targeted at European and Asian retail investors.Rising US interest rates and a flat Treasury yield curve are making short-dated dollar deals attractive to investors.Credit Suisse First Boston, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and Morgan Stanley lead-managed the sale.The European Investment Bank took advantage of strong demand for short-dated dollar paper as the European Union’s financing vehicle kicked off its benchmark funding programme for 2006 with a $3bn, three-year transaction.Once again, Asian central banks dominated the order book. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Nomura were the lead managers.In the euro market, KfW found strong demand at the opposite end of the yield curve, as the German development bank issued its first bond with a 15-year maturity.The €5bn issue attracted orders of about €10bn from 230 accounts across Europe.Frank Czichowski, KfW treasurer, said: “Due to regulatory changes for pension funds and insurance companies, especially in Europe, the demand for bonds with longer maturities has increased. We reacted just on time to this demand.”The absence of any outstanding Bund with a 15-year maturity also made the issue attractive, as investors see AAA-rated KfW as a surrogate German government borrower.Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch were lead managers.
73;NRG;NRG Energy;2005-10-03T20:32:18Z;M&A distracts Wall Street from inflation;;NRG Energy shares rose 14 per cent to $48.55 after the company said it would buy Texas Genco for $5.8bn in stock and cash in the latest consolidation among US power companies.Meanwhile, Dex Media lost 3.5 per cent to $26.82 after its smaller rival RH Donnelly announced it would buy the publisher of telephone directories for $4.2bn in cash and shares. RH Donnelly eased 2.4 per cent to $61.77.The deals provided distraction for a market once again preoccupied with inflationary concerns. A report on manufacturing activity last month indicated that the US industrial sector expanded in spite of the recent hurricanes. “That was a real shock,” said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services.A rise in the price index for raw materials received most attention, reviving worries about inflation and the chances of a continued tightening of monetary policy by the US central bank.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach and Co, who sees interest rates at 4.75 per cent by the first quarter of 2006, said: “The fear is that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates. It’s just a matter of time before we see some pick up in inflation.”However, Mr Mendelsohn said that the market was being supported by the continued strengthening of the dollar, which has hit a near three-month high against the euro and a 16-month high against the yen.“The strong dollar has been helping to put a floor on the US equity market,” he said. “It has brought in a lot of Japanese and European buying as it boosts the return on US assets. These foreign inflows have offset many of the headwinds for the US equity market.”Still, investors on Monday morning appeared more concerned with manufacturing data, which forced declines in the stocks of leading US manufacturers, with Alcoa down 2.3 per cent to $23.89 and General Electric down 1.3 per cent to $33.23.Banking shares, which tend to benefit from higher interest rates, were mixed. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange banking index was nearly unchanged, as State Street rose 0.9 per cent to $49.36, while North Fork fell 0.5 per cent to $25.38.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent off at 10,535.48. The S&P 500 index eased 0.2 per cent to 1,226.70 and the Nasdaq Composite index bucked the trend with a 0.2 rise to 2,156.43.Other stocks in the news included Lexar Media, which rose 18 per cent to $7.53 after JPMorgan analysts upgraded the stock.Two stocks attracted interest after joining the widely-quoted S&P 500. Ameriprise, the financial advisory firm spun off from American Express, lost 4.5 per cent to $34.20 as it became an S&P 500 component from its first day of trading. Lennar, the housebuilder, added 3.3 per cent to $61.70.
74;NRG;NRG Energy;2005-10-03T13:58:06Z;RH Donnelley to buy Dex Media for $4.2bn;;RH Donnelley is set to become the third largest US telephone directory company after sealing the $4.2bn acquisition of Dex Media, a rival, amid a flurry of mid-sized transactions announced on Monday in the US.Donnelley’s move, which reflects a need to compete more effectively against the growing power of internet search engines such as Google, accounted for only a fraction of the volume of deals in the US, which exceeded $10bn on Monday.Also announced was a $2.2bn cash acquisition by Chesapeake Energy, which is buying Columbia Resources, a natural gas producer with assets in the Appalachian Basin, from Metalmark, the former private equity unit of Morgan Stanley.In addition, Reliant Energy’s sold three New York-based power plants to private equity groups Madison Dearborn and US Power Generation for $975m. This came on the heels of Sunday’s landmark deal in the highly fragmented US merchant power industry, where NRG Energy of New Jersey agreed to pay $5.8bn in cash and stock for Texas Genco.Private equity firms Texas Pacific Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group and Hellman Friedman bought Texas Genco last summer for $3.7bn producing a return of more than five times in a year. Increased interest in the global refining industry encouraged Honeywell, a US industrial conglomerate, to buy out its joint venture partner Dow Chemical in an $825m deal to take full control of UOP, which provides catalysts and technology to refineries.In real estate, Monday’s $2bn union of Brandywine Realty Trust and Prentiss Properties Trust will form one of the largest office property companies in the US with a portfolio of 49m sq ft.Donnelley’s acquisition of Dex, paid for in a mix of cash and stock, provides the latest evidence that the company is counting on size and geographic expansion to tackle increasing competition from online search groups. “Scale is going to be more important in our business,“ said David Swanson, Donnelley chief executive, in an interview with the FT. In 2003, it acquired Sprint’s directories business for $2.2bn and last year it bought SBC’s yellow page portfolios in Illinois and Indiana for $1.4bn.After the Dex acquisition closes, Donnelley will operate in 28 states, generating annual revenues of $2.7bn.Investors in Dex including its private equity backers Carlyle and Welsh Carson will receive the equivalent of $27.58 a share, in a mix of cash and stock that values the company below its closing share price on Friday. However, this price represents the highest valuation for an incumbent yellow pages company, at 10.4 times estimated 2005 earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation.
75;NRG;NRG Energy;2005-09-30T20:44:33Z;‘Incredibly resilient’ week for Wall Street;;Wall Street tacked on gains slowly over the past week in the face of uncertainties over the impact of hurricanes Rita and Katrina and achieved their first September advances in seven years.All the main equity indices finished the week, and the third quarter, with respectable gains in spite of yesterday’s news that consumer spending fell an unexpectedly steep 0.5 per cent in August, the biggest drop since November 2001.By the close on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced 0.2 per cent to 10,568.70 and the S&P 500 index had fallen 0.1 per cent to 1,228.81. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent behind at 2,151.69.For the week, the Dow put on 1.4 per cent as the S&P 500 gained 1.1 per ent and the Nasdaq added 1.6 per cent.The Dow advanced 2.9 per cent in the quarter ending on Friday, while the S&P 500 put on 3.1 per cent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq advanced 4.6 per cent.Seasoned bulls appeared impressed by the market’s ability to withstand the impact of the hurricanes and other negatives over the quarter.“It’s been tremendously resilient,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “We’ve had two of the largest natural catastrophes in our nation’s history back-to-back, seen one of our major cities decimated and had 28 per cent of our refining capacity put out of business. The Fed Reserve has continued to raise rates, the news on the ground from Iraq is terrible every day and we have tremendous divisiveness in Washington.“I think it is very impressive that the market did not fall. We bent, but we did not break.”Mr Goldman forecast earnings growth of about 10 per cent in the forthcoming third quarter reporting season and that the S&P 500 would end the year about 6 per cent higher at 1,300. He estimated that Wall St was currently trading on a multiple of about 15.5 times 12-month forward earnings.Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, agreed the resilience of Wall Street was “absolutely incredible”.“You have to wonder how much higher this market would be without the bad news,” he said. However, Mr Hogan warned that the market was not out of the woods yet, with gasoline prices still elevated, higher heating bills due to start arriving in the coming months and healthcare costs also increasing.The early signs of the challenges facing US stocks could be reflected in the indices’ monthly performance as the quarter drew to a close and the impact of Katrina and Rita on the economy became apparent. In September, the Dow and the S&P 500 both advanced a timid 0.8 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively, while the Nasdaq was flat. Nevertheless, the bulls found solace in the fact that it was the first winning September for Wall Street in seven years.“The effects of some of things that have already happened are still to be felt in the fourth quarter,” Mr Hogan said.This week saw an onslaught of corporate news, ranging from earnings to merger-and-acquisition activity and initial public offerings.A stream of deals hit the headlines almost every day. Tuesday’s news that WellPoint agreed to buy WellChoice sent the latter’s shares 7 per cent higher for the session. They rose 7.5 per cent on the week.A day later, NRG Energy saw its shares advance 3.7 per cent on news the power plant operator was in talks to acquire Texas Genco. It finished the week up 5.2 per cent.Then on Thursday the $1.6bn acquisition of JPMorgan’s BrownCo unit by E*Trade sent the online broker’s shares 5.5 per cent higher.By the close on Friday, they had advanced 7.3 per cent for the week.Also on Thursday, the shares of IDX Systems shot up 23 per cent on news that the healthcare software company’s success had induced General Electric into acquiring it.IDX Systems gained 26.6 per cent up on the week.Not all bid news led to actual bids, as Constellation Brands discovered midweek. An unsolicited – and rejected – bid from the drinks group for Canadian rival Vincor sent the latter’s stock up sharply in Toronto, while Constellation shares rose 1.8 per cent on Wednesday. On the week, the shares lost 1.7 per cent as Vincor invited the company to try again.Earnings news highlights this week included Red Hat, the open-source software company, whose above-estimate results sent the shares almost 30 per cent up on Thursday. They finished the week 30.6 per cent higher.The same session also saw six new companies debut on Wall Street. WebMD, a medical information portal, was the most successful among them, closing its first session up 39.4 per centm tacking on another 1 per cent on Friday.
76;NRG;NRG Energy;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
