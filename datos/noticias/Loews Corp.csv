Upon completion, Consolidated Container will be part of a newly-created segment called Loews Packaging Group.
1;L;Loews Corp;2015-08-03T16:47:02Z;Tyson Foods slides on earnings miss;US equities start new month on the defensive as energy sector slides;US meat processor Tyson Foods was one of the worst performing stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company cut its full-year earnings forecast, reflecting higher cattle prices’ eroding margins on its beef unit.The Arkansas-based company now expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $3.10 to $3.20 a share, below its previous forecast for earnings of $3.30 to $3.40. That was shy of Wall Street forecasts for earnings of $3.44 a share.Beef, Tyson’s biggest division, which accounted for 42 per cent of group sales last year, fell into an operating loss of $7m for the quarter, compared with an operating profit of $101m last year, due to higher cattle costs.The company said it sold beef at lower values in other markets rather than build up inventory because of the West Coast port strikes. Tyson said its beef business was also impacted after feedlots fell behind on their marketing schedules, leaving the company with a low supply.Tyson warned that the unit should be “near break-even for fiscal 2015 and profitable, but below its normalised range” of 2.5 to 4.5 per cent for fiscal 2016, as a result of the “imbalance of fed cattle supply and demand”.The news came alongside disappointing third-quarter results. Tyson said weaker export prospects as a result of the stronger dollar shaved $84m off its third-quarter results.The company reported profits of $343m, or 83 cents a share, compared with $260m, or 73 cents a share. Sales rose 4 per cent to $10.1bn.Analysts had forecast earnings of 93 cents a share, on sales of $10.3bn.Shares in Tyson Foods, which are up 8 per cent over the past year, fell 9.9 per cent to $39.96.Michael Kors shares fell 7.9 per cent to $38.66 as analysts at Piper Jaffray lowered their price target from $44 to $38.“Our checks suggest inventory for Michael Kors is building at retailers like Macy’s & Dillard’s,” Erinn Murphy, an analyst at Piper Jaffray said. “Watches remain under pressure in the US and are starting to slow in Europe.”Shares of Loews, a provider of commercial property insurance and a hotels and energy conglomerate, fell 2.8 per cent to $37.03 after the company reported second-quarter profits that were shy of analysts forecasts.The New York-based company reported profits of $170m, or 46 cents a share, compared with $116m, or 30 cents a share, in the period a year prior. This missed analysts estimates for earnings of 66 cents a share. Sales fell more than 4 per cent to $3.4bn.Loews said its operating profits for the quarter fell after the drop in crude prices weighed on Diamond Offshore, the company’s second largest subsidiary, accounting for 20 per cent of overall revenue in 2014.US stocks began the week on the back foot after a 5 per cent drop in the price of Brent crude pushed the S&P 500 energy index 2 per cent lower.The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent to 2,098.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 17,598.20. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 5,115.38.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
2;L;Loews Corp;2015-05-03T18:07:54Z;UK election and US jobs report to dominate a packed week;Earnings season roars on with more than 80 companies in S&P 500 reporting;Investors have a packed calendar, with the UK election sharing a week with the latest reading on the US labour market and the latest negotiations between Greece and its creditors.Here’s what to expect over the coming days.UK ElectionThe UK faces one of its most unpredictable general elections with voters heading to the polls on May 7. Recent surveys suggest a hung parliament, forcing either the Labour or Conservative party into a coalition government. Sterling has come under pressure in the lead up to the election, and implied volatility in the pound-dollar currency pair — a measure of expected volatility in the future — has climbed.US Jobs ReportJobs growth in the world’s largest economy is thought to have bounced back after a disappointing report in March showed the slowest monthly gain in more than a year. Economists expect the closely scrutinised non-farm payrolls report will show a 225,000 increase in jobs from a month earlier, with the unemployment rate projected to fall from 5.5 to 5.4 per cent.Greek PaymentDespite a sharp drop in Greek bond yields, investors will be watching for any news on negotiations between Athens and its international creditors over the weekend. The country gathered enough money to pay obligations due to pensioners and people familiar with the matter have told the FT that Athens should be able to make a €200m interest payment to the International Monetary Fund due on May 6.EarningsEarnings season in the US roars on, with more than 80 companies in the S&P 500 reporting in the coming days. The list includes Loews Corp, Walt Disney, Mylan, Kellogg, Electronic Arts, Fossil, Chesapeake Energy, Motorola Solutions, Twenty-First Century Fox, Whole Foods Market, Priceline and Monster Beverage.The Week in Four ChartsEven Germany’s safe-haven government bond market can suffer a sell-off. That was the surprise for investors this week, after prices of both short- and long-dated German tenors slid following a lacklustre auction of new government debt. The yield on the 10-year note jumped roughly 20 basis points to trade at 0.37 per cent — earlier in the month the yield had fallen as low as 0.07 per cent.Greek bond yields tumbled over the course of the week after Athens reshuffled its team negotiating with international creditors on a list of economic reforms to unlock bailout funding. While a deal remains elusive, the yield on Greece’s 10-year note declined to 10.23 per cent, roughly 300 basis points below a high reached earlier this month.Apple once again eclipsed consensus expectations for revenues, earnings and iPhone sales with its results for the second quarter, as it increased its shareholder return programme to $200bn, briefly sending its stock to a record.Results from the wider tech sector did not prove as lively. Twitter shares tumbled more than 25 per cent over a two-day period after the messaging company missed revenue expectations, prompting downgrades from Barclays and Janney Montgomery Scott. Yelp and LinkedIn also suffered stock price drops following quarterly results.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

He is also the bestselling author of business book The Power of We and co-owner of the NFL’s New York Giants.Suit by HermèsAt Loews, we have a business-casual dress code but, as I spend a lot of time meeting outside bankers and partners, I tend to wear conservative, custom-made suits by Hermès in navy or grey, with the occasional pinstripe. As someone who cares about being fit, I like that these slim-cut suits hide what they need to and accentuate the rest.hermes.comShirt by CharvetI get all my shirts from Charvet in Paris because I like the trim cut, traditional collar, and proper French cuffs. I have a wide range of colours – from light pinks and purples to basic blue and white.charvet.comCufflinks by HemmerleI am a fan of cufflinks and wear them every day. Many have been given to me by my wife, Lizzie, who finds me difficult to buy for, and my favourites include the ones I am wearing – a white gold pair by German designer Hemmerle. I also have several pairs by Parisian jeweller Lorenz Bäumer. The most special set I own is from Tiffany and they were designed to commemorate our football team, the New York Giants, winning the Super Bowl in 2012. These silver cufflinks are in the shape of the winning trophy and serve as a reminder of that special victory.hemmerle.comTie by HermèsI tend to play to my audience with all of my clothing choices, including my ties. I work in the hospitality business and meet staff internally much of the time but I also work with bankers, lawyers and others in a more formal capacity, so I need to look professional and not loud in any way. As a result, I don’t take a lot of risks with my tie choices and typically choose solid colours. Every once in a while I will get more creative and wear something with stripes but that’s the extent of the patterns. A few times a year, however, I will wear a Hermès tie with a whimsical elephant print. I wear this one when I attend board meetings at my alma mater, Tufts University, as the elephant is the school mascot. Otherwise, it’s plain, subdued ties all the way.Watch by MADI am currently wearing a unique watch by MAD that I bought at Colette in Paris. This company takes a Rolex and basically redoes the finish in unexpected ways. This one is a subtle grey stainless steel model with a matt finish and it strikes the perfect balance between casual and formal. I love the ruggedness of a Rolex that has been combined with a sleek polish, and I get many compliments on this unusual timepiece.mad-collections.comBelt by ArmaniBelts, and socks, are a bit of an afterthought for me. I wear the simplest ones available – in either black or very dark brown – with a discreet silver buckle. These are not statement pieces for me but rather functional things that I prefer no one notices.armani.comShoes by JM WestonI get all my dress shoes from JM Weston, the French shoemaker that specialises in comfortable, very well-made footwear. Again, I always go for conservative black or dark brown leather as it works with all of my suiting, and I prefer lace-ups for a more formal look. I also wear their loafers with more casual trousers. If I am feeling really informal, I will wear sneakers by Hogan. I spend a lot of time on my feet, so I prefer shoes that are comfortable but that can also stand up to the elements.jmweston.com

Claims from suppliers totalled $546m.Diamond Offshore Drilling, Ensco and General Electric are among those getting their fingers burnt.This from Bloomberg:Diamond Offshore, a subsidiary of Loews Corp. (L), said Oct. 24 that it wrote off $58 million in the second and third quarters on missed payments related to contracts with OGX. Loews is led by Chief Executive Officer James Tisch.Ensco, the offshore drilling contractor building six rigs, said last week that a loss of $27 million for a pair of vessels contracted to OGX reduced quarterly earnings by 12 cents per share……General Electric Co. (GE), which in July said it wrote down a $300 million investment in Batista’s holding company, and seamless steel pipe maker Tenaris SA (TEN) are also among suppliers to OGX, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Related reading:

5;L;Loews Corp;2011-11-18T12:50:48Z;Risk-on/risk-off markets;This is a terrible time for the stockpicker as the eurozone crisis drags on;"Gee, thanks Bill. The imminent departure of Bill Miller from a flagship equity fund at Legg Mason, the US mutual fund house, should be the opportunity of a lifetime for his successor as portfolio manager, Sam Peters. Yet, as Mr Peters noted in a recent pamphlet, this is a bad time for the stockpicker. While markets fret over the collapse of the eurozone, equities have become “an undifferentiated lump of risk assets”, he wrote, to be “bought during ‘risk on’ regimes and sold or shorted during ‘risk off’ episodes”.Correlation has indeed been climbing all year. Since January, stocks as diverse as Dow Chemical, Honeywell (engineering) and Loews (insurance) have done exactly what the S&P 500 index has done, nine days out of 10. The third quarter was particularly tough for managers trying to sort wheat from chaff: the average level of the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s implied correlation index for the S&P 500, which tracks how much stocks move in tandem, was a record high of 71.In that kind of environment, macro will always trump micro. Hedge funds running global macro strategies, flitting across liquid assets around the world, posted $81bn of gains during that period, according to Hedge Fund Research. (Equity hedge – the stockpickers’ paradise – lost $51bn.)Institutional investors seemed to doubt macro funds could continue to outperform: they suffered net outflows during the quarter. Since then, the implied correlation of
S&P stocks has climbed higher still, to 82 in November. The rise of index-linked products amplifies
the trend. The creation and redemption of exchange traded funds leads to the buying and selling of all constituents of the
indices tracked by the funds. Until markets discriminate once more, stockpickers will struggle. A monkey throwing darts at a board will seem just as effective – and a lot cheaper."
6;L;Loews Corp;2011-10-31T14:40:24Z;US stocks down as financials suffer;Trading of MF Global shares suspended;Trading in shares of MF Global was suspended after the broker-dealer, which has been weighed down by exposure to European sovereign debt, filed for bankruptcy on Monday morning. Attempts to sell the company to Interactive Brokers failed over the weekend.MF Global’s market capitalisation had fallen by two-thirds last week, with the shares valued at $1.20 when trading was suspended.The S&P 500 index fell 2.5 per cent to 1,253.30, its second worst day of the month. European concerns returned to the fore as Italian bond yields approached euro-era highs. Monday’s losses left the benchmark US index up 10.7 per cent for October, still the best month since December 1991.Half of Monday’s losses came in the last hour as the Euro fell against the dollar.“It was a day of profit taking that accelerated at the end of the day,” said Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist at Schaeffers. “That makes sense given the strength of last week’s rally. I’m not too worried as long as the market holds here.”Utilities and consumer staples held up best. Cyclical energy and material stocks suffered the worst, down 4.4 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively.Solar stocks were left particularly bruised after the UK government proposed a 55 per cent cut in its solar subsidy scheme.First Solar was off 7.8 per cent to $49.77 and MEMC Electronic Materials was off 9.8 per cent to $5.99.“The entire solar industry is subsidised and, when you look at any region, subsidies are under threat everywhere apart from China,” said Ben Pang, alternative energy analyst at Caris and Company.Oil driller Nabors Industries fell 3.8 per cent $18.33, although it had traded in positive territory most of the day, despite revealing it had paid $100m to chairman Eugene Isenberg after he relinquished his post as chief executive.The company, which is based in Bermuda, has faced shareholder rebellions in the past over compensation paid to the estates of deceased executives and executive pay.“It’s a huge payout and again Nabors shareholders are the losers,” said Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, a shareholder activist group, which holds Nabors stock. “It seems that Isenberg has absolutely no regard for appearances, even when corporate excess is under scrutiny.”Nabors did not comment on the payout.Financials, which had benefited most from improving sentiment towards Europe, were also sold off.Insurers were worst hit. Lincoln National was off 11 per cent to $19.05 and Genworth Financial fell 6.9 per cent to $6.38.Asset managers and investment banks also suffered. Money manager Janus Capital was off 9.1 per cent to $6.56, while Morgan Stanley dropped 8.6 per cent to $17.64 and Goldman Sachs was off 5.5 per cent to $109.55.Yahoo fell 5.6 per cent to $15.64 on reports the company may dispose of Asian assets, rather than be acquired as a single business.Humana was the stand-out performer in the S&P 500. The health insurer jumped 5.7 per cent to $84.89 after forecasting full-year earnings of between $8.35 and $8.40 a share, which would represent a 20 per cent jump on last year’s profit and is a big improvement on a previous estimate of $7.50 to $7.60 a share.Humana benefited from having a higher proportion of customers covered by Medicare – the government healthcare programme for senior citizens – and from low customer claims.The company predicted 2012 earnings per share will moderate to $7.40 to $7.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.3 per cent lower at 11,955.7 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.9 per cent to 2,684.41.But despite scepticism about the sustainability of last week’s rally, some strategists at big US banks advised clients to position for further gains.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, urged clients to hold more material stocks, arguing valuations remain “in the cheapest quintile versus history”, despite last week’s rally.Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou at JPMorgan Chase said the rally could gather further steam as hedge fund managers “increase their equity exposure given their poor performance this year, as they attempt to recover their losses”.Electronic broker Charles Schwab released a survey showing the majority of its clients still expect the S&P 500 to rise through to the end of the year.Diversified energy and commercial property holding company Loews was down 3.8 per cent to $39.70 despite reporting third-quarter profits of $162m, or 40 cents a share, compared with only $36m in the 2010 third quarter. Analysts had been expecting 54 cents a share.Healthcare real estate investment trust HCP Inc fell 0.9 per cent to $39.88 after funds from operations in the third quarter rose to 63 cents per share, up 16.7 per cent from the same quarter in 2010.
7;L;Loews Corp;2011-08-01T21:01:42Z;Wall Street erases gains after weak data;;US stocks closed slightly lower after a turbulent session that saw the session open with shares sharply higher on the US debt agreement and then tumble after weak manufacturing figures damped sentiment.Leading defence companies came under pressure on worries that fiscal retrenchment in the wake of the debt deal will hit the Pentagon’s defence budget.Lockheed Martinlost 1.7 per cent to $74.46, Boeingfell 2 per cent to $70.33 and Northrop Grummanwas down 1.5 per cent to $59.60.The broader aerospace and defence sector, which is still undervalued according to Citigroup analysts, was lower.About $350bn of cuts over 10 years are expected in the Pentagon’s defence budget. Although Citi analysts said this was not as bad as the industry had expected, the cuts were not yet final and could increase.Citi said it expected “there to continue to be some overhang on defence names until a deal gets done”, but the key details of defence spending would probably be released in the strategic review due in September.After the bell, the S&P 500 index fell 0.4 per cent to 1,286.95, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,744.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,132.49.Last week, the S&P 500 registered its worst weekly performance in a year and markets fluctuated on the news of the negotiations and the growing possibility of default.The indices were also hit by weaker-than-expected Institute of Supply Management figures indicating that the pace of US manufacturing growth was slowing.Some analysts saw some hope, at least over the short term, for bulls.“Over the near term, a solution to raising the debt limit will probably result in a strong rally, given stocks are deeply oversold and near support, which is at 1,250 to 1,270 using the S&P 500,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird. “But the ramifications of GDP growth of less than 1 per cent for the first six months of the year will linger.“Looking further out, the question now becomes whether the weak economy can endure the austerity programmes planned for the second half of the year,” he said.Healthcare facilities were some of the biggest losers after Friday’s after-market news that nursing homes lost a lobbying fight with Medicare that will cost the industry more than $3.8bn next year. The federal government’s healthcare programme for the elderly is cutting its payment rate by 11.1 per cent to help compensate for overbilling.Sun Healthcare Group lost 52.14 per cent to $3.35, Skilled Healthcare Group fell to $5.06, a 42.5 per cent drop, and The Ensign Group slid 22.2 per cent to $22.09.US insurers slipped on news that the US department of health and human services had signed off on recommendations to include contraception in preventive care.While not slated to go into effect until next year, analysts said it would force insurance companies to increase premiums. The S&P healthcare sector was down 1.71 per cent.Concerns that some of the spending cuts from the debt deal will affect Medicare and other healthcare services also hit the sector.Among health insurers to fall were Cigna, down 4.3 per cent to $47.63, Aetna, off 2.9 per cent to $40.29, and United Healthcare, 3.2 per cent lower at $48.02.Humana, the US health insurer, also fell despite forecast-beating results. It reported a second-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast by more than 10 per cent but shares fell to $72.36, a 2.9 per cent loss.The company would have raised its full-year guidance further, Citi analysts said, but plans to increase non-production spending in the second half could have an impact on results.Allstate, the home and car insurer, reported a second-quarter net loss of $620m after a spring of tornadoes, flooding and other natural disasters, but the loss was less than markets had anticipated. In the quarter, losses from catastrophes reached more than $2bn, the most disclosed by any publicly traded US insurer. Its shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.34.Shares in Ford Motor rose despite news that the US car company was recalling 1.1m pick-up trucks because of a risk of the gas tank falling off and causing fires. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $12.35.Late on Sunday, HSBC agreed to sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank, for $1bn in cash. Shares in the regional bank, which merged with NewAlliance Bancshares for $1.5bn last year, fell 2.7 per cent to $11.92.Loews, the US insurance and property group, was hit by higher catastrophe losses and lower income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial.Missing market expectations, it reported earnings per share of $0.62 versus an expected $0.74. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $39.11.
8;L;Loews Corp;2010-08-26T19:12:36Z;Political leaders and markets;Blaming Obama for weak equity prices;On Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the US television pundit, spent most of his popular show blaming Barack Obama for soggy stocks. “Mad” Mr Cramer reckons the president is waging an “undeclared oblivious war against equities”. The chief executive of conglomerate Loews Corporation goes further, remarking on Thursday to Bloomberg that a lack of confidence in the White House was stunting economic growth.To what extent should political leaders be responsible to investors? To be sure, it is rare for those in high office to comment on equity markets. That explains the headlines last year when stockbroker-in-chief Obama recommended buying shares, saying they were a “potentially good deal if you’ve got a long-term perspective on it”. Even if he is wrong in the long run, voters would have made 52 per cent on their money if they had taken the president’s advice – he picked the low to within four days.Perhaps he was responsible for the rebound. Who knows? Certainly, politicians feel less restraint wading into currency markets. Naoto Kan, Japan’s prime minister, openly wants a weaker yen. That is unusual. Mostly politicians stupidly see their country’s currency as some kind of virility symbol – the stronger the better, even if exporters suffer. Bonds are also fair game, presumably because governments feel it is their business. Leaders from the developed eurozone to dodgy emerging nations regularly opine on the unfairness of the latest sovereign credit rating.Obviously the problem with politicians talking up markets is that they risk looking stupid or impotent, or both. These are not attributes helpful to power games. Of course Mr Obama and his global peers would love higher share prices. Bill Clinton’s legacy, for example, owes much to warm memories of the 1990s bull market. But leaders should stick to sound policies and trust markets to reward them for doing so.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

10;L;Loews Corp;2009-12-07T09:40:50Z;Buffett on sale;;Value is in the eye of the beholder, even when valuing value investors. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway can now be had for 1.18 times book value, which – depending on how one looks at it – is cheap or expensive.Closed-end funds typically trade at a discount to book of 5 to 15 per cent. Even well-run conglomerates sell at a discount to break-up value. Loews, with similar holdings to Berkshire, is at a 10 per cent discount.But Berkshire is, of course, no ordinary conglomerate, so a mere 18 per cent premium to book is among the cheapest entry-points in decades. Over the past 18 years investors have paid 1.7 times book on average. Anyone who balked at paying 1.3 times in 1991, as the US was exiting a recession, missed out on a tenfold return. Since 1964, Berkshire’s book value has grown more than 400,000 per cent versus 5,000 per cent for US stocks overall.While he touts growth in book value and not share price as the best measure of his prowess, Mr Buffett stresses that it is but a crude approximation of “intrinsic value”. Of Berkshire’s $155bn market value, some $95bn can be ascribed to publicly available debt and equity holdings that deserve no premium. The rest, mostly insurance and utility investments, are tougher to value, but have publicly traded counterparts. Then there are opaque derivatives bets. But hardest to value of all is how Mr Buffett allocates the prodigious cash flow from these holdings. No accounting convention can capture his sterling record.Berkshire’s cheapness may reflect fear of dilution from its pending acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Or it may mark realisation that the 79-year-old Oracle of Omaha and his 85-year-old partner Charlie Munger will not be around to allocate their capital for another 46 years. It is hard to put a price on their intrinsic value, but the market appears to be trying.
11;L;Loews Corp;2009-11-02T21:49:00Z;Ford drives Wall St higher;;US equities were volatile on Monday, turning sharply negative during the afternoon as financials slumped, before recovering some lost ground.Initially, stocks rallied, boosted by upbeat economic reports and a surprise swing to profitability for Ford.The US carmaker posted its first quarterly profit in more than a year as cost-cutting and the government’s “cash-for-clunkers” rebates helped produce earnings of nearly $1bn, or 29 cents a share, during the third quarter.That confounded expectations of a 12-cent-a-share loss and Ford closed up 8.3 per cent at $7.58.After the closing bell, Stanley Works announced it would acquire Black & Decker in an all-share deal valued at $4.5bn.After dipping as much as 0.7 per cent during the afternoon, the S&P 500 closed 0.7 per cent higher at 1,042.88, half its earlier rise of 1.5 per cent.It was a wild ride on Monday for Vix, the index of S&P options volatility. After dropping 8.5 per cent to 28, Vix powered back above 30, only to ease a tad as stocks recovered. Last week, Vix closed above 30, for the first time since July a sign of rising fear for stocksThe S&P financials also rebounded from an afternoon slide of 1.8 per cent, sparked by worries that the banking system remains vulnerable in the wake of CIT filing for bankruptcy on Sunday.“Weakness among financials was also likely reflecting investor concerns as how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will build reserves against future loses in an environment that’s already seen 100 banks fold this year,” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities.Elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite closed higher by 0.2 per cent at 2,049.20, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,789.44.The behaviour of equities on Monday came after last week’s decline of 4 per cent for the S&P, which helped drag the broad benchmark into negative territory for October, its first monthly decline since February.Investors enter November facing a busy week of data, the end of the earnings season and a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Any change in the central bank’s policy statement as to the timing of removing easing policy could weigh on sentiment, notably in the bond market.Later in the week, attention will focus on the release of the October employment report. Economists expect a decline of 175,000 jobs during October with the unemployment rate rising 0.1 percentage points to 9.9 per cent.“The bottom line in Friday’s jobs data is likely to be that the labour market remains a significant source of vulnerability for the economic recovery,” said Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson Icap.On Monday the market was propelled to its intra-day highs after the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched manufacturing index was 55.7 for October.That was higher than an expected rise of 53 and was the best reading since April 2006. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion.Meanwhile, construction spending for September rose 0.8 per cent, its biggest gain since September 2008, and pending home sales for September were up 6.1 per cent as the home buyer tax credit boosted activity.Sentiment for stocks was also boosted by other earnings, brokerage actions and a deal in the energy sector.Denbury, the oil company, announced a deal to buy Encore for $3.2bn with Encore shareholders receiving $50 a share, consisting of $15 in cash and $35 in Denbury common stock.Denbury fell 10.3 per cent to $13.09 while Encore rose 20.5 per cent to $44.67.In other earnings news, Humana, the health insurer, posted a 65 per cent rise in third-quarter profit.The company reported earnings of $301.6m, or $1.78 a share, up from $183m, or $1.09 a share, a year before. Revenue rose 8 per cent for the quarter to $7.72bn and the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $37.01.Shares in Loews Corp rose 2.4 per cent to $33.90 after the conglomerate reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit of $469m, or $1.08 a share, beating a forecast of 89 cents a share. That compared with a loss of $144m, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Sysco Corp, the food distributer, recorded an 18 per cent rise in quarterly profit, just above estimates. The stock gained 0.2 per cent to $26.50 as sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.Shares in Clorox rose 0.3 per cent to $59.40 after the maker of bleach products posted a 23 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit, beating estimates.Shares in Motorola rose 5.4 per cent to $9.03 after Citigroup upgraded it to a “buy” from a “hold” and raised the target price to $10.50 ahead of the new Droid cell phone.Nordstrom gained 1.6 per cent to $32.29 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the retailer to a “buy” from a “hold” with a target price of $45 from $36on expectations of better store sales in October.
12;L;Loews Corp;2009-08-03T15:28:13Z;Loews profits fall as investment income drops;;Loews Corp on Monday reported a nearly 40 per cent drop in second quarter net income from continuing operations to $341m, as a drop in investment income led the company to widely miss analysts’ expectations.Net income from continuing operations at the company, excluding special charges, was $0.78 per share, compared with $1.00 per share in the second quarter last year. Analysts had been expecting earnings per share of $0.98. Revenues fell almost 10 per cent to $3.53bn.Including special charges, Loews Corporations net income fell from $9.54 per share to $0.78 per share, mostly due to a one-time gain on the sale of tobacco business Lorillard. It spun the maker of Newport menthol cigarettes off as the US economy slowed, capitalising on the business’ defensive nature, and protecting itself from tobacco related lawsuits.Loews subsidiary CNA Financial Corporation, of which the company owns a 90 per cent stake, saw its net income fall 42 per cent to $105m, as the property downturn hit its residential and commercial mortgage-backed security portfolios.Excluding investment losses, the company’s income from operations fell less than 10 per cent to $511m year on year.Loews rose 3 per cent to 30.92 in early trading in New York on Monday.
13;L;Loews Corp;2008-09-19T12:07:29Z;SEC unveils temporary shorting ban;;"US regulators on Friday launched a temporary ban on short selling as part of a group of new initiatives aimed at restoring calm to stricken financial markets.The Securities and Exchange Commission published a list of stocks in 799 financial companies that investors were prohibited from short selling until October 2. The move could be extended for up to 30 days if necessary.The emergency measures, which will take effect immediately, follow similar bans by the UK’s Financial Services Authority and the Irish stock market regulator. Australia banned “naked” short selling, where shares are sold without being borrowed first, in a move that takes effect on Monday.The SEC, which stated that it was acting “in concert” with the FSA, said it had taken the “action to prohibit short selling in financial companies to protect the integrity and quality of the securities market and strengthen investor confidence”.The list of US companies includes AIG, the insurance group bailed out by the government earlier this week; Blackstone Group, the private equity group; Berkshire Hathaway, the investment group controlled by Warren Buffett; and Loews, the insurance-to-hotel group controlled by the Tisch family.Short-sellers have been widely blamed for plunging shares of financial firms, with some claiming they were reponsible for driving down the share prices of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that filed for bankruptcy earlier this week, and of AIG, the insurance giant that was rescued by the US government.Short sellers aim to profit from share declines, usually by borrowing a stock, selling it and buying it back after its price has decreased. In abusive “naked” short selling, the seller does not borrow the stock and fails to deliver it to the buyer.The SEC said: “At present, it appears that unbridled short selling is contributing to the recent, sudden price declines in the securities of financial institutions unrelated to true price valuation.”The move is the latest in a series of recent actions against short sellers. In July, the SEC temporarily banned “naked” short selling in a number of financial companies. And on Wednesday the US securities regulators said they would subpoena hedge funds for their past trading records and may force investors to disclose short sale positions, in the latest move to combat potential market manipulation.In addition to the ban on short selling the 799, the SEC said it was temporarily requiring that money managers report their new short sales of certain stocks, and easing restrictions on securities issuers to buy back their shares - an action that could help bolster stock prices and increase liquidity."
14;L;Loews Corp;2008-09-08T14:18:16Z;Altria buys UST for $11.7bn;;Altria on Monday announced that it would buy US chewing tobacco maker UST for $11.7bn, in a deal which would help offset Altria's declining US cigarette volumes and boost its position in the tobacco market by expanding its range of alternative tobacco products.Altria, the owner of Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, has tried to build strength in the expanding smokeless tobacco category but has met with little success. UST, which makes Copenhagen and Skoal tobacco and also owns a wine distribution business, is the largest US maker of chewing tobacco.Altria said in a statement that it was offering to buy in cash all outstanding UST shares at $69.50 each, valuing the deal at approximately $11.7bn, including the assumption of approximately $1.3bn of debt.Shares of Altria were up 3.3 per cent at $21.65 in early trading. UST shares were 0.9 per cent higher at $68.16.An agreement between Altria and its smaller rival has long been expected by investors and Wall Street analysts.The two rivals have been unable to strike a deal in the past, largely because of disagreements over pricing, industry sources have said.Shares of UST were hit hard in the summer after it said tougher competition and higher gas prices were affecting its premium smokeless tobacco volumes. The stock had been trading just above $50 in the months before news arrived on Friday of a possible transaction, which sent the stock up to $67.55.According to Altria, the offer represents a premium of 28.9 per cent to UST’s three-month average share price of $53.90.Altria said it expected the acquisition to be accretive to adjusted diluted earnings per share within 12 months and to generate “an attractive double-digit economic return”.Combination of the two companies would lead to around $250m of annual cost saving by 2011, the company added.To finance the acquisition, Altria has changed a two-year, $7.5bn share repurchase programme to a three-year, $4bn programme. It has received $7bn in bridge financing Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and it plans to access the public-debt market to refinance a portion of its credit facilities.A combination of the US rivals could set off more consolidation in the global tobacco industry, such as the oft-rumoured takeover of Lorillard by Reynolds, industry analysts have said. Lorillard was spun off from Loews last year.US tobacco stocks underperformed the broader market by 4 per cent in the second quarter, according to Goldman, as investors expressed concerns over pricing, volumes and potential increases in regulation and taxes.Altria split its US Philip Morris division from Philip Morris International in March, and investors speculated that it would subsequently consider making an acquisition. Altria bought John Middleton, a cigar maker, late last year.For the first half of 2008, Altria’s operating income was $2.6bn, compared with UST’s $451m. If Altria had owned UST since the beginning of 2008, Altria’s first half revenue would have increased 10.3 per cent to $10.4bn, it said.
15;L;Loews Corp;2008-03-28T15:54:10Z;A good time to build exposure to the US large-caps;;"News from across the pond has been rather depressing in recent weeks. More strife is likely on Wall Street following the proposed takeover of the stricken bank Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase.The confidence of American consumers is low, and falling house prices indicate that the US property market outlook will be bleak for months to come.But contrarian equity fund managers are less
pessimistic about the state of the US economy.They say UK investors can find value in certain sectors, particularly if they focus on buying large-cap companies with a broad international reach, which are seeing a boost in exports because of the weakness of the dollar.Indeed valuation multiples between the best and worst large-cap stocks are tight, so quality stocks are “illogically” cheap by comparison, managers say. And the price to earnings ratios for large companies are more attractive than they are for US small caps.“The performance of large-cap stocks has perked up, and we are now seeing
institutions and wealthy individuals, not to mention foreign investors, reallocate some of their assets into US large-cap funds,” says Mark Donovan, manager of Collins Stewart’s $43.5bn US Equity Focus fund.“Lower-quality/higher-risk companies have been re-rated in the past four years and now are expensive. This has allowed us to accumulate positions in larger, more consistently profitable companies that are trading at attractive prices,” he adds.Donovan favours US technology, healthcare and certain consumer goods groups. His holdings include Loews, Exxon Mobil, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Lockheed Martin, IBM, Altria, Merrill Lynch, Wellpoint
and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.David Forsyth, co-manager of Martin Currie’s North America fund, takes a similar view to Donovan’s. He has opted to buy into US and Canadian large-caps that generate at least 50 per cent of their revenues from outside the US.“The bears will tell you that the US economy is in recession and it’s deep,” Forsyth says. “You’re right to be cautious. But I was out in the states a couple of weeks ago and met with the managers of a raft of companies. The balance sheets of many of them are still sound,” he says.“We still expect good earnings growth in the first quarter from these companies – perhaps even double-digit growth. The export data are still very strong and the job data are reasonable.”Three picks of Forsyth’s are: Potash, the Canadian fertiliser producer, which is trading at 17 times 2009 earnings; Assurant, a niche company that specialises in homeowner insurance; and Bucyrus, a coal mining equipment manufacturer.“We believe in coal pretty strongly and China is one of the main drivers for coal demand. There has been a huge underinvestment in capital equipment for the mines. And Bucyrus is one of only two companies that supplies equipment,” Forsyth says.In addition to blue-chips, Andy Holliman, co-manager of Threadneedle’s American fund, reports finding value in small and mid-sized comapnies de-rated in the downturn.Two stocks Holliman likes are Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer, which is now trading at twelve times forward earnings, and Republic Services, the waste management company.Advisers recommend phasing some money into the US while the market is weak.Tim Cockerill, an adviser with Rowan, suggests that investors looking for exposure consider three funds: Neptune US Opportunities, M&G American and Martin Currie North American.“These have been among the best in recent times and Martin Currie is doing particularly well at present. All three funds are flexible and not constrained by benchmarks, so they have been able to avoid the worst- performing sectors such as financials,” he says."
16;L;Loews Corp;2007-12-18T04:00:59Z;Dealmaking does little to dispel gloom;;A spate of deal-making failed to dispel the gloom on Wall Street on Monday as fears of an economic slowdown and rising prices sapped confidence from investors.The US Federal Reserve began a $20bn term loan auction in an attempt to ease liquidity bottlenecks in financial markets, but stocks extended last week’s losses amid concerns it may not be enough to end the credit squeeze.The S&P 500 closed 1.5 per cent lower at 1,445.91 points, for a fall of 4.6 per cent in the past week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 13,167.20. The Nasdaq Composite index declined 2.3 per cent to 2,574.46, a three-week low, after Internet and software stocks felt heavy selling pressure. Baidu.com, the Chinese search engine, fell 9.4 per cent to $356.Roger Volz, chief technical strategist at Swiss American Securities, said that as the end of the year approached hedge funds were “looking to push the button and lock in profits”.Shares in energy and mining groups fell after commodity prices waned but transport stocks outperformed as crude oil prices slipped. “We have been in a trading range market for five months – a tug of war between ‘recession’ and ‘no recession’,” Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said.Mergers and acquisitions returned to the agenda, led by Ingersoll-Rand, the diversified manufacturer, which agreed to acquire Trane, the heating and air conditioning systems company in a deal valued at $10.1bn. Ingersoll’s shares fell 11.4 per cent to $43.60 and Trane’s stock soared 21.6 per cent to $45.24.National Oilwell Varco agreed to buy Grant Prideco, the drill pipe supplier, for about $7.4bn in cash and stock. Grant’s shares rose 13.6 per cent to $53.91 but its buyer fell 8.6 per cent to $70.69.Bristol-Myers Squibb, down 1 per cent at $27.81, said it would sell a medical imaging unit to Avista Capital Partners, a private equity group, while Plains Exploration & Production, up 1.6 per cent at $55.17, said it would sell some oil and gas properties for $1.75bn.Loews, the US conglomerate, approved a spin-off of its interest in Lorillard, owner of the Newport and Kent brands, to form a separate publicly traded company.Loews’ shares rose 2.4 per cent to $47.94.A slowdown in merger and acquisition activity, particularly in private equity, has helped to depress the share prices of smaller companies by slashing takeover premiums. The Russell 2000 small-cap index, down 2 per cent at 745.11, has fallen 6.2 per cent this year.Although buyout firms have been hit by the tightening in credit markets, many companies remain flush with cash, as the popularity of share buybacks illustrates.Shares in Harley Davidson rose 1.5 per cent to $45.62, after the motorcycle group approved the repurchase of up to 20m shares.Investors were keeping an eye on the leading investment banks amid fears of further writedowns.Goldman Sachs, down 1 per cent at $208.63, reports quarterly results on Tuesday while Morgan Stanley, down 1.5 per cent at $49.53, releases fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow with Bear Stearns, 1.3 per cent weaker at $94.07, set to follow on Thursday.Citigroup on Monday downgraded a range of consumer finance companies, including Capital One Financial, the credit card provider. The shares fell 3.3 per cent to $45.66.“We expect consumer lenders/insurers to face further credit challenges as home prices decline 3 per cent to 5 per cent in each of the next two years, mortgage rates reset and the macro-economy slows,” said Bradley Ball, a Citi analyst.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, rebounded 16.9 per cent to $26.66 after Moody’s affirmed its AAA rating.In the industrial sector, Caterpillar fell 3 per cent to $71.16 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the heavy equipment maker. llinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, fell 6.1 per cent to $52.49 after it lowered its fourth quarter earnings guidance.Mr Volz said markets could expect further big price moves prior to Friday’s so-called quadruple witching, the quarterly expiration of contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures: “It bodes for a lot more volatility than normal.”
17;L;Loews Corp;2007-12-17T19:11:54Z;Loews moves to spin off Lorillard;;Loews, the insurance-to-hotel group controlled by the Tisch family, is to sever its 40-year ties with its $14bn tobacco business Lorillard, in a move that underlines the US conglomerate’s desire to capitalise on the slowing domestic economy.The spin-off of Lorillard – maker of Newport menthol cigarettes, the second-largest brand in the US – will enable Loews to tap into investors’ renewed appetite for tobacco companies, which are less exposed to an economic downturn.The separation of Lorillard – acquired by Loews in 1968 – is also aimed at lifting the threat of tobacco litigation from the rest of the group, improving its credit rating and reducing the cost of raising funds for acquisitions.The move by Loews suggests conglomerates and other value investors such as Warren Buffett are looking to the liquidity squeeze and deteriorating economic environment as an opportunity to reshape their portfolios and make acquisitions.Analysts said independent Lorillard – which last year had revenues of $3.8bn and profits of $826m, about a third of Loews’ total earnings – could be a target for tobacco groups looking to improve their fortunes in the slow-growing US market.Chas Manso de Zuniga, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said: ”The part that makes Lorillard attractive is …Newport, which is the leader in the menthol segment of the cigarette industry and a premium brand.”In August, Louis Camilleri, chief executive of Altria, parent of the world’s largest cigarette maker Philip Morris, said a planned split between its fast-growing international unit and its US business would provide “a potential acquisition currency” for both units. Philip Morris USA, which had $18.5bn in revenues last year and control of the dominant Marlboro brand in the US, lacks a dominant menthol cigarette brand.Altria declined to comment.Lorillard, whose stock market value is partly captured by shares in Carolina Group, a tracking stock issued by Loews, was valued at about $14bn on Monday.Jim Tisch, Loews’ chief executive, told the Financial Times the Lorillard spin-off move was driven by the desire to increase shareholder returns and improve Loews’ ability to hit the acquisition trail.“We are here to create value for our shareholders,” he said. “As a result of the transaction, there will be a dramatic improvement in our perceived risk profile”.Mr Tisch added that the Lorillard spin-off should prompt Wall Street analysts to revaluate Loews. He said the company was largely followed by tobacco analysts rather than conglomerates specialists, adding that he wanted Loews to be covered by the same analysts that follow Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.However, Moody’s, the credit rating agency, on Monday said it would retain its Loews’ rating unchanged.Under the terms of the deal, expected to be completed in the middle of next year, investors in Carolina Group will receive new shares in Lorillard.Loews will also exchange the 38 per cent stake it directly owns in Lorillard by distributing it to Loews’ shareholders in exchange for common stock.
18;L;Loews Corp;2007-10-09T15:42:18Z;Quest for clear direction: Corporate America confronts most uncertain outlook in years;;"Theodore Chandler has not had a good summer. As chief executive of LandAmerica, a large provider of property services such as insurance, Mr Chandler was on the front line when the US housing bubble burst.“It has been surprisingly bad,” he says. “Summer is typically our best season, as a lot of people buy and sell houses, but 2007 will go down as the year when the summer never came.”Mr Chandler now faces an unappealing conundrum. LandAmerica has already shed 1,800 of its 14,000 staff and closed branches. He may have to undertake more cost-cutting to cushion the blow of a deepening crisis. But that could leave the Virginia-based company too thinly spread if the housing market rebounds and business picks up.The problem is, Mr Chandler does not really know which way the wind is blowing. “It is the most perplexing market we have been in, because of the paradox of a still healthy US economy and reduced-volume real estate sector.”He is not alone. For the first time in nearly half a decade, US companies have to grapple with an economic environment that is both worrying and unpredictable. After years of chugging along at a relatively brisk and steady pace, the domestic economy has been rocked by the credit squeeze and a housing crisis, which have raised the prospect of a sharp downturn. Neither data nor experts have so far been able to indicate whether the current turmoil will have a lasting negative impact on the world’s largest economy.Even a seasoned watcher such as Robert Rubin, chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup and former Treasury secretary, recently acknowledged that the outlook was “highly uncertain”.The most likely scenario remains that – with the help of recent and future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve – the US economy will get through a couple of quarters of very subdued growth (possibly in the 1.5-2 per cent range in the last three months of this year and the first quarter of 2008) and gradually strengthen next year as the housing correction abates.But there is also an unusually large risk that the housing market woes could become even worse and depress consumer spending. That in turn would raise the chances of the US economy sliding into recession – a probability many economists currently estimate at about 25-30 per cent. “The biggest issue for business at the moment is uncertainty,” says Ian Davis, who as the head of McKinsey, the management consultancy, is in constant touch with corporate leaders. “Most businesses don’t know what is going to happen and that makes things very difficult.”The strategies adopted by companies to deal with these uncertain times are likely to separate the corporate winners from the losers of the next phase of the business cycle. So should companies ramp up investment and employment levels in the hope of a quick rebound? Or should they adopt a defensive stance, cutting expenditure (including jobs) in anticipation of tougher times ahead?These questions have been reverberating through boardrooms across America for the past few weeks but have few answers. When the Business Roundtable asked its members – some 120 of the largest US corporations – whether they were planning to hire more workers in the next six months, it found them split. One third of the companies polled said they wanted to hire more, while just over one quarter said they would cut staff.Similarly, when quizzed about future plans for capital expenditure, half of the executives say they would leave that spending unchanged – a response that underlines their inability to read the economic tea leaves.In the words of Alan Mulally, the chief executive of Ford, a company that is counting on robust US growth to pull it out of a financial and operational crisis: “This is a very ambiguous time right now, because the economy is still growing …but the credit market is tightening [and] the overhang on the homes, new home construction – those are real issues.”Policymakers face similar dilemmas, amplified by the fact that the latest economic data, which lag the real economy by several weeks, have been mixed. Consumer spending seems to be holding up well, though income growth has slowed. Recent automotive sales were not bad and durable goods orders suggest the corporate sector is neither booming nor throwing in the towel. The August jobs report at first appeared to point to a weakening labour market. But last Friday’s sharp upward revision of the August data, coupled with positive figures for September, showed that the labour market had withstood the initial impact of the credit squeeze well.The lack of a clear picture is not surprising. It is likely to take several months before the impact of the credit squeeze shows up in the macroeconomic data. Companies, unfortunately, cannot wait that long and, out of the cacophony of conflicting evidence, a number of distinct corporate strategies are beginning to emerge.One is to carry on with business plans regardless of the perilous economic situation. Companies that have taken this route tend to be concentrated among utilities and other regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals and tobacco whose profits are less exposed to the vagaries of economic cycles.Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, the North-Carolina-based utility, believes this strategy is underpinned by the role traditionally played by companies such as his. “We have different dynamics from the rest of the economy,” he says. “We provide vital infrastructure to the country. The US has an ageing infrastructure and we need to upgrade it regardless of the economic or business cycle.”To prove the point, Duke recently boosted its planned capital expenditure for the next five years to $22.5bn (£11bn, €16bn). Last month, the New Jersey-based NRG meanwhile submitted the first application in nearly three decades to build nuclear reactors in the US – a project that could cost the equivalent of one-third of the company’s $10bn market capital.But the expansionary plans of Duke and NRG are simply not suitable for the many companies that have been more directly affected by the property and credit crisis. For housebuilders, carmakers, banks and, to a lesser extent, retailers, the real issue is how to scale back costs and production just enough to weather the storm but not too much to hamper a future recovery. At Ford, for example, Mr Mulally has instituted quarterly meetings to review production levels and quickly adjust the company’s vehicle output to changes in demand. “You immediately tailor your production to what [the] real demand is,” he explains.Wall Street has taken more drastic measures. The current season of quarterly earnings reports from investment banks has been a pretty bloody affair, with blue chips such as Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers announcing the closure of business units and hundreds of job losses.Retailers, which rely more than most on the financial health of Middle America, have been adopting a more cautious approach in making their inventory decisions for the remainder of the year and the crucial holiday shopping season. Some, such as Target, the fourth-largest US retailer, and Lowe’s, the second-biggest home improvement chain, have already issued profit warnings. The National Retail Federation is predicting a 4 per cent increase in retail store spending in November and December, the lowest growth for five years.Ken Hicks, president of JCPenney, the department store chain, sums up the sector’s worries thus: “I don’t think anybody knows for sure exactly what the consumer is going to do this fall …Macroeconomic issues are something that we can’t control.”Economists share Mr Hicks’ sense of powerlessness. Over the past few years, US consumer spending has proven remarkably resilient to a variety of shocks, including the housing downturn. With the stock market up and income growth relatively good over the past year, it is possible that spending will not slow dramatically, especially if unemployment experiences only a gentle upward drift from the current low levels.But the threat that the housing woes could spill over into other areas of the economy, precipitating a crisis in consumer confidence, looms large. House prices are probably now falling year-on-year (although different measures tell somewhat differing stories) and home equity withdrawal has become substantially more difficult as a result of the near-seizing up of the mortgage market. The recovery in the equity market helps by counterbalancing the loss of housing wealth, but stocks could just as easily retreat if consumption and the economy soften.That is why many experts believe the winners, or even survivors, of the tectonic shift in macroeconomic conditions will be the companies that are less dependent on the slowing US domestic economy. The stock market, for one, seems to agree: the latest rally in the Dow Jones industrial average has been led by the likes of Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Intel – multinationals that derive most of their sales from outside North America. The slide in the dollar has sharpened the competitive edge of US-based international companies by boosting export volumes and the value of overseas profits.“The increase in exports has created a lot of economic activity,” says Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, the delivery group whose performance is one of the most accurate gauges of global economic fluctuations. “We don’t just carry things from China and Europe into the US; we are carrying stuff from the US abroad too.”Although FedEx recently cut its profit forecast, citing US economic woes, Mr Smith says a company that moves some 6m packages around the world every day draws its strength from global growth. “We benefit from the continued integration of the global economy,” he says. “The fortunes of large companies these days transcend those of any single economy.”This is indeed the hope not only of the big multi­nationals but also many other companies that have made globalisation their business. Yet the assumption behind this strategy – a “decoupling” that enables the global economy to grow at a healthy clip despite a US slowdown – has not been tested by events and could yet prove a pipe dream.There is, however, a pocket of the US economy that is resolutely not global but could still benefit from the darkening economic clouds. Known as “value investors” or, less politely, “vultures”, financiers such as Warren Buffett and Wilbur Ross could take advantage of the unsettled conditions to buy troubled assets at bargain prices.“It is not just the growth in the economy that matters but also the price at which you can buy something,” says Jim Tisch, who heads Loews, the hotels-to-pipelines group assembled by buying undervalued US companies. “If everybody moves to where the growth is, buying low-growth assets in the US could be a good opportunity.”A “low-growth opportunity”, indeed. As corporate America stares, undecided, at the economic junction ahead, it will have to bear agonisingly in mind the risks inherent in embarking on the wrong road.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall"
19;L;Loews Corp;2007-06-29T18:01:17Z;A gruff, tough dealer;;When Jimmy Cayne, chief executive of Wall Street brokerage Bear Stearns, sat down to interview a former Enron trader for a job a few years ago he began with a blunt question.“So, was everyone at Enron a crook?” the gruff, cigar-chomping Mr Cayne inquired, according to an anecdote shared at a recent Bear Stearns analyst conference.It was the kind of approach for which the 73-year-old Mr Cayne is well known. Some would call it refreshingly direct. Others might call it thuggish.A similar debate coursed through Wall Street this week as two of Bear’s proprietary hedge funds tottered on the edge of collapse after making bad bets on the subprime mortgage market.Some executives at Wall Street banks that lent the funds billions were furious that Bear was slow to put any of its own money at risk to back up the funds. Others said it came as little surprise.It was Mr Cayne, after all, who famously refused to participate in a Wall Street bail-out of failing hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, infuriating fellow chief executives and nearly sparking a physical attack from the hulking David Komansky, then head of Merrill Lynch.“This really should not have surprised anyone,” says one senior Wall Street executive who was in the room at the New York Federal Reserve bank in Lower Manhattan in 1998 when Mr Cayne said he would not put in a nickel of Bear’s money to help bail out LTCM. “This was Jimmy being Jimmy. And in the end they stepped up,” in the current hedge fund meltdown.Mr Cayne was very angry and took the problems personally. Bear ultimately agreed to extend $3.2bn in fully secured credit to one of the two funds. Bear’s exposure has since been reduced to $1.6bn as the fund has sold assets. Bear did nothing to back up the second fund. So in the end, Bear assumed little risk.While other Wall Street banks have made big moves into proprietary trading and private equity and dramatically increased their presence outside the US, Bear has largely remained tied to its roots as a domestic bond house and prime broker to hedge funds.That melds with Mr Cayne’s development as a champion card player. In his younger days, Mr Cayne specialised in poker, but as he aged he switched to bridge, a game that rewards the shrewd tactician over the swashbuckling gambler. “He has a very sophisticated mind for detail and for playing the percentages and that’s what bridge is all about,” says Melvyn Weiss, a securities lawyer and sometime golf partner of Mr Cayne. “And that has helped turn him into a legendary Wall Street figure.”Mr Cayne was born in Evanston, Illinois, in 1934. He attended Purdue University but never received a degree. He worked as a scrap iron salesman before moving to New York in the 1960s as a salesman at Lebenthal, the municipal bond dealer.He was interviewed for a job at Bear in 1969, meeting Alan “Ace” Greenberg, a star stock trader who would become chairman and chief executive when Bear went public in 1985.During the interview, Mr Greenberg asked Mr Cayne about his hobbies and he told him he played bridge. Mr Greenberg, himself a competitive bridge player, had found a kindred spirit. Mr Cayne brought just one big client with him, Laurence Tisch, co-founder of Loews and also an avid bridge player.But his reputation within the bank soared in the 1970s when he convinced senior executives to make a market in bonds issued by New York City, then in the midst of a brutal financial crisis. New York recovered and Mr Cayne’s strategy paid off handsomely for Bear. He quickly rose through the ranks, serving as Mr Greenberg’s trusted lieutenant.Mr Cayne handled much of the day-to-day management while Mr Greenberg continued to trade for top clients and serve as the charismatic public face of the bank. Mr Cayne took over as chief executive in 1993 and as chairman in 2001, all the while remaining a world-class bridge player who has now piled up 12 national tournament championships.Friends say he has used his bridge skills to help Bear navigate down markets and multiple regulatory entanglements, including an agreement last year to pay $250m to settle charges that the bank aided improper mutual-fund trading.“He never gets tired no matter how much he plays,” says Charles Burger, a long-time friend and former bridge partner. “He is quietly intense. And he is afraid of no one.”But while widely known as indefatigable, Mr Cayne is something of a rarity in the world of Wall Street workaholics. He is typically out of the office by five, if not before, often retreating to his apartment on Park Avenue, where he lives with his wife, Patricia, a neurologist and tournament bridge player. In the evenings Mr Cayne often plays bridge online for several hours. He continues to puff away on cigars and listen to music in his office in an era where indoor smoking is all but unheard of.Like its chief executive, Bear, with a market value of just under $21bn, remains something of an anachronism when compared to its larger and more diversified rivals. It has long been viewed as a potential acquisition candidate.Mr Cayne himself shopped the bank around to big European groups in 2000 when Bear’s shares and profits were lagging. He is known to have talked to at least one US investment bank about a deal. But he found no one willing to pay the four-times-book-value premium he wanted.And while it has delivered smaller profits than rivals such as Goldman Sachs, Bear has thrived over the past five years, its shares rising 135 per cent. That increase has driven the value of Mr Cayne’s stake in Bear – which is famous for handsome payments to executives – to nearly $1bn.However, in the wake of the hedge fund meltdown and continued turmoil in the market for mortgage-backed securities, a critical business for Bear, questions are once again being raised about the bank’s ability to remain independent.The trouble with that theory is that Mr Cayne would have to want to sell. He seems less inclined than ever to do so. He has also shown no intention of stepping aside and leaving decisions about Bear’s future to one of its two co-presidents.“Frankly, I don’t know what he would do if he did retire,” says Mr Burger. “The only other things he really does are play golf and play bridge and he does plenty of both while still going to work everyday.”
20;L;Loews Corp;2007-06-04T20:29:51Z;Deals, energy push S&P 500 to record close;;Wall Street rallied late yesterday, and the main benchmarks extended their winning streak to six straight days. Upgrades for Wal-Mart boosted bluechips, while deals and energy stocks helped the S&P 500 fashion another record close.In spite of robust increases since late March, analysts were divided over the outlook for equities this summer against a backdrop of higher bond yields.Investors largely took a sharp slide in Chinese stocks in their stride. Energy stocks were buoyed by higher oil prices, and led gains among the main industry groups in the S&P 500 index.The S&P rose 0.2 per cent to a record close at 1,539.18. The benchmark has yet to test its March 2000 intra-day peak of 1552.87.Utilities, however, extended their recent bout of weakness as bond yields remained near highs last seen in August. Higher oil prices and weaker customer traffic at Continental Airlines in May also weighed upon that sector. The American Stock Exchange airline index fell 2.75 per cent, with Continental down 6.1 per cent at $37.45. UAL Corp lost 6.6 per cent to close at $36.21.Technology stocks rose and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent firmer at 2,618.29.Apple rose 2.5 per cent to $121.33, after the company announced the iPhone would be available on June 29.Blue chips reversed weakness earlier in the day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to a record close at 13,676.32.The outlook for sections of the US market this year was tweaked by Citigroup yesterday, as it announced new year-end targets for benchmarks and lifted its forecasts for the Dow to 14,400 from 14,000 and for the S&P 400 index of medium-sized companies to 955 from 905.The S&P 400 rose 0.45 per cent to a record close of 925.90 yesterday, for a rise of 15.1 per cent this year, a performance that has outpaced other US benchmarks.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “The US equity market has performed better than most investors expected heading into the year, with mid-caps showing the most powerful returns – driven in part by a scaling-up of market cap by investors due to liquidity requirements but also due to mergers and acquisitions activity.”The bank left its S&P 500 target for 2007 unchanged at 1,600, and also reiterated a target of 888 for the Russell 2000 small-companies index.Other analysts cautioned that stocks might face a testing period later this year.“Stocks have been rising steadily since March, fuelling a wealth effect that has managed to offset the effects of gasoline and housing,” said William O’Donnell, bond strategist at UBS. Against the backdrop of rising bond yields, the current environment “is reminiscent of the conditions in 1987 before the stock market crash”.Deal activity yesterday was led by the sale of a 25 per cent stake in Palm for $325m to Elevation Partners, a $1.9bn private equity partnership. Shares in Palm rose 9.2 per cent to $17.57.Shares in Dominion Resources gained 0.3 per cent to $87.87 after the company sold much of its gas and oil exploration operations for $6.5bn. Shares in XTO rose 5.6 per cent to $61.61 after the natural gas producer said it would pay about $2.5bn for some of Dominion’s assets. Shares in Loews rose 2.6 per cent to $52.35 after the conglomerate agreed to pay about $4.03bn for Dominion’s gas assets.A buy-out of Avaya, the telecoms equipment maker, was reported to be close to fruition. Shares were up 4 per cent at $16.7 from a low of $13.46 last week, as speculation of a deal intensified.Digene jumped 26.9 per cent to $56.82 after Qiagen said it would buy the diagnostic healthcare company for $1.6bn in cash and stock. Qiagen fell 9.8 per cent to $15.58.Investors kept a close watch on Dow Jones. The stock closed at $61.20 last week, above the $60-a-share offer made in April by News Corp. The Bancroft family, which controls voting power in the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, met Rupert Murdoch yesterday to discuss the $5bn bid and the issue of editorial independence.Shares in Dow Jones fell 1.7 per cent to $60.16, while News Corp lost 0.5 per cent to close at $24.10 yesterday.After announcing a $15bn stock buy-back programme last Friday, Wal-Mart remained in the news on Monday. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan both upgraded the retailer to “overweight” and its shares gained 3.5 per cent to $51.21.In earnings, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts reported a larger first-quarter loss as the company continued its turn-round strategy. Shares fell 6.7 per cent to $8.09.
21;L;Loews Corp;2007-06-04T14:55:24Z;Dominion to sell gas and oil interests;;"Dominion Resources, the Virginia-based gas and electricity company, has agreed to sell most of its US natural gas and oil exploration and production operations to two energy companies, Loews and XTO Energy, for $6.5bn.Loews will buy Dominion’s operations in the Permian Basin, Michigan and Alabama, including estimated reserves of about 2.5 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent, for $4.03bn, while XTO said it would take Dominion’s operations in the Rocky Mountains, Gulf Coast, San Juan Basin and South Louisiana, which includes 1 Tcfe in reserves, roughly 95 per cent of which is natural gas, for $2.5bn.The sales represent about 85 per cent of Dominion’s reserves.“We expect the new Dominion to produce 2008 operating earnings of $6 or more per share, and we are confident that we can achieve long-term average annual earnings per share growth of at least 4 per cent to 6 per cent thereafter,” said Thomas Farrell, chief executive and chairman of Dominion. “We will provide detailed 2008 operating earnings guidance in January.”The deal is Loews’ first move into the energy exploration and production business.”We have a favourable long-term view of natural gas pricing in the US and believe natural gas will increasingly be the fuel of choice in the future,” said James Tisch, chief executive of Loews.Loews is a diversified financial corporation which runs tobacco company Lorrillard, maker of Newport and Kent cigarettes; CNA Financial Corporation, the casualty insurance company; luxury lodgings in Loews Hotels; and watch and clockmaker Bulova.XTO is an energy exploration, production and marketing company based in Forth Worth, Texas.Alongside the acquisition from Dominion, XTO said it intended to review its portfolio of oil and gas reserves, for possible inclusion in a master limited partnership with an initial capitalisation of more than $500m. A master limited partnership is a limited partnership that is publicly traded. Limited partnerships can provide certain tax benefits, such as avoiding corporate income tax, while being publicly traded provides liquidity and improves cash flow.XTO said it was increasing production growth guidance this year to 15 per cent as a result of the deal, up from 10 per cent. XTO is targeting production growth of 15 per cent next year as well.Both sales are expected to close in August.Dominion is also looking to sell its operations in Oklahoma, with over 2 Tcfe in reserves, by the end of this year.JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers and Juniper Advisory are providing financial advice to Dominion on the sales. BakerBotts and McGuireWoods are the company’s legal advisers.Dominion shares rose 53 cents or 0.6 per cent to $88.17. Loews shares rose 33 cents or 0.65 per cent to $51.35. XTO shares rose $3.45 or 5.91 per cent to $61.82."
22;L;Loews Corp;2007-05-18T17:25:40Z;Whitney Tilson: Not-to-be-missed tips for value hunters;;"My recent column detailing the 10 investment traps I’ve identified prompted several readers to ask if I have a comparable list of the opposite – types of opportunities that are likely to lead to good investment outcomes.I do, and happily it’s a bit longer than the list of traps. Given that the first step to successful investing is knowing which ponds to fish in, here are the 15 most common types of value opportunities I have been able to capitalise on in my investing career:● Out-of-favour blue chips. Even the greatest companies encounter problems or otherwise fall out of favour. We bought McDonald’s a few years ago when it fell below $13, believing in its assets and that it could return to its former glory through better management. The shares now trade above $50.● Turnrounds of broken businesses. It’s difficult to fix a truly broken business, but when it happens, the returns can be extraordinary. One of my best investments ever was CKE Restaurants, which engineered a spectacular turnround at Hardee’s due to its new Thickburger menu. The shares, as low as $3 in 2003, are now above $20.● Cyclicals at the bottom of the cycle. Success here usually involves correctly anticipating when a cyclical industry will rebound, though precision is not necessary as long as the company has a strong enough balance sheet to weather the tough times.● Distressed industries. Our buying auto-systems maker Lear last year below $20 when its prospects were considered most bleak is a successful example of buying a good company in a distressed industry. Its shares have more than doubled off their lows.● Overlooked small-caps. Among the 5,000 or so publicly traded US stocks that have no analyst coverage are fine businesses that are cheap because no one is paying attention to them or the stocks are thinly traded. A good example we’ve owned for years is Weyco Group, which makes Florsheim shoes.● Fallen growth angels. When high-growth companies slow down, growth and momentum junkies often sell indiscriminately, which can create great opportunities for value investors. Just be careful not to anchor on the stock’s previous price or earnings multiple, which are no longer relevant.● Growth at a reasonable price. These are also high-quality growth businesses, but the stocks haven’t fallen. They may not appear cheap on traditional valuation metrics, but can be excellent investments if the high growth can be maintained. Starbucks over the years has been a great example.● Piggybacking on activism. There are select opportunities to invest alongside experienced activist investors pushing for prudent change. One of our most profitable investments over the past two years, for example, was following Pershing Square and Trian Group into Wendy’s International, which has more than doubled.● Spin-offs. Many significant stock-price inefficiencies can occur when a company is spun off. A recent example we currently own is Mueller Water, which operates largely under Wall Street’s radar and is uniquely positioned to benefit from needed investment in US water-system infrastructure.● Post-bankruptcies. There are also many reasons why companies emerging from bankruptcy can be inefficiently priced, not the least of which is investors’ reticence to back a recent loser. We’ve almost tripled our money in less than two years owning shoe retailer Footstar, which came out of bankruptcy with a solid balance sheet and plan for reviving itself.● Let someone else do the investing. Certain public companies, including Berkshire Hathaway (which we own), Loews, Leucadia National, Alleghany and White Mountains Insurance are structured as investment vehicles for proven value investors. At a reasonable price, it can pay to let these investors do the heavy lifting for you.● Free/mispriced option. In these situations, one or more ongoing businesses justifies the current market price and an investor gets a valuable option – in the form of a new market opportunity or turnround of a floundering business – for almost nothing. In Wendy’s, we thought the value of its Tim Hortons restaurant franchise was worth the entire stock price two years ago, so we were getting the Wendy’s brand restaurant and franchising business for free.● Declining cash cow. At the right price – and if management wisely milks the business and allocates capital – the stock of a declining business can be a great investment. The shares of Deluxe, the leading check printer that many investors had abandoned, have tripled over the past year thanks to cost cutting under a new chief executive.● Oddball companies. Certain companies have revolutionary business models that are poorly understood, resulting in cheap stock prices. Classic examples are Southwest Airlines, Dell and Kinder Morgan.● Discount to the sum of the parts. Many companies lend themselves to valuing their different pieces and can be a great buy if the whole is trading at
a sufficient discount to the pieces. We own Tyco because we think the three companies that will emerge from it in the next few months are worth more than $40, versus today’s share price below $33.Whitney Tilson is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress. feedback@tilsonfunds.com"
23;L;Loews Corp;2006-07-06T16:44:01Z;$145bn tobacco ruling goes up in smoke;;The tobacco industry won a decisive legal victory on Thursday when Florida’s highest court threw out a $145bn damage award, the largest in US history, in a move that substantially reduces the risk of crippling litigation against cigarette makers.The decision by Florida’s Supreme Court to rule against punitive damages that could have bankrupted the tobacco industry is expected to pave the way for the long-awaited spin off of the food group Kraft from Altria, the cigarette maker.The court said the damage award was “clearly excessive” and would “result in an unlawful crippling of the defendant companies,” which included Altria’s Philip Morris USA, RJ Reynolds Tobacco and Loews Corp’s Lorillard Tobacco.The outcome of the so-called “Engle” case is also likely to mark the end of the era of sprawling class actions that have threatened the financial stability of tobacco companies for more than a decade.Although other lawsuits are still outstanding, including a Department of Justice’s civil racketeering case against the industry, legal experts believe that future class actions seeking huge damages would have little chance of succeeding.“It is increasingly clear that the US tobacco industry is in its strongest overall legal position since the 1994 emergence of the state [litigation],” wrote David Adelman, Morgan Stanley analyst, in a report issued before Thursday’s ruling.However, the Florida ruling will still allow the 700,000 smokers in the Florida class to go ahead with individual cases against the tobacco companies within 12 months, and to use some of the favourable rulings from the previous verdict to help them win their cases.Nevertheless, news that the $145bn damage claim had been thrown out was welcomed by investors, partly because it came just before a summer recess that could have prolonged the uncertainty hanging over the tobacco industry.Shares in Altria rose more than 7 per cent, while shares in both Reynolds American, RJ Reynolds’ parent group, and Carolina group, the tracking stock for Lorillard Tobacco, hit record highs in intra-day trading.The Engle case - filed more than a decade ago and originally led by the pediatrician Howard Engle - was the first class-action brought by smokers to go to trial.Theoretically, Thursday’s ruling could be appealed to the US Supreme Court, but legal experts said it was virtually certain that such an appeal would not succeed.Most analysts believe that the improving legal landscape will prompt Altria to quickly spin off its 87.6 per cent stake in Kraft - a move that will streamline the parent company’s business and free Kraft from a large share overhang.Altria has said the break-up hinges on continuing improvements in the “entire litigation environment”, which also includes the DoJ case and a lawsuit in New York.
24;L;Loews Corp;2005-06-08T23:23:40Z;Tobacco debate inflamed by cut in penalties;;The US Justice Department's decision to reduce radically the penalties it was seeking in a landmark case against tobacco companies from an expected $130bn (£71bn) to $10bn prompted the federal judge overseeing the case to question the government's motives on Wednesday.Gladys Kessler, a US district judge, said of the change: “Perhaps there are some additional influences being brought to bear on the government's position in this case.”This week an attorney for the Justice Department, Stephen Brody, surprised both tobacco company executives and anti-tobacco lobbyists when he called for tobacco companies to pay $10bn an “initial request” over the next five years to fund an anti-smoking campaign. Michael Fiore, a government witness and medical professor, had suggested the companies pay $130bn over 25 years in an earlier phase of the trial.The decision prompted outrage among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Edward Kennedy and others called on the inspector-general to investigate the Justice Department's request and accused the Bush administration of pandering to the powerful tobacco lobby.The long-running case, filed in 1999, centres on the government's allegation that the leading tobacco companies, including Altria's Philip Morris, Loews's Lorillard Tobacco, and Reynolds, among others, conspired to promote smoking and misled the public on its dangers. Ted Wells, an attorney for Philip Morris, maintained yesterday that the government's proposed sanction whether it cost the industry $10bn or $130bn was “a fatally flawed programme”.The Justice Department's case was dealt a severe blow in April when a federal appeals court declined to reconsider a ruling that prevented the government from seeking $280bn in past profits from cigarette makers.The department on Wednesday night said: “The government's suggested cessation programme is only an initial requirement…the court can extend and expand the programme to exceed the $10bn/five-year programme proposed in order to prevent and restrain the continuation of fraudulent activities by the tobacco companies.”
25;L;Loews Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
