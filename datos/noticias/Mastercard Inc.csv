0;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:26:46+0000;Gates Foundation and Wellcome set up $125m coronavirus drug fund;Research foundations join forces with Mastercard-backed charity to develop treatments;The world’s two largest medical research foundations, Wellcome and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Mastercard’s Impact Fund charity are jointly committing $125m in “seed funding” to develop treatments for coronavirus disease.The Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, as they have called it, will be a catalyst to draw in much more money for coronavirus drug development, said Jeremy Farrar, Wellcome director. He hopes other donors will see it as an attractive vehicle to support research. He is on the board of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, an independent health monitoring body, which estimated on Monday that a total of $1.5bn will be required for research and development of a portfolio of four Covid-19 treatments. “We have provided a place for others to join us and we hope many will,” Sir Jeremy said.UK-based Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, established by the billionaire Microsoft founder and his wife, are committing $50m each to the Covid-19 Accelerator. Mastercard, the global payments company, is putting in $25m. The world currently has no broad-spectrum antivirals available in case a dangerous new disease such as Covid-19 emerges. Nor are there any licensed treatments specifically for coronavirus infections. The accelerator aims to develop both.Some pharmaceutical companies are beginning Covid-19 research, although no estimate is available for how much they are spending. Most advanced may be Gilead of the US, whose antiviral remdesivir — originally developed to treat Ebola — is undergoing a clinical trial among Covid-19 patients in China. Preliminary results are expected later this month or in April.The new accelerator will work with the World Health Organisation, governments and the private sector. It aims to provide “fast and flexible funding” at all stages of development, from research to manufacturing and scale-up.Thousands of existing compounds and drugs approved for other purposes will be screened for any activity against Covid-19, while new ones — including antibodies — are developed. Those that look particularly promising will then commercialised with an industry partner, working with regulators to speed up the pathway to market. Products approved for other diseases or with existing clinical data could be approved for Covid-19 within a year. Others are bound to take longer.“Science is moving at a phenomenal pace against Covid-19, but to get ahead of this epidemic we need greater investment and to ensure research co-ordination,” Sir Jeremy said. “The Therapeutics Accelerator will allow us to do this for potential treatments with support for research, development, assessment, and manufacturing.”Its mission for drugs will be similar to that of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which develops vaccines against emerging diseases, he added. But Sir Jeremy warned against expecting too much too soon, given researchers’ uninspiring record of developing therapeutics for acute viral infections. “Although we have some drugs for flu, they are not hugely effective,” he said.Subscribers can use myFT to follow the latest ‘coronavirus’ coverage

For incoming chief executive Michael Miebach, that may prove to be too much of a good thing.New bosses who turn round struggling companies and preside over surging stock prices are adored by shareholders and the media alike. Think Satya Nadella and Microsoft. Upsides are harder to come by when the company you inherit is already a well-oiled machine with a virtual duopoly over the global payment processing market. There are no easy wins left.Under Ajay Banga, Mastercard’s annual revenue has more than tripled since 2010 to reach $16.9bn. The shares have returned more than 1,600 per cent over the period and set a new all-time high last week. The market worth, at $308bn, exceeds Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined. At 36 times forward earnings, the stock boasts a richer valuation than big tech names such as Apple and Facebook. Mr Miebach, who takes over next year, should be a capable steward. While Mr Banga rightly gets much of the credit for Mastercard’s success, Mr Miebach should not be left out.Mastercard may be best known as a credit card payment processing service provider, but its future lies in non-card transactions. As chief product officer, Mr Miebach has been instrumental in expanding the company’s role in non-card payment services. He led the acquisition of Vocalink and the real-time payments unit of Denmark-based Nets.* Both acquisitions are aimed at providing merchant and bank partners with technology that will allow more streamlined payment capability.The result: credit cards now account for less than half of revenue while services account for more than a quarter. Mr Miebach’s task will be to continue diversifying. At the same time, he must protect a strong market position that technology could easily disrupt.*Article has been amended to clarify that Mastercard is buying a unit of Nets.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

2;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-02-25T14:59:20Z;Mastercard announces Michael Miebach will be new chief;Ajay Banga to step aside at the start of 2021 and move into executive chairman role;Ajay Banga, who led Mastercard during nearly a decade of double-digit annual revenue growth and a soaring stock price, will step aside as the payments company’s chief executive at the start of 2021 and move into the role of executive chairman.The group’s chief product officer, Michael Miebach, will become chief on January 1, the same day incumbent chairman Richard Haythornthwaite will also step down from his position.Since Mr Banga’s appointment as chief in 2010, Mastercard’s revenue has grown from $5.5bn to $16.9bn, and its shares have returned more than 1,600 per cent, easily outperforming rival Visa. The S&P 500 returned 280 per cent over the same period.“The numbers speak for themselves,” KBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote in a note to clients. “The news is surprising and bittersweet given the admirable job Mr Banga has done leading the company over the past 10-plus years.”As chief, Mr Banga oversaw Mastercard’s transition from a credit card company to a more diversified payments group, with strength in debit and prepaid cards, security and data services, and business-to-business payments. Credit cards now account for less than half of revenue, and services account for more than a quarter. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, he emphasised that the secular transition from cash to electronic payments was only enough to drive revenue growth to 7 per cent to 8 per cent. Reaching the 13 per cent growth it averaged over the past 10 years required the addition of new products and businesses.Mr Banga, a longtime advocate for global financial inclusion, had argued that global private networks were a “better, faster, cheaper” way to increase the security and breadth of electronic payments, at a time when several countries have moved towards nationalising their networks. He has also been an outspoken critic of bitcoin and other virtual currencies. He told the FT last year that Mastercard opted to leave the consortium sponsoring Facebook’s Libra currency because he could not make sense of the business model or extract hard commitments from key stakeholders about data privacy and security.On Monday, Mastercard cut its 2020 financial outlook, citing the impact of the coronavirus on cross-border travel and commerce.As part of the leadership transition, Mr Miebach, a 10-year Mastercard veteran, will become president of the group on March 1 and oversee the sales, marketing products and technology organisations, the company said in a statement on Tuesday morning. Mr Miebach held leadership positions in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and in the US in payments, banking services and technology.“Mr Miebach has been instrumental in driving MA’s multi-rail [diversification] strategy,” Mr Sakhrani wrote. “We believe the company is in good hands with this transition.”Shares were down about 1 per cent in early trading on Tuesday, with investors processing the earnings downgrade delivered after Monday’s closing bell. 
3;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-02-25T00:12:26Z;Mastercard cuts revenue outlook on coronavirus impact;Shares tumble more than 7 per cent form previous day’s close;Mastercard has cut its financial outlook, citing the impact of the coronavirus on cross-border travel and commerce.The payments company now expects its first-quarter revenues to grow 9 to 10 per cent, compared with a year ago, roughly 2 to 3 percentage points lower than the company forecast when it reported 2019 earnings a month ago.The company expects full-year revenue growth to be at the “low end” of its previous outlook, which called for revenue growth in the low teens, but noted that “there are many unknowns as to the duration and severity of the situation.”“The fundamentals of our business remain strong . . . However, cross-border travel, and to a lesser extent cross-border ecommerce growth, is being impacted by the coronavirus,” the company said in a statement.Mastercard does not have a payments business in mainland China, which operates a national payments network, though the company has partnered with Chinese payment leaders Tencent and Ant Financial to let Chinese to use the Mastercard network when travelling abroad.Mastercard’s revenue, adjusting for currency effects, grew 17 per cent last year. The company charges a fee of a fraction of a per cent of each transaction completed over its network. The fee is significantly higher for international transactions.Mastercard’s warning on the virus impact follows those of other major companies. A week ago, Apple said it would miss its first quarter revenue targets. United Airlines withdrew its profit targets altogether on Monday.Mastercard shares, which fell 4.4 per cent on Monday, dropped another 2.7 per cent in after-hours trading in the wake of the announcement.
4;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-02-11T13:56:33Z;Mastercard wins approval to enter Chinese payments market;Securing access for US card companies was a provision of Trump’s US-China trade deal;Mastercard has secured Chinese government approval to enter the country’s electronic payment services market — 17 years after the sector was theoretically first opened to foreign investors.In a statement on Tuesday evening, China’s central bank and banking regulator said the US card company’s application to launch a joint venture with a local company had been approved. Securing long-delayed China market access for Mastercard, Visa and American Express was a key objective for Trump administration officials during the two countries’ “phase one” trade talks, which resulted in a preliminary trade agreement last month. Accelerating approvals for US card companies was one of the provisions of the 90-page agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, China said it would formally rule on US card companies’ applications within one month of their submission. Mastercard, Visa and American Express are cited specifically in the text of the agreement. American executives had long complained that the People’s Bank of China, the central bank, would simply refuse to accept their applications to begin operations in the country. In 2012, the World Trade Organization ruled in favour of a US suit challenging China’s de facto ban on foreign payment providers, saying the market should have been opened when the country acceded to the WTO in December 2001. Beijing, however, ignored the ruling. Early last year the Financial Times reported that the central bank had refused to acknowledge applications submitted by Mastercard and Visa more than a year previously. Visa is still waiting for a ruling on its application. But Chinese financial regulators recently confirmed that they were reviewing an application by American Express, which is likely to be approved. It its statement on Tuesday evening, the PBoC said it would be “open, fair and impartial” as it continues to open the bank card market. In private, Chinese officials say they were prepared to grant US card companies market access in late 2017 but US president Donald Trump’s move to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018 had made it politically impossible for Beijing to do so. Most of the US tariffs — and counter-tariffs imposed by Beijing — remain in place pending a new round of negotiations expected later this year or in 2021. But earlier China’s finance ministry said earlier this month it was halving the rates of some of its counter-tariffs, as agreed in last month’s deal. Over the almost two decades that foreign card companies have waited to enter the Chinese market, the competitive landscape of the country’s electronic payment sector has changed drastically. The groups will face an entrenched state-owned monopoly, China Unionpay, that was established after China’s WTO entry.Credit and debit cards also now account for less than 15 per cent of all online payments. The sector is instead dominated by e-wallet services provided by tech companies Alibaba and WeChat, which hold more than 60 per cent of the market. 
5;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-02-03T04:00:28Z;Mastercard chief speaks out against nationalism and Facebook;Ajay Banga says tech giant’s Libra project morphed: ‘I’m like, this doesn’t sound right’;"Few companies have more to gain from the march of globalisation and digitisation than Mastercard. The payment network’s strength is its worldwide reach, and its growth is driven by the move from cash to electronic transactions.So chief executive Ajay Banga is unequivocal about governments’ attempts to break the global payments system into national fiefdoms.“The economic cost of building siloed systems in a world where citizens travel globally is really stupid, and where crime travels globally is even more stupid, and where technology is completely global is even three times more stupid,” he says, with emphasis on each “stupid”.Mr Banga sees more governments edging towards nationalisation of consumer payments systems, and fears that consumers, wary of their privacy, could shift back towards cash.Right now, though, Mastercard is in a strong position. Mr Banga, 60, says the company can hit 7-8 per cent revenue growth every year, “if [we] just fog the mirror and don’t make thousands of mistakes”. Mastercard takes a fraction of a percentage of every transaction on its network, and also sells services to banks and merchants.Last week Mastercard reported 2019 revenue of $17bn, more than triple the level of a decade ago, when Mr Banga took the helm. Profit has grown faster still, and the company’s share price has risen from $20 to $320 under his tenure.Globally, payments on credit and debit cards have quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to The Nilson Report, a data provider.Mr Banga, who previously ran Citigroup’s operations in Asia, does not take growth for granted. “Global companies [could] get disallowed from working in a bunch of big markets around the world because these markets begin to say ‘I don’t want you around’. It gets exacerbated in days of populism and nationalism that we’re going through.”In recent years, several countries from Russia to Mr Banga’s native India, have either developed national payments networks or lent government support to local payment groups. China has a fully nationalised payments network.It is an established phenomenon, says Mr Banga. “This idea of finding a way to have national control on certain kinds of payments is not new — it’s a fantasy that’s been going on for a long time.” He notes that France, Australia, Brazil and Mexico have all tried to build national payments networks, with limited success.The problem with local networks is threefold, he argues. They require massive redundant investment; they are cumbersome or useless for cross-border transactions; and they fragment the data the network throws off, hindering the analytic work needed to track fraud and crime.Mr Banga says that when he talks to national regulators “they’ll garb [nationalisation] as national security”. He points out in response that national data is of limited use when terrorists do not respect borders — and that domestic banks hold more country specific data anyway. “They all say, ‘that’s a good point’.”“For national parochial reasons or [to help] domestic business . . . [governments] may still get prompted to chase me down. But now we’re not talking principles; now we’re talking good old dirty politics.”Government parochialism is not the only threat. The movement towards electronic payments could switch the other way “because people get scared of digital transparency”, he says. “An event like Facebook-Cambridge Analytica actually could set you back because it could create the feeling among people like you and me who say, ‘do I really want everything to be visible to other people? Because other people are taking advantage of what they see of me. I don’t like that. I want my life back.’”Mastercard is parsimonious about the user data it collects. Card networks receive only four pieces of information with each transaction: an account number, the value of the transaction, a time and a merchant code. This makes it possible for the company to keep high standards for data ownership and transparency, and insist that the customer “receive some benefit” any time their data is used.Concerns about data integrity help explain why Mastercard pulled out of Libra, the Facebook-led digital currency project that was unveiled last year. Mr Banga likes the idea of a global currency and joined the association of companies backing Libra, but concerns over compliance and the business model led him to withdraw.The association’s key members would not give a hard commitment to “not do anything that is not fully compliant with local law”. He points to due diligence considerations such as know your client, anti money laundering, data management, “all that . . . every time you talked to the main proponents of Libra, I said ‘Would you put that in writing?’ They wouldn’t.”He also did not see how Libra would make money, and “when you don’t understand how money gets made, it gets made in ways you don’t like”. Finally, he was alarmed that Facebook had positioned Libra as a financial inclusion tool but then proposed linking it to a proprietary digital wallet, Calibra.“It went from this altruistic idea into their own wallet. I’m like: ‘this doesn’t sound right’ . . . For financial inclusion, the government has got to pay you in this [currency], you’ve got to receive it as an instrument you can understand, and you have to be able to use it to buy rice and cycles. If you get paid in Libra [coin] . . . which go into Calibras, which go back into pounds to buy rice, I don’t understand how that works.”Arguably, Mr Banga also has self-serving reasons for pulling back from Libra. Lisa Ellis, payments analyst at MoffettNathanson, thinks that it is possible that a blockchain-based payments system could, years in the future, grow into a real-time global payments network — posing an “existential threat” to private networks such as Mastercard.Analysts also fret that as digital wallets such as Apple Pay or India’s Paytm gain traction, and more transactions are conducted on big tech platforms such as those belonging to Google or Amazon, Mastercard’s place in the payments ecosystem will become less prominent.Mr Banga is unperturbed: “We have 30,000 plus banks around the world connected with 60m merchants with billions of people in 200 countries with local legal regs of every country built into the system. Everybody, even the digital giants, realises that is a [lot] of heavy lifting to try and do,” and that it is “better, faster, cheaper” to partner with Mastercard.Most analysts agree. “It’s not easy to break into payments — many entrants have found that out, quickly and the hard way,” says Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. But, he says, it could be different with big tech companies “if they want ownership of everything” in ecommerce.Surely as the tech players gain scale, they will at least ask Mastercard to lower its fees? Of course they will, says Mr Banga. “He who has bigger shoes is going to take them off and beat your goddamn head in . . . a bigger bank negotiates harder than a smaller bank. A bigger merchant negotiates harder than a poorer merchant. A bigger government negotiates harder than a smaller government. So China negotiates differently than Vietnam. It’s just reality.”"

Adjusted earnings, at $2.15 a share, compared with projections of $2.01.During the quarter, the company acquired the Danish real-time payments company Nets for $3.2bn, as part of its strategy to expand beyond card payments and become a “multi-rail” payments company. Nets technology facilitates real-times payment between bank accounts in Europe. The deal follows a series of other mergers in the payments space. Mastercard is also investing in its business-to-business payments tools.Last week, Mastercard rival Visa reported its payment volumes rose 9 per cent in the fourth quarter. Credit-card issuing banks such as Citigroup, JPMorgan and Capital One have reported solid results from their card operations, too, as US consumers continue to spend and interest rates on loan balances remain near multi-decade highs, despite rates falling elsewhere in the economy.Mastercard shares rose 1 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday morning.Shares in Mastercard and Visa have returned 47 and 37 per cent, year to date, easily outpacing the wider market’s 23 per cent return.
7;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-08-06T17:47:43Z;Mastercard buys real-time payments unit from Nets Group for $3.2bn;Card network strikes its biggest deal in further effort to be ‘one-stop shop for all payments’;The land grab in payments technology continued on Tuesday, as Mastercard announced the $3.2bn purchase of the real-time payments unit of Denmark-based Nets Group.The deal, the biggest acquisition in Mastercard’s history, gives the card network the infrastructure for real-time payments between bank accounts in Europe, as well as a suite of associated applications and services.Michael Miebach, Mastercard’s chief product and innovation officer, said that the acquisition was part of the company’s shift from being a pure card payments company to a “multi-rail” payments group serving merchants, banks and governments.“About three or four years ago we took a decision that it was important to give [clients] choice in payments — not just cards . . . Half of payments happen directly from one bank account to another, and for our bank partners, we want to be a one-stop shop for all payments,” Mr Miebach told the Financial Times.The real-time payments space is evolving so quickly that building its own technology, rather than acquiring it, would take too long, he added.The deal follows a series of payment tie-ups this year. In May, Global Payments and TSYS announced a $21.5bn all-stock merger, combining a US business specialising in helping merchants process payments with another that helps banks clear payments. The same broad principle was behind the January merger of Fiserv and its rival First Data in a $39bn all-stock transaction, and the $43bn tie-up of Fidelity National Information Services and Worldpay in March.At the time of the TSYS deal, Global Payments chief executive Jeff Sloan said the tie-up created “a kind of mini-Visa or Mastercard”.This week private equity group KKR, which had been First Data’s largest shareholder, won the race to buy German payments group Heidelpay for €600m.Bo Nilsson, chief executive of Nets, said in a statement that expanding the company’s account-to-account payments business beyond its current geographic footprint “requires the capabilities and resources of an established global leader” such as Mastercard. Nets will now focus on its merchant services and payment processing businesses.Mastercard announced two smaller payments deals this year. In March, the company said it would buy Transfast, a global account-to-account payments company, for an undisclosed sum. In April, it bought the point-of-sale payments company Vyze, also for an undisclosed sum.The Nets deal is expected to close in the first half of 2020. Mastercard expects it to be dilutive to earnings for up to two years after clearing.Mastercard shares rose 2.2 per cent in mid-day trading in New York, ahead of both the wider market and rival Visa, which rose 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively.
8;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-06-03T03:00:27Z;China’s UnionPay joins Europe credit card battle;Mastercard and Visa face new rival after link-up with UK payment start-up Tribe;China UnionPay, the world’s biggest card issuer, is to start offering debit and credit cards in Europe for the first time as the Chinese state-controlled giant continues its global expansion to challenge Visa and Mastercard.UnionPay, which has issued more than 6bn cards in China, has partnered with Tribe Payments, a new UK-based back-office technology start-up, to allow banks and fintechs to start offering individuals and companies its branded cards from this month.“This agreement shows UnionPay’s intent to compete with the major card schemes in Europe,” said Suresh Vaghjiani, the founder of Tribe. “This is the first time European institutions will be able to put UnionPay cards into the hands of people on the street.”Mr Vaghjiani says Tribe so far has two clients interested in UnionPay’s services, one for a virtual card in Europe and another for a debit card in the UK. He declined to name them.“European corporate clients that do business in China will now be able to use UnionPay cards there, while Chinese businesses in Europe will have a consistent payment method at home and abroad,” Mr Vaghjiani added.Founded in 2002 under a charter from the People’s Bank of China, UnionPay has a virtual monopoly on domestic bank card payments, where it has issued more cards than Visa and Mastercard combined.The Chinese group has been expanding internationally in recent years, mainly in Asia, and says its cards are accepted by more than 41m merchants and 2m ATMs in 170 countries, 40 of which are in Europe.“We have the largest cardholder base in the world, working with issuers through Tribe is important to our growth,” said Zhihong Wei, head of UnionPay in Europe.It first moved into the continent a decade ago to provide access for Chinese tourists and its cards are now accepted by 60 per cent of merchants and ATMs in the region.Seven years ago London department store Harrods installed a UnionPay point-of-sale terminal, prompting a surge in sales from Chinese students and tourists who were able to spend directly from their home bank accounts.UnionPay’s new move comes amid intensifying competition in its home market from digital payments groups such as Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay. The two have dislodged UnionPay from its dominant position online, robbing it of fee income and valuable transaction data from consumers who have switched from traditional plastic to mobile phones.Mr Wei told the Financial Times in September the company did not need a licence for its European expansion plan as its cards will be issued by third parties, such as banks and fintechs, and its transactions will be handled by payment processing groups like Tribe.Tribe employs 72 people, has an office in London’s Shard and outposts in Lithuania and Denmark. Mr Vaghjiani previously ran another payments processor called Global Processing Services and has worked on systems for Monzo and Revolut.While UnionPay expands overseas, US rivals Visa and Mastercard have been repeatedly frustrated in their attempts to enter the huge Chinese market. Both have applied to Beijing for licences to clear renminbi payments, but the central bank has refused to acknowledge them. This is despite a World Trade Organization ruling six years ago that China discriminates against foreign payment groups.UnionPay operates a similar business model to Visa and Mastercard, earning a commission on each card swipe. The currency-printing unit of the People’s Bank of China is its largest shareholder, with most of the remaining equity held by other state-owned financial institutions.
9;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
10;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-04-29T16:21:54Z;Visa and Mastercard to cut foreign card fees in EU;Latest concession in payment companies’ long-running antitrust battle with Brussels;Mastercard and Visa will cut the fees they charge on purchases made in the EU with foreign-issued debit and credit cards, a concession the payment companies hope will end their long-running antitrust battles with Brussels. Retailers will be charged an average of 40 per cent less on purchases made in the European Economic Area using Mastercard, Maestro, Visa, Visa Electron and V-PAY credit and debit cards issued in countries outside the EEA. At issue is the fee paid by a retailer’s bank to the cardholder’s bank — a so-called interchange fee — that the card companies use to cover costs of fraud, security and processing. According to Monday’s agreement, the fee on in-store purchases will fall to 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards. Online purchases, where the card is not physically presented, will be charged a maximum of 1.15 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 1.50 per cent for credit cards. The higher fees reflect the greater risks, increased complexity and additional value of the global e-commerce payment service, as well as the wider range of competitors, which include PayPal and Alipay. Margrethe Vestager, European competition commissioner, said the binding promises would “reduce the costs borne by retailers” and, along with earlier decisions, “lower prices for European retailers to do business, ultimately to the benefit of all consumers”. The newly agreed rates for foreign-issued card transactions will come into effect on October 19 and apply for five years. Visa and Mastercard can be fined up to 10 per cent of their global turnover if they fail to meet their commitments. Visa said it “played a central role negotiating a resolution that achieves the best outcome for all parties”. Mastercard said it saw “the closure of this antitrust chapter as an important milestone for the company”. EU officials launched their investigations more than a decade ago, initially focusing on fees charged on European-issued cards. Investigations into the two companies were separate and while Visa addressed the concerns through a series of settlements, Mastercard chose to fight the charges. The European Commission ruled in 2007 that Mastercard’s fees on cross-border purchases for European-issued cards broke the bloc’s competition rules and inflated the cost of card acceptance by retailers. It ordered the company to cut the fees.Mastercard capped fees on those purchases in 2009, at 0.2 per cent of transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards. Visa soon followed suit and in 2015 the EU’s Interchange Fee Regulation made those caps legally binding. The EU’s 2007 decision provided the basis for a £14bn legal claim brought against Mastercard in the UK courts, filed on behalf of more than 46m British consumers — the first mass consumer claim brought under the new regime introduced by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.In a decision in January, Ms Vestager fined Mastercard €570m for limiting the ability of retailers and banks to shop around between member states to find lower interchange fees.
11;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Leader of £14bn Mastercard claim defends US-style class actions;Former Financial Ombudsman head says claims will provide better redress for consumers;The man spearheading the £14bn legal claim against Mastercard has defended the advent of US-style class actions in Britain, saying they give wronged consumers the chance to hold businesses to account. Walter Merricks — whose career has taken in roles at the law reform and human rights organisation Justice, the Law Society, the Gambling Commission, and the press monitor Impress — is the public face of a consumer claim testing new ground in the English legal system. He is leading a class action on behalf of more than 46m British consumers for losses suffered from alleged illegal credit card fees, in the first mass consumer claim brought under the new regime introduced by the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The Mastercard action is the most significant test to date of English courts’ appetite for US-style consumer class actions — and of the role of litigation finance businesses, which support legal claims in return for a share of any settlements or damages. “A lot of the criticism of the US class action system is not justified,” said Mr Merricks, adding that the Canadian system worked “extremely well” and had more safeguards.“Nobody in Canada thinks that’s an unfair system or one that imposes undue burdens on business.” This week, the Court of Appeal in London breathed new life into the Mastercard claim, two years after the Competition Appeal Tribunal seemingly blocked the lawsuit.Mr Merricks, 73, said that law firm Quinn Emanuel had contacted him after the 2015 act was passed, as collective consumer actions typically need leadership from an individual.“It was important to have someone with credibility and experience, with both litigation and financial services,” he said. “Naturally I was very interested.” Mr Merricks was the first head of the UK’s Financial Ombudsman Service from 1999 to 2009, giving him a ringside seat for Britain’s biggest financial scandals — from the mis-selling of payment protection insurance to the collapse of the insurer Equitable Life. “I knew we just didn’t have a proper system for providing consumer redress where there had been large-scale damage but sometimes for relatively small amounts of money,” he said. He also defended litigation funders, arguing that they “run a substantial risk” of either losing the case or there being no money left over after consumer claims. Innsworth, a litigation funder, supported Mr Merricks taking the case to the Court of Appeal. The firm, which is also funding a shareholder claim against the carmaker Volkswagen, can call upon backing from US hedge fund Elliott Management. It is nearing a deal for further financing, believed to be about £40m.Ian Garrard, managing director of Innsworth, said the Mastercard consumer claim was attractive because it was a “novel” case and he called the arrangement “equitable”. He added that Elliott gave Innsworth the financial firepower to take on groundbreaking and substantial claims.While Innsworth would be left out of pocket if all 46m eligible claimants recovered money from Mastercard, even in well publicised claims such as the PPI scandal most consumers usually fail to act. 
12;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-04-16T12:09:23Z;Court ruling paves way for £14bn lawsuit against Mastercard;Hurdle cleared towards class action being taken against payments provider;"A London court has breathed new life into a £14bn lawsuit against Mastercard by reversing an earlier decision by a competition tribunal to block it.Walter Merricks, a former financial ombudsman, had applied to lead the unprecedented class action on behalf of more than 46m British consumers for losses suffered as a result of alleged illegal credit card fees. It was the first mass consumer claim to be brought under the new collective action regime introduced by the Consumer Rights Act 2015.The Competition Appeal Tribunal threw out the claim two years ago, saying it was not suitable for collective proceedings. But on Tuesday the Court of Appeal set that ruling aside, saying the tribunal had applied the wrong legal test in making its decision. The CAT will now have to reconsider the case.“I am very pleased with today’s decision,” said Mr Merricks. “It is nearly 12 years since Mastercard was clearly told that they had broken the law by imposing excessive card transaction charges, damaging consumers over a prolonged period.“As a result we all had to pay higher prices in the shops than we should have done — while Mastercard have pocketed the profits.”Boris Bronfentrinker, the lawyer at Quinn Emanuel who is representing Mr Merricks, called the decision “a landmark day for all UK consumers” his client wanted to represent, as well as a “significant day for the collective action regime in this country”.No liability has been established against Mastercard and Tuesday’s decision does not mean Mr Merricks’ suit can yet proceed to trial. The payments provider said it would appeal to the Supreme Court.Mastercard said: “This decision is not a final ruling and the proposed claim is not approved to move forward; rather, the court has simply said a rehearing on certain issues should happen.“Mastercard continues to disagree fundamentally with the basis of the claim and we believe UK consumers receive real value from the security, convenience and consumer protection of our payment services.”The case against Mastercard stems from a 2007 European Commission ruling that cross-border charges on the use of Mastercard debit and credit cards — known as interchange fees — were in breach of competition law.Those fees, Mr Merricks alleges, were passed on to UK consumers, who therefore paid higher prices than they would otherwise have done.He is making the claim on behalf of all individuals over the age of 16 and resident in the UK for at least three months between 1992 and 2008 and who bought goods and services from a business based in the UK that accepted Mastercard.If a £14bn award was made and was divided equally between every eligible consumer, that would amount to £300 each.Louise Freeman, co-chair of the European disputes team at the law firm Covington & Burling, said the Court of Appeal had “sent a clear signal” that the tribunal had set the bar too high in assessing whether the mass claim should proceed.The CAT was deemed to have demanded too much data from Mr Merricks in determining the merits of his claim against Mastercard, she added, and had erred in requiring at this stage a clear method of distributing any compensation among consumers.Christian Smith, a partner at the law firm Seddons, said that mass consumer actions were well established in the US but “unprecedented in the UK”.Both consumer rights groups and litigation funders — businesses that support claims in return for a share of any settlement or damages — would be following the case closely in the hope that a successful appeal would “open the doors” to similar claims.However, “a long road lies ahead” before that is the norm in Britain, he added."
13;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-04-02T16:53:34Z;#fintech: Bonfire of the paperwork;Global digital identity plans advance;"Less than a decade after its 2009 launch, India’s Aadhaar digital identity system has been adopted by 99 per cent of the country's population, drawing hundreds of millions of previously unbanked people into the digital economy and the country's financial system at large. Now, Mastercard has unveiled a blueprint for repeating that feat the world over, while also liberating merchants and service providers from the manual process of validating prospective clients' identity. The idea is that the digital identity would substitute for the wodge of paperwork and official ID people currently need to do everything from opening an account with a utility company, signing up for an online payments service, hiring a car or renting an apartment.“Identity as we well know is a big pain for everybody,” Mastercard president for cyber and intelligence solutions Ajay Bhalla told FintechFT. “This means that you can actually have a digital identity which can be put on a device and used anywhere in the world.”As well as cutting out hassle and giving credentials to people who are currently locked out of the financial system, the scheme could also reduce fraud by making it harder to assume someone else's identity (a big problem in some online payments systems). Last week's update centred on the principles of how the global digital identity would work, hitting all the right notes like inclusion (“everyone has a right to a digital identity”), ownership (“individuals own their identity and personal data”) and confidentiality. Bhalla sees these values as critical to the system's credibility, and therefore its adoption. Details on the logistics of its operations are fuzzier. Bhalla says that it is “envisaged” that banks and merchants “pay for it”, but Mastercard hasn’t “actually come up with any pricing models yet”. “We've discussed this with our banks, with the merchants, with people in the gig economy, and there is a very clear expressed need,” said Bhalla. “We are very confident that once it's rolled out we will get very wide embracing of this entire service.” Derek White, global head of customer and client solutions at BBVA, told FintechFT that “lots of banks and fintechs are already working on solutions very similar” to what Mastercard is doing, including a BBVA-backed venture Covault, which facilitates “the creation and private exchange of secure digital identities”.“What Mastercard has going for it is scale, the potential flexibility of its (digital identity) tokens to prove identity or just transactions, and its existing relationships,” White added. “What we have seen repeatedly in areas like finance-related technology is that massively scaled adoption is critical to any specific platform's success.” Mastercard works with 20,000 banks globally, and millions of merchants. It's not only merchants and banks who have to adopt the system, though, regular people need to get it and want it too. “It’s early days for consumers to understand the concepts of centralised ID management,” said Colin Walsh, chief executive of US digital challenger bank Varo Money. “Regulators will still need to get comfortable with it and there is likely to be a period of back-and-forth so that new technology does satisfy requirements.” Indeed, regulators — and other instruments of the state — are likely to put the breaks on the digital identity systems long before the limits of technology are reached. In New Delhi, India's Supreme Court last year ruled against plans to integrate mobile phone data in digital IDs, and blocked companies' access to citizens' biometric and demographic data on privacy grounds.With $6bn a year of remittances flowing through its pipes, Seattle's Remitly has already achieved a scale many fintechs can only dream of. Last week's announcement of a partnership with Visa could take the remittances business to a whole new level, but Remitly's chief executive is already eyeing even bigger things. “We have over 1 million customers saying 'we trust you with our remittances,” Remitly CEO Matt Oppenheimer told FintechFT. “I have a longer term vision . . . to say 'how can we help those immigrants with a broader range of financial services needs'.”Oppenheimer cited the challenges immigrants have with everything from opening bank accounts to getting loans as problems that Remitly could help solve, either on its own, or through partnerships. Certainly immigrants seem to be liking Remitly's core play of making it cheap and easy to send money from developed to developing countries. After initially focusing on the biggest corridors like USA to India, Remitly now offers its services across more than 700 of the developed to developing “corridor pairs”.Oppenheimer attributed some of Remitly's success to the sheer variety of payment methods it offers; you can send them to a bank account, a local store, or even get home deliveries. “That's where we really add value,” he said, adding that those kind of activities were “not a sweet spot” for banks. The Visa deal opens up another avenue, and will ultimately make it possible to use Remitly to send money almost-instantly to anyone with a Visa debit card anywhere in the world, allowing Remitly to fight for an even bigger share of the $600bn a year annual remittances market. “There's a very large independent business to be built here,” said Oppenheimer, ruling out any interest in being bought by a bank. Remitly's existing investors include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, global internet and entertainment group Naspers as well as venture capital firms DFJ and DN Capital. The number of active Apple users, aka the potential customer base for Goldman Sachs' and Apple's new credit card New frontiers: Goldman Sachs and Apple have finally unveiled their hotly-anticipated joint credit card, a first for two giants in their respective fields. The duo are offering a titanium card supported by a slick app. Apple boss Tim Cook promised the tie-up would be the biggest innovation for credit cards “in 50 years”, while Goldman boss David Solomon said it “completely changes the credit card experience”. Plenty of fintechs have, of course, already tried to transform the experience of owning a credit card, but the scale that Apple and Goldman bring gives them a better chance than most. Stumbling blocks: The plot deepens at German digital payments giant Wirecard. Intrepid reporting by the Financial Times' Dan McCrum and Stefania Palma last week uncovered the bizarre network of entities supposedly doing business for Wirecard, including one purportedly based at a retired seaman's house in the northern Philippine city of Cabanatuan. Meanwhile, over at Quadriga, the Canadian crypto exchange where clients are down almost $200m after its founder's death, former company lawyer tells Coindesk how her deceased boss terminated “law and order” folks. Regulators’ advance: Hong Kong regulators are finally rolling out the red carpet for digital banks, but Chinese fintech giants Tencent and Alibaba's Ant Financial have been left out in the cold. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority last week announced that its first three digital banking licences were going to joint ventures involving Standard Chartered, a Bank of China subsidiary and online insurer ZhongOn Online P&C Insurance. That gives the trio a head start on getting a slice of Hong Kong's $15bn retail banking market, a potentially lucrative market fintechs have been coveting for years.Trendwatch: Russia is getting its first neo bank in the form of online-only Bank 131, the first newcomer to receive a licence there in four years. Founded by serial tech entrepreneur Dmitry Eremeev, Bank 131 is targeted at entrepreneurs and small businesses in eastern Europe. The bank is targeting the $8bn market of gig economy workers or freelancers hired by global tech companies, and promises to give them access to more transparent and compliant banking. New frontiers: BBVA, which has long trumpeted its intention to become not just a digital bank but “a truly digital company,” has designed and led a $350m credit facility where the interest rate will vary depending on its client's success in hitting a set of digital business milestones. Given that neither the variability of the rate nor the exact milestones have yet been disclosed, it is hard to tell whether this a significant innovation or end-of-cycle fluff. BBVA, for its part, thinks that digital loans could be the new green bonds.

The two companies will also form a “strategic partnership”, working together to encourage more adoption of digital payments in the Middle East and Africa.Network, which was initially formed as a subsidiary of Dubai-based bank Emirates NBD, is already the largest expert in enabling retailers to take card payments instore or online in the region.A structural shift away from cash in favour of cards and other digital payment methods has led to a boom in the payments sector in recent years. Tuesday’s deal, coming a little over a week after US groups FIS and Worldpay agreed a $43bn combination, further highlights the rising pressure on companies to keep up with the changing landscape through merger and acquisition activity.Earlier this month Mastercard lost out in a bidding war with its biggest rival Visa for British group Earthport, but agreed to buy Transfast, another international money transfer network.Mastercard will become Network’s fourth-largest shareholder behind its current owners General Atlantic, Warburg Pincus an Emirates NBD.Ron Kalifa, Network chairman, said the deal “demonstrates significant confidence in the strength of the business as we move forward to listing.”“ Network International sits at the heart of the Middle East and Africa’s payments ecosystem, the world’s most under-penetrated payments market, providing investors with the unique opportunity to benefit from the rapid structural shift from cash to digital payments,” he added.
15;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-02-08T07:45:37Z;Visa ups offer for UK payments group, fending off Mastercard bid;US-based card network offers £247m for Earthport;A bidding war for British payments group Earthport is hotting up, with Visa upping its offer after an earlier attempt to buy it was gatecrashed by its largest rival, Mastercard.Visa said on Friday it made an offer of 37p per share — or £247m in total — for Earthport, 12 per cent higher than the price agreed with Mastercard two weeks ago and 23 per cent more than the original deal it offered Earthport late last year.Shares in Earthport jumped almost 9 per cent to 42p after the news.The stock has been trading higher than Mastercard’s offer price since its bid was announced, suggesting many shareholders were expecting a counter-offer.Earthport’s board recommended the latest offer, and Visa said it had already received commitment to support the offer from shareholders controlling around 17 per cent of Earthport shares.Mastercard said it was “considering its options and urges Earthport shareholders to take no action” in response to Visa’s announcement.The Aim-listed company specialises in cross-border payments for banks and other financial firms, allowing them to transfer money without having to manage their own relationships with local regulators and lenders.Visa said that “Earthport can complement the development of Visa’s payment solutions and intends to use its resources to help Earthport grow”. The US group said it may consolidate some of Earthport’s existing offices and data centres into Visa’s own network, but “does not expect to make a material change in the balance of skills and functions of the employees and management of Earthport”.

However, on Tuesday, Amex blocked its cardholders from using the service. Curve said that Amex users spent more than £450,000 before the service was blocked.In a blog post on Curve’s website, Shachar Bialick, founder and chief executive, described the move as a “bombshell” which had been “entirely disproportionate and discriminatory to Curve and our joint customers”.“Amex has given no good or fair reason for their decision,” he said. “We have already sent a letter [asking Amex] to reconsider their decision and have given them reasonable time to comply. Failure to do so will mean that we will be forced to exercise our rights in the courts and to submit complaints to the relevant regulators in the UK and Europe,” he added.Through its membership points system, Amex cards offer a range of rewards such as cashback, Avios points to spend on British Airways flights and exclusive deals with brands such as Hilton and Selfridges.Curve customers have taken to social media to express their dissatisfaction at being unable to spend on Amex and collect points and cashback.Curve user Matt Elliot tweeted: “I spend more on Amex through Curve, due to many places not accepting it natively.”Jonathan Conway, another user, tweeted: “It’s already hard enough finding places that accept Amex as it is. Got a Curve card because I thought it’d improve the situation.”In a statement, American Express said it had participated in a limited trial where a small number of customers could load money on to an e-wallet using their Amex card in the Curve app.“We informed Curve that we would not participate in the further roll out of the Curve e-wallet, prior to them launching the product,” Amex said. “We do not have regulatory obligations to work with a particular partner and we can confirm that we have terminated our agreement with Curve.”Curve is a free service, although premium users can pay £150 upfront for a metal Curve card which offers fee-free foreign transactions, worldwide travel insurance, gadget insurance and the ability to “go back in time” and move purchases between cards.Curve customers have received an email explaining their legal entitlement to a 14-day “cooling-off” period, within which they can cancel the service and get their money back. In addition to this, Curve said it was giving its customers 14 extra days to decide whether they want to keep their cards.

Net income, adjusted for special items, rose by a third, to $1.6bn.Rebates and incentives continued to grow, reflecting the ongoing “rewards war” that also affected American Express earnings earlier this month.In spite of this, though, Mastercard profits came in just ahead of Wall Street expectations. The shares rose by almost 5 per cent in pre-market trading.US banks have reported strong growth in their credit-card loan portfolios for the fourth quarter.Mastercard’s rival Visa released its fourth-quarter numbers on Wednesday after markets closed.Its revenue and volume growth were 13 and 11 per cent, respectively. It shares were down 2 per cent in early trading on Thursday.
18;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-01-25T13:16:15Z;Mastercard gatecrashes Visa bid for UK payments company;Group makes £233m offer to buy Earthport as M&A flurry continues;Mastercard has made a £233m offer to buy cross-border payments specialist Earthport, derailing a previous agreement with rival Visa and raising the prospect of a bidding war for the British group.Mastercard and Earthport said on Friday they had agreed a 33p-per-share deal, a 10 per cent premium on Visa’s bid last month. Sunil Sabharwal, Earthport’s interim chairman, said the offer “provides our shareholders with even greater value”.Shares in Earthport, which is listed on London’s secondary Aim market, jumped 28 per cent to 35.6p. The rise above Mastercard’s offer price suggests some investors expect further counter-offers.Visa said it was “considering its options” and would provide an update “in due course”.There has been a wave of merger and acquisition activity in the payments industry as customers have turned to cashless payments and infrastructure technology has improved.Most recently, US payments processor Fiserv said it would buy rival First Data for $39bn, in what would be one of the largest financial services takeovers since the crisis.Meanwhile, several groups are considering initial public offerings this year, including Italy’s Nexi and UAE-based Network International.Earthport allows banks and other financial firms to move money across borders without having to establish relationships with local regulators and banks in each country. One Earthport shareholder suggested Visa and Mastercard, which have been looking to diversify away from their traditional cards businesses, would be attracted by Earthport’s existing network and local expertise.“I don’t think its inconceivable that a third party would show up” with its own bid, they added.Despite high-profile clients such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Japan Post Bank, and backers including the World Bank, Earthport has struggled to win over investors since it floated on Aim in 2009.The Earthport shareholder said they thought the company had been undervalued because of stock market investors’ focus on short-term profits and lack of understanding of the industry.In its most recent financial year, the company lost one of its biggest customers, and its shares dropped 26 per cent in the 12 months running up to Visa’s offer. It changed its executive team, installing a new chief executive and chief financial officer, and said in its full-year results last month that it was aiming to become a “bigger and more technologically enabled player in the global payments market”.Investors holding a total of 13 per cent of Earthport’s shares have sent letters supporting the proposed Mastercard deal.
19;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-01-22T12:43:03Z;Brussels fines Mastercard €570m for restricting competition;Credit card group limited banks’ ability to ‘shop around’, EU says;Brussels has fined Mastercard €570.6m for limiting the ability of retailers and banks to shop around between member states to offer lower fees, thereby restricting competition between banks and raising payment costs for retailers and customers.Mastercard levies a so-called interchange fee on transactions between the cardholder’s bank and the retailer’s bank. Historically, the rates varied considerably between member states but in December 2015 the EU passed a regulation capping the cost and levelling the playing field within the bloc.“By preventing merchants from shopping around for better conditions offered by banks in other member states, Mastercard’s rules artificially raised the costs of card payments, harming consumers and retailers in the EU,” Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s competition commissioner, said on Tuesday.The fine was reduced by 10 per cent because the company co-operated with the European investigation and acknowledged both the facts of the case and the breach. Retailers and customers can seek damages from Mastercard through the courts based on the commission decision.EU officials have been cracking down on credit card company fees for more than a decade. In December 2015 the bloc’s interchange fee regulation capped the fee charged by the US payment group and its rival Visa within the European Economic Area to a maximum of 0.2 per cent of transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards.The US payment group also had a seven-year antitrust dispute over its cross-border fees to retailers. The commission decided in 2007 that the company had restricted competition and inflated charges — the European court upheld that decision in 2014.Mastercard said: “Today’s decision by the European Commission puts an end to a legacy investigation concerning Mastercard’s European central acquiring rules that [had been] in place until 2015.”It added: “This decision relates to historic practices only, covers a limited period of time of less than two years and will not require any modification of Mastercard’s current business practices.”The company can appeal against Tuesday’s decision in the European courts.
20;MA;Mastercard Inc;2019-01-13T22:00:24Z;China’s central bank delays market entry for Visa and Mastercard;New rules allow foreign access, but PBoC has refused to process card companies’ applications;China’s central bank has refused to acknowledge applications submitted by Visa and Mastercard to process renminbi payments, despite rules in 2017 that removed formal obstacles to foreign participation in the $124bn market following a decade-long struggle. The application delays highlight complaints by overseas companies and White House trade negotiators that China uses informal barriers to block foreign competition in the domestic market, even where written rules ostensibly guarantee fair treatment. Although Visa and Mastercard submitted applications to the People’s Bank of China more than a year ago, the PBoC has not formally acknowledged these submissions, according to two people familiar with the application process.China’s refusal to process the applications could cause trouble in trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing, which are reaching a critical juncture ahead of a March 2 deadline to strike a deal or face a new escalation in tariffs.The US has been trying to secure greater market access for American financial services companies, along with other changes to Chinese economic policy, like curbing the forced transfer of technology. The Office of the US Trade Representative, which is leading the talks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.In a typical Chinese permissions process, formal acceptance and acknowledgment — shouli in Chinese — is the initial step towards approval. According to the application procedure published in 2017, the central bank must decide on applications within 90 days of acknowledgment. “It’s a funny spin on World Trade Organization compliance. Yes, China will have due process for the application once they’ve accepted it, but no one ever thought it would be possible not to accept the application,” said one of the people. In November, American Express became the first foreign card scheme to win initial approval from the central bank to establish a renminbi bank-card clearing company. But Amex’s approval raised eyebrows because the new entity is a 50-50 joint venture with a Chinese partner, even though the rules permit wholly foreign-owned ventures. Reuters reported in November 2017 that China was pressuring Visa and Mastercard to operate through joint ventures.But an executive at a major foreign card operator said the PBoC had not explained its refusal to process the company’s application. “One could suspect that it’s because of the trade war, but then again American Express was approved. Somebody said, ‘Well Amex is smaller, so there’s less impact to the market,’ but nobody really knows,” he said. “There are a lot of variables. We are communicating with the central bank on and off, but there’s no clear reason.” Visa, Mastercard and the PBoC did not answer requests for comment.Visa and Mastercard’s efforts to enter China date back at least a decade. The WTO ruled in 2012 that China discriminates against foreign payment providers, nearly two years after the US government filed the complaint. In October 2014, China’s cabinet declared that it would open the market to foreign players. The cabinet published a more specific market entry framework six months later, and the PBoC followed up with rules governing bank-card clearing companies in 2016.In June 2017, nearly five years after the WTO ruling, PBoC issued the application procedure for establishing such a business. Visa submitted its application in July 2017 and Mastercard followed suit later that year. The PBoC is the largest shareholder in China Unionpay, which maintains a de facto monopoly on renminbi bank-card payments in China. Visa, Mastercard and American Express have partnerships with Chinese commercial banks to issue foreign-branded credit cards, but they are only usable for foreign-currency payments. Chinese customers use such cards for international travel, but most domestic merchants do not accept them. Unionpay’s dominance in China helped it earn a 36 per cent market share globally in bank card payments, compared to 32 per cent for Visa and 20 per cent for Mastercard, according to RBR, a payments research group. Unionpay has sought to expand its international business in recent years, first in emerging markets and more recently in Europe. Chinese payment card transactions totalled Rmb848bn ($124bn) in the year to September 30 2018, up 11.5 per cent from a year earlier, according to PBoC data, despite the rapid rise of mobile payments, which has sparked a shift away from plastic.Additional reporting by James Politi in WashingtonFollow Gabriel Wildau on Twitter at @gabewildauThis article has been amended to reflect the fact that the renminbi-processing payments market is worth $124bn
21;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;At last, US banks are introducing contactless cards;Issuers which are first with long-delayed technology are set to reap benefits;To tourists from much of the rest of the English-speaking world — the UK, Canada, Australia — a visit to New York can feel like a trip into the past. They tap their credit cards against subway turnstiles or shops’ card readers and wait for something to happen. Nothing does.Contactless cards, taken for granted in many countries, will at last roll out at scale in the US in 2019, giving card-issuing banks a chance to grab market share away from cash and, potentially, one another.But the fact that tap and go payments have taken so long to hit the US shows the challenges to financial innovation in one of the world’s biggest markets.In 2017, according to the Federal Reserve, US consumers made $6.6tn in payments on credit, debit, and prepaid cards, 8 per cent more than the year before — and a little less than half of total consumer expenditures on goods and services. That proportion could be even higher, analysts think, if the US did not lack cutting-edge card payments networks.“Free enterprise is an inhibitor of progress in payments in the US, not the enabler — we get the privilege of living in chaos,” said Thad Peterson, consumer payments analyst at Aite, a research firm.In smaller markets, the shift to new payment standards is effectively mandated by common agreement between banks, with support from standard-setting bodies. The UK made the shift toward cards with chips “quickly, efficiently, and well” by 2006, Mr Peterson said, opening the way for contactless shortly thereafter. The US only just completed the move to chip cards.The age, size, and complexity of the US market has been a barrier. The US was where the card industry began, “and is arguably the most complex market in the world, with over 50 years of legacy systems”, said Craig Vosburg, president of Mastercard North America. There are thousands of banks — compared to a handful of major ones in other markets — tens of millions of merchants, and a fragmented industry that provide payments technology. This makes it hard to settle on ubiquitous solutions.The US industry muddled along with magnetic stripes and improvements to back-end technology. “Then Target happened” said Oliver Jenkyn, head of North America for Visa, referring to the retailer’s massive data breach in 2013, which included credit card numbers. “Everyone was saying ‘I shop at Target’. It was a major tipping point.” It pushed issuers to issue cards with chips, which are much harder to counterfeit.The crucial move to make chips ubiquitously acceptable in the US was a shift in liability rules at the card networks. After October 2015, merchants rather than banks became liable for fraudulent transactions using magnetic stripe cards, giving the merchants a strong incentive to update their card-reading equipment.Once terminals that accept cards with chips are in place, the move to contactless only requires updated cards. So the delay on chip cards put the US way behind on contactless. Visa says that outside the US, more than 40 per cent of face-to-face transactions with Visa cards already occur with a tap. The number is 90 per cent in Australia, 60 per cent in Canada, and nearly 50 per cent in the UK. In the US, the number is in the low single digits.When transit gets enabled through contactless, usage rates go up everywhere, not just in transit but in Starbucks, McDonald’s and so onMomentum appears to be building behind contactless in the US market, however. “Card issuers have changed their approach in the last six months — from sticking a toe in the water to a cannonball,” said Kevin Morrison, retail banking analyst at Aite. “They were thinking of doing it with one or two card types, premium ones, but now they are all in with credit and debit . . . The smaller banks said ‘if the larger institutions move, we have to go too.’”The key catalyst has been JPMorgan Chase, which announced in November that all of its credit and debit card holders would be moved to contactless by the end of 2019. No other major bank has made a similar commitment, but Mastercard says it has agreements with its bank partners that will bring contactless cards to customers accounting for two-thirds of its total payment volumes within two years. Visa expects 100 million contactless Visa cards to be issued in the US by the end of 2019.An important catalyst for adoption will be rapid transit. New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority says it will start accepting contactless payments in 2019, using the same technology provider that built the system in London’s Tube. Some 500 subway turnstiles and 600 buses will be upgraded in 2019. Pat Foye, president of the MTA, said the project is proceeding on time and on budget.“When transit gets enabled through contactless, usage rates go up everywhere, not just in transit but in Starbucks, McDonald’s and so on” said Mr Vosburg of Mastercard.The move comes to contactless at a crucial times for banks’ card businesses. While consumer credit quality remains strong, hot competition is pressuring fee revenue and stoking a rewards war.Being first to offer a consumer contactless will confer a key advantage on issuers. “What is at stake for the banks is top of wallet status for their cards,” said Mr Jenkyn of Visa. Contactless tends to be adopted for minor, everyday transactions — coffee and fast food — which puts consumers in the habit of reaching for their contactless card first.AT Kearney, a consultancy, has found that in developed markets the shift to contactless increases the number of transactions per card by 20-30 per cent.Whatever card gets pulled out first to set up an online account at, for example, Amazon or Apple ends up capturing all the spending, said Mr Peterson. “Top of wallet means much more now — the first card in your wallet is often the only card [you use].”

The cards will give Grab and Mastercard significant insight into consumer trends in a region where 200m people are expected to enter the middle class by 2030.Grab, which was set up in 2012 and is currently valued at $11bn, is moving aggressively into sectors beyond ride-hailing, such as healthcare, food delivery and mobile payments, helping to cement its dominant position in the region at a time when rivals, including Indonesia’s Go-Jek, accelerate their own expansions.Reuben Lai, senior managing director at Grab’s financial arm, said the new product would help Grab create products and services tailored to the needs of consumers and merchants, and price them effectively. Rama Sridhar, executive vice-president for digital and emerging partnerships and new payment flows at Mastercard, said pairing Grab’s existing insight into consumer behaviour with the US company’s data analytics and experience with financial institutions would help “create lending products, which is what most regulators are hoping for across south-east Asia”. Partnering with Grab gives Mastercard access to a region where credit card use has historically been low. According to Boston Consulting Group, there are 177 credit cards for every 100 people in the US, compared with 29 per 100 in Thailand and 5 per 100 in Vietnam.“It helps us leverage Grab as a partner to tap into a huge demographic that was perhaps underserved until now,” said Ms Sridhar.However, BCG said last month that in south-east Asia, where small businesses tend to prefer cash on delivery over credit cards, consumers are likely to “leap directly from cash to digital payments, skipping credit and debit cards”.Asked who Grab’s competitors would be in prepaid cards, Mr Lai said: “Seventy per cent [of south-east Asians] are unbanked. Ninety per cent don’t have a card. Who is our competitor? Cash or digital wallets?”
23;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa and Mastercard offer $6.2bn for ‘swipe fees’ settlement;Potential agreement leaves conflict over rules imposed on merchants unresolved;Visa, Mastercard and a group of top-tier US banks have proposed a $6.2bn settlement of a long-running antitrust lawsuit over the card “swipe fees” they charge merchants.The monetary settlement requires court approval but, even if it is cleared, a related dispute over what rules the card networks can impose on merchants will remain unresolved.Under the deal, the two payment groups and banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, agree to pay $900m to the merchants on top of the $5.3bn agreed under a revised 2012 settlement. Visa’s share of the extra payout will be $600m, while Mastercard is liable for another $108m. Both companies had increased reserves to reflect their expected liabilities under the latest settlement.If the settlement is approved, plaintiffs will be given the option to opt out in light of the ongoing case on card network rules.“It is highly likely that the large merchants who are involved in litigation with the card networks will opt out of the settlement,” said Jeffrey Shinder, the lead lawyer for the so called “7-11” group of merchant plaintiffs, a group which includes Amazon, Starbucks, Lowe’s, and 7-11. “This case is fundamentally about structural issues, and not just money.”Of particular concern to many merchants is the “honour all cards rule” imposed on them by both Visa and Mastercard. It states that a merchant taking any bank issuer’s Visa card, for example, must take all Visa cards. Merchant groups claim that the rule removes the incentive for banks to charge lower transaction fees.In 2012, the card companies reached a $7.25bn agreement on the litigation, first brought 13 years ago, covering both the monetary and rules elements of the case. That was contested by some merchants, however, and ultimately rejected by the court, which found that the having the same lawyers representing plaintiffs suing both for monetary damages and “injunctive relief”, or changes to card network rules, represented a conflict of interest. The decision prompted the revised, monetary offer of $5.3bn.Regulators in other countries have imposed caps on the fees banks can charge credit hard holders. Under EU rules, the limit is 0.3 per cent for credit cards and in Australia the fees are capped at less than 1 per cent. In the US, “swipe fees” for debit cards were capped under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms but fees average about 2 per cent for credit cards.Brian Riley, a card industry analyst at Mercator Advisory Group, said there would be significant repercussions if swipe fees came down. “As you saw with debit cards in the US after Dodd-Frank, rewards programmes for cardholders will disappear quickly, and credit will probably tighten.”In mid-day trading in New York, Visa shares were up 1 per cent and Mastercard’s up 2 per cent, both ahead of the broader market.
24;MA;Mastercard Inc;2018-09-16T13:41:09Z;China UnionPay kicks off European expansion with UK launch;World’s biggest payment card issuer challenges US rivals Visa and Mastercard;China UnionPay, the world’s biggest payment card issuer, is preparing to launch branded cards in the UK, the first step in a wider European expansion plan to challenge its US rivals Visa and Mastercard in one of their key markets.The move comes as UnionPay faces intense competition in its home market from digital payments groups Alipay and WeChat Pay. It is also likely to add to the frustration of its US rivals, which have spent years trying to enter the Chinese market.The Chinese state-controlled group will team up with a UK company as early as next month to start issuing virtual pre-paid cards for British corporate clients to give to their staff for use via a mobile wallet when travelling in Asia.This will be followed by more deals to issue UnionPay branded credit cards elsewhere in Europe as early as December. “In Europe we want to target local customers in the domestic market, not only people travelling to Asia” said Zhihong Wei, head of UnionPay in Europe.Founded under a charter from the People’s Bank of China in 2002, UnionPay has a virtual monopoly on bank card payments in its domestic market, where it has issued 6bn cards — more than Visa and Mastercard combined.The Chinese group has been expanding internationally in recent years, mostly in Asia, and its cards are accepted by more than 41m merchants and 2m ATMs in 170 countries.It first moved into Europe a decade ago to provide access for Chinese tourists and its cards are now accepted by 60 per cent of merchants and ATMs in the region. It has offices in Paris, London, Madrid, Milan, Frankfurt and Budapest, with another set to open in Stockholm.Mr Wei said it did not need a licence for its European expansion plan as its cards will be issued by third parties, such as banks, and its transactions will be handled by payment processing groups.Six years after the World Trade Organization ruled that China discriminates against foreign payment groups, Visa and Mastercard have applied to Beijing for licences to clear renminbi payments but are awaiting approval.UnionPay operates with a business model similar to Visa and Mastercard, earning a commission on each card swipe. The currency-printing unit of the PBoC is its largest shareholder, with the remaining equity mostly held by state-owned financial institutions.But the rise of mobile payments in China — dominated by Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay — has dislodged UnionPay from its dominant position in electronic payments. Beyond the loss of fee income, the group is also losing access to valuable transaction data from consumers who have switched from plastic to mobile phones.However, Mr Wei said UnionPay was regaining ground on its digital rivals with its QuickPass system, which uses Near Field Communication (NFC) chips of the type used at subway turnstiles around the world and contactless card payments in the US and UK.The move to issue UnionPay-branded cards in Europe comes seven years after London department store Harrods became one of the early UK retailers to install a UnionPay point-of-sale terminal, prompting a spike in sales from Chinese students and tourists who were able to spend directly from their Chinese bank accounts.
25;MA;Mastercard Inc;2018-08-27T13:01:59Z;TSB delays moving millions of customers to new debit card;‘Big bang’ transfer from Visa to Mastercard postponed after IT failure earlier this year;TSB has been forced to delay a long-planned shift of customers to new debit cards while the troubled UK bank struggles to recover from a crippling IT failure earlier in the year.The bank had planned to transfer millions of customers from Visa debit cards on to Mastercard in a “big bang” migration later this year, but the move has been pushed back until 2019.TSB ran into problems in April when it moved all its customer data to an IT system designed by its new Spanish owner Sabadell. Hundreds of thousands of customers were locked out of online banking services for weeks, while staff were unable to complete many basic services in branches.The company had been hoping to return to normality in recent weeks but the aftermath of the IT outage continues to throw up problems, even in previously unaffected areas.Earlier this month, TSB said it had finally restored remortgaging services for existing mortgage-holders, which had been disabled since before the IT outage.However, customers renewed criticism of the bank after it emerged that waiting times for remortgaging advice appointments were up to six weeks and it was still unable to carry out “execution-only” switches that do not require such advice.Jonathan Holdcroft, a TSB customer whose fixed-rate mortgage deal ends this month, said: “The only [available] service is an ‘advice service’ which is meaningless as we know the product we want. Because TSB have been promising a fix for months, I’ve not been able to search the market for alternative products.”TSB’s problems cost it £176m in the first half of the year. This dragged into a loss and there may also be regulatory penalties to come.Last week it emerged that three of the company’s most senior executives are leaving in the coming months.TSB and Mastercard declined to comment on their commercial arrangements, but one person close to Mastercard said the debit card delay was likely to have costs for TSB.Mastercard is pushing hard to expand its debit card business in the UK, where Visa dominates.More than 95 per cent of debit cards in the UK use Visa Europe, which used to be owned by a group of regional banks. However, Mastercard has signed up several new customers, including Monzo and Santander, since Visa Europe was bought out by its US parent Visa Inc in 2016.TSB said: “We’re pleased to be working with Mastercard. The partnership presents lots of opportunities for TSB and our customers in 2019 and beyond.”Mastercard said: “TSB is a valued partner and we are working closely with them to roll out Mastercard Debit cards from 2019. By working together we will ensure TSB account holders have the best possible payment experience.”
26;MA;Mastercard Inc;2018-07-12T20:14:59Z;MasterCard customers suffer outages around the world;Problems arise just weeks after rival Visa hit technical problems;MasterCard has apologised after an outage at the credit card company blocked payments for customers using its cards around the world only weeks after its main rival Visa was hit by technical problems.It was not clear what caused the outage at MasterCard, which caused a surge in complaints to banks and other card issuers by frustrated customers unable to complete their payments. The credit card operator said on Thursday evening that the problem had been resolved.“We are aware that some issues were experienced and have been working hard to resolve it,” MasterCard said in an emailed statement. “The situation has been fully resolved and all transactions are now working as normal. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.”Regulators are already intensifying their scrutiny of apparent fragilities in the payments system after Visa suffered a serious outage in its European credit card network recently that left thousands of customers unable to complete transactions.Customers again took to social media to express their anger on Thursday. Sarah Louise Wilson in the UK tweeted: “Shame @Mastercard can’t communicate their current banking issues so that I can pay for my food shop! What a shambles!!!”Sharlene Sanders from the Netherlands tweeted: “On a business trip and just tried to pay hotel with @Mastercard . Didn’t work. Called @ING_news and the advice was, please pay with @Visa Ain’t that a peach? #fail.”The problems at MasterCard followed a broken switch at Visa that led to the failure of more than 5m attempted debit and credit card purchases during an outage across its European network.The Visa failure affected 2.4m transactions in the UK over a 10-hour period, forcing many stores to stop accepting card payments and prompting consumers in some areas to empty local ATMs.On Thursday MasterCard customers reported problems across much of Europe and America, but the US credit card company refused to provide an explanation for what caused it.Monzo, the UK digital bank, said in a tweet: “The Mastercard network had a partial outage starting at 6:05pm that caused some payments to decline. We are seeing card payments succeed as of 7:40pm and Mastercard have told us that the issue has been resolved.”TransferWise, the European digital payments company, said in a tweet that the problems at MasterCard were “affecting a large number of banks and that may cause some of your card payments to fail”.
27;MA;Mastercard Inc;2018-07-04T10:28:12Z;Legal row between retailers and card processors faces fresh delay;Court of Appeal ruled case will need to be reconsidered by competition tribunal;A legal battle between UK retailers including Sainsbury and Asda and credit card companies over card fees will have to be reconsidered by a competition tribunal, the Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.Three senior judges had been asked to decide three appeals brought by retailers including Asda, J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison against Visa and Mastercard over the level of so-called interchange fees which are costs that businesses face for processing card payments levied each time a credit card is used as payment by customers.The retailers had argued that the level of interchange fees set within the Mastercard and Visa payment card systems was an unlawful restriction of competition law. The case is important because it will have a bearing on the outcome of other lawsuits brought against Mastercard and Visa by retailers over interchange fees.Sir Terence Etherton, Master of the Rolls, said on Wednesday the fees were unlawful and restrictive of competition but also said that previous decisions in the UK courts had incorrectly decided certain points of law on issues of exemption.The Court of Appeal said it was planning to remit the three cases for reconsideration by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) which examines competition cases.The CAT will not be able to re-try the cases or hear new evidence but will be able to assess damages and whether a claim for exemption should apply to the credit card companies. The CAT hearing will be chaired by a High Court judge and all three cases are expected to be heard together.The decision means further delay in finally determining the case which has dragged on for at least five years.The three cases all went to the Court of Appeal earlier this year after judges gave different rulings in lower courts.The Competition Appeal Tribunal in 2016 ruled that Mastercard must pay £68.5m in damages to Sainsbury’s after judges found it had broken EU and UK competition laws on interchange fees. Sainsbury’s had to pay the fees under Mastercard’s payment scheme but it later claimed damages for the level of interchange fees saying it had breached the Competition Act.However Visa won a separate case against Sainsbury’s in 2017 when the High Court found that its UK fees were lawful. Another High Court judge decided in 2017 that fees charged by Mastercard were not anti-competitive in a case brought by Argos, Morrison and Asda.Mastercard said in a statement that it was reviewing the court’s decision. It said:“ . . . we continue to firmly believe that retailers derive real value from our network and we are committed to helping our retail partners grow their businesses and encourage the adoption of ever more convenient, safe and secure payments.” Visa declined to comment.Kate Pollock, co-head of competition litigation at Stewarts, the law firm which represented Asda, Argos and Morrison, said that it was pleased that the Court of Appeal had recognised that the fixing of interchange fees “was and is an unlawful infringement of competition law” subject to the question of exemption that is expected to be decided by the CAT in due course.“Our clients now look forward to a swift and final resolution of this matter.” she said.J Sainsbury said in a statement: “We are pleased with the Court of Appeal’s declaration that both Mastercard and Visa’s domestic interchange fees are restrictive of competition. We will consider the judgment carefully and remain confident in the next hearing at the Competition Appeal Tribunal which will examine whether there is any lawful level of interchange fee for either scheme and establish our damages.”This article has been amended to clarify the comments from Kate Pollock.
28;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Visa and Mastercard near $6.5bn settlement over swipe fees;Companies top up legal reserves in preparation for end of hostilities with merchants;Visa and Mastercard are closing in on a multibillion-dollar settlement to resolve a years-long antitrust lawsuit over the “swipe fees” they levy on US retailers and other companies that accept their cards.The two payment groups, along with several banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, would pay about $6.5bn to the merchants under the terms of the agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.Consumer-facing US companies, including large retailers such as Walmart and millions of smaller outlets, have long complained about the fees financial companies charge them each time a customer uses a credit card.Post-crisis regulation placed tight restrictions on debit card payment fees, but not credit cards. US merchants paid $97bn in card processing fees last year, according to The Nilson Report. That was up by $8.3bn from 2016.Visa and Mastercard credit cards carry typical merchant fees of more than 2 per cent.Merchants claim the costs are ultimately borne by consumers, through higher prices. They filed the antitrust case in 2005, arguing the financial companies suppressed competition and kept the charges excessively high.Card payment networks argue consumers benefit, in part through generous reward schemes.A $7.25bn settlement was reached in 2012, but some merchants contested the terms of that deal, which would have curbed their ability to sue in future, and a court rejected it.This week both sides asked a court in Brooklyn, New York, for more time — until mid-July — to reach an agreement. The proposed settlement was reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier.“This is a big deal, opening the door for both sides to commit resources and time elsewhere,” said Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha, a research group. But given the extent of legal battles between the two sides, he added: “Any rumoured death of swipe fee contention should merit confirmation by multiple coroners.”In a statement on Thursday, Mastercard said that it expected to increase reserves by $210m “as a result of advances in negotiations” with merchants, while Visa said it had deposited $600m into a litigation escrow account. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America declined to comment.
29;MA;Mastercard Inc;2018-06-25T14:32:31Z;Amex wins US Supreme Court backing for restrictions on merchants;Credit card group can block vendors from steering customers to cheaper payment methods;American Express secured victory in an eight-year legal battle over its terms and conditions for merchants on Monday, when the US Supreme Court said it can block them from steering customers to use cheaper credit card payment methods.The court voted 5-4 that Amex’s merchant restrictions do not stifle competition and said that consumers must be taken into account when weighing up harms and benefits in the credit card market.The ruling is a major victory for the credit card business over retailers and other merchants, who have long chafed at the costs and the restrictions involved in offering card payments to customers.And it could also have wide-ranging implications for other industries where businesses run so-called two-sided marketplaces.American Express is a two-sided platform, where the company deals with merchants on one side and consumers on the other side. The ruling could require antitrust enforcers to prove that increased prices on one side of a market are not outweighed by benefits on the other side.The key feature of transaction platforms is that they cannot make a sale to one side of the platform without simultaneously making a sale to the other“Both sides of the two-sided credit-card market — cardholders and merchants — must be considered,” wrote Justice Clarence Thomas, delivering the majority opinion.American Express shares rose almost 2 per cent on Monday. The company said the Supreme Court’s decision was “a major victory for consumers” as well as for Amex. “It will help to promote competition and innovation in the payments industry,” a spokesperson said.The Department of Justice and 17 states first sued American Express in 2010, along with rivals Visa and Mastercard, arguing that the terms they placed on merchants illegally constrained competition.Visa and Mastercard settled, but Amex fought the case. It argued that the restraint ensured a frictionless experience for customers, allowed it to offer rewards to credit card users, and prevented merchants from undermining its two-sided platform.David Kully, a partner at Holland & Knight, who previously served as chief of the section at the DoJ that sued American Express, said the question of whether the Supreme Court ruling applied to other markets that arguably have two-sided features would have to be litigated in the courts.A key question at the American Express trial in 2014 was the definition of the relevant market.The district judge who oversaw the case defined the market as the merchant side of the platform and said the burden was on American Express to show that any consumer benefit outweighed the harm on the merchant side.The decision was reversed by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which said both sides of the American Express business should have been included in the market definition. It ruled the government should have to prove that harms on one side of the platform outweigh benefits on the other.The state of Ohio led an appeal to the Supreme Court, which the justice department declined to support. On Monday, the court sided with American Express.“Evidence of a price increase on one side of a two-sided transaction platform cannot, by itself, demonstrate an anti-competitive exercise of market power,” wrote Justice Thomas.The Supreme Court cautioned that the need to look at both sides of a two-sided market would not necessarily apply to all cases. The court argued the standard was necessary in the credit card industry because merchants and customers were directly and inextricably linked at the moment of a transaction.“The key feature of transaction platforms is that they cannot make a sale to one side of the platform without simultaneously making a sale to the other,” said Justice Thomas in the opinion.
30;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Visa’s European payment systems back up after outage;Failure leaves businesses without services and highlights problems of cashless society;Visa said on Saturday its European payments network was running as normal after a “hardware failure” on Friday led to a continent-wide outage that left hundreds of small businesses without credit card services.Visa’s payment systems in Europe suffered a serious outage going into the weekend, leaving many businesses and customers across the continent unable to make or receive card payments.“We have no reason to believe this was associated with any unauthorised access or malicious event,” Visa said.The difficulties highlight one of the potential pitfalls of the increasing shift to a “cashless” society. Card payments accounted for 77 per cent of total UK retail sales in October 2017, according to industry body UK Finance. Some countries such as Sweden are even less reliant on cash.More than 95 per cent of debit cards in the UK run on Visa’s network.Paul Lewis, a journalist and personal finance expert, said: “When such problems occur, they seem to take the regulators by surprise. There should be more resilience in the systems that more and more of us rely on. But my advice has always been carry two or three cards, on different networks and providers, and also some cash for your immediate needs.”Users began reporting issues on Friday afternoon, with the outage leading many UK ATMs to run out of money as customers were forced to use cash.Ramzi Kozhani, manager of Cafe Brood by Southwark Cathedral in London, said he feared he had lost as much as £3,000 on a busy Friday afternoon because customers’ cards were declined.He said: “We have had maybe 100 customers affected today when we should be doing big business, and then had to bin the food.”While some retailers reported that they had stopped taking all card payments, larger companies said that not all customers were affected. A spokesperson for Asda, the supermarket chain, said it was experiencing issues in some stores, but its fuel and online sales had not been affected.Bank of Ireland said some of its customers were experiencing issues using their Visa cards, adding: “This is impacting multiple banks across Europe.”Mastercard, which powers a small number of debit cards and the majority of credit cards in the UK, said it had experienced no problems on its network.
31;MA;Mastercard Inc;2018-05-06T15:40:06Z;Unilever credit initiative aims to drive Africa revenues;Kenya scheme offers alternative lending to local traders to help increase sales;"Francis Magambo could not be happier. Sales of Unilever products at his Magson supermarket — a 35-square-metre, dimly lit shop in the Tassia district of Nairobi — have risen 40 per cent to Ks21,000 ($207) a week since January. He expects them to rise at least another 50 per cent in the next three months. The surge is not the result of a boycott of Unilever competitors or new-found wealth by residents in a neighbourhood where few roads are paved and many sewers are open streams. Mr Magambo has joined a project launched by the consumer goods company to help the tens of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses in Kenya sell its products, from margarine to washing detergent. With most traders not having bank accounts let alone a formal credit history, Unilever is using big data to unlock their hitherto extremely restricted access to credit, and thus expand its own sales. Bruno Witvoet, president of Unilever Africa, said the project, called “Jaza Duka”, or “Fill the Kiosks” in Swahili, highlighted the need to “look at different models” to succeed in sub-Saharan Africa, where most retail trade is through the informal sector. “To grow our business means developing volume,” he said. “And that means increasing coverage of traditional traders. But the cost of financing for these people is a real hurdle, it’s crippling many economies.” Other multinationals, including Procter & Gamble and East African Breweries, majority owned by Diageo, have started similar, but smaller, initiatives with 4G Capital, a Nairobi-based microfinance institution. Cash flow and access to credit are my crises. This has given me both because I don’t have to pay cash to increase my stockUnilever uses its traders’ purchasing history to determine whether they qualify for loans and the maximum credit available. Traders are given 17 days to repay the loans interest free. It has partnered with Kenya Commercial Bank, east Africa’s biggest lender by assets, and Mastercard, the payments company, to provide the finance and technology respectively. Under Jaza Duka, the money is loaned to Unilever’s distributors which supply the traders who then repay KCB directly, usually via a mobile money platform. The year-long pilot has involved 800 traders in and around Nairobi. The scheme will be rolled out to 35,000 retailers nationwide this month and then internationally. Mr Witvoet said Tanzania and Nigeria are among the countries being considered. Joshua Oigara, KCB’s chief executive, said the 97 per cent repayment rate among Jaza Duka traders highlighted how banks needed toadopt alternative methods of doing business.“The future of lending decisions is going to bebased on data, so we have to move away from the old model of know your customer,” he said. “Sometimes we don’t know them but the data show that theycan be trusted. It’s the ability to analyse the data that we are collecting and linking to the customer’s behaviour which is the reason for our success.” Deepak Dave, a Nairobi-based risk management expert, said that if the scheme succeeded there would be myriad benefits. “For Unilever, if this can work with KCB it should work with other banks as well, and the informal sector is being incentivised to formalise and professionalise so they can fall into the basket of trusted buyers,” he said. “As they formalise the country benefits because they become taxpayers.” The project is also likely to bolster Unilever’s reputation in Kenya, which suffered after former Unilever Tea Kenya employees tried to sue the company for alleged inadequate protection during election-related ethnic unrest in 2007. Hearings on whether the case can proceed in London were held in the UK Court of Appeal last week. Mr Magambo said Jaza Duka had “transformed” his business. “Cash flow and access to credit are my crises,” he added. “This has given me both because I don’t have to pay cash to increase my stock.” He said profits could rise as much as 10 per cent as the additional Unilever stock triggers additional sales of other products. Mohona Dey, Unilever’s manager for the project, admitted some traders are reluctant to participate. “There’s a local suspicion of banks in general and some [traders] have said if it seems too good to be true then it probably is and so ‘what’s the catch?’,” she said. “And we say there isn’t one.”Amasi Muriuki, who owns a kiosk in Tissa, is one such retailer. “My sales fell a lot last year during the political crisis,” she said, referring to Kenya’s disputed presidential elections. “I don’t want to take on extra stock yet. And I don’t want loans either.” Mr Witvoet recognised it would take time for the initiative to significantly affect Unilever’s Kenyan business — where informal traders account for just over 50 per cent of retail sales — let alone the broader African business, for which it does not break out revenues. “In Africa you’re bound to have a big vision,” he said. “But don’t believe you’re going to deliver the big vision in a couple of years; you really have to understand how you’re going to develop the various steps to get there.” In Tissa, Agnes Katulu was excited about obtaining her first loan — that enabled her to increase her Unilever stock by 50 per cent. “I will sell it all, I know my customers,” she said. “This will help me so much.” "

This was previously owned by a co-operative of European banks, with the value of each bank’s stake dependent on the volume of transactions they handled.Analysts warned at the time of the €21bn deal that it could allow Mastercard to win back some of the business that had previously been tied to its rival.TSB — which has around 4.5 per cent of the debit card market — is due to move its debit card portfolio to Mastercard later in the year which, with the Santander agreement, is expected to bring Mastercard’s market share close to 20 per cent.Matt Hall, Santander UK director of banking and unsecured credit, said the partnership “will enable us to give better payment solutions to our customers and look forward to rolling out the new cards from next year”.Mastercard’s push into the UK follows last year’s £700m acquisition of Vocalink, which builds real-time payments infrastructure, from a consortium of British banks.Vocalink is aiming to launch a separate service this year allowing customers to pay for online purchases directly from their current accounts, cutting out the need to use a debit card. The company has signed up several banks that issue cards through Visa — including Barclays and HSBC — to join the programme.
33;MA;Mastercard Inc;2018-03-19T04:00:47Z;MasterCard keeps options open on cryptocurrencies;Card company ‘happy to look at’ use of digital currencies issued by central banks;MasterCard would be “very happy to look at” facilitating the use of national digital currencies issued by central banks, a senior executive at the card company has told the Financial Times.Central banks including Sweden’s have considered creating their own cryptocurrencies that would have the same security and ease of use as decentralised cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, but would be backed by the central bank and would be less volatile.“If governments look to create national digital currency we’d be very happy to look at those in a more favourable way [compared with existing cryptocurrencies],” Ari Sarker, co-president of Mastercard's Asia-Pacific business, said. “So long as it’s backed by a regulator and the value . . . it is not anonymous, it is meeting all the regulatory requirements, I think that would be of greater interest for us to explore.” MasterCard and its rival Visa both made it more difficult for users to buy bitcoin this year by reclassifying such purchases as “cash transactions”, which attract higher fees.Mr Sarker said MasterCard was running a pilot enabling customers to cash out of bitcoin on to a MasterCard. There were strict “know your customer” and anti-money laundering controls, he added. MasterCard has no exposure to Bitcoin’s price, which oscillates wildly. “We are not operating trading of bitcoin through the MasterCard network,” Mr Sarker said. “[The pilot] is a toe in the water, we're fully cognisant of the reputational risk.” The pilot is running in Singapore and Japan but is not yet “of scale”. A MasterCard spokesman declined to give further details about potential dealings with national cryptocurrencies or the bitcoin pilot because the company had not announced either.The spokesman said Mastercard’s R&D division, MasterCard Labs, had filed for “more than 30 patents related to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency”. Blockchain is the distributed ledger that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.“MasterCard Labs is working on a blockchain technology that will support a wide range of use cases, including but not exclusive to [business to business] interbank payments, tracking trade finance obligations along the value chain, exchanging know your customer and anti-money laundering data between trusted parties, and more,” he added. Mr Sarker also said MasterCard had had “25 to 30 engagement discussions” with Asian cities about introducing the same kind of contactless payment system that is used on London transport. It has already run pilots in Singapore and Australia. The card company has also partnered with India’s national biometric ID system and its cards can be used for contactless payments on toll roads in the Philippines.
34;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
35;MA;Mastercard Inc;2018-03-15T05:00:35Z;MasterCard and IBM to set up European ‘data trust’;‘Truata’ aims to help businesses meet strict new EU privacy rules;MasterCard and IBM are teaming up to create one of Europe’s first “data trusts” in an attempt to help businesses meet strict new EU rules on how companies hold personal information that will come into force in two months. The independent company, called Truata, will manage, anonymise and analyse vast amounts of personal information held by companies such as travel agents and insurers in a way that is compliant under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It will be set up as a “data trust” under Irish law, which is seen as less stringent than in other countries, and be based in Dublin. Business are rushing to meet the May 25 deadline for the GDPR, which has been hailed as the biggest shake-up of global privacy rules in history. The new regime will force any company holding the personal information of an EU citizen to seek explicit content and delete it on request. These regulations are expected to present a significant challenge for companies that are not always aware how much information they have or where it is stored. Under the new regime, businesses will also face stringent new requirements to report cyber breaches within 72 hours of becoming aware of them.The fine for flouting the GDPR will reach up to 4 per cent of global turnover, or €20m, whichever is higher. Data trusts have been described as a particularly good option for smaller businesses without the resources to organise their own data. Data are a powerful resource but companies have a clear responsibility to protect itTruata will strip data sets of key details such as a person’s name, contact details or email address so they cannot be re-identified from the information. It will also offer analytical services to allow a business to extract valuable information from the data.Both IBM and MasterCard have provided initial investment and technological expertise to set it up. MasterCard will also become one of its first clients. The companies did not disclose the size of their stakes in Truata and are in talks with three other potential founder companies ahead of its official launch when the GDPR comes into effect.Felix Marx, a former MasterCard official who will become Truata’s chief executive, said the trust was the latest “evolution of the data economy”. He added that “medium and large-sized” companies from financial services, the travel sector and insurers have all shown interest about using the trust. Lawyers said the model could take time to gain traction with businesses eager to protect the competitive advantage afforded by having more data than rivals.“The first couple of data trusts are going to have a real public confidence hurdle to get over,” said Tom Guida, a lawyer at Fieldfisher. “People have to make a calculated risk that what they receive in return is bigger than what they contribute.” “Data are a powerful resource but companies have a clear responsibility to protect it,” said Arvind Krishna, director of IBM Research.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that IBM has not said it will be one of Truata’s first clients and to correct the date of GDPR’s launch.

For the full year, revenue grew 16 per cent to $12.5bn. Both figures were ahead of the median forecast from analysts in a Thomson Reuters survey.Net income in the three months ended December 31 fell to $227m from $933m a year earlier owing to a one-off hit from the recent change to the US tax act. The company’s adjusted earnings per share was $1.14 in the fiscal fourth quarter, up by one-third from a year ago and ahead of the $1.12 forecast by analysts.During the company’s conference call, MasterCard flagged revenue growth in 2018 toward the high end of low-double digits and that EPS would grow at a compound annual growth rate around the mid-20 per cent mark, up from a previous estimate of about 20 per cent.Shares were up 3.4 per cent to $173.78 in early afternoon trade on Wall Street.Consumers were the primary driver of US economic growth in 2017, lifting their spending by 3.8 per cent over the year. In December, recent data showed personal consumption rose 0.4 per cent.Rival Visa is due to report quarterly results after closing bell on Thursday.
37;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Traditional US retailers gain on holiday sales hopes;Kohl’s and Macy’s lead charge but Apple falls back on fears over iPhone sales;Shares in US retailers enjoyed a bounce on the first day of trading after Christmas on rising hopes of a strong holiday shopping season, but fading expectations over sales of Apple’s new iPhone weighed on the broader stock market.A host of traditional retailers and department store chains topped the table of the biggest stock market climbers on Tuesday, helping the S&P 500 retailing industry index gain 0.6 per cent and achieve a fresh record high.US retail sales, excluding automobiles, climbed 4.9 per cent between November 1 and Christmas Eve, the strongest pace of growth since 2011, according to MasterCard SpendingPulse, a unit of the credit card company that tracks internet and physical sales.Online shopping continued to accelerate, with e-commerce sales up 18.1 per cent over the period, according to MasterCard, and Amazon accounting for the bulk of the retailing index’s rise this year. The indications of a buoyant period overall helped boost the shares of many brick-and-mortar retailers that have been battered by internet competition.Kohl’s and Macy’s, two big US department store chains, were the best performers on Tuesday, up 6 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively to extend their December gains to 18.9 per cent and 12.8 per cent. Footlocker, Signet Jewelers, and Nordstrom were also among Tuesday’s biggest stock market winners.Amazon shares also rose after the company said it had its “biggest holiday season”, although it did not disclose sales figures. However, Apple ended the day down 2.5 per cent after analysts trimmed their forecasts for the new flagship iPhone X. The technology company is the single biggest company in the S&P 500 index, and its decline dragged the broader market down by 0.1 per cent.Although the holiday sales figures remain preliminary, many analysts are betting the trend will continue. Confidence among US households is the highest since 2000, according to the Conference Board, pushed up by the lowest rates of unemployment since the George W Bush years and rocketing stock and house prices.Household net worth in the US is at an all-time high, according to Deutsche Bank research, with low debt servicing costs helping support finances.“It’s been a solid holiday shopping season,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Consumer confidence is high, unemployment is low and although wage growth is slow, it is growing.”This helped underpin expectations that consumers will carry on spending at a rapid pace, sustaining gross domestic product growth readings of close to 3 per cent. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s estimate for fourth-quarter GDP growth is 2.8 per cent, with real consumer spending growth estimated at 2.9 per cent.The question is how sustainable the spending will prove, given the household savings rate has dropped to the lowest in a decade, at 2.9 per cent, with real spending growth in November outpacing rises in incomes.“It is the strongest consumer [performance] we have seen for some time because of the employment gains,” said Diane Swonk of DS Economics. However, she said sluggish wage growth — recorded at a year-on-year pace of 2.5 per cent for November — could hold spending growth back if it fails to pick up in the new year.Mr Arone pointed out that US retailers often rally in the peak spending season of the “Black Friday” shopping spree between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but frequently relinquish those gains once they start to report quarterly results.“This is probably a short-term phenomenon. The longer-term prospects are more negative,” he said. “The Amazon effect continues to put pressure on prices. That retailers have rallied so much in this shopping season means it’s probably not the time to add to positions.”Although trading on Tuesday was muted — most European markets remained closed for the Christmas holidays and volumes were light in the US — Apple’s decline was the worst one-day drop it has suffered since August 10 and pushed the company’s value firmly below the $900bn mark.Still, for traditional retailers the healthy December sales are a welcome fillip after a tough year. A clutch of big names — such as Claire’s, Gymboree, True Religion and Toys R US — have slipped into bankruptcy and others have been forced to close thousands of outlets across the US. While the S&P 500 retailing index has climbed nearly 30 per cent this year, Amazon alone accounts for about two-thirds of its gains in 2017.Despite the late-2017 rally, Macy’s shares are down by almost 25 per cent this year and two-thirds since their 2015 peak, and many analysts expect Sears, the venerable department store chain founded in 1886, to fall into bankruptcy in 2018. Its shares are down over 90 per cent since mid-2015.

Lloyds declined to comment.Investor interest in trading cryptocurrencies has prompted Chicago’s two largest derivatives exchanges to go head to head in the coming weeks as both launch bitcoin futures trading.However, Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, recently dismissed bitcoin as “a fraud” and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has warned that unregistered bitcoin exchanges are susceptible to “Ponzi schemers”.Revolut said its cryptocurrency transactions would be done through the Bitstamp and GDAX bitcoin exchanges, which both say they carry out anti-money laundering checks and sanction compliance screening on trades.“Despite being one of the hottest trends in the world right now, getting exposure to cryptocurrency has notoriously been time-consuming and expensive,” said Nikolay Storonsky, the Russian-born founder and chief executive of Revolut.“Cryptocurrency exposure has consistently been the number one requested feature from our customers and so we listened and took action.”Mr Storonsky, a former investment banker at Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse, said that “beta testing” of the service had seen about 10,000 customers trade more than $1m of cryptocurrencies.Revolut said its users would be able to invest in bitcoin, litecoin and ether at a cost of 1.5 per cent in a transaction taking 30 seconds to complete.They will not be able to directly pay for goods using cryptocurrencies. But if their debit card runs out of fiat currency the app will automatically convert enough cryptocurrency to cover a purchase or cash withdrawal.

It said about $1.5bn remained under that programme.MasterCard also announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 to be paid on February 9, up 14 per cent from the previous quarter.The company reported a larger-than-expected rise in third-quarter profits and revenues in October as higher transaction volumes and steady global growth bolstered its business.

Those dividends are covered only 1.4 times by earnings for a reason, too. Political unanimity in seeking to cap “rip-off” energy bills after a collapse in the oil price has halved the valuation of the British Gas owner in five years, just as its earnings have cooled by 36 per cent.So shareholders can only have shuddered at the prime minister’s latest vow to “fix” an apparently free market. What, then, should they make of Monday’s pre-emptive tariff changes from Centrica? It is time to de-ice The Lombard Disambiguator™, and fire it up to interpret the announcement.“Centrica proposals to reform UK Energy Market: . . . as market leader, we are announcing seven unilateral steps we will take, and proposing a further seven recommended actions for [regulator] Ofgem and the Government.”As market leader, we need to do something before the process slides any further away from us, and our recommended action for the prime minister is to stop making populist speeches in the middle of a consultation process before Ofgem’s own recommendations come out.“We fully recognise that the energy market can and should be improved.”We fully recognised there was trouble brewing in 2013 when Labour leader Ed Miliband found voters warming to a price freeze.“We believe more action is needed and are ready to play a leading role.”We believe our recommendation to the Competition & Markets Authority 18 months ago was scrapping controversial standard variable tariffs but no one is giving us credit for it.“Further price controls will only set this back.”Further price controls have set Spain back €29bn, or 3 per cent of GDP. That’s the “tariff deficit”: the difference between the retail price cap and the actual energy costs. Price controls also mean all providers cluster around a capped price, reducing competition. Just look at university tuition fees!“A temporary price cap . . . is based on the claim by the CMA that customers are losing out to the sum of £1.4bn a year . . . £1.4bn is more than the total annual profits generated by all suppliers.”A temporary price cap would totally wipe out our margins. RBC analysts reckoned that even without the “Armageddon scenario” of a cap, our margins will trend down to the low end of our 4-6 per cent guidance, post tax.“This has in turn created uncertainty for Centrica and our shareholders.”This has in turn created even less reason to hold our shares. Have you seen the price?“Centrica has already taken a number of measures . . . reducing our own costs to enable cheaper offers.”Centrica has already taken £600m in costs out of the business since 2015, and those savings, plus higher margin home servicing revenues, could mitigate total margin compression, as long as that compression comes from our post-2013 enthusiasm for competition, not your post-election enthusiasm for intervention. Brrrr.Glint of Gold was the less successful progeny of Derby-winning racehorse Mill Reef, having the misfortune to spend a career being overshadowed by Shergar, writes Kate Burgess. Glint, the fintech group of Shoreditch traders and hedgies, will be hoping for more success — and certainly seems to have a gleam in its eye.Britain’s government abandoned gold as a way of backing its account more than 80 years ago. Now Glint has come up with a debit card offering the opportunity to pay in gold, or many other currencies, accessed via a smartphone app.Its founders talk of a return to a golden era in money, before coins and paper. But they appear to be playing to the paranoia of bunker-dwellers who worry the world is about to go to hell in a handcart. Glint’s card is not for those who fret about cyber security, though: the company is an electronic money institution — it is not regulated as a bank able to take deposits. Its origins are firmly in the 21st century, where gold is really just another form of moolah like greenbacks and euros. See terms and conditions for fees.And like its equine namesake, the company is likely to be overshadowed, with the runaway cryptocurrency winner, bitcoin, setting the pace.Given their rarefied tastes, Goldman Sachs’ London bankers are unlikely to be relieved that website Versus.com ranks Paris and Frankfurt equally for price of a Big Mac and “possibility of drinking alcohol in public places”. They are more likely to be horrified that boss Lloyd Blankfein has said the bank will have one post-Brexit hub near all 10 of Paris’ 3-Michelin-star restaurants, and another near all none of Frankfurt’s.Even Mr Blankfein admits “many Americans would prefer living in Paris”. Expect productivity in Goldman’s Fleet Street office to soar between now and the first quarter next year, when all the desk plans — and table plans — will need to be in place.matthew.vincent@ft.com
41;MA;Mastercard Inc;2017-11-14T11:38:03Z;Global banks launch real-time payments in US;;"A group of the largest global banks have launched real-time payments
in the US, allowing consumers and businesses to send and receive money
instantly between bank accounts.The Clearing House, which is owned by the global lenders, has worked
with Mastercard’s Vocalink, a payments infrastructure company, to
create a system that enables domestic payments in the US to be
concluded in seconds, rather than days.The development is transformative for the US payments sector, which is
dominated by cheque and credit card usage, and represents the first
new payments system in the US for over 40 years.The launch follows the advent of similar real-time payment systems in
the UK, Singapore and Thailand by Vocalink.In the UK, Faster Payments was launched in 2008 to reduce payment
times between different banks’ customer accounts from the three
working days that transfers take using the long-established BACS
system, to typically a few hours.The new US service operates 24/7, allowing money to be sent between
bank accounts instantly with immediate confirmation of its receipt.Paul Stoddart, CEO of, Vocalink, said the US “is not only aligned with
other markets, but is a trailblazer in the payments sector”.Unlike other real-time payment systems elsewhere in the world, the US
allows more information to be sent with payments, such as confirmation
messages.The new service will also benefit businesses, which will be able
to receive instant payments and invoices, helping to reconcile
accounts.Jim Aramanda, chief executive of The Clearing House, said the launch
“is a significant development for America’s banks, consumers and
businesses”.“We will provide increased efficiency and solve problems for
businesses large and small as they track and reconcile payments. This
new capability provides an opportunity for banks and others to add
value for their customers.”"
42;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Millennials play in the credit card casino;Amex and JPMorgan are the biggest winners from a closed financial system;Kenneth Chenault knows how to play the game of life: the chairman and chief executive of American Express has received at least $370m during his 17-year tenure there. He was declared “the gold standard for corporate leadership”, by Warren Buffett, a long-time Amex investor, when he announced his departure.Mr Chenault also knows when to take his chips off the table. The US credit card business, especially for high end cards such as Amex Platinum, is more competitive than it used to be. A points scramble has intensified since JPMorgan Chase launched its Sapphire Reserve card last year, with an annual fee of $450 and an initial sign-up bonus worth $1,500 in points.His departure is an opportunity to ask questions about how card companies prosper, particularly in the US. The Supreme Court this month agreed to hear a case challenging Amex’s practice of barring merchants from steering customers towards cards that charge lower transaction fees. The ultimate question is who loses and who wins in what is an oddly structured market.The traditional answer to the question is clear enough: people who pay for goods and service in cash lose, while card holders gain. As one study found, it involves “a regressive transfer from low income to high income consumers . . . amplified substantially by the practice of paying rewards”.This is how the transfer works: companies such as Visa, MasterCard and Discover levy a charge on sellers of two per cent for each transaction (Amex’s average merchant charge is 2.4 per cent, which is why it tries to stop steering). Stores are barred by contract from charging card users more, so prices rise about 1 per cent for everyone, whether they pay by cash or card.Some of the fees are channelled back by credit card companies to their customers in rewards and, since Discover launched the first cashback card in 1986, cash rebates averaging 1 to 2 per cent. Since rewards cards such as Amex tend to be held by people with prime credit scores, they gain most.The big winner is the house, as in any casino. Amex charged $18.7bn in merchant fees last year and paid out $6.8bn in rewardsRecently, the market has become more like a game. The Sapphire Reserve card shook up Amex by offering top users superior rewards in return for a large annual fee. Those who play their cards right, earning triple points for travel and dining, can gain high returns. A Sapphire Reserve card holder could gain $7,950 net of fees over 10 years, Barclays analysts estimate.This has sparked a contest among millennials with good credit, an aptitude for games, and time to plan their spending cleverly. Some apply for multiple cards to maximise rewards, unlike traditional users. “The question is not just how much disposable income you have but how much disposable time,” says Robert Harrow, an analyst at the research group ValuePenguin.The contest has made life less comfortable for Amex, which had to raise its rewards by 21 per cent in the third quarter of this year. The total rewards paid by the top six US card issuers doubled to $23bn between 2010 and 2016, attracting more people to use credit. US credit card debt now exceeds $1tn, and Americans rate credit cards as their favourite payment method.Like casinos, card issuers do not want their customers to master their games too well. Casinos frown on blackjack players who change the odds by counting cards, although it is legal. Both Amex and JPMorgan strive to prevent people signing up for cards for welcome rewards and later dropping them. Amex changed its terms this year to prohibit “abuse, misuse or gaming”.The big winner is the house, as in any casino. Amex charged $18.7bn in merchant fees last year and paid out $6.8bn in rewards. Most card users are not single-minded enough to obtain the highest potential returns. Discover card holders can get 5 per cent cash back per quarter on $1,500 of purchases in some categories, but its average rewards rate is only 1.3 per cent.Amex gains most from what it calls its “closed loop” — it issues cards and handles transactions. Its degree of control has similarities to Nintendo, which sells both consoles and games and this week raised sales projections for its Switch console. Complete control has its privileges: Amex’s US card business made a 35 per cent return on capital last year, far higher than investment banks.The growth of super-prime cards has increased competition but it ultimately reinforces the credit card networks. The largest transfer of wealth is now from poorer cash buyers to millennial gamers but the latter have to work hard for their points and are rewarded in the currency of the card issuer.While rewards have risen, little has affected where they come from — the US card market’s high transaction fees. Unlike the EU, which capped some transaction fees in 2015, the US relies largely on competition to minimise card purchasing costs and the price distortions that they create.To judge by the profitability of Amex and others, competition is not working as well as it should. More of the “swipe economics” of transactions are being passed through to the most energetic users but there is room for reform in the market as a whole.

43;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;US stocks edge higher as investors digest earnings, await Fed;;US stocks inched up on Tuesday buoyed by upbeat results from MasterCard and Mondelez and as markets await fresh details on Republican tax cuts and look ahead to the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision.The S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to 2,575.94 — led by a 0.6 per cent increase in the consumer staples sector and offset by a 0.5 per cent slide in the real estate sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 23,379.59, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 6,716.26.Stocks ended the day lower on Monday amid a string of political developments that included the announcement of the first charges to stem from Robert Mueller’s probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. But Wall Street was lifted after MasterCard reported upbeat quarterly results driven by higher transaction volumes and after snack maker Mondelez, late on Monday, posted better-than-expected third quarter profits.The moves also came as markets await details on Republican plans for tax reform and the Fed’s latest monetary policy decision, due on Wednesday, where expectations are for policymakers to sit pat. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is expected to nominate a new Fed chair on Thursday.On the economic front, investors largely overlooked a fresh batch of data. The employment cost index rose 2.5 from a year ago in the third quarter and 0.7 per cent from the previous quarter, in line with consensus.“That’s hardly an alarming pace, but it is creeping higher, and the Fed is concerned that the further decline in unemployment this year will drive faster increases next year,” Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said. Meanwhile, the Case-Shiller home prices index rose 5.9 per cent in August shy of the 6 per cent increase that economists had forecast, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.Elsewhere, the dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of peers, rose 0.1 per cent to 94.61. While, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury, which moves inversely to price, rose 0.2 basis points to 2.368 per cent.
44;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;MasterCard earnings, sales jump on higher transaction volumes;;MasterCard revealed on Tuesday a bigger than expected rise in its quarterly profits and revenues, bolstered by higher transaction volumes amid steady growth in the global economy.The New York-based company said its revenues climbed 18 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter to $3.4bn. Net income rose to $1.4bn, or $1.34 a share, from $1.2bn, or $1.08 a share in the same three-month period in 2016.Wall Street analysts had forecast EPS of $1.23, on revenues of $3.28bn.“These results reflect a continued momentum in strengthening and extending relationships with our partners and customers,” said chief executive Ajay Banga.MasterCard provides the means for merchants to process credit card sales by authorising transactions and facilitating the transfer of funds between both parties. Like its US rival Visa, it has benefited from an uptick both in the global economy and the usage of credit cards by consumers.Switched transactions at MasterCard climbed 17 per cent to $16.9bn in the third quarter, meanwhile the gross dollar volume of transactions rose 10 per cent to $1.4tn. Cross-border transactions were up 15 per cent.MasterCard shares have rallied this year by 44.3 per cent, part of a broad rally in the shares of technology companies. They advanced 1.1 per cent in pre-market action in New York.
45;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Lawyers take central role in transformational business deals;Novel remedies to competition challenges ensure significant mergers went more smoothly;Jonathan de Lance-Holmes is a self-confessed “sucker” for a “cool” gig. And few gigs come cooler than the one that crossed his desk at Linklaters in London last year.SoftBank, the phenomenally acquisitive Japanese technology company, wanted to launch a $100bn fund that would attract private money to make substantial investments in the emerging generation of innovators — the next Apples and Ubers — that will shape a new era of technological innovation.“We only live once, so I want to think big. I have no intention of making small bets,” Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s chief executive, told investors in May. “My life really starts from here.”Mr de Lance-Holmes, a partner and funds specialist at Linklaters, learnt of SoftBank’s plans for the Vision Fund on a Thursday morning. Five days later, he was in Tokyo pitching to SoftBank’s chief executive. He left that meeting with a mandate to develop a document of planned terms and conditions, and so began a frenetic eight months for him and an army of colleagues.Their output? The launch of a technology fund whose unprecedented size promises to affect Silicon Valley ‘s investment landscape dramatically, not to mention SoftBank’s own business, which co-invests with the fund and reaps profits above a certain threshold.While the stakes of the SoftBank transaction are unparalleled, there are plenty of other examples of lawyers taking a central role in transformational business deals over the past year.For instance, in Italy, nifty legal work by two in-house teams and their law firms led to the European Commission allowing the €21.8bn merger of the country’s third and fourth-largest telecoms companies, Wind and 3 Italia, even though it had blocked similar consolidation in Denmark and the UK.In the UK, lawyers found a novel way to help payments specialist Vocalink sell its entire business to MasterCard, overcoming the UK competition commission’s strong concerns about the deal.For Mr de Lance-Holmes at Linklaters, the sheer scale of SoftBank’s scheme was the initial draw, along with the chance to create a fund from scratch, with “a blank sheet of paper”.SoftBank was used to doing enormous deals very fastThere was also the prospect of some unique challenges. First, funds are usually set up in an attempt to minimise conflicts of interest between investors and fund managers. In SoftBank’s case, certain conflicts were fundamental and unavoidable — SoftBank’s strategy of investing in technology companies itself would have to coexist with the fund’s strategy to also invest in technology companies.SoftBank was “used to doing enormous deals very fast”, says Mr de Lance-Holmes, and initially wanted to have a fund closed by the start of 2017. The eventual date was May 2017.To pull this off within eight months, Mr de Lance-Holmes and his team had to find a novel construct of offshore vehicles and onshore exemptions that would allow the fund to be launched before regulatory approval by the Financial Conduct Authority had been granted.As the project progressed, Linklaters, which previously had a limited relationship with SoftBank, became involved in aspects ranging from employment law to tax structuring for the new venture. Other companies may want to follow in SoftBank’s footsteps, but Mr de Lance-Holmes foresees this will be a small group. “You have to be very good at doing something in a way that you can show that it produces measurable financial gain,” he says. On top of that, companies have “to be prepared to live with the consequences” and accept that they are binding themselves to things they can and can’t do “for an extended period of time”.In Italy, the legal teams working round the clock on the Wind and 3 Italia merger would have been happy with an “extended period of time”, if only the European Commission would let them. Antonio Bavasso and his team at Allen & Overy were trying to create Italy’s biggest mobile phone company by winning approval for the merger of 3 Italia, owned by CK Hutchison, and Wind, controlled by Veon.“This is a transaction that came at a very delicate moment of European consolidation,” says Mr Bavasso, who advised Veon (formerly VimpelCom). Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner had blocked a similar deal involving TeliaSonera and Telenor in Denmark and the £10.5bn takeover of operator O2 by Three in the UK.The critical moment came when the commission opened an investigation in March 2016. Veon and 3 Italia’s owner CK Hutchison, advised by Freshfields, opted for a “fix it first” remedy, in which they offered to sell some of the merged entity’s assets to promote competition.Scott Dresser, group general counsel at Veon, says Allen & Overy’s combined government relations expertise and strategic focus was a key strength. “[Mr Bavasso] has an ability to read where the sensitivities lie, to work with the commission,” he says.The team at Freshfields also had extensive experience of the issues involved because they had previously advised Hutchison on the acquisition of Orange in Austria and Telefónica O2 in Ireland. Natasha Good, a partner at Freshfields, credits that “unique insight” with helping get a deal over the line, which “shows that large-scale consolidation in the mobile market is still possible”.Mr Dresser’s point about finding ways to navigate competition challenges is echoed by Jackie Holland, a special adviser at Slaughter and May, who says the lawyers’ achievement on the £700m Vocalink deal will reassure others that competition challenges are surmountable.Ms Holland began working with Vocalink when its owners — a group of 18 leading UK banks and building societies — faced being forced into a sale by the UK’s payment services regulator.MasterCard emerged as the preferred buyer for Vocalink, which processed more than half of all payments made in the UK in 2015. Then the banks hit a new competition hurdle, when the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said MasterCard and Vocalink were two of the three most likely bidders for a contract to service the Link network, which executes payments through the UK’s cash machines.“The standard remedy a competition agency would go for is a divestment,” Ms Holland says. “This wasn’t an attractive option for the Vocalink team because the cables and IT that were used for the Link network included some parts that were also used for other [Vocalink] services.”Slaughter and May and Vocalink’s in-house team together came up with a “network access remedy” that undertook to allow third parties to piggyback off Vocalink’s infrastructure the next time the Link contract came up.Ms Holland says the outcome does not imply that the CMA will approve “network access” remedies in all cases of competition issues, but it shows that in some “it is worth considering other remedies that may solve the competition issue, rather than viewing divestment as the only option”.Novel solutions to competition challenges will be in even greater demand in the future — with financing still cheap and organic growth hard to come by, companies are especially motivated to make sure that the M&A deals or other expansions they plot make it over the finishing line.
46;MA;Mastercard Inc;2017-08-28T13:01:55Z;New Fitbit smartwatch and headphones take aim at Apple;Partnership with Adidas marks effort to regain leadership of wearable tech market;Fitbit is teaming up with Adidas as it takes on Apple with its first fully-fledged smartwatch, Ionic, and new wireless headphones. Ionic is the first of what Fitbit chief executive James Park said would be a series of smartwatches, as it looks to regain its position at the top of the wearable technology market, a position that analysts say it has lost to Apple Watch in recent months. The $300 device — which boasts four-day battery life, new wireless music and payment features, and improved GPS and heart-rate tracking — will go on sale in October. Adidas, the German sportswear group, will sell a special edition of Ionic starting early next year, boosting Fitbit’s profile in Europe and Asia. In Fitbit, Adidas has a new ally against Nike, which first partnered with Apple on a customised version of its Watch last year. Adidas lags behind Nike in the US sportswear market but has been gaining share in recent months. Fitbit is banking on Ionic to reverse its declining sales, as simpler fitness trackers reach saturation point in many developed markets. The San Francisco-based company’s revenues this year are expected to fall by as much as a quarter compared with 2016. Ionic’s launch is “definitely a big event in the company’s history”, Mr Park said in an interview. “We’ve rarely entered a new category with this much effort and push behind it.” While the majority of Fitbit’s revenues in the fourth quarter will still come from its earlier products, Mr Park added: “Our entry into smartwatches — and Ionic is not the only product in our smartwatch road map — allows us to re-establish a growth profile for Fitbit looking forward.” [The Ionic’s] upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoeaThe unveiling of Ionic, alongside new Flyer wireless headphones and updated Aria scales, comes ahead of the anticipated new version of the Apple Watch, which is expected to include a cellular wireless connection when it makes its debut next month. Ionic, which unlike an Apple Watch works with both iOS and Android smartphones, features a slimline design that Fitbit says was inspired by the space age. Its upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoea. A colour touchscreen will also offer guided workout sessions, powered by a revamped Fitbit Coach app, and customisable watch faces. Analysts at Gartner estimate that 41.5m smartwatches will be sold globally this year, up 19 per cent from 2016, generating $9.7bn in revenues. The consultancy predicts that smartwatches will be the second best-selling kind of wearable device by 2019, after Bluetooth headsets. Fitbit’s $130 Flyer wireless headphones, which pair automatically with Ionic watches, are designed to be workout friendly with a secure and sweat-proof design. While Flyer headphones, at $130, are cheaper than Apple’s $160 AirPods, the Ionic is at least $30 more expensive than the cheapest available Apple Watch. Gartner estimates the average selling price of a smartwatch is $223. Mr Park believes Ionic can command a premium price because of its four-day battery life (Apple Watch lasts just a day or two), improved GPS reception thanks to “nanomoulding technology” that he says is unique in wearables, and the ability to stream music from Pandora, the internet radio company. Thanks to the acquisitions of Coin and Pebble last year, Fitbit’s watch will also support third-party apps, such as Starbucks and Strava, as well as contactless payments with Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards. Although multi-day battery life means Ionic can track sleep, continuous use of both music and GPS will consume all the device’s power reserves in around 10 hours. Like the Apple Watch, Ionic’s screen remains dark until wearers raise their arm or push a button, in order to lengthen battery life. Customers can order an Ionic starting on August 28, with the first shipments arriving in late September. The device will go on general sale in October.
47;MA;Mastercard Inc;2017-08-18T04:09:45Z;Charlottesville teaches Big Tech a lesson in accountability;Facebook, Google and other groups clamp down on white nationalists;For years now, the big internet groups have insisted that they should not be held responsible for the material their users post. Casting themselves as conduits rather than content providers, Facebook, Google and the gang have argued that intensive monitoring would not only be prohibitively expensive, but also run the risk of curtailing freedom of expression.There is nothing like a violent, racist mob for changing minds.In the wake of last weekend’s white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, the big technology companies — alongside financial services firms — have suddenly discovered that there is more that they can do. After the Daily Stormer published an article making fun of an anti-racism protester who died in the violence, GoDaddy, world’s largest domain registrar, cancelled the site’s web hosting account. When the Daily Stormer tried to move to Google, it followed suit. Now Twitter has deleted several accounts associated with the same site, and cyber security group Cloudflare has stopped providing it with protection from hackers.For their part, Facebook and Reddit have removed several white nationalist groups from their sites. Spotify has pulled tracks by “hate bands” from its music streaming service.Payments groups including MasterCard, Visa and PayPal are also taking new action to block hate groups from receiving money through their websites, and Apple pulled support from white supremacist sites that had been using its online payments service to sell Nazi merchandise. They acted after pressure from activists such Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change. He pointed out that their processing fees were “quite literally profiting off hate and murder”.None of these steps are unprecedented. The financial groups routinely prevent people from using their payments systems for illegal products — online gambling, banned drugs. Social media groups have in recent months stepped up their efforts to spot and remove terrorist and other hate group posts and videos after coming under sharp criticism.But the flurry of activity after the Charlottesville march suggests that the attitudes have shifted sharply in the last few days.Not only have the tech and finance companies taken action to starve hate groups of money and online exposure, but a host of US chief executives quit President Donald Trump’s business councils after he failed to denounce the neo-Nazi and far right violence.Apple’s Tim Cook spelt out his reasoning in a memo to employees: “We must not witness or permit such hate and bigotry and we must be unequivocal about it.”There is a danger. In their rush to distance themselves from violent hate groups, some businesses could end up overreacting. Civil liberties groups are already warning that there is a clear difference between groups that advocate violence and those that are merely deeply unpopular. “Racism and bigotry will not be eradicated if we merely force them underground,” said Anthony Romero of the American Civil Liberties Union.Businesses are well within their rights to stop providing services and exposure to violent hate mongers, whether they are Islamic terrorists or white nationalists. But as Cloudflare’s chief executive Matthew Prince has already warned, Google and Facebook should not have the last word on who is entitled to free speech.brooke.masters@ft.com
48;MA;Mastercard Inc;2017-08-17T01:28:14Z;US companies crack down on key services for hate groups;Move to halt access to funds adds to Silicon Valley squeeze on internet use;US companies are blocking hate groups from key services such as payments, cyber security defences and social media sites after the violence in Charlottesville, despite questions over the consequences for freedom of speech.Leading payment and credit card groups MasterCard, American Express, Discover Financial Services and Visa have joined Silicon Valley companies Twitter and Cloudflare to become the latest corporations to try to block neo-Nazis’ access to funds and the internet.Several of the payments companies said they did not ban the use of their services because the customers expressed offensive views but because they violated their terms of service or incited violence.Discover said “in light of recent events” it was “terminating merchant agreements with hate groups, given the violence incited by their extremist views”.MasterCard said it was “shutting down the use of our cards on sites that we believe incite violence, as well as those who are wrongfully suggesting they accept our cards, when in fact they don’t”.American Express said it was reviewing websites brought to its attention by activists and would take “appropriate action”.Visa said “a number of” sites it reviewed had engaged in illegal activities or failed to meet issuers’ acceptable-use policies.PayPal has also stopped enabling money transfers to websites that violate its policies by promoting “hate, violence or racial intolerance”.The payments companies had come under pressure from activists such as Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, who said they were “making hundreds of thousands of dollars from processing fees for these racist groups and quite literally profiting off hate and murder”.Apple confirmed on Wednesday that it had pulled support for a handful of white supremacist sites that had been using its online payments service to sell merchandise such as T-shirts and bumper stickers bearing Nazi logos and slogans. Guidelines for Apple Pay state that sites “may not incorporate Apple Pay into a website that promotes hate, violence, or intolerance based on race, age, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation”, while the iPhone’s App Store also prohibits various kinds of “objectionable content”.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, was quick to condemn the weekend’s violence in Charlottesville, tweeting on Monday morning: “We’ve seen the terror of white supremacy & racist violence before. It’s a moral issue — an affront to America. We must all stand against it.”Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, Twitter and Cloudflare have also joined a tech industry effort to block neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer from the internet. The site posted an offensive article about the woman who died in the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.The San Francisco-based messaging platform appeared to have suspended several accounts that are associated with the website, such as @dailystormer and @dailystormers, but did not respond to a request for comment.Cloudflare ended its business with the site, which it protected from distributed denial of service attacks designed to take it offline.Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, said he was also worried about the consequences of the “dangerous” decision he made to drop the site. He was concerned that it could lead to “vigilante justice”, where hackers can launch attacks because no one will protect certain sites, and questioned whether it made his company more vulnerable to a government pressuring them to take down a site.In the end, Mr Prince said he decided to remove the site after a Daily Stormer commenter claimed Cloudflare was “one of us” and he did not want the company to appear to sympathise with readers of the neo-Nazi site. “We could not remain neutral after these claims of secret support by Cloudflare,” he said in a blog post.The tech companies follow GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar, which removed the site. The Daily Stormer then tried to switch to Google Domains but Google said it would not host the site because it represented an “incitement to violence”. The Daily Stormer then transferred to a Russian domain name, but that can no longer be reached, probably because it is no longer protected from hackers attempting to take it offline.Facebook and Reddit have removed several white nationalist groups, while Spotify, the music streaming service, said it had removed tracks by “hate bands” as classified by the Southern Poverty Law Center.But some believe tech companies are overstepping their role by effectively banning sites from the internet.Nate Cardozo, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit defending digital privacy and free speech online, said there is a difference between Facebook deciding content violates its policies in its walled garden, and infrastructure providers “pulling the plug”.“If an internet service provider wants to deny me the opportunity to read offensive speech like the Daily Stormer, that’s a problem,” he said. “There doesn’t seem to be any suggestion the Daily Stormer was hosting illegal content, just terrible content. We should be able to see it and reject it.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in Los Angeles
49;MA;Mastercard Inc;2017-08-16T11:08:42Z;Priceline: tripping up;The online travel agent may have to settle for lower growth;"Ageing disrupters always like to pretend they still have plenty of room for expansion. So MasterCard would rather talk about the continued opportunity to replace cash than its gnarlier war with Visa or newer payments companies.Priceline, for its part, defines its battlefield as the “global accommodation business” where it has only a “single-digit market share”. Even at the age of 20, the online travel agent sees plenty of room to grow.The spin is undermined by the slowdown which Priceline predicts. Its third-quarter earnings forecast last week sent the stock down 7 per cent. Room nights booked should increase 11-16 per cent year-on-year, Priceline said, a sharp deceleration from the 21 per cent growth in the second quarter. That was its lowest growth on record.Analysts hope Priceline is lowballing. At least three of them deemed its forecast “conservative”. Understandable, given that the company has beaten its revenue guidance in every quarter bar one over 10 years, according to Bloomberg. But beware the extent of its conservatism: the average beat is only 4 per cent.So the business is slowing. It could simply ramp up marketing spending. Priceline is holding back, in part because it is seeing costs per click increase in some channels. This is surprising given Google’s decline in CPCs; TripAdvisor, another travel portal has also reported lower CPCs.If Priceline cannot spend effectively, for whatever reason, settling for lower growth is acceptable. Its market share, especially with its successful European business Booking.com, is still strong, easily leading Expedia at the top of the online travel market. It enjoys the margins of a mature business, 35 per cent at the operating level, and could go higher. Unfortunately, its $85bn enterprise value needs support from a fast-growing business. The management has clearly signalled that no longer exists."

The tribunal ruled on Friday to block the action.The case claimed that MasterCard had allegedly infringed EU competition law by imposing cross-border charges on the use of debit and credit cards — known as interchange fees — on retailers over a 16-year period ending in 2008. This cost was then passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services, it alleged.The litigation was one of the first to be brought under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which enables consumers to bring collective damages claims on behalf of large numbers of individuals who have suffered losses under competition law.Walter Merricks, the former financial ombudsman, applied to spearhead the class action and instructed law firm Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. If the case had been allowed to proceed it would have tested the limits of the new laws as an extremely complex piece of litigation.Mr Merricks said on Friday he was considering the possibility of an appeal and was “surprised and disappointed” by the tribunal’s decision.“The new collective action regime was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements. I am concerned that this new regime designed to benefit consumers may never get off the ground,” Mr Merricks said.MasterCard said in a statement: “We welcome the Competition Appeal Tribunal’s judgment refusing certification for the proposed collective action. As set out in Mastercard’s arguments to date, we believe that the claims were completely unsuitable to be brought under the collective actions regime. The tribunal sided with this position.”The number of potential claimants involved in the proposed action was so large because the law allows individuals to be automatically included in this type of litigation unless they opt out.The case had been eagerly awaited by competition lawyers because of the potential affect on similar lawsuits. Paul Walsh, commercial litigation partner at law firm Hill Dickinson, said: “If collective proceedings cannot be pursued then the likelihood of consumer claims being pursued in large numbers seems small, given the difficulties of any opt-in type approach and the relatively small value of individuals’ claims.”

He argued the legal action ought to include anyone who bought goods or services from UK businesses that accepted MasterCards between May 1992 and June 2008, provided they were UK residents and aged 16 or over.MasterCard had argued that the claims do not meet the set criteria for a collective action to proceed and said it was a massive class of individuals with disparate claims.

54;MA;Mastercard Inc;2017-01-30T17:07:39Z;MasterCard wins ruling in legal battle over card fees;High Court verdict goes against group of UK retailers over interchange fees;MasterCard has won a High Court legal battle against a group of retailers including Asda, Morrison, New Look and Next in connection with cross-border charges on the use of debit and credit cards, known as interchange fees.The card issuer is fighting at least 10 separate lawsuits from retailers in the UK seeking upwards of £1.2bn in compensation over the fees.The central issue in all the lawsuits is whether the interchange fees set by MasterCard for credit and debit card transactions by consumers are anti-competitive and infringed UK and EU law and if so by how much.To support their claims, the retailers had relied on a 2014 decision by the European Commission in which MasterCard was found to have infringed European law by imposing various interchange fees on cross-border card transactionsIn a ruling on Monday, Mr Justice Popplewell ruled in favour of MasterCard and found that the historic rates charged by the card issuer were necessary for it to function as he assessed the interchange rates that the company could have lawfully charged.The judge said the trial was looking at a different period of time to that examined by the European Commission which had looked at the period between 1992 and 2007 and there was only “only a small period of overlap”.“I must decide the case on the evidence before me, which is largely directed to a different period of time and a different market,” the judge said.MasterCard said that it was “grateful” that the court had found in its favour. “In rejecting the retailers’ claims, it found that MasterCard’s interchange fees did not restrict competition and were necessary for the functioning of its payment system,” it said.MasterCard said that the court had examined its interchange rates for the entire period of the claim. The judge had found that those rates were significantly below the lawful level of interchange that could have been charged to the retailers for those benefits, it added.Stewarts Law, the law firm acting for the retailers, called Monday’s ruling “disappointing” and “surprising” given that the European Commission, the General Court and the Court of Justice of the European Union had all previously unanimously ruled that interchange fees were anti-competitive.“We are reviewing the findings in detail with our clients and will be seeking leave to appeal,” it said.The lawsuit is one of a number of legal claims which MasterCard is fighting.In July, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled that MasterCard must pay £68.5m in damages to supermarket group J Sainsbury after losing a landmark competition case over interchange fees that it made on cards used by the retailer’s customers.Other claims include a £14bn lawsuit which is being brought on behalf of up to 46m consumers for imposing card charges on consumers in what is set to be one of the UK’s first US-style class-action cases.
55;MA;Mastercard Inc;2017-01-18T18:31:24Z;MasterCard faces overcharging claim from up to 46m individuals;London court hears details of £14bn lawsuit for fees passed on to UK consumers;Up to 46m individuals could be represented in a £14bn lawsuit brought against MasterCard for imposing card charges on UK consumers in what is set to be one of the UK’s first US-style class action cases.MasterCard is facing the claim after it allegedly infringed EU competition law and imposed high card charges that were ultimately passed on to shoppers over a 16-year period ending in 2008, a London tribunal heard on Wednesday.This week the Competition Appeals Tribunal is hearing arguments about whether it should allow the class action lawsuit to proceed to a full trial.Paul Harris QC, a barrister representing individuals wanting to bring claims, called MasterCard a “proven wrongdoer”.He told the tribunal that allowing the lawsuit to proceed would provide “justice to the victims of this proven wrongdoing . . . we say many millions of them”.The lawsuit alleges that cross-border charges on the use of MasterCard debit and credit cards — known as interchange fees — were a significant cost for retailers. This cost was then passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services.The landmark case is one of the first to be brought under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which enables consumers to bring collective damages claims on behalf of individuals who have suffered losses in competition cases. The law allows individuals to be automatically included in any litigation unless they opt out.Court papers filed for this week’s hearing show the MasterCard claimant class will be “extremely large”, encompassing an estimated 46m consumers mostly with “modest value claims”.It would include anyone who bought goods or services from UK businesses that accepted MasterCards between May 1992 and June 2008, provided they were UK residents and aged 16 or over.MasterCard said it a statement that it would be “arguing strongly that these claims do not meet the set criteria for a collective action to proceed”.In its written arguments to the tribunal, the company said it was “not a large class with largely identical individual claims. It is a massive class with disparate claims.”“We continue to disagree with the basis of the proposed collective action,” the company added. “Our payments network delivers choice to consumers and real value through the benefits of security, convenience and consumer protection, and we are committed to investing in our services.”Mr Harris told the tribunal that the Consumer Rights Act legislation was designed for cases like this, where huge numbers of consumers had suffered small losses that would be too costly to bring to court by themselves.Walter Merricks, the former financial ombudsman, is applying to spearhead the class action and has instructed law firm Quinn Emmanuel.MasterCard was also in the crosshairs of UK politicians on Wednesday, who questioned the suitability of its $700m purchase of Vocalink, the infrastructure group that processes payments.The deal was given the provisional nod by the Competition and Markets Authority after MasterCard pledged to reduce costs to the Link ATM network for switching providers.Vocalink, currently owned by the big banks, processes 90 per cent of salaries in the UK and all state benefits.George Kerevan on the Treasury select committee labelled MasterCard a “single monopoly owner with multiple antitrust suits against it” on Wednesday. The committee slammed the Payment Systems Regulator, the watchdog that oversees the plumbing of the financial system, for allowing the deal, accusing it of breaching its statutory objective of ensuring competition.MasterCard declined to comment on the hearing.

57;MA;Mastercard Inc;2017-01-04T13:27:05Z;MasterCard deal to buy Vocalink raises competition concerns;Competition watchdog gives MasterCard a week to resolve issues around Link ATM services;The British competition watchdog has given MasterCard a week to respond to its concerns over the £700m acquisition of payment technology company Vocalink before the start of an in-depth investigation into the deal.MasterCard could stifle competition among companies that run Britain’s cash machine network, according to the Competition and Markets Authority, which said that a number of industry rivals had “raised concerns” over the deal to buy Vocalink.After conducting an investigation, the CMA said that the merger would reduce competition in cash machines using Link ATM technology. Vocalink and MasterCard are two of only three credible providers of services for the system.The CMA said: “The merger would reduce the number of bidders and limit the ability of the Link scheme to obtain good value when tendering for an infrastructure provider.”MasterCard said in July that it had acquired Vocalink, which underpins £6trn of payments a year and operates the technology that processes about 90 per cent of salaries, 70 per cent of household bills and all state benefits in the UK. Vocalink processed about 11bn transactions in 2015, more than half of all payments made in the UK.Vocalink was previously owned by a group of 18 UK banks and building societies, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander.The CMA warning comes as another UK watchdog — the Payment Systems Regulator — is attempting to inject competition into payments by wresting control from the largest high street banks.A review by the PSR last year found that innovation and competition are being hampered by the dominance of the large high street banks.The CMA said the two companies can avoid an in-depth investigation if they respond to the regulator’s concerns by January 11.Andrea Coscelli, acting chief executive of the CMA, said: “It’s important that Link has a good choice of providers when it comes to supplying the necessary infrastructure so it can take advantage of the opening up of payment systems to competition.“The Link ATM network provides an essential service for millions of customers. These concerns warrant a closer investigation in the event that MasterCard cannot address them at this stage.”A spokesperson for Vocalink said: “We will continue to work with them over the coming weeks to establish the most appropriate outcome for all concerned. Together with MasterCard and the CMA we can reach an outcome that will fully support and drive further innovation and opportunity within the payments industry.”MasterCard said: “The thoroughness of the CMA’s review reflects the significance of this deal and its potential for the industry.“We’re pleased to have the opportunity to address their one concern, regarding the LINK ATM scheme, in the timeframe provided. This acquisition promises to bring greater choice and innovation to the payment ecosystem, enabling people, governments and businesses to pay the way they want to pay.”

While the cards allowed foreign groups to process US-dollar denominated payments for Chinese customers travelling overseas, Unionpay has kept a firm hold on domestic currency clearing for card payments.Both parties had benefited by splitting the fees from international transactions, especially during the early days of the arrangement when foreign companies had little exposure to China, and Unionpay was not widely accepted abroad. Since then, the Chinese company has built an extensive network overseas, reducing the need for Chinese customers to carry foreign cards.About 240m co-branded credit cards have been issued by Chinese banks during the past 14 years, according to data from Goldpac. The cards — which forced competitors to share space on the same piece of plastic — have seen Visa and Unionpay clash over which company processes the payments.The end of the unique Chinese payment product comes just months after the central bank and securities regulator said foreign card companies could apply for licences to clear domestic Chinese payments.The process of setting up those operations is expected to take at least a year to complete and faces regulatory challenges, experts say. In the interim, foreign card companies will lose customers as the co-branded cards expire without the opportunity for renewal.“The foreign companies will be affected by this . . . There will be a period where they cannot expand that business,” said David Lu, chairman of Goldpac, noting that the impact could be limited if foreign companies set up their businesses quickly.Customers looking to renew expired cards will now be issued two separate cards from the same bank, one serviced by Unionpay, the other by the foreign company.Visa declined to comment on the specifics of the situation but said that it “will comply with all government regulations”. MasterCard and Unionpay did not immediately respond to inquiries on the matter.The decision to allow global payments operators to set up domestic clearing operations was a breakthrough in the market following years of complaints from the US that China discriminated against foreign payment companies. In 2012, the World Trade Organisation ruled in favour of the US and mandated that China open the market over a period of time.The central bank has said that about $8tn worth of card payment transactions were processed last year, making the market one of the world’s largest.The time required for companies such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express to set up new businesses was unclear but experts expected the groups to face challenges.The regulator has 90 days to approve applications for bank card licences from foreign companies, according to a notice issued in June. After receiving approval, the company has a year to launch the business and must also pass a series of reviews on internet technology and security systems.Those checks are already proving difficult for the companies that have made it to that stage, according to Zennon Kapron, a payments specialist and director at Shanghai-based consultancy Kapronasia.“I get the impression that the actual licences to operate aren’t terribly difficult to get, but getting the final approval to start operations is, as there are all these checks,” Mr Kapron said. “At this point, I would expect the earliest we would see a mainland issued [foreign] card would be late 2017, early 2018.”

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Further countries are expected to follow in 2017.Ajay Bhalla, Mastercard president of enterprise risk and security, described the development as a “significant milestone in the evolution of payments”.Established payments groups like Mastercard face increasing competition thanks to the emergence of mobile payments, where barriers to entry are much lower than the traditional credit card business.The global value of payments made by mobile devices or wearable technology is expected to reach $95bn annually in 2018, up from $35bn last year, according to Juniper Research, the market research group.
63;MA;Mastercard Inc;2016-09-26T05:46:26Z;Financial industry faces extreme disruption in payments;Start-up challengers, regulatory pressure and cyber crime shake up staid backwater;A few weeks before the Olympic Games started in Brazil this summer, a world record of a different kind was claimed by two small banks in Canada and Germany, when they completed a transaction that could change the world of finance.ATB Financial, based in Edmonton, Alberta, sent C$1,000 to Germany’s Reise Bank over a platform developed by Ripple, the San Francisco-based specialist in blockchain, the shared database technology that underpins the digital currency bitcoin.Payments have long been a backwater of finance, pleasantly profitable yet placid. Now all that is changingThe banks claimed this was the first real international money transfer using blockchain technology. It took only 20 seconds to complete, compared to the several days that most international bank transfers take to clear, underlining the technology’s potential.Payments have long been a backwater of finance, pleasantly profitable yet placid. Now all that is changing. The trend for people to pay for more things on mobile devices, and combined with the growth of online shopping, has produced a spurt of growth in this once staid sector. The consultancy McKinsey predicts that global payments revenues will rise from $1.8tn in 2014 to $2.3tn in 2019.However, the industry is entering a period of extreme disruption. The dominant players — the banks and credit card companies — face an uncertain future. A fast-growing group of upstart financial technology, or “fintech”, companies are lining up to challenge the incumbent payment providers by offering to meet customer demand for faster, cheaper and easier-to-use services — many of them using the blockchain.Allied to this, regulators are ratcheting up pressure on banks to cut the juicy fees they earn from processing payments while forcing them to be more co-operative with the fintech challengers. At the same time, traditional providers of payment services are facing an onslaught of cyber attacks from an army of increasingly sophisticated hackers and digital criminals.The rise of the “sharing economy” based on peer-to-peer services, such as Uber and Airbnb, is expected to fuel rapid growth of small mobile payments. These are already on the rise, driven by the adoption of digital wallets, such as Apple Pay, which allow consumers to pay for products by waving their smartphone over a terminal.Juniper Research predicts that global payments using mobile devices or wearable technology will be worth $95bn annually in 2018, up from $35bn last year.Bo Nilsson, chief executive of Nets Holding, the Nordic payment processor, which recently announced plans for a public listing, says: “We continue to see cash being converted into digital payments, such as with new contactless payments. We expect 70 per cent of commerce in dollar terms to be in digital payments in a few years.”As consumers carry out more financial transactions on their mobile devices, banks are responding by making it easier for them to transfer money quickly. In the UK, for example, the main lenders have launched Paym, a service allowing people to pay someone using only their mobile number. More than 3m users have signed up so far.Cross-border payments are still a costly and time-consuming exercise for the most part, both for individuals and companies. Marcus Treacher, head of strategic accounts at Ripple, says: “The payments industry is revving up, but it is stuck in second gear because it is being held back by the antiquated banking system.”This has prompted scores of fintech groups to spring up, offering cheaper and faster ways to transfer money overseas via online services. Perhaps the best known in Europe is TransferWise, which has been doubling in size each year and is now handling more than $1bn of payments each month.Some banks are responding to the rapid growth of these fintech companies. Barclays recently struck a deal with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that will allow customers to send payments between the two countries using only a mobile phone number.Rachel Nash, the UK head of financial services at NCR, which operates thousands of ATMs and provides payment software to banks, says: “It is all about a seamless customer experience. Transferring money across accounts really easily, that is what customers are starting to expect now.”While innovation is flourishing in the payments sector, it is increasingly under attack from cybercriminals. In the UK, the latest official figures showed that more than half the 3m cases of bank fraud came through the internet. Similarly, a group of hackers stole up to $1bn from about 100 financial institutions over a two-year period, according to researchers at internet security group Kaspersky Lab.One of the most high profile incidents resulted in cyber criminals making off with $81m from the Bangladeshi central bank in February, exposing a weakness in the security around the Swift international payments network. Several similar cases, some of which were successful, have since emerged at banks in Vietnam, the Philippines and Ecuador.The industry is also under fire from regulators, which are stepping up their efforts to inject more competition into a payments industry that has long been dominated by the big banks.Earlier this year, the largest British banks sold Vocalink, which processed more than half the country’s payments last year, to MasterCard in a £700m deal. The UK’s payments watchdog had called for the business to be sold to increase competition in the sector.In Europe, the banks are braced for the arrival of the Payments Services Directive 2, which is due to require lenders to open up access to the data of their clients to third party service providers in a bid to boost competition and stimulate innovation in the sector.Once these third parties gain customers’ permission to access their accounts they could handle payments and offer tailored financial advice.For the banks, this could prove critical. It would enable companies such as Google, Amazon or Facebook to aggregate all of a person’s financial information from different accounts into a single site and then provide payment services directly from this portal. If banks do not respond quickly, they risk becoming the “dumb pipes” that handle the plumbing of the financial system, while all their customer interaction is stolen away by more technologically adept rivals.As Accenture put it in a recent report: “This scenario would present a significant threat to incumbent banks by acting as a virtual consolidation of the fintech industry . . . With less customer data, the banks would enter a negative feedback loop in which their ability to compete would steadily decline, eroding a key competitive advantage that banks currently enjoy through their wealth of customer data and insight.”
64;MA;Mastercard Inc;2016-08-02T12:14:20Z;#fintech: Transferwise steps up assault on banks;;Transferwise is best known for its aggressive adverts bashing banks for over-charging customers to move money across borders. But even the most radical disruptors are sometimes forced to do a deal with the devil to achieve what they want.So Transferwise had to team up with a traditional lender – in this case Raphaels Bank, one of the UK’s oldest private banks – to become the first fintech group to gain access to the country’s Faster Payments Service since the real-time payment system’s launch in 2008.The partnership between the two, nine months in the making, will give Transferwisedirect access to the Faster Payments Service later this month. This will allow its UK customers to send and receive money almost instantaneously, rather than having to wait several hours for their cash to move.There is also a symbolic importance to the move. For the first time, a UK fintech will not be reliant on a big bank that it is competing fiercely with to gain access to the country’s payments infrastructure.This is being hailed as a victory by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) which is pushing for greater competition and access to the UK payment infrastructure.Only last week, the PSR bemoaned that “there is no effective competition for the provision of UK payments infrastructure for the three interbank payment systems” – the Bacs scheme for direct debits, the Link system of ATMs and the Faster Payments Service.Yet there are signs that this may be slowly changing – not just with the breakthrough by Transferwise, one of Europe’s few fintech unicorns valued over $1bn.Two weeks ago, the big British banks gave up control of Vocalink, which operates the Link ATM network and processes half of all payments in Britain, by agreeing to sell it to Mastercard.Perhaps more importantly, Bank of England governor Mark Carney announced plans in June to allow fintech groups and other non-bank providers of payment services to access its Real Time Gross Settlement service, the backbone of Britain’s banking payments system, which handles about £500bn of transactions a day.At the moment such companies must go through one of the four main clearing banks with whom they compete. Instead, Mr Carney aims to give them access directly or through aggregators that can provide direct technical connections to the infrastructure.Transferwise’s adverts featuring scantily clad women and its criticism of “that moment you realise your bank rips you off” mean it will continue to get up the nose of the UK’s major lenders.Its latest move chips away at another of the big banks’ advantages. But it has only achieved this after nine months’ work and by partnering with a bank – albeit a relatively small one – showing how far there is still to go before a truly level playing field exists for access to the UK payments infrastructure. Should the regulators succeed in creating one it will be a massive boost to the country’s fintech sector.FT launches the Future of Fintech AwardsThese new awards aim to recognise the fintech companies with the ability to bring lasting change to the financial services sector.

PayPal’s deal with Visa was an “iconic truce”, said Michael Moeser, consultant at Javelin Strategy & Research.He said “it will be important for MasterCard to provide something in addition to what Visa’s offered” as MasterCard “doesn’t have as much to offer PayPal” as Visa did. “It doesn’t have as many consumers.”Martina Hund-Mejean, MasterCard chief financial officer, added: “Everybody needs to remember that we were the first network, actually, to tell them . . . that the way that they’re doing the PayPal wallet is not good for the ecosystem.”“Both parties have to be happy and we’ll announce when we can announce.”Under PayPal’s arrangement with Visa, the online payments company will stop encouraging its customers to link to bank accounts.In return, the online payments specialist gains a boost to its physical presence, giving it access to Visa’s contactless payment points in US retail stores. Visa will also sweeten the deal by paying PayPal a fee based on the volume of payments that PayPal steers towards Visa.With 188m active users, PayPal is one of the world’s largest payments networks and is growing fast.New services from the 20-year-old company include Xoom, the cross-border payments app that PayPal bought last year, and Venmo, a peer-to-peer payments app popular with US millennials.Thanks in part to strong growth from these new services, PayPal’s payments processed rose 28 per cent in the most recent quarter to $86bn.Historically, PayPal steered customers towards linking their bank accounts because credit card processing fees were much higher than bank processing fees. These fees have come down over time, however, and the deal with Visa includes provisions that lock in these processing fees at advantageous rates.MasterCard and PayPal already have a co-branded consumer credit card scheme, and the companies disclosed this week that they had extended that deal.MasterCard generated net income of $983m in the second quarter, 7 per cent more than a year ago, helped by higher consumer spending.Shares in MasterCard rose 1.5 per cent, giving the company a market capitalisation of $103bn.

The card issuer accounts for less than 5 per cent of the UK’s debit card business, with Visa dominating the market.Ajay Banga, president and chief executive of MasterCard, said: “We’re excited about the opportunity to play a bigger role in payments in the UK, a very strategic market for us.”The deal is the latest international merger with a British company following the UK’s vote to leave the EU at the end of June. This week Japan’s SoftBank agreed to acquire technology group Arm Holdings for £24.3bn.Philip Hammond, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, said on Thursday: “MasterCard’s decision to buy Vocalink shows that Britain remains an attractive destination for international investors. Britain is and continues to be an open and globally facing country in which to do business.”He added that Mastercard’s global presence meant that the merged group would be “well placed” to secure more international deals.The deal comes months after the UK’s payments watchdog recommended that banks sell their stake in Vocalink to encourage competition in the market. A review by the Payment Systems Regulator found that the dominance of the small number of banks that owns Vocalink had a “negative impact” on the industry.Vocalink is expanding its global presence. It has licensed its technology to support faster payments systems in Sweden, Singapore, Thailand and the US.As part of the deal with MasterCard, a majority of Vocalink’s shareholders will retain the remaining 7.6 per cent ownership for at least three years.MasterCard said that these existing shareholders had the potential to earn up to an additional £169m if “performance targets are met”.The Payment Systems Regulator said: “On the acquisition, we will discuss developments with MasterCard and Vocalink and, where appropriate, with the relevant merger authority. Our main consideration is that the infrastructure delivers good outcomes for the people and businesses that use it.”

They are seeking combined damages of more than £1.2bn.Sainsbury’s was required to pay the fees on card transactions under Mastercard’s payment scheme. The supermarket claimed damages for a breach of the Competition Act for the level at which the interchange fees were set.To support its claim, Sainsbury’s relied on a 2014 decision by the EU Commission in which MasterCard was found to have infringed EU law by imposing different interchange fees on cross-border card transactions.Sarah Houghton, partner at Mishcon de Reya representing Sainsbury’s, said: “This is a good result for our client in a landmark case. This marks the first substantial award in a competition damages claim in the UK, and we believe in Europe. It has an importance well beyond the precedent it sets for claims against the MasterCard and Visa schemes.”Rob Murray, another Mishcon de Reya partner, said that the ruling was good news for the other retailers involved in the litigation.Sainsbury’s said in a statement that it had consistently maintained that the level of interchange fees charged in the UK by MasterCard was not justifiable.“While Sainsbury’s is still considering the judgment, Sainsbury’s is pleased that the tribunal has recognised the harm that MasterCard has caused,” it said.MasterCard said in a statement: “On first look, we are grateful that the court found that significant benefits flow to both retailers and cardholders from interchange in the UK.“While we are disappointed to see liability as part of the finding, we note that in awarding a limited portion of the claimed damages, the court concluded that Sainsbury’s did not pass through interchange costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.”The case is one of a number of lawsuits being brought against MasterCard for imposing card charges that were ultimately borne by UK consumers.It emerged last week that the credit card company will face a multibillion-pound lawsuit in what is set to be one of Britain’s first US-style class action cases.Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, the law firm bringing the case, alleges that the fees were a significant cost for retailers, which was then passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services. It claims that UK consumers have lost as much as £19bn as a result, in a lawsuit which will be filed within weeks.

In 2014, MasterCard was found to have infringed EU law by imposing intercharge fees on cross-border card transactions.Law firm Quinn Emanuel alleges that the fees were a significant cost for retailers. This cost was then passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services. The lawsuit claims that UK consumers have lost as much as £19bn as a result of the fees.“The prices of everything we all bought from 1992 to 2008 were higher than they should have been as a result of the unlawful conduct of MasterCard,” said Walter Merricks, a former Chief Financial Services Ombudsman who is spearheading the claim.He has instructed Quinn Emanuel to lead the case, and litigation funder Gerchen Keller Capital is providing up to £40m to finance the lawsuit.In a statement MasterCard said it firmly disagreed with the basis of this legal claim. “Electronic payments deliver real value to people online, in-store and everywhere. MasterCard is committed to providing ever more convenient, safe and secure payments to all our customers, including consumers, retailers, governments and banks,” it said.The case is likely to be heard in the Competition Appeal Tribunal, a specialist court which hears competition law disputes. An initial hearing is likely to take place later this year and a trial could start in 2018.The lawsuit claims that because Mastercard’s fees have already been found to be illegal by the EC, this legal action only needs to prove that consumers suffered loss as a result of Mastercard’s anti-competitive behaviour.Boris Bronfentrinker, partner at Quinn Emanuel, said: “This is precisely the type of claim for which the new collective action regime was established. This is a landmark case where unlawful anti-competitive conduct has harmed UK consumers.”

Lord Grabiner should know that. He is a distinguished barrister, as well as chairman of Taveta. This Green family holding company once owned BHS, a store chain that has collapsed with £571m in pension liabilities.The QC revealed a disturbing outlook in using the phrase “after-event ratification” to explain his role in the disposal of BHS a year ago.The term is evidently meant to suggest the deal received his full magisterial approval as chairman of the board, even though a group of Taveta directors had agreed it in a board meeting to which he was not even invited. One imagines the peer banging down a very big rubber stamp on a ledger entry for £1 paid by scratch buying team Retail Acquisitions.Lord Grabiner was testifying to MPs on Monday evening concerning the due diligence — or lack of it — on the sale. His comments will have whetted MPs’ appetites for slips from Olswang and Grant Thornton, lawyers and accountants to Retail Acquisitions, on Wednesday.“After-event ratification” sounds rather like a mash-up of “post hoc rationalisation” and “morning-after pill”. Prophylaxis was occurring on two levels, we may surmise. Retail entrepreneur Sir Philip Green wanted to put some distance between the reputational and financial liability BHS had become. Lord Grabiner aimed to demonstrate he had overseen a significant transaction by Taveta, albeit glimpsed in a rear-view mirror.Taveta was “a private company”, as Lord Grabiner scratchily protested on Monday. That is true. But directors’ statutory duties to exercise care, skill and diligence apply to both private and quoted businesses. Doubtless the peer abided by the letter of the rules.

70;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;MasterCard to start trialing Pepper the robot in Pizza Hut;Childlike android comes of age taking orders and payments;The childlike humanoid billed as the world’s first robot that can read people’s emotions may be about to come of age. Pepper is being put to work in a pizza takeaway.The payments network MasterCard said on Tuesday it would begin testing a cashier variant of the multilingual gizmo in Pizza Hut, the latest sign that big companies are experimenting with the emerging technology.Thousands of Peppers, designed by the technology and telecoms group SoftBank, have already been sold in Japan. About a third are deployed in business settings, including as demonstration aides or as customer assistants. Brands including Nestlé and Mizuho Bank have touted their use.MasterCard said, however, that its planned use of the robot was a first since it would allow the customer to deal entirely with the state of the art contraption — both to place an order and to make the payment.Teenagers’ pocket money jobs nevertheless look safe enough for now. Although pizza jobs are a rite of passage for human adolescents, it remains to be seen whether Pepper’s work experience shows that the playful droid is maturing.Despite considerable hype, the sleek white device is still seen largely as a novelty item. Even so, MasterCard denied the forthcoming roll out of the 1.2 metre-tall robot in a handful of Pizza Hut outlets in Asia was a stunt.The second-largest US payments company said the planned pilot was a genuine attempt to test how payments could be conducted in future.The robot has been designed to chat with customers, answer their questions and allow them to pay by syncing with their mobile phones.In theory, the development could eliminate the need for real-life pizza checkout boys and girls. Even MasterCard played down that notion, however.“We’re not trying to replace anything,” said John Sheldon, head of the company’s innovation management. “There will be human staff.”Still, he added: “There’s an opportunity for operational efficiencies . . . The bigger opportunity is in migrating them [employees] to higher value, experience-based activities.”MasterCard said it might consider deploying the device elsewhere, from hotels to airports, but that it still was an “early experiment”. It plans to begin the pilot at as-yet undisclosed locations in Asia by the end of the year.

The deal marks a significant step in developing Europe’s payments industry and opening it up to international growth.Vocalink said that the value of UnionPay card withdrawals from Britain’s ATMs would be five times the value of UK withdrawals on average.Wei Zhihong, general manager of UnionPay International Europe, said: “This partnership represents a significant milestone in our goal to increase access to UnionPay cards internationally.“UnionPay customers will benefit from secure, reliable and accessible ATM transactions in the UK and Europe.”It comes shortly after VocaLink announced the UK’s largest ever ATM processing deal with Link, the ATM network. Under the agreement, Vocalink will support the transactions of more than 70,000 ATMs connected to Link in the UK and across Europe.However, the future ownership of Vocalink is currently under question. The group is owned by the UK’s largest high street banks, but a recent report by the UK’s payments regulator called for banks to reduce their stake in VocaLink as a way to encourage competition.It is understood that MasterCard is readying a £1bn takeover, which would be an important step in boosting the card provider’s presence in the UK.The card issuer accounts for less than 5 per cent of the UK’s debit card business, with Visa dominating the market. In contrast, MasterCard represents the majority of the credit card sector, issuing about 65 per cent of cards.The ownership of Vocalink came under the spotlight last year, after a number of private equity funds including CVC Capital Partners and Permira are believed to have entered talks with the payment infrastructure provider about potentially acquiring stakes in the group.A number of private equity funds have bought stakes in other payment systems across Europe in the past couple of years, as the shift away from bank-owned structures continues.Sara Parker, product director at Vocalink, said: “We have ambitious plans over the coming years as we look to further expand our payments systems into international markets.”

Mr Moiseev candidly said these were being made more urgent by western sanctions on Russia.“The motivation has increased significantly,” Mr Moiseev said of the closer ties. “We are driven by outside [events] to develop bilateral financial links.”But the deputy finance minister declined to comment on whether Russia was in talks to issue sovereign debt in renminbi, as some bankers have said.The agreement with Unionpay, which is usable in 141 countries according to its website, would ease the way for international acceptance of the “Mir” credit card that Russia plans to issue in 2016, said Mr Moiseev. “Clearly we would like our national plastic card system to be as internationally accepted as possible,” he said.Russia has sought to increase its exposure to China after US and EU sanctions over the Ukraine conflict largely cut the country off from western markets. The finance ministry has struggled to find western banks willing to underwrite a planned $3bn Eurobond after the US Treasury warned them off the deal.The motivation has increased significantly. We are driven by outside [events] to develop bilateral financial linksWhile both Visa and MasterCard continue to operate in Russia, they are banned from doing business with two Russian banks accused by the US of close links to the Kremlin. “The very possibility that Russian banks can be switched off from plastic cards have of course pushed us to make steps,” Mr Moiseev said.Amid several rounds of negotiations over financial integration, many see Russia’s primary aim as access to China’s debt markets. Western sanctions mean many of Russia’s largest banks and corporations are unable to raise finance in dollars. Historically low oil prices have also hurt Russia’s economy and led to an increase in financing needs.Meanwhile, China is easing international access to its onshore bond market, estimated at some $6tr — the third largest in the world. Several western banks and corporates, including HSBC and Daimler, as well as South Korea, have over the past year issued so-called “panda bonds”.I want to make it much more convenient for investors on both sides to investBankers have told the FT that talks between Russia and China to issue a renminbi-denominated panda bond are under way, but Mr Moiseev declined to discuss the matter.“I am deliberately not talking specifically about the Russian Federation borrowing in China or Chinese buying Russian government bonds in Russia,” he said.He said his trip to Beijing had the broader aim of promoting the integration of financial infrastructure. “I want to make it much more convenient for investors on both sides to invest,” he added.He pointed to other recent examples of integration including a dual-taxation treaty which would unlock cross-border investment by lifting taxation on capital gains and coupons. He said topics for discussion also included mutual recognition of credit ratings and auditing standards.

Giving a presentation at his office on the outskirts of Dublin, the chief innovation officer at MasterCard flashes a large, black so-called “smart ring”. It looks like something Q would hand James Bond before a mission, but it is in fact a wearable device that can connect to a smartphone, store your bank account details and be used to make very quick purchases in stores.“I just tap it,” Mr Lyons says with a grin, “and it charges my account”, meaning there is no need for cash, for queueing, or even for paying at a till.This bit of techno-jewellery is not the only payment gadget being shown off on this drizzly morning in Leopardstown, an office park suburb popular with multinationals lured to Ireland by its low corporation tax rates.MasterCard and its rivals are rolling out whole ranges of tech accessories, from bracelets to apps, that harness the capabilities of smartphones, making it almost too easy for consumers to part with their cash.Visa offers a wristband that looks like a fitness tracker but is used to make payments, while the futurologists of the finance industry dream up apps that drive your smartphone to tell you what to buy next. But do shoppers actually want to buy things in this way?“The supply side push for this is extremely strong,” says Eden Zoller, who researches public attitudes towards digital technologies at Ovum, a consultancy.However, the idea of having your smartphone pipe up in Tesco to ask if you want hot cross buns again this week is a concept consumers have yet to engage actively with.“People don’t see the need for mobile payments at this stage, adoption of wearables is still very low and, quite frankly, a lot of people still perceive this stuff as a bit of a gimmick,” Ms Zoller adds.At MasterCard’s Dublin base, however, its technology team is looking far into the future and has even developed a “virtual buying assistant”. Mr Lyons shows a video of an affluent, attractive woman in a nicely decorated kitchen, casually calling over her shoulder to a small, square black box to “order diapers,” and “book a girls’ weekend in New York”. The buying box, in a cheery disembodied voice, then instructs itself to buy its owner some concert tickets, promising to secure the best seats.At no point in the video is the cost of the goods and experiences mentioned, or whether the box is securing a good deal. This product is merely a bit of “future gazing”, MasterCard says, which is why it does not yet incorporate elements such as helping its users budget or control their spending.Steve Davies, who advises companies on financial technology at accountants PwC, also cautions that much of what large businesses are doing in the mobile payments space may never really take off.Multinationals and banks think financial technology is about trying new things out as they “try to embrace the start-up culture”, he says. However, other financial corporations — including the payment processors — keep coming up with kooky ideas for how to pay for stuff as they fear being crowded out by new technologies, and want us to spend more.MasterCard and Visa are basically telling banks that transactions between a consumer and a retailer are happening, but things may not always have to work this way. Blockchain, for example, is an emergent technology that allows payment information to be held at a central point, without any need for a middleman. This week, Google announced it would soon launch Android Pay in the UK, the rival to Apple Pay, which lets shoppers pay with their phones.The payment companies are “the rails” that transactions run along, explains Ms Zoller, and they take a tiny slice of the money spent each time it changes hands. “They are understandably always keen to leverage any technology that increases payments,” she says.When MasterCard’s Mr Lyons goes shopping in the future, he foresees having a connected device that says “Welcome back Garry, the last time you were here you bought this . . . do you want it again?” He adds: “If I was a frequent runner, I would have something set up that just orders me the next generation of my favourite sneakers when my current ones are running out.”If such technologies ever become mass market, questions will naturally be raised about the social responsibility of companies that enable robots to fill up our online shopping baskets, or nudge us around malls.Measured on a monthly basis, personal borrowing in the UK is running at levels not seen since 2007. And there is already evidence that making it easier to “tap” and spend money contributes to more money being spent.Britons spent a record £1bn on contactless cards last November. The government’s Money Advice Service is also concerned about the “distance” that paying with contactless devices puts between our money and the act of spending it.The executives at MasterCard say they are developing their new payment solutions responsibly, although their main focus appears to be on preventing identity theft and payments fraud.MasterCard has also developed what it calls “selfie pay”, which verifies an account holder by storing details of their face, via a smartphone camera. This is much quicker than inputting a password before an online transaction is approved. It is also easier for consumers than remembering a password, removing another barrier.For now, however, the financial services industry’s biggest worry is probably that the kooky payment systems they are developing will go unnoticed by consumers and retailers.Making payments on a key ring or a piece of jewellery, is too much too soon for some people, Ms Zoller says. “I don’t think the end of cash is exactly around the corner.”
74;MA;Mastercard Inc;2016-03-23T12:22:01Z;Google launches Android mobile payment service in UK;Introduction of smartphone payment service ramps up competition with Apple Pay;Google is bringing its mobile payment service for Android smartphones to the UK, in a move that will expand its competition with Apple’s rival system.Android Pay will allow smartphone users to take advantage of payment apps provided by banks, credit card providers and retailers to either buy goods in stores or using retailer websites.The service will support MasterCard and Visa as well as many of the UK’s banks such as Bank of Scotland, First Direct, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds, M&S Bank, MBNA and Nationwide.The UK is seen by analysts as an attractive market for mobile payments given most people have a smartphone and are increasingly becoming familiar with other contactless ways of paying such as using a debit card.The country also has a relatively high proportion of retailers and coffee shops equipped with the necessary contactless equipment to enable mobile payments.Android Pay can be used to make contactless payments in shops, with a large range of places supporting the technology from Costa Coffee to Waitrose. Android Pay can also be used on the London tube, buses and trains.However, use of contactless technology through the near field communication chip in a smartphone is still far from mainstream.Android Pay was launched in the US last September, and the group claims that it signs 1.5m registrations each month.Apple took a head start in the market by launching Apple Pay in the UK last year, while there are also alternative ways to use Android smartphones to pay such as a platform developed by Samsung for its devices.More than 36m people have an Android phone in the UK, according to IHS, a research group, but only a quarter of active users have the fingerprint sensors that can make mobile payments quicker than a normal card chip and pin payment using a PIN.This compares with the 19.1m people who have an iPhone, although close to half of these are models compatible with Apple Pay with both a fingerprint sensor and contactless capability.Jack Kent, analyst at IHS, said Apple Pay had sparked renewed interest in the mobile payments market.Mr Kent said Apple Pay had an advantage of being able to use the wider Apple services ecosystem — such as iTunes payment — but “Google has lagged behind Apple when it comes to getting users to register payment card information, which means that it may face a bigger hurdle to widespread adoption”.He added: “Much of the focus on these new payment services is on the in-store use case, but the ability to drive in-app retail and commerce will be a major factor in the success of mobile payment services.”MasterCard said millions of cardholders and Android device owners in the UK would have “additional safe and secure ways” to make mobile payments and purchases. MasterCard said Android Pay was “simple, safe and secure”.“The strength of our technology means that consumers can enjoy both security as well as simplicity. MasterCard cardholders can feel confident about using their digital cards for everyday purchases,” said Mark Barnett, president of MasterCard UK & Ireland.

Forcing the banks to sell part of their holdings would pave the way for new competitors, such as financial technology companies, private equity firms, smaller “challenger” banks and other card issuers.Acquiring Vocalink — through which more than 90 per cent of UK salaries, 70 per cent of household bills and almost all state benefits are processed — would be an important step in boosting MasterCard’s presence in the UK.The card issuer accounts for less than 5 per cent of the UK’s debit card business, with Visa dominating the market. In contrast, MasterCard represents the majority of the credit card sector, issuing about 65 per cent of cards.Last year Visa Inc, the US-based company, agreed to acquire its former European subsidiary for €21bn.This deal triggered large windfalls for the 3,000 UK and European banks and payment companies that owned Visa Europe.The purchase will give Visa a stronger position to compete with MasterCard globally. But analysts said it also paved the way for MasterCard to win debit card business in the UK, as the banks that owned Visa Europe may no longer be so loyal to Visa cards.The ownership of Vocalink came under scrutiny last year, after it emerged that a number of private equity funds including CVC Capital Partners and Permira entered talks with the payment infrastructure provider about potentially acquiring stakes in the group.Private equity funds have snapped up stakes in other payment systems across Europe in the past couple of years as a trend away from bank-owned structures gains momentum.Advent International and Bain Capital led a consortium that purchased the Nordic payment services group Net Holding from a group of banks in 2014.MasterCard declined to comment. Vocalink declined to comment. The development was first reported on Sky News.

The picture is mapped against a stored image on file, allowing use of mobile payments.Mobile phone groups such as Samsung are expected to use Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to reveal more details of their payment platforms. Samsung Pay, which uses its phones to pay for goods and services using touch technology, will be extended to a range of markets this year, including the UK.MasterCard is investing in developing other new ways of ensuring identity using smartphones and other wearable devices. The group is also trialling a system that measures the user’s heartbeat through a connected bracelet to authenticate credit card transactions.Talking ahead of Mobile World Congress, Ajay Bhalla, president of enterprise security solutions at MasterCard, said that the group was also testing voice and iris scanning as it sought to eliminate fraud. “Consumers are really loving it,” he said about the trials of “selfie pay” in the Netherlands and US.MasterCard is also aiming to stamp out false declines, when credit card users travel abroad and have legitimate attempts to spend blocked. The value of false declines per year has hit $118bn, MasterCard said, which is more than 13 times the total amount lost annually to actual card fraud. Higher-spending cardholders account for half of all false declines owing to their spending patterns.MasterCard has developed ways to cut the rising number of card transactions being falsely declined. One out of every six cardholders has had at least one decline because of suspected fraud, it says.As a result, it has created a system that brings in information about historical behaviour using the card to predict and assess risk against a transaction, and enables the exchange of information from the merchant such as account, device ID and IP address.“Nobody likes being falsely accused of something, but that’s what it feels like when a transaction is falsely declined,” said Mr Bhalla. “As criminals have become smarter, so efforts to prevent fraud have resulted in an increase in genuine transactions being declined.”

Farewell also to Irish domestic banks with global expansion plans. Innovation and research and development has become Ireland’s best bet at earning a place on the global financial services map.Citigroup, MasterCard and State Street are among the big names in US financial services to have picked Ireland for R&D projects that will help shape the future of their global businesses.At the same time, the Dublin start-up scene has many companies offering complex solutions to investment banks and hedge funds overseas, while other newcomers are working in cutting-edge fields such as blockchain and online payments.“Ireland definitely has a greater concentration of financial services and global technology companies than most other countries of a similar size,” says Sean Croston, head of IT at Irish brokerage Goodbody’s.Susan Dargan, head of State Street Global Services Offshore, says the country has been an obvious location for the funds administration group to develop projects for more than 20 years. Last month, it launched a new financial technology research centre at University College Cork and China’s Zhejiang University.Ms Dargan credits Ireland’s appeal to the scale of its international financial services sector and the “breadth of the technology sector”, which includes the European headquarters of internet powers such as Facebook, Ebay and Google.Many point to the country’s low-tax environment as an attraction for large corporations seeking a base in the EU. But Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate — the lowest in a developed English-speaking country — is “not a significant differentiator” for State Street, she says. State Street hopes the Cork project will bear fruit in areas such as assessing the development of virtual and crypto currencies. New insights into investor behaviour, and their willingness to use new technologies such as robo advisers offering wealth management with minimal human intervention, are also on their wish list.MasterCard has already rolled out an application from its Dublin fintech lab — a new mobile payment system that is being introduced in leisure and drinks venues around the world, including sports venues. The technology, known as Qkr!, allows customers to use smartphones to settle bills through an app to which the venue must also sign up. Venues include UK restaurant chains such as Carluccio’s, Wagamama and Ask Italian, alongside some US sports stadiums.Citi has rolled out systems developed in Dublin across the worldCiti has also rolled out systems developed in Dublin across the world. Its Innovation Lab, founded in 2009, now has 70 full-time employees working on projects for Citi’s corporate bank, which has no operational presence in Ireland.Emmett Kilduff, a former Morgan Stanley banker who founded a Dublin fintech firm in 2012, can relate to having an overwhelmingly international client base.Mr Kilduff’s Eagle Alpha trawls the internet for “data-driven actionable information”, which it sells to investor clients. If customers are tweeting product reviews, Eagle Alpha’s 20-strong team can analyse the implications for listed companies. They also comb other social media and online signals such as the frequency of Google searches.“There isn’t any other firm globally that provides asset managers with our three types of output — research, analytics and data,” says Mr Kilduff. “We are a tech company at heart.”A few miles down the road, Donal Gallagher’s Quaternion Risk Management has developed open source software for valuing complex derivatives which he says is the only one of its kind in the world. Mr Gallagher is a former executive at the defunct German-Irish Depfa bank who struck out into fintech in 2010. The firm also does consultingMr Gallagher had the idea for the company after being horrified by how poorly banks understood the risks they were taking on. Quaternion has grown from two founders to 25 people in Dublin and two in New York and Boston. So far, their clients are mainly in London and Germany but its founder sees potential for growth further afield. “We’re just at the start of a new five-year plan,” he says.Terry Clune, who developed Taxback.com into the world’s biggest sales tax refund processor, has similarly ambitious hopes for TransferMate, which he co-founded in 2010. He is attempting to raise €25m for the business, which aims to exploit a global network of licences and bank accounts allowing it to handle a range of foreign exchange transactions in a single day at fees Mr Clune says are less than half those charged by banks. He believes his new business can be bigger than Taxback.com, which has expanded to 23 countries with 875 employees.Ireland has pushed to secure a niche in the global financial services sector before. But back-office jobs, which Ireland worked so hard to win, are also moving to cheaper centres in eastern Europe and Asia. Ireland’s distressed banks were also forced to abandon international expansions after a series of devastating losses and bailouts.Even so, fintech’s legion of proponents insist their boom is here to stay.
78;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-12-08T05:07:13Z;Having the courage to speak out is hallmark of sound counsel;Flexibility and business skills are desirable traits in modern legal advisers;"The general counsel behind the best teams in the 2015 FT North America in-house ranking may well be a pointer to the lawyer of the future. Many of them have a multidisciplinary background and all are classed as business partners and leaders by their commercial colleagues. Few, say their chief executives and other company officers, are the obstructive “black holes” that corporate legal functionaries were so often in the past.Ivan Fong at 3M, Brandi Galvin Morandi at data centre company Equinix and Tim Murphy at MasterCard are three of these lawyers of the future. Mr Fong and Ms Galvin Morandi have multidisciplinary backgrounds — chemical engineering and public relations, respectively — and enhance their roles with outside perspectives.Mr Murphy started off in the legal department of MasterCard, and then became chief product officer before returning to legal in 2014.It is not all that unusual to have lawyers move into the business, but it is still uncommon for lawyers to move back into the legal function.Fluidity is increasingly a feature of innovative corporate counsel. For companies undergoing rapid change, a nimble approach is critical.At General Electric in the past 18 months, the legal team has handled not only one of the largest corporate deals in its history — the $10.6bn acquisition of Alstom’s power and grid business — but also the withdrawal of the company from financial services, which entailed more than 40 transactions to sell GE Capital to various buyers.Similarly, lawyers at the Vodafone Americas team under Megan Doberneck handled the sale of its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless, a deal worth $130bn.Following that, Ms Doberneck was given the job of building a legal, regulatory and corporate security team from scratch to support the organic growth of Vodafone’s Americas business.“We had no blueprint for the scope, scale and how to undertake this activity,” says Ms Doberneck — traditionally Vodafone has entered new markets through acquisitions.The lawyers had to come up with frameworks flexible enough to support a new and evolving business to deliver fixed and mobile services across the Americas.The ability of the legal teams at GE and Vodafone to handle extensive corporate reorganisation and its aftermath is because they are focused on the business as a whole, not just the legal function. At Vodafone, Ms Doberneck is on the board and plays a key part in the executive management team.Leadership in business affairs is a hallmark of any innovative general counsel and is increasingly expected of chief legal officers.Corporate legal functions now commonly encompass compliance, ethics and corporate social responsibility. It is normal for general counsel to take on different functions within the business.Bill Reilly, senior vice-president and general counsel at Ansell, the manufacturer of protective health and safety products, served as interim head of human resources at the business for six months. Mr Reilly runs a lean legal team of only 11 lawyers serving a business that has 14,000 employees in 35 countries.The team at Ansell has innovated repeatedly, from its use of technology to the monetising of the company’s intellectual property. It shows what a corporate legal team can do with limited resources.Mr Reilly had a business career before he went to law school. He says he identified the potential of the corporate counsel role in the early 1980s. “I wanted to marry my understanding of business with the law and I sought to do that early on. Clearly, the in-house role has grown and evolved into a lively and respected part of the profession,” he says.For many of the FT’s ranked teams such as those at Gap, Hanesbrands and The Hershey Company, the role includes having an ethical function within the business.Leslie Turner at Hershey says her time as Assistant Secretary for Territorial and Insular Affairs in the Clinton administration and at Coca-Cola exposed her to many different aspects of the law, the combination of which has changed her thinking.“There is a trend among lawyers to emphasise the importance of being business partners,” she says, “but we need to be more than that. In-house lawyers serve as the voice of courage to the business. We certainly need to drive business solutions but we also need to speak with one voice to protect and enable the company’s reputation and shareholder value.”Tom Russo, AIG — Winner
Many insights come from being chief legal officer of Lehman Brothers from 1993 to its collapse in 2008. And still more from taking the top legal role in the reconstruction of AIG — American International Group, the insurer. As a result, he understands the role regulators, government and business play. Establishment of the Legal Operations Centre four years ago was a significant step in centralising AIG’s $2.5bn annual legal spend.Michelle Banks leads a legal team at Gap, the clothing company. She facilitated work of the Gap Foundation and more funding reached needy young people. She set up its first compliance function and a system to manage legal budgets more efficiently.Megan Doberneck is a member of the Vodafone Americas executive team with a seat on the board. She was given the task of building a legal function from scratch when the company sold its stake in Verizon Wireless.Edward Knight, (Special Mention) the general counsel at Nasdaq, is described as a “constant innovator” by commercial colleagues. He leads a team also responsible for technology innovations at his organisation.Tim Murphy has spanned business and legal functions at MasterCard: key in advancing the patent muscle of the company and gaining a foothold in new payments.Bill Reilly became general counsel at Ansell in 2000, when the Australia-based company was known as Pacific Dunlop.Leslie Turner is an exceptional general counsel, according to colleagues. With experience in private and government sectors, her function includes corporate security, government relations and ethics. One move has been board training for crises.Ross Vincenti is general counsel at OneWeb, which plans to create a constellation of satellites to provide global internet broadband service to consumers. An experienced in-house telecoms lawyer, he has served at Siemens mobile wireless division, Sprint Nextel Corporation and Clearwire."
79;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-11-22T17:50:00Z;Deutsche Bank tests password-free mobile security;Lender hopes technology will boost fight against fraud and allow it to lift limits on transactions;Deutsche Bank is experimenting with new antifraud technology that uses the way you handle and hold your phone to work out if you are really you.The bank hopes the system will free customers from passwords and allow it to lift limits on mobile transactions.The technology analyses about 50 different factors to build a picture of a user from pressure applied to the pin-pad to how the phone is held, location, facial recognition and thumbprint.Some of these are already in use. MasterCard is trialling facial recognition — dubbed “selfie pay” — and voice recognition.The boast of Callsign — the company working with Deutsche Bank on the new technology — is that its system brings so many factors together.“If I stole your mobile . . . and I got hold of your pin number and biometric (fingerprint) and I was trying to impersonate you in some way, just because I could do that doesn’t mean that I’m you,” said Zia Hayat, chief executive and founder of Callsign.Nick Doddy, Deutsche’s regional innovation manager, said the system can adjust to multiple profiles to take into account whether a customer is sitting or standing. It can even adjust to temporary setbacks.“If you’ve broken your right arm and . . . you’re at home and now you’re using your left hand, it will say her location is good, her pin is good, her biometric is good, but she’s now handling it in a different way, so it might say ‘give me a facial recognition’,” he said.In tests, Deutsche says no one has managed to achieve a “match” above 15 per cent trying to hack someone else’s account. In most cases, the match was zero.Philip Gilligan, head of innovation at Deutsche, said that having such a high degree of confidence about who was accessing an account would allow the bank to let customers execute higher value transactions.This will benefit wealthy individuals, businesses or funds who want to move large sums with ease. Deutsche has been trialling the system and plans soon to extend it to 10,000 members of its staff as part of a larger pilot.Mr Gilligan said it would be up to managers of the bank’s business lines to decide if and when they wanted to roll out the system.Paul Lee, an analyst at Deloitte, said other banks and payments companies were also looking at smartphone solutions. “Financial services companies are taking advantage of the fact that the modern smartphone has lots of sensors, and the more you use a phone the more data is gathered to authenticate the user,” he said.Barclays last year unveiled a biometric reader that identified clients through blood flow to their finger tips. So far it has only been rolled out to corporate clients.The UK’s Royal Bank of Scotland and Spain’s BBVA are among several banks that employ fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 6 to authenticate users. BBVA also uses a digital wallet to send alerts to customers when their card has been used so they will see any suspect purchases immediately.
80;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-10-27T12:19:14Z;New payments service to launch in Kenya;Interswitch’s Verve debit cards could threaten dominance of Visa, MasterCard and M-pesa;The Nigerian company Interswitch is to launch its Verve payments cards in Kenya, a move that should cut banks’ costs and threaten the dominant positions of Visa, MasterCard and the M-pesa mobile money service.Charles Ifedi, Verve’s chief executive, said fees charged by Verve in Nigeria were between 30 per cent and 50 per cent less than those charged by Visa and MasterCard, with savings on some services, such as buying mobile phone airtime, of up to 300 per cent.It is Interswitch’s auxiliary services, such as its Quickteller platform to pay bills and top-up airtime, that are likely to have the greatest impact on Safaricom, Kenya’s largest mobile operator, which operates M-pesa.M-pesa is used by about 70 per cent of Kenya’s adult population to make five times as many monthly transactions as credit and debit cards combined.The Verve debit cards are set to be introduced in Kenya early next year, with three banks — including two of the bigger ones — already signed up. Customers will be encouraged to use their cards with offers of cash rewards for each transaction.People without a bank account in Kenya, who account for some 33 per cent of the adult population, will be able to use Verve prepaid cards and top up their balances at agents.However, Mitchell Elegbe, founder and group managing director of Interswitch, said his company was not in competition with Safaricom. “We’re more of a catalyst to speed up transactions rather than being involved in them ourselves,” he said. “We want to work with Safaircom as well as the banks.”Our aim is to make payments intuitive. We don’t want you to have to think about the cost of a transaction when you make itMr Elegbe admitted that by introducing more Verve services, the goal was to make the cards “more sticky” so people would use them for increasingly varied transactions.“Our aim is to make payments intuitive,” he said. “We don’t want you to have to think about the cost of a transaction when you make it.”Launched in 2009 in Nigeria, Verve cards are used by about 45 per cent of the west African country’s 30m cardholders, Mr Elegbe said, adding that a further 16m people use its prepaid tokens or mobile payment apps.The private company that is 60 per cent owned by Helios, the private equity firm, processes 4.2bn transactions worth $32bn a year in its three markets of Nigeria, the Gambia and Uganda.Eric Musau, an analyst at Standard Investment Bank, said Verve’s entry would be “very interesting”. “The uptake of cards hasn’t been that strong in Kenya, there’s a phobia about them, and people still prefer to use their phones,” he said. “But if [Interswitch] can attract more banks and their systems work well technologically they will have something going for them.”Mr Elegbe said his goal is to start operations in more east African countries and combine the company’s operations into one regional network.
81;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-10-27T02:07:47Z;JPMorgan Chase to launch Apple Pay rival;US bank seeks to profit from increasing use of smartphones in financial transactions;JPMorgan Chase is going head to head with Apple Pay in mobile payments, announcing a tie-up with a group of merchants accounting for about $1tn of annual spending by consumers.The move by JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, underscores the determination of lenders to profit from a small but growing band of consumers who like to use their smartphones for simple financial transactions.Last September the bank partnered with Apple, and it announced this year that it had already signed up 1m Apple Pay users, many of them younger and wealthier than the typical cardholder.Now the bank is launching a digital wallet of its own, called Chase Pay, signing a deal with a group of major retailers including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Kmart and Best Buy. By next July, JPMorgan’s 94m credit, debit and pre-paid cardholders will be able to pay at more than 100,000 stores across the US by displaying a code on their phone that can be scanned by the cashier.The bank’s initiative comes as Apple Pay, launched just over a year ago, struggles to gain traction. Phoenix Marketing International, a research firm, estimates that 14 per cent of US households with credit cards had signed up for the Apple Pay payment option by the end of September this year, up from 11 per cent in February — but actual transactions may account for just a couple of percentage points of the total.“Not a lot of consumers, when they are presented with the option, actually go for it,” said Oren Levy, co-founder of Zooz, a payments software company.Even so, Apple Pay poses a threat to traditional payment processors because of the relatively generous fees it has carved out for itself in the US, where it earns roughly 15 cents for every $100 transacted.Meanwhile, competition is mounting. Android Pay and Samsung Pay both launched in the US in September, while MasterCard joined JPMorgan in announcing an initiative on Monday at Money2020, a payments conference in Las Vegas. The credit card company said it would partner with banks and designers to create a line of accessories — rings, fitness bands, car-key fobs — that can handle contactless payments.Unlike Apple Pay, which uses a near-field communication chip to link phones and registers, JPMorgan’s new system relies on relatively cheap scanners, which many merchants already use to process gift cards.15 centsAmount Apple Pay earns for every $100 transactedCustomers would be able to use the Chase Pay app directly on their Apple or Android phones, said Eileen Serra, chief executive of Chase Card Services, or use it via another app called CurrentC, which centralises merchant loyalty schemes and automatically applies discounts at the checkout. That latter option could be a big advantage for Chase Pay, she told the Financial Times, noting that until now mobile apps had not created “a meaningfully better experience” for consumers than simply swiping a piece of plastic.JPMorgan is the market leader in cards, with $127bn in loan balances at the end of the third quarter.Greg Weed, director of card performance research at Phoenix, said that more big card-issuers in the US were likely to launch bank-branded apps.“It’s fine to ride on Apple Pay and Android Pay, but control of the customer relationship is the paramount thing,” he said.Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive JPMorgan, had signalled that a challenge to Apple’s early dominance in mobile payments was in the offing.“We want to get some of that real estate so that you can use Chase Pay . . . and we’re going to be very aggressive in that kind of stuff,” he said at a conference in New York last month.

Online merchandising sales were twice what they were at the last World Cup — and there have been record television audiences in France and Japan, where 20m people tuned in for the match against Scotland.“From a business perspective, we evaluate the success of our sponsorship on the global impact on the Heineken brand,” said a spokesman for the brewer. “To this extent, we are delighted with the quality of the tournament and the excitement it has created in all participating markets.”The biggest impact will be on ITV, which paid £60m for the broadcasting rights for the 2011 and 2015 World Cups, twice as much as it paid for the preceding two tournaments.The broadcaster could lose between £1m and £2m per match as the price of advertising slots falls, said Phil Hall of MediaCom, the media buying agency, to AFP. ITV had a peak of 11.6m viewers for England’s match against Wales, a 49 per cent share of people watching television at the time.ITV declined to comment on advertising revenues, but said there had been significant audiences for non-England games, with 4m people watching Scotland take on South Africa. “This is a fantastic tournament and we are very proud of our association with the Rugby World Cup. There are some great fixtures to come.”One person close to the company also suggested that much of the tournament had been pre-booked with advertisers, limiting the financial impact of England’s departure.The pub industry was unsure how badly it would be hit. An increasing share of revenues for the sector comes from food sales, which could rise after England’s exit if more couples and families start eating out during the tournament.Simon Emeny, the head of Fuller, Smith & Turner, said: “I am feeling more down as a rugby fan than as the chief executive of a pub company where lots of people are watching the games. I don’t think England falling out will make a big difference to our pubs and business. Pubs showing sport have been very busy, but pubs selling food have been a bit quieter. We will lose a few of the armchair fans but we will make it back on food.”The mobile phone network O2, which has sponsored the England team for 21 years, created its biggest-ever campaign for the tournament. It took prime time television advertising slots and has rebranded all of its 377 stores in the UK to replace its own logo with an England rose.O2 gave away £3m worth of England shirts and also created an enormous projection on the roof of the former Millennium Dome in south-east London to display messages of support from fans.At 9.51pm on Saturday, just after the final whistle confirmed England’s exit, O2 tweeted: “Standing beside you. Always.” Its social media team continued tweeting through the night, making the most of its last marketing opportunity for the tournament. The company said: “We are still sponsors. Our sponsorship runs through till next year.” It added that the company felt it had created “huge value” through its partnership with the Rugby Football Union.FT writers assess the leading teams and important issues.Further readingIt added that the roses would stay on O2 stores until after the match between England and Uruguay next weekend, and that its advertising campaign would also cease at that point.Lucozade, owned by the Japanese conglomerate Suntory, spent £5m on its Rugby World Cup campaign, offering fans the chance to win rugby shirts every 80 minutes and branding itself as “for home nations only”. The group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sponsors that will be cheering England’s departure include Under Armour, the sports clothing brand, Vitality and Admiral, all of which sponsor Wales; and Guinness, Paddy Power and Aviva, which have deals with Ireland. The mobile network 3, which now owns O2, also sponsors Ireland."

It intends to roll out “iZettle Advance”, a financial product that provides businesses with small cash advances that are paid back automatically as a fraction of future card sales.“Small companies have persistently been underserved by the traditional finance industry,” said Jacob de Geer, iZettle’s chief executive and co-founder.The funding makes iZettle one of the best backed fintech companies on the continent. In December 2014, Adyen, a Dutch payments processor, raised $250m in a funding round that valued the company at $1.5bn. Last April Funding Circle, a British peer-to-peer lender, raised $150m in a round that valued the group at about $1bn.According to company filings, in 2013 iZettle reported a net loss of SKr171m ($25m), with revenues of SKr78m. However, the company said it was growing quickly, with revenues increasing 150 per cent between 2013 and 2014.iZettle’s move to raise more money and diversify outside card payments comes after reports that US rival Square, the San Francisco company launched by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, had filed for an initial public offering.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

At least £1m a month has been swapped on the platform this summer; it offers 16 currencies and operates in 10 European countries.“People feel good about the idea of swapping,” says Mr Jesner. “The travel money patterns between countries are very equal. What the UK spends in travel money in Australia is almost equal to what Australians spend in the UK.”However, maintaining this balance for the various pairs of currencies being swapped is a key challenge for this business model.WeSwap follows in the footsteps of peer-to-peer international money transfer firms such as TransferWise, which now processes £500m a month after high-profile ad campaigns drawing attention to what it describes as banks’ “rip-off” fees.Dublin-based CurrencyFair also caters for individuals sending money across borders, while Kantox acts as a marketplace for small and medium-sized businesses to conduct peer-to-peer currency exchanges.But WeSwap, founded by Mr Jesner and former corporate finance adviser Simon Sacerdoti, is the first to tackle the travel money market.In 2018, UK residents are forecast to spend £38bn abroad, according to research by Mintel. The market for obtaining this foreign currency is a fragmented one, drawing in the state-owned Post Office, banks, supermarkets, other retailers, travel agents and bureaux de change such as Travelex.While many of these charge no commission, the exchange rates they offer to buyers and sellers can differ by as much as 14 per cent. Rates also vary widely between operators — according to travelmoneymax.com, a comparison site, £1,000 buys between €1,345 and €1,422.Users of WeSwap receive the current mid-market exchange rate but pay 1 per cent commission for transfers taking up to a week, 1.3 per cent for three days and 1.4 per cent for an instant exchange.Building scale is the key challenge, along with navigating different regulatory regimes in each country and balancing supply and demand.“The big barrier for peer-to-peer currency exchanges is liquidity,” says Simon Champ, chief executive of Eaglewood Europe, an asset manager that runs a peer-to-peer lending fund. Like such lending platforms, companies carrying out money transfers in this way must ensure transaction volumes are balanced between the two sides of each currency pair. This can be tough even for mature peer-to-peer lending firms, which sometimes struggle to find borrowers to match would-be lenders.Mr Jesner says sterling-euro exchanges on WeSwap are about 50 per cent genuine peer-to-peer swaps, while standard wholesale forex markets are used for the rest. As WeSwap grows, it hopes peer-to-peer transactions will approach 100 per cent.Tariq Attia, head of private clients at the private equity firm IW Capital, which led WeSwap’s funding round, says: “Acquiring customers is the hard bit, but they have ads all over the London Underground and we believe there will be a snowball effect.”WeSwap’s users receive a prepaid MasterCard that is loaded with their foreign currency. Andrew Hagger, a personal finance expert, said there was only one UK market player offering better rates than WeSwap: Centtrip, a start-up established this year that charges 0.5 per cent commission.It is not a peer-to-peer provider but aims to build market share by offering direct access to a live currency market, provided by CurrencyCloud — a different model that has also fired shots across the bows of existing providers. Daniel O’Neill, its business development director, questioned the efficiency of peer-to-peer currency exchange. “You always have to have the match, and to build a large, scalable business on that basis — I find it hard to see how that could flourish,” he said.Mr Jesner says that more competition in the travel money market has already brought rates down. “Over the past year they have become tighter and tighter,” he says.His long-term goal is to eliminate commissions on WeSwap, offering free currency exchange at mid-market rates, and monetise the customer database through other means.Peer-to-peer forex firms have taken inspiration from the 10-year-old peer-to-peer lending market, which processed £500m of loans in the UK in the second quarter of 2015. Barriers to entry are lower in P2P foreign exchange than in lending, says Mr Champ.Mr Jesner is in New York meeting potential investors for further funding that he hopes will be “substantially” larger than the £4.5m raised last year. He plans to expand to Asia and the US, and to market the offering specifically to business travellers.WeSwap will also add the old-school option of having cash delivered, for an extra fee. “Cash isn’t the future, but people still want it,” he admits."
86;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-07-31T17:27:10Z;How to . . . avoid holiday scams;Fraudsters are exploiting the trend to book villas and apartments online direct with owners;It is the stuff of holiday nightmares. After an early start from the UK to reach your chosen villa in the sun, you arrive many hours later, ready to relax poolside with a chilled drink.But when you come to the door, you discover another family is already there, and neither they, the homeowners nor the booking agent have the slightest idea who you are.Worse still, the person to whom you made a hefty payment three months earlier has vanished, their mobile phone disabled and bank account emptied.The internet has given new life to the market for holiday homes, allowing travellers huge choice and convenience when booking a break. But just as with any internet marketplace, its rapid growth has attracted those willing to exploit its technology to commit crimes at arm’s length.We look at the rise of holiday booking fraud and the precautions that you can take to ensure you don’t become its next victim.Some 1,569 cases of holiday booking fraud were reported in 2014, according to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, a section of the City of London Police. This amounted to £2.2m taken from unsuspecting UK travellers, with an average loss of nearly £900.But actual fraud is likely to be far higher. Sean Tipton, a spokesman for ABTA, the association for travel agents and operators, said: “Most people don’t report fraud because they don’t know where to go, they don’t think it’ll do any good or they’re embarrassed.”A common type of fraud is “spoofing”, where fraudsters either hack into the accounts of owners on rental home sites or create fictitious pages or websites advertising homes that do not exist or are already booked legitimately. They might send spoof emails pretending to be the owner — often dressed up to look like an email from a well-known rental brand — which then inveigle the traveller to send money to the criminal’s bank account.Other types include fake airlines, where travellers buy a fake ticket from a fraudulent online provider or pay for one that never arrives, and sporting or religious fraud where criminals concoct fake tickets or accommodation for the World Cup or trips to the Hajj in Saudi Arabia — events in such high demand that people are tempted by what seems like a bargain buy.Rental home companies say contacting owners before and after booking is one of the best anti-fraud checks.Erica Chang, senior regional director at HomeAway UK, says: “We advise people to call the phone number on the ad and ask them specific questions about your booking, things you want on your holiday, about your travel dates, about availability. If you start to feel a little uncomfortable, your second port of call should be our customer care service.”A site’s staff should be able to verify whether a fake telephone number has been used or double-check the details of the property.There is nothing to stop a clever swindler posing as a fake “owner” on the phone, but most are looking for a quick gain and will be reluctant to spend time answering detailed queries about a fake or “spoofed” property. Eagerness to end the conversation and complete payment should be another red flag for travellers.The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) said it is receiving a growing number of reports of firms either being contacted by fraudsters or falling victim to fraudulent activity.Continue readingAnother alarm bell can be an absence of reviews or a very recent clustering of positive reviews. “The more reviews a home has, the more comfortable you can feel with the owner and the home. It shows a lot of people have travelled there. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not fraudulent, it’s just less likely to be,” says Ms Chang.When booking a property through a company, keep an eye out for slight changes to the company name in the website address, as variations can indicate spoofing. If paying online via a reputable company, there should be a secure connection indicated by the letters “https://” at the beginning of the web address.Last-minute bookers should be particularly vigilant as criminals target peak periods — summer holiday or school breaks — when people are hunting for bargains. They can also charge more during these periods because demand is high. Their pricing is often finely judged, Mr Tipton says: “If the market rate for a villa is £2,000 they won’t offer it for £500, they’ll offer it for £1,500. They’re not stupid.”Equally, users should be suspicious of gorgeous houses in glamorous locations being offered at popular times for £500 or less a week. If a low-ball offer seems too good to be true, it very probably is.One of the best sources of comfort for those booking is to go through the bespoke payment systems offered by the bigger home rental sites.These give reassurance that the payments are going to the right recipient, and if anything untoward happens will provide a certain level of compensation. HomeAway Payments, for instance, means a payment is covered against internet fraud for up to £10,000. Booking with credit cards such as Visa or MasterCard typically offers similar or higher amounts of protection from fraud.From apartments on the Costa del Sol and villas on the Côte d’Azur to ski chalets in the Alps, Britons are rediscovering their appetite for owning an overseas bolt-hole. Continue readingOutside the “walled garden” of a secure payment system, there is much less protection. Western Union, banker’s draft or cashier’s cheque, for instance, are discouraged by the big sites.Airbnb, for instance, discourages users of its hosting services from venturing beyond its payments systems. “If a transaction happens outside of our platform and we have no record of it, it is very difficult for us to provide any assistance,” it says. Depending on the circumstances, HomeAway may offer up to £700 to a customer defrauded even after booking outside its secure payment system.Lastly, email can offer the fraudster another avenue of attack: home rental websites will usually have their own email communication systems, so owners and clients cannot email each other without going through the site. Resist the temptation to go off-grid if invited by an “owner”, as this may be an attempt to inveigle you into revealing sensitive financial information or persuade you to transfer cash for a fake booking outside the site’s payment system.For tips on avoiding holiday related fraud, visit http://abta.com/fraud. If you are the victim of a fraud, report the incident at 0300 123 2040 or via www.actionfraud.police.uk.Not all holiday home scams are perpetrated on the holiday-maker. One variant, though less common, targets the owner. How does it work?1. The fraudster gets in touch and asks to book time, often over a long period to increase the value of the payment.2. He says he had already paid for a stay elsewhere, but the other owner had to cancel after a supposed catastrophe, such as flooding or the roof falling in.3. The cost of the stay at the other place was, say, £5,000, compared to £3,000 at your place.4. He says that for “simplicity” he will instruct the other owner to send you a cheque for £5,000. You can then wire the difference of £2,000 directly to him.5. The cheque arrives from the alleged landlord. You bank it on receipt and transfer the difference. Being a foreign cheque, it appears to have been deposited safely but then bounces. Your phantom guest vanishes.One owner, who did not wish to be identified, said a scammer had set off alarm bells when he asked to book her home for three weeks in March, an unseasonal period, was overly effusive about the property and gave unsolicited and irrelevant information about his personal circumstances.But it was only after ringing the help desk at the home rental company that the owner realised the nature of the scam. “I couldn’t quite put my finger on it but I knew something was fishy about it,” she said. Going back to her “guest”, she played along: but when she insisted on payment by credit card, she never heard from the man again.
87;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-07-17T17:15:39Z;Apple seen as leading the field in phone payments race;Banking, tech and telecoms groups battle to be Britain’s new wallet;The barista at the well-known coffee shop chain looked blankly at the phone being brandished in front of the till to pay for the coffee. Clearly, if Apple Pay were to herald a revolution in the UK payments industry, it would not be starting here.Nonetheless, change is coming. The battle to be Britain’s new wallet has begun, with banking, tech and telecoms companies vying for pride of place not just in your pocket but on the home screen on your smartphone.While most people still use their phones mainly to make calls and send messages, banks have set their sights on turning them into payment platforms. A recent study by Visa suggested smartphones were on track to replace cash and cards as the preferred way to pay over the next five years. There would be £1.2bn a week in mobile payments within five years, it predicted.Apple Pay, which launched this week in the UK, is seen by analysts as having the best chance yet of turning the mobile phone into a mainstream method of payment, something at which many others have failed. But even Apple might not find it easy to break into what is still a small and fragmented market. Eden Zoller, analyst at Ovum, said: “Apple’s progress in the UK will be keenly watched across the rest of the world. But displacing contactless cards in favour of [contactless] mobile payments will be more of a challenge.”Mobile payments have been around for almost two decades. One of the first systems allowed you to use SMS text messages to pay at a vending machine. “It was a very slow way of acquiring a Coke,” says Deloitte analyst Paul Lee. Then in 1999, Visa and Nokia developed a way to pay over the internet or in a shop using a Nokia 7110 — very similar to what Apple Pay would offer 16 years later. So why do analysts think this latest development could finally lead to the popular acceptance of mobile payments?One reason is the proliferation of the requisite technology, from smartphones capable of carrying the secure technology needed to retailers with tills able to accept contactless payments. The concept appears sound. Like a wallet or purse, most people do not leave home without their phone, but it can also provide a range of security features that a card or cash cannot.The technology is shielded in a secure part of the phone. Limits can be set, while purchases can be made either using the phone’s browser online or physically by holding a special transmitter next to a reader.Apple may find that its brand could help it to win the trust of more sceptical consumersSecurity features that are being developed include eye recognition and location verification, so the bank can check that the phone is being used where the customer has travelled. Apple Pay uses a phone’s fingerprint sensor or pass code, while MasterCard is trying out facial recognition technology that has been dubbed a “selfie test”.The banks have tried to make use of their relationships with customers. Contactless cards are now commonplace, which has helped bridge at least the mental barrier to the tap-to-pay concept. Now, they have their eyes on the mobile phone or other smart wearable device. Most technology platforms require bank partners — with customers needing to tie their phones to their accounts to make payments or top-up credit.This also means consumers have the same protection against fraud using Apple Pay, for example, as for contactless credit or debit card transactions. Under the Lending Code, the most a consumer will have to pay towards the cost of a fraud is £50, providing they are not shown to have acted fraudulently. But banks generally refund the full amount lost anyway.There have still been worries in the US about high fraud levels on Apple Pay, which Americans have been able to use since last September. Cherian Abraham, a payments technology blogger, estimated 6 per cent of all transactions on the service were fraudulent, or 60 times higher than for credit cards. This has not dimmed the enthusiasm among banks to jump on Apple’s platform, a move likely to be repeated when Google launches Android Pay later this year.Banks have also been pushing their own mobile payment apps to customers. One of the more popular is Pingit from Barclays, which it says has been downloaded more than 5m times and used for more than £4bn in payments and transfers.Wealthier customers of Coutts and Barclays have recently been offered video banking services that allow them to see a financial adviser at any time, seven days a week, over their mobile devices.Other banks have incorporated Paym, a service launched last year, which allows people to pay money to each other using only a phone number. Barclays has signed a deal with payments provider Zapp to allow users to pay for goods and services with Zapp’s “Pay by Bank” app. Attempting to build on the success of contactless credit and debit cards, Barclays also last week launched bPay wristbands, key fobs and stickers that can be linked to a person’s debit or credit card and used to make contactless payments.But analysts say that just the number of alternatives alone suggests that these options may struggle to reach widespread adoption. Apple may find that its brand and the number of devices already out there could help it to win the trust of more sceptical consumers.Apple is far from alone in offering mobile phone payments, with a confusing array of rival services on offer.Samsung and PayPal have introduced “digital wallets” that also allow people to pay with the tap of a mobile phone or another gadget that features an NFC, or near field communication, chip. But so far, these services have struggled to gain much traction with consumers.But there are signs the major technology groups will make a new push in response to Apple Pay. In June, Google said it would launch “Android Pay”, which would work with smartphones running on the technology company’s mobile software. Samsung has said its “Gear” smartwatch device will support Android Pay. Google has not yet said when Android Pay will be released in the UK.Others may soon join the fray. Microsoft has shown off trials of a “tap-to-pay” system that would run on phones using its latest Windows operating system, which will be released this month.Rival tap-and-pay services are also on offer from telecoms groups, which have seen a chance to use the secure technology in Sim cards to house financial details and consumer billing relationships. But services offered by EE and Vodafone have also been slow to take off.Letter in response to this report:Excitement at the till in a Birmingham coffee bar / From Mike Horry
88;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Apple Pay taps UK to shake up consumer spending;Brands including Boots, BP, M&S and Pret A Manger and most banks have signed up;Apple Pay, the contactless payment service, is set to launch in the UK on Tuesday, opening up a potentially large market for the US technology company and transforming the way consumers buy goods.Many large brands — including Boots, BP, Marks and Spencer and Pret A Manger — and most big banks have signed up to support Apple Pay, with more than 250,000 locations ready to accept the service.It is the first time the “tap-and-pay” system — which allows users to pay for goods and services by touching their smartphones on contactless payment points — will be available outside the US.Of all the changes that mobile phones have brought to society, one of the most anticipated but underwhelming has been in financial services.There have been countless attempts to launch mobile payments services from banks, mobile telecoms groups, technology companies and retailers.But this fragmentation has failed to convince the general public to opt into any one as an accepted replacement to a wallet or card.Research from Deloitte found that 5 per cent of people in the UK use mobile payments on a weekly basis, which includes some of the more ‘soft’ mobile payment options such as using the Starbucks or PizzaExpress smartphone apps to pay for a drink or food.“The market has moved from nothing to niche in the last few years,” said Deloitte analyst Paul Lee. “The usage of mobile payments is very low — most iterations to use mobile in store have failed.”Mike Cowen, head of emerging payments products UK and Ireland at MasterCard, which provides the payment systems that operate between Apple, retailers and banks, described Apple Pay as a game changer.“It feels like it is a tipping point. In the first 72 hours after Apple Pay went live in the US, it had provisioned over 1m cards,” he said. “The name carries a lot of weight for consumer confidence and familiarity. I expect it to have a significant impact on the market.”Apple’s platform is relatively simple, requiring just a fingerprint touch verification for smaller amounts to take money from a linked account.The mobile payment service will be available in the UK on Apple’s most recent handsets — the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Payments can also be made with the Apple Watch, which works with older generations of iPhones.Most high street banks have signed up. Barclays was expected to focus on its own payments application, although said on Tuesday that it would be offering the Apple Pay service “in future”. HSBC said it was launching later this month.As much as 45 per cent of the UK uses an Apple phone, according to one mobile industry executive, which makes for a large potential market in future.“It will grow steadily in the next few years,” said Mr Lee. “This year might be the year that it finally comes off the floor. It’s a long time coming. The numbers are not great at the moment but people will be drawn in by things like loyalty offers and just the ability to buy something while you are sitting on the bus that will be waiting for you when you get home.”Most companies in the mobile payments sector are hoping for a successful launch of Apple’s mobile money, with even rivals admitting that it would be helpful if the US group could finally help establish the phone alongside the wallet and purse as a recognised way for people to pay in future.This article was amended since original publication to reflect Barclays’ decision to launch Apple Pay
89;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-07-09T13:00:22Z;MasterCard faces EU antitrust charges over fees;European Commission accuses group of ‘artificially raising’ the cost of card payments;MasterCard faces formal antitrust charges in Brussels after the European Commission accused the payments company of “artificially raising the cost of card payments”.The EU’s executive arm claimed that MasterCard prevented banks from offering lower fees to retailers in different countries. So-called “interchange fees” vary steeply between member states, meaning that some customers within the EU face far higher fees than others, the commission alleged.Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of competition policy, said: “Many consumers use payment cards every day, when they shop for food, clothes or purchase anything online. We currently suspect MasterCard is artificially raising the costs of card payments, which would harm consumers and retailers in the EU.”Under EU rules, the commission can fine a company up to 10 per cent of global revenues — MasterCard’s were almost $10bn last year — for antitrust breaches. It can also demand fundamental changes in a business’s operations.The commission also accused MasterCard of breaching antitrust rules by charging “artificially high” transaction fees for non-EU cards when they are used in the bloc. A Chinese tourist using a card in the EU will generate fees up to five times larger than a European cardholder.MasterCard confirmed it had received a “statement of objections” (SO) from the commission, which is the first step in building an antitrust case. The company said: “We will be formally responding to the SO and are also working with the European Commission on the issue as part of an ongoing constructive dialogue.”The antitrust probe is the latest battle between MasterCard and the EU. In 2014, the US payments group lost a fight with the EU after legislators introduced laws limiting fees on credit card transactions — despite stiff opposition from itself and its rival Visa.In a seven-year antitrust dispute about the fees MasterCard charged retailers, the commission found that the US payment group had restricted competition and inflated charges. An appeal found in the commission’s favour in 2014.Consumer issues such as credit card fees have become a major focus for the EU, which has launched an attempt to iron out the discrepancies that Europeans face when shopping online.At present, customers in different parts of the EU face wildly different prices, product ranges and delivery charges — even when using the same websites — based on their country of origin.MasterCard has joined an increasingly long list of big US companies facing investigation by the commission. State aid cases involving Apple, Amazon and Starbucks are already under way. Search giant Google is also in the midst of a long-running antitrust case with the commission.
90;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard cashes in on smart transit;Credit card company promotes seamless ticketing in cash-dominated market;MasterCard is building a network of partnerships to realise the potential of contactless and mobile payments to make urban transit systems work more efficiently, as it looks to the trend for “ smart cities” as a means of expanding the market for its cards.In tests from Philadelphia to Gujarat, MasterCard has begun to integrate payment systems for train, metro, bus and road toll systems.“85 per cent of the world’s payments are still in cash. To me that’s our largest opportunity,” Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s chief executive, told the Financial Times.MasterCard analysis found that transit systems — along with coffee and newspapers — were one of the largest markets in which cash dominates payment cards. “It’s $200bn a year in different cities around the world, which has the opportunity to be transformative for our business,” he said.The company announced a partnership in March with Cubic Transportation Systems, which uses traffic data to advise network operators from London to Chicago whether they need to change routes or pricing to cope with rush hour demand, and to alert commuters through their smartphones of the best options.Other new partners include Masabi, which allows users to buy tickets through their mobile devices, and Parkeon, a parking company with which MasterCard this week announced a plan to turn parking meters into kiosks that offer coupons for local businesses.Mr Banga said MasterCard’s aim in cities such as Philadelphia, where a pilot programme is due to expand into a full consumer launch later this year, was to cut the time train passengers spend buying a separate bus ticket, and “intelligent personal routing”, using data to advise users of their best routes home.“All transit systems are built for the peak of the peak. If you could find a way to take 5-7 per cent of the peak of the peak traffic off to less used routes you could reduce the cost of how you build and plan transit systems enormously,” he said, estimating that large urban transit systems could save $150m-$200m by being able to delay upgrades to their infrastructure.Citing the example of Transport for London, which has opened up its ticketing systems from depending on its Oyster Card contactless payment system to accepting ordinary bank cards, Mr Banga said MasterCard could save transit system operators the cost of maintaining their own systems.“It’s actually cheaper for them” than maintaining their own systems and handling cash, he said. “It takes out the friction.”Mr Banga said that getting transit systems to accept payment cards could be a “critical factor” in expanding MasterCard’s market. It processed more than 11bn transactions in the first quarter from the 2.2bn MasterCard and Maestro cards in issue.All transit systems are built for the peak of the peak. If you could find a way to take . . . traffic off to less used routes you could reduce the cost of how you build and plan transit systems enormouslyMr Banga added that most MasterCard users are in cities, which are home to more than half of the world’s population and about half of the world’s “financially excluded” — a group MasterCard has been targeting through separate initiatives with the UN, the World Bank and others.The company is among several, including IBM and Google, to have identified the business potential in the rise of “smart cities” — increasingly automated and connected urban areas whose authorities use data to inform the provision of public services.More public-private partnerships would be needed as urbanisation puts a strain on cities’ networks, Mr Banga added, saying the challenges transit systems face were “too vast, too deep” to tackle alone.
91;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-06-28T23:00:54Z;Wearable devices offer bank customers new ways to pay;Barclaycard unveils trio of devices for contactless payments;Bank customers will be able to make payments using a wristband, key fob or even a sticker at high street shops with the launch of a new “contactless” range.Barclaycard has unveiled the trio of “wearable” devices that can be used to make transactions at 300,000 locations, including Transport for London, across the UK.The launch comes at the same time as ApplePay arrives in the UK, allowing people to make purchases through applications on their iPhone or Apple Watch and pay at contactless points by tapping their device against a card reader.Barclays is the only major high street bank not to sign up to the ApplePay service as it pursues its own digital payment service.The wearable devices are connected to a digital wallet, to which consumers can add funds through the online bPay site or mobile app. Customers of any bank can use the devices, as long as they have Visa or MasterCard.Barclaycard has struck a deal to sell the three devices initially through Runners Need and Cycle Surgery shops, which are part of the Snow and Rock Group, with a view to offering them through a range of stores over coming months. The three wearables are also available online.The band is a slimmer version of a trial product released last year, while the key fob and sticker are new. The sticker allows consumers to turn any object with a flat surface into a payment device.Under current law, contactless payments are capped at £20 until September, when the maximum permitted will rise to £30.Contactless payments are a way of paying without having to carry cash, with the same fraud protection that is applied to debit and credit cards. If devices are lost or stolen, customers can shut them down through their mobile app or the website.Recent figures show contactless payment increased 331 per cent year on year in 2014. More than 319m contactless transactions were made to the value of £2.32bn last year.Lenders are competing to stay at the forefront of digital services, in an attempt to win and retain customers.Nationwide was among the first to launch an app on the new Apple Watch, while Royal Bank of Scotland enabled customers to log in on their phone using Touch ID, which recognises users’ fingerprints.However, despite the launch of sophisticated apps for customers, banks’ underlying payment systems technology is under pressure.Both Royal Bank of Scotland and Nationwide faced technology glitches last week. RBS’s problem meant 600,000 customer payments went missing, only months after the bank was hit with a record £56m fine for a similar systems failure.
92;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;US companies still face investment hurdles in Cuba despite thaw;Bureaucracy, eroded infrastructure and regulatory risk are among hurdles;“There was a kind of euphoria after last December,” says Pedro Freyre, who chairs the international practice at law firm Ackerman and advises US companies on Cuban issues. “But now, companies are realising that it makes sense to kick the tyres first before investing in Cuba.”Despite improved relations since President Obama’s announcement last year, US companies seeking to invest in Cuba still see more roadblocks than welcome signs. The US embargo on trade and travel remains and requires an act of Congress to overturn. But this is not the only impediment.Most of Cuba’s 11m citizens are very poor, which limits market opportunity, and infrastructure is corroded. Gary Hufbauer, fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and co-author of Economic Normalization with Cuba, emphasises the flawed incentive structure of the statist model. Investment is inefficient because of bad data and a workforce with little experience of big projects.The distorting effects of the embargo and communism have also produced idiosyncratic obstacles for US companies.Taking Cuba off the government’s list of terrorism sponsors makes it easier for financial institutions to offer services there. Yet doing so would continue to pose a regulatory risk for US banks, which might worry about their liability if they process a customer transaction that runs foul of the embargo or laws that govern money laundering.MasterCard removed its block on the use of its US-issued credit cards in March, but the banks that issue the cards decide whether they will work. They have declined so far, as the risk may be small but is still hard to justify.It is a balancing act, says Yosbel Ibarra, co-chair of the Latin America practice at Greenberg Traurig, the law firm. “What are the bank’s compliance costs? How much money can be made? It’s complicated. Though I also think that it’s just a matter of time.”Telecommunications companies could try to capitalise sooner. IDT Corp became the first US company to offer direct, long-distance telephone calls to Cuba after a deal in March with ETECSA, the state telecoms company.But ETECSA will not allow IDT to offer other services, such as sending top-up mobile minutes to relatives in Cuba, and fees imposed by the Cuban government for calls from the US are some of the highest in Latin America.To the rest of the world, tourism is Cuba’s most appealing economic sector, and it is growing. The number of tourists climbed by 36 per cent in the first quarter from the 2014 figure, and available bedrooms at hotels or privately run casas particulares have been hard to find lately, according to economist Omar Everleny of the University of Havana.Arnold Donald, chief executive of cruise line Carnival, cites “pent-up demand” and the country’s proximity to the company’s main port in Miami. Yet cruises to Cuba almost certainly cannot begin until the embargo, which prohibits American tourism to Cuba, is lifted. Certain categories of travel are permitted — for journalistic activity, cultural exchange, to visit family — but it is unrealistic to fill a cruise ship with people who satisfy these criteria.A different set of challenges awaits US hotel groups, should they try to set up in Cuba, says Mr Hufbauer: “Any US company [considering future investment] must do its own strategic analysis about whether it will eventually want to compete with state-owned enterprises or partner with them.”The state typically insists on having a majority stake in partnerships with foreign companies. And for now, Cuba’s dual-currency system effectively functions as a tax on this sector.Similar obstacles arise in other sectors, and they all point to the same conclusion.The promise of closer diplomatic ties is exciting, but without an end to the embargo and a further liberalisation of the Cuban economy, US corporates can only wait, watch and prepare.

Europay merged with MasterCard in 2002.The payment standards issue is the latest in a series of scuffles over Chinese techno-nationalism.In 2003, for example, China tried to force all wireless internet devices sold in the country to support its homegrown Wapi standard, an alternative to global WiFi. China eventually reversed after pressure from the tech industry, high-level negotiations with the US and the threat of a challenge at the World Trade Organisation.To meet the new payments standards, Visa and MasterCard would have to change the way they produce cards, potentially at enormous cost.""This will definitely impact the foreign players, but it is not finalised yet,"" says James Chen, greater China general manager at First Data Corp and former China GM at MasterCard. ""The issues can be resolved. The question is, how much space is left for Visa and MasterCard?""Payment card standards underpin the fingernail-sized chips embedded in global debit and credit cards, increasingly a substitute for less secure magnetic strips.While the US has been slow to adopt the chip-and-pin technology, China is following Europe in attempting to phase out magnetic strips. Both the international and the Chinese payment-card standards generate single-use data for each transaction, making the information useless for a hacker attempting to clone a card.""I don’t think [the technical standards requirement] blocks [Visa and MasterCard] from entering the market, but it is a delaying tactic that will hold them back awhile,"" says Gilles Ubaghs, financial services technology analyst at Ovum, a consultancy.Experts say China, if challenged at the WTO on payment card standards, may again cite security concerns, as it did when it tried to persuade the International Organisation for Standardisation to certify Wapi.The new rules enabling foreign companies to seek renminbi clearing licenses follow a WTO ruling in 2012 that Beijing unfairly discriminated against non-domestic electronic payment processors.The local incumbent, China UnionPay, was created by the central bank and spun off as an independent company in 2002. It is now controlled by a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks, with a succession of former senior central bank officials as chairmen.Chinese banks do issue Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit cards — whose payments are processed through their foreign-currency networks — but few Chinese merchants accept them. Instead, Chinese cardholders use them mainly for foreign travel.Even as Visa and MasterCard have been stymied in China, UnionPay has rapidly expanded its global market share. Last year, it accounted for 10 per cent of purchase transactions worldwide, up from 6 per cent in 2012, according to the Nilson Report.A key question for Visa and MasterCard is whether they will accept the technical standards requirement or ask the US government to return to the WTO for another round of litigation.While a legal challenge could further delay their entry into the renminbi market, legal experts say they have a strong case. Brian Mercurio, law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says Beijing may be violating the WTO requirement that countries adopt internationally recognised technical standards barring a compelling reason to diverge.The issues can be resolved. The question is, how much space is left for Visa and MasterCard?Advocates of the Chinese payment standard say it includes additional features not supported by EMV, such as support for near-field communication technology, which enables “contactless” payments.However, ""even if it is possible for, say, MasterCard and Visa to redesign their own chip to meet that standard, the fact that it is possible doesn't detract from the point that China would be deviating from the international standard and creating an unnecessary barrier to trade,"" says Mr Mercurio.""Visa believes that globally interoperable standards in the payments industry are critical to ensure cardholder convenience and security,"" the company said, adding that it is “confident” a viable solution can be reached.MasterCard declined to comment.Additional reporting by Ma Nan"
94;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-06-03T11:11:54Z;China drives Asia tourism spending to fresh heights;Middle Kingdom visitors fuel Thai recovery but raise infrastructure worries;Travellers from China are powering a rise in Asian regional tourism spending that is outstripping economic growth but could leave infrastructure in some countries lagging in its wake.Growing arrivals from the Middle Kingdom have fuelled double-digit annual rises in visitor receipts in popular cities, as expanding air routes make trips more cost-effective.Bangkok’s rebound after a big hit last year from its political crisis highlights the unquenched appetite of a generation of newly wealthy Chinese for venturing south, in volumes that have at times left some destinations feeling overwhelmed.“Travel in general is growing much faster than economic growth overall and that trend is going to continue into the foreseeable future,” said Matthew Driver, president of Southeast Asia for MasterCard, who added that tourism from the richest Asian economies was also buoyant. “If we have got the infrastructure, the growth will come very, very quickly.”Asian cities accounted for half the top 10 most popular overnight visitor destinations worldwide, according to a report published by MasterCard on Wednesday. Individuals’ spending in Bangkok, Singapore, Seoul, Taipei and Tokyo has increased by compound annual rates of at least 9.7 per cent over the past six years, even if their fortunes varied last year.China is providing the impetus throughout, with visitor numbers to its old enemy Japan climbing more than three-quarters last year. Spending across the region is also being lifted by shopping mall developments and the rise of niche sub-industries, such as health tourism in Singapore and halal tourism in Malaysia.Bangkok is perhaps the most striking symbol of the Asian tourist times. While the city narrowly failed to wrest the crown of most popular overnight destination back from London, China drove a sharp reversal of fortune after holidaymakers had stayed away during the months of protests that culminated in a military coup last year.Mainland Chinese tourist arrivals in Thailand in March more than doubled year on year to almost 680,000, according to government statistics, also taking them far past their pre-troubles 2013 level. China and other Asian countries accounted for almost two-thirds of total tourist visitors to Thailand in March, up from just over 50 per cent last year, while Europe’s share fell from 32 per cent to 21 per cent.It has not all been plain sailing, however, as the visitor upturn has once again stoked worries over long-delayed projects to improve Thailand’s creaking transport and resort infrastructure.There has also been a spate of negative coverage about the behaviour of some Chinese holidaymakers, including air rage, public defecation and drying underwear at a temple. But critics of the tales say they are unrepresentative, inevitable given the large number of visitors — and humdrum companion pieces to infamous stories about the conduct of some Britons and other westerners.
95;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-06-02T15:49:02Z;The future belongs to the cities of the west;These are places where today’s 0.1 per cent, the most mobile class in history, might want to live;"Today’s global city must have bike paths and sunny restaurant terraces, says former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt. It needs pretty neighbourhoods and great art. A strong urban economy is not enough to attract talent. “People will choose where to live,” says Ajay Banga, president and chief executive of MasterCard. “Capital will follow where people go. I’m not sure that talent follows capital as easily.”Fun as well as rich: this is the consensus picture of the successful global city that emerged from last week’s Chicago Forum on Global Cities. By this description, for decades to come most great cities will be western ones. The US and western Europe combined have less than 10 per cent of the world’s population, yet rankings of world cities tend to begin with New York, London and Paris before passing on to Tokyo, perhaps Hong Kong, says Richard Longworth, author of On Global Cities. Since these are the cities where power and wealth are increasingly concentrated, the west may continue to outcompete the rest.Most big developing-world cities mushroomed after about 1950, in the automobile age. But the roads of Beijing, Rio, Istanbul and others are gridlocked. Many Chinese cities have unsafe air, and Latin American ones have unsafe streets. As Hank Paulson, former US Treasury secretary who chairs the Paulson Institute, points out: “Nowhere in the developing world do you see a successful urbanisation model.”Lest this sounds like a partisan western view, note that the Chinese and Russian elites are increasingly stashing their money and children in western cities. Wang Shu, Pritzker-prize-winning Chinese architect, says his compatriots have spent 30 years destroying their own traditional cities. Even the landmark buildings by brand-name international architects that now adorn Chinese downtowns are out of context. Mr Wang says Chinese people have recently begun asking: “Where is our memory and our life and our culture?”Hundreds of cities are being built across Asia. But it is hard to give a new city life, says Mr Wang. Wim Pijbes, director of Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum, notes that newcomers such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi are trying to fill new museums with art. But buying rootless collections rarely works.A large chunk of pre-1900 human heritage, neighbourhoods as well as art, is now concentrated in a few western cities. Preserved history is part of the appeal of London and Paris. The great western cities have innumerable assets besides. Built mostly before cars, they can adapt relatively easily to a new-old era of walking, cycling and public transport. They also house all nationalities. And they keep getting safer, albeit not yet as safe as Hong Kong, where the homicide rate is near the world’s lowest and crime data are so sparse that “predictive policing” — the statistical approach to law enforcement being adopted in places such as Chicago — barely works.There are signs of trouble however; New York and London in particular are becoming bastions of the superrich. Hong Kong, where more than a few people already live 30 or more floors up, lacks room to expand. If first-tier cities hit their limits, smaller ones can pinch business.But their rivals will mostly be other western cities: Berlin, which competes with London for artists and techies, Oxford or Austin, Texas. These are places where today’s 0.1 per cent, the most mobile class in history, might want to live. As long as some Swedish diplomats refuse to move to Beijing because they consider it “unbearable”, as Mr Bildt told delegates at a conference last week, China’s capital and its developing-world peers will remain second-tier. In an age when global cities suck in global talent, that matters.simon.kuper@ft.com"
96;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-05-31T07:58:38Z;China opens door for Visa and MasterCard to challenge UnionPay;Even a small slice of nation’s bank card market would boost foreign players;Global bank card operators including Visa and MasterCard can seek licences to clear domestic Chinese payments starting on Monday, following a long-running effort to penetrate a market dominated by a state-backed incumbent.The biggest share price gains for both Visa and MasterCard over the past year have come in response to Chinese government policies that open the local payment card market to foreign players.In late October, China’s cabinet announced it would allow foreign companies to access the market. The government followed up in April with rules that take effect on June 1.Previously, all renminbi payments had to be cleared through China UnionPay, a network created by the central bank and now owned by 85 mostly state-owned banks. But in 2012 the World Trade Organisation ruled that China unfairly discriminated against foreign payment processors, handing a victory to the US, which brought the complaint.Industry experts say foreign players still face big challenges in trying to win market share from UnionPay, the settlement network used by 80 per cent of debit cards accounting for 72 per cent of total transaction value in 2014, according to Datamonitor.“Visa and MasterCard need to build up their local infrastructure. In the past they just operated as a sales office. They don’t really have the physical presence,” said James Chen, former China general manager for MasterCard and now greater China general manager at First Data Corp.“They need to start to recruit people and buy equipment — basically build from ground zero.”Chinese banks do issue Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit cards — whose payments are processed through their foreign-currency networks — but few Chinese merchants accept them. Instead, Chinese cardholders use them mainly for foreign travel.Before 2010, many banks issued dual-currency credit cards with both a UnionPay and a foreign logo. But dual-currency cards were largely halted after a dispute between Visa and UnionPay in 2010.Central bank data shows that banks had issued 4.9bn debit and credit cards in the country by the end of 2014, with retail payments totalling Rmb42tn ($6.8tn), a third higher than 2013.Even after the rules take effect, foreign operators face a long road. Though now ostensibly independent from the government, UnionPay has been chaired by a succession of former senior officials from the People’s Bank of China, and the government is keen to support the company’s growth both within China and overseas, where its cards are accepted in 150 countries.“Realistically, Visa and MasterCard are not going to be the dominant card networks in China in the near future,” said Tristan Hugo-Webb, associate director of global payments at Mercator Advisory.“Nonetheless, even a small share of the fast-growing Chinese electronic payment market will be a big boon for Visa and MasterCard as they increasingly face competition from other players in the global payments marketplace.”Twitter: @gabewildau
97;MA;Mastercard Inc;2015-04-13T17:12:11Z;Citigroup reshuffles top ranks as Manuel Medina-Mora retires;Asia Pacific chief Stephen Bird to head group’s global consumer bank;Citigroup shuffled its executive team on Monday, a chain reaction of job moves started by the retirement of Manuel Medina-Mora, head of the consumer business, whose standing was hurt by fraud in Mexico.Stephen Bird, head of Asia Pacific, will replace Mr Medina-Mora as head of Citi’s global consumer bank, according to an internal memo from chief executive Mike Corbat. Francisco Aristeguieta, head of Latin America, will succeed Mr Bird. Jane Fraser, head of US retail and commercial banking, will succeed Mr Aristeguieta.In his memo, Mr Corbat said that Mr Bird, who will move from Hong Kong to New York, had “gained deep experience in consumer banking and our operations across several geographies . . . significantly increasing net income by focusing on target clients in the region”.Mr Bird was head of consumer banking and global cards in Asia before becoming co-chief executive, alongside Shirish Apte, of the region in 2009 when Ajay Banga left to join MasterCard. In 2013 he was on the short list of potential candidates to become chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland.Mr Medina-Mora came to Citi via its $12.5bn acquisition in 2001 of Banamex, the Mexican bank, which then consolidated its position as one of Citi’s crown jewels even as much of the global empire showed chronic weaknesses.But last year Banamex was engulfed in two fraud scandals. It admitted that faulty internal procedures had enabled Oceanografía, a contractor to Mexican state oil company Pemex, to stack up fake invoices. Then Citi said that an outside investigation had exposed a $15m fraud in a unit that oversaw senior executives’ security.Mr Medina-Mora’s was not implicated in either episode but was held responsible for weaknesses in oversight. One of Mexico’s most famous bankers, his cousin Eduardo Medina-Mora, a well-known Mexican diplomat, was last month confirmed as one of the country’s supreme court judges.The Mexican operation, which is much bigger than most parts of Citi’s sprawling global network, had been run separately but will now be part of Ms Fraser’s remit. She will report directly to Mr Corbat as part of the new structure and will move to Miami.“Jane has reengineered the mortgage business, streamlined our branch footprint and driven cross-business collaboration while improving productivity, controls and performance,” Mr Corbat said in his memo. He said Mr Bird would announce her successor for the US consumer business. The executives take up their new jobs on June 1.The personnel moves follow another retirement last week when Brian Leach, Citi’s head of strategy and risk, stepped down.
98;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Democratising finance: Technology improves access for the masses;FT series examines the impact of new banking competition;There are two popular perceptions of Nigeria. To many, it is the beating heart of Africa’s growth story, with GDP expanding by about 7 per cent a year. To others, it is a country in turmoil, with a fragile democratic government desperate to shrug off the mounting atrocities of Boko Haram terrorists.The rollout of a national ID scheme by President Goodluck Jonathan captures this ambiguity. Electronic chips on the new ID cards store details of the holder’s iris and fingerprints, boosting security. But with the backing of MasterCard, these are also payment cards — and a potential harbinger of access to finance for the masses.“This is digitalisation, democratisation and financial inclusion all rolled into one,” says Ann Cairns, who heads international operations for MasterCard.Once it is fully implemented, the project will allow 100m Nigerians to access financial services. It is just one of countless initiatives around the world being touted as proof that digitalising finance can empower people.Over the next week, the Financial Times in its series “Democratising Finance” will examine the initiatives that are bringing new sources of finance, new forms of currency and new methods of payment to new customers — and ask the question: is the world genuinely being “democratised”, as many of those behind such innovations insist?Nigeria’s ID scheme is a case in point. To its fans, the project is a slick way to modernise the country, leapfrogging some of the west’s traditional ways of doing things in the process. But it has been criticised by human rights and protest groups. Privacy International, the data protection charity, has raised concerns about the potential abuse of biometric data. And local protest groups have complained about the involvement of a western financial company, the MasterCard branding on the back of the ID card was akin to the branding of people in the 19th century slave trade, they said.Finance companies, from MasterCard to the biggest banks, dispute suggestions of exploitation. But there is no denying that access to digital technology is helping financiers tap lucrative new markets.“Making access to finance more democratic is not only about social responsibility, it’s a business model,” says Carlos Lopez-Moctezuma, the Mexico-based head of financial inclusion at BBVA.The Spanish bank operates in Mexico through a network of 30,000 agents — local shops, pharmacies and post offices. Now in an effort to reach a broader spread of customers improve efficiency and reduce risk, the bank is trying to shift agents away from traditional cash transactions by encouraging them to turn their smartphones into point of sale devices.In another initiative, 2.5m customers now have an integrated mobile phone number and bank account number. “It is about using technology to reach more people but also making life easier by understanding what they want,” says Mr Lopez-Moctezuma.Only a few banks are thinking radically about technology and finance, using big data to analyse customer behaviour, for example, or partnering with peer-to-peer lenders. Many of the biggest advances in bringing financial services to the masses have come from mobile operators and technology companies.Vodafone’s M-Pesa service, a relatively low-tech money-transfer scheme launched in 2007 using mobile phones and on-the-ground agents, dominates in Kenya, Tanzania and beyond. Similar schemes have spread across Latin America.Vikram Pandit, the former chief executive of Citigroup and now a financial technology investor in a range of whizz-bang start-ups, is full of admiration. He says that M-Pesa might be simple in comparison with cutting-edge “fintech”, but it is fulfilling a gaping need. “The most fundamental needs of the poor are not ‘which stock can I buy?’ It’s just matching inflows and outflows of their lives and almost all of them come down to payment systems.”Not everyone is so upbeat. Arjan Schutte, another fintech investor and founder of Core Innovation Capital, says: “I’m a bear on the mobile phone. It should be the great democratiser. [But] how old a story is M-Pesa? Come on! In 10 years no one else has been able to leapfrog over the consumer finance infrastructure. There’s nothing even close. There’s no story to tell at scale other than M-Pesa.”In the west a different form of “democratisation” is taking place, whereby ordinary people who would once have had no access to key parts of the financial-services market can suddenly find themselves enfranchised. Online platforms that use “big data” analysis to judge credit risk are widening the pool of people who can borrow money (though it may also allow risk to be so finely assessed that some people will become unfinanceable or uninsurable).New psychometric testing is doing the same in emerging and developed markets alike.Mr Pandit believes in the need to “democratise the disparity” between US billionaires who can earn 20 per cent on a big M&A deal and the 2 per cent return available to most Americans. And sure enough, online platforms that give access to “crowdfunded” equity investments are rocketing in popularity.But it is the broadening and deepening of the crowdfunded debt market that has been one of the most striking trends of recent years. From Shanghai to London to New York peer-to-peer lenders, online platforms that match people looking to invest money with individuals and companies that want to borrow it, are doubling or tripling in size every few months.In the past it wasn’t really possible for individuals to lend to businesses unless they had £100,000 or more available. Now they’re on an equal footing with big institutionsIn a sign of the excitement around the industry, one of the world’s biggest, Lending Club, floated with a valuation of more than $5bn.Samir Desai, chief executive of British P2P lender Funding Circle, says that there are clear benefits for borrowers who might otherwise be unable to find the money they need but also for lenders looking for worthwhile investment opportunities. “In the past it wasn’t really possible for individuals to lend to businesses unless they had £100,000 or more available. Now they’re on an equal footing with big institutions. That is true democratisation.”Others are less sure. Marshall Wace, a hedge fund group that is backing a P2P venture, thinks the “peer” funding element that has underpinned the sector to date will steadily institutionalise so that big asset managers and banks become the main funders of lending on these platforms. “There’s a romantic idea about peer-to-peer,” says Simon Champ, who heads the company’s P2P operation. “But it is not only about democratisation. It’s also about the replacement of an outdated, 300-year-old business model, with a new, more efficient one.”As one user of Lending Club commented: “Success drew in institutional players, with high-speed computer programmes to buy loans in seconds. So, a good deal for borrowers and institutions, not so sure about retail investors.”Some regulators and commentators are also concerned that the P2P market has been tested only in a low interest rate environment. When rates rise, defaults increase and investors get burnt, there could be a popular backlash.Few would dispute that technological innovation is benefiting the masses in much of the world, aiding financial inclusion from the most basic payment services to the most sophisticated investment strategies. But if this is democratisation, it is unlikely to be a painless process.As Abraham Lincoln said of the impending US election in 1864: “It’s the people’s business . . . If they turn their backs to the fire and get scorched in the rear, they’ll find they have got to sit on the blister.”
99;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;EU caps debit and credit card transaction fees;Draft law seeks to end protracted battle with payment groups;Fees to process debit and credit card transactions are to be capped under an EU law that attempts to wrap-up a protracted battle with payment groups such as Visa Europe and MasterCard.Negotiators for EU member states and the European Parliament on Wednesday night agreed draft terms to introduce maximum fees to handle card transactions, scaling back a multibillion-euro revenue stream for European banks.The ceiling in the regulation of about 0.2 per cent for debit card rates and 0.3 per cent for credit cards is in line with antitrust deals on cross-border fees. Its impact is likely to be felt most in markets such as Germany, where average credit card rates stand at 1.8 per cent, and Poland, where average debit card charges are 1.6 per cent.Retailers have long decried paying what they see as excessive fees for handling card payments, the cost of which is hidden from consumers. Under the reforms, retailers will also now enjoy more freedom to chose between cards charging different fees.Brussels’ resort to regulation was an attempt to provide a more comprehensive solution to an issue that had stretched the limits of antitrust enforcement for more than two decades. It follows similar legislative efforts by the US, Switzerland, Spain and Australia, the results of which were bitterly contested.Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, said: “This legislation is good for consumers, good for business, and good for Europe. It will lead to lower prices and visibility of costs for consumers. It reduces a ‘tax’ levied on business by banks in the form of interchange fees, and releases the brakes that have so far held back innovation.”Card schemes and banks warn the legislative reforms will backfire because retailers will pocket any savings from fee restrictions, while consumers will pay more through upfront banking fees. Crucially, MasterCard lost its court appeal against a commission finding that the interbank card fees violated competition law.In 2011, about 727m payment cards were issued in the EU and the value of card transactions exceeded €1.9tn. Visa and MasterCard have a 41.6 per cent and 48.9 per cent market share respectively.Retailers across Europe pay banks about €13bn a year to handle transactions, and 70 per cent of this charge is accounted for by interchange fees between banks handling the process.Under the draft deal, cross border debit card transactions are limited to 0.2 per cent of the transaction. For domestic transactions, member states have an option, for up to five years, to apply the 0.2 per cent limit to the annual weighted average.The rules also partly apply to so-called three party schemes, such as Diners Club and American Express, which do not use an interchange fee. The schemes will not be subject to the regulation as long as the card is both issued and processed within the same scheme. After three years, this will extend to schemes that licence to other parties to issue cards.MasterCard and Visa were able to overturn a parliamentary proposal and win an exemption for commercial cards used only for business expenses.The draft deal agreed on Wednesday will need to be formally approved by EU member states and the European Parliament early next year.

Santander will buy shares worth 5.5 per cent of the existing share capital, Telefónica 2.2 per cent and MasterCard 0.5 per cent.The new investments amount to buying 161m new shares at Wednesday’s closing price of 30.5p per share. This group of “strategic partners” has also joined discussions to “expand its commercial relationships” with Monitise.The agreements will provide a welcome respite for the British technology start-up, which has seen its share price lose more than half of its value since January. In this time, it has been hit by two profit warnings, global nervousness over tech stocks and problems over a shift in business model. Last month, Visa, it’s fourth largest shareholder and long-time investor, said it had hired JPMorgan to advise on the potential sale of its 5.5 per cent stake in the company.Alastair Lukies, Monitise’s founder and co-chief executive and a former rugby star turned tech entrepreneur, said his strategy is to switch focus from a large number of small deals to pursuing bigger alliances to build a global platform.“This shows that we’re here to stay,” he said. “If you look at some of the commentary and shorting arguments, people have suggested we’re a busted flush . . . [but following the latest deals] there can be no question that we need to raise more capital. We’re debt free and have plenty of cash. 2015 should be, from a share price perspective, a really positive year as we continue to execute.”Dispatches from the tech world: FT experts in San Francisco, London and Taipei upload their viewsPeter Roe, research director at TechMarketView, the analyst group, cautioned the company must continue to seek more deals to maintain its goal to be profitable by 2016.“We want to see that Monitise is building momentum, with a drumbeat of good announcements and a building of confidence that shows the company is building scale and really seizing the opportunity,” he said.In August, Monitise announced a deal with IBM that opens access to Big Blue’s corporate client base. That agreement also included the transfer of about 200 workers to the US tech conglomerate. On Thursday, IBM also agreed to expand this relationship by using its artificial intelligence engine Watson to support Monitise’s mobile money technology.Monitise, which listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market in 2007, has 30m registered users, via customers such as HSBC and RBS. It builds banking and payment apps, as well as software that lets different financial institutions talk to one another in order to facilitate mobile transactions. It likens itself to a next-generation Link, the organisation that co-ordinates ATMs in the UK.The company has undergone a major transformation in recent months. It has taken a number of steps to shift from a licence business model, which required its customers to pay a large upfront fee, to a subscription-based model.Monitise has also made changes to its board, as well as recruiting two Visa executives: Elizabeth Buse joined as co-chief executive in June, and Mike Dreyer, Visa’s former global head of technology, was appointed president for the Americas this month.

Sales climbed 13 per cent to $2.5bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of 78 cents a share, on revenue of $2.45bn.Revenue climbed on the back of an increase in cross-border volume fees and transaction processing fees.On Thursday, the State Council in China said it would allow foreign companies to clear electronic payments, which was welcome news for MasterCard and Visa.“Although MasterCard was pleased with reports that China plans to open up their domestic processing market, this is only the first of many steps needed to get MasterCard access to this market, while the regulatory framework and timing surrounding this initiative require more clarity,” Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies, said.Shares of MasterCard climbed 9 per cent to $83.13 and are down 3 per cent so far this year.Shares of Lakeland Industries, maker of protective suits used by healthcare workers treating Ebola, surged 23 per cent to $14.24.The company said on Wednesday that it had received orders for 1m suits, with additional orders for other protective gear such as foot coverings and gloves.The company said it would increase manufacturing capacity for its suits after “experiencing significant interest globally for its ChemMAX and MicroMAX protective suit lines”.It expects monthly production capacity for the suit lines to increase 100 per cent by January 2015, after having increased 50 per cent from August to October this year.Shares in Lakeland are up more than 200 per cent this year.Shares of DreamWorks Animation fell more than 5 per cent to $22.03 despite an earnings beat.The company reported net income of $11.9m or 14 cents a share, compared with $10.0m or 12 cents a share a year ago. Sales climbed 17 per cent to $180.9m.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of 5 cents a share, on sales of $184.4m.Drew Borst, an analyst at Goldman Sachs said, said: “DreamWorks Animation remains in transition with a goal of diversifying away from feature films by expanding into related business, such as TV production, location-based entertainment and consumer products.

102;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa/MasterCard: growth is priceless;The future looks bright for Visa and MasterCard;At times you just need one good day to recover from a disastrous year. Football strikers know that (just ask Liverpool’s Mario Balotelli). MasterCard and Visa do too, now. Better-than-expected quarterly numbers and a robust outlook lifted shares in the two payment processors by nearly a tenth. After an uninspiring year, their share prices are now almost back to where they were in January. True, share price performance is not just about quarterly results. But their future looks bright.The US economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.5 per cent in the third quarter and the Federal Reserve has enough confidence to end quantitative easing. So consumers should have a renewed appetite for spending money. Visa and MasterCard expect payment volumes to grow by more than 10 per cent both this year and next.There have been concerns about challenges from the likes of Apple Pay. The new iPhone allows customers to use mobiles to pay for in-store products instead of cash or cards. But this is no threat to MasterCard and Visa – payments on Apple Pay still go through their cards, but in a digital form.Apple provides the slick, consumer-friendly platform that the card companies were unable to create. Apple does this for a fee but the card companies save the investment they would have had to make in building a platform themselves. The Silicon Valley threat has been overstated.China’s move to open up its domestic electronic payment market to foreign companies could be a bigger deal for MasterCard and Visa, if it happens. According to Nilson Report, Union Pay (the leading credit and debit card player in China) processes about $5tn worth of transactions each year. Add that to the fact that a large portion of China’s 1.3bn population has no or very basic access to banking services, and the potential for expansion is enormous. The challenge for the payment companies is to address the emerging markets profitably. Concerns about Brazil and Russia were behind their shares’ price fall earlier this year.Still, Visa and MasterCard look well set for the next few decades. Regardless of good or bad quarters, with 85 per cent of the world’s transactions still happening on paper, there are many growth opportunities. The valuation about 20 times next year’s forward earnings makes the two look expensive. Growth, it seems, is priceless.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
103;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-10-30T14:18:20Z;BBVA looks to US’s midwest for banking innovation;;Spanish bank BBVA has struck up a partnership with payments start-up Dwolla as the Spanish group continues trying to figure out how to integrate new digital technology into its core banking business.The partnership with Iowa-based Dwolla will enable customers of BBVA Compass, the bank’s US division, to use a network Dwolla has built that can move funds more quickly than traditional wire transfers allow. The target customers, says Dwolla’s chief executive Ben Milne, are online marketplaces that need to send payments to merchants on their platform, or small businesses that need to pay suppliers.Banks are racing to find ways to stay ahead of customers, who are shying away from bank brands and high-cost financial advisors in favour of quick and easy online banking and related apps that make it easy to manage their finances, get loans, pay for goods securely and quickly. Financial services companies from Citi to Wells Fargo and MasterCard are reaching out to developers and investing or partnering with start-ups.BBVA caught significant attention for its purchase earlier this year of Simple, an online-only bank that had won many fans in tech circles for giving customers with access to deep data analytics on their spending patterns. The bank has also been an active venture investor, banking companies such as Taulia, which helps small businesses handle invoicing, and Personal Capital, a digital wealth management start-up.“We believe that digital is the future, and we believe that it’s also a way to have customers outside our physical footprint,” said Jeff Dennes, the bank’s chief digital banking officer.The focus, says Mr Dennes, is tapping into start-ups’ skills in developing customer-focused products.“Different start-ups have tried to get a niche in designing a better experience than what banks are delivering today,” said Mr Dennes. “That’s where we spend more of our time focusing.”They are not the only bank to realize that customers tend to enjoy using products developed by Silicon Valley more than they enjoy using most of their banking services. The chief executive of Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, told the Financial Times recently that he looked to Apple and Google for their skills in design and product development.“I’m so impressed with, and envious of, companies who take complexity and make it simple,” said the chief executive, John Stumpf.
104;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;China to open bank cards to foreign competition;Policy shift opens door for Visa, MasterCard;China will allow foreign companies to clear electronic payments in its domestic market, its cabinet said on Thursday, opening the door for Visa and MasterCard to compete with the dominant state-owned champion.The World Trade Organisation ruled in 2012 that China unfairly discriminated against foreign electronic payment processors who wanted to process renminbi transactions, handing a victory to the US, which brought the complaint.Central bank rules require all payment cards – including debit and credit cards – to clear renminbi transactions through China UnionPay, a clearing network owned by 85 mostly state-owned banks. But in a statement, the State Council signalled a cautious shift.“In order to expand financial openness, promote innovative development of the domestic bank card and payment markets . . . foreign and domestically invested enterprises that meet requirements can all apply to establish bank card settlement organisations,” the State Council said, without referencing the WTO ruling.Many Chinese banks issue credit cards bearing the UnionPay logo alongside either Visa, MasterCard or American Express. UnionPay clears renminbi payments made with these cards, while the other systems are used for foreign currency payments.“One era ends, a new era begins. Opening up the payment clearing market is not only a WTO requirement, it’s also the necessary next step for an industry that has developed up to a certain point,” said Tang Bing, chief executive of Yeepay.com, a Beijing-based payment processor.Still, the extent to which foreign companies will be able to compete with UnionPay depends on implementation. In China’s policy making process, the State Council issues broad guidelines, leaving specific agencies to follow up with specific regulations. Even after the WTO ruling, the People’s Bank of China last year blocked a local online payment platform from issuing renminbi-settled credit cards in partnership with MasterCard.“If the policy can be smoothly and quickly implemented, it’s great for the industry. Merchants and users can expect higher quality and more diversified payment clearing service,” said Mr Tang.The market potential for foreign companies is enormous. Chinese consumers long favoured cash transactions, but that has changed in recent years. UnionPay bank card transactions hit Rmb21.8trn ($3.6tn) in 2012, up 37 per cent from 2011, and had issued more than 3.5bn cards.Still, UnionPay will remain a formidable competitor. Founded in 2002, its chairman until Thursday was Su Ning, a former central bank vice governor. But on the same day that the cabinet announced the policy, UnionPay’s website quietly changed the list of its senior executives, replacing Mr Su’s name with Ge Huayong, another former central banker and recently UnionPay’s vice-chairman.UnionPay did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Additional reporting by Ma Nan in Shanghai

He entered his company into IBM-sponsored SmartCamp – which identifies early stage entrepreneurs who are developing a business – and successfully negotiated competitions in London (UK), Vienna (Europe) and finally San Francisco (world) to win the overall award.“SmartCamp not only puts start-up entrepreneurs in front of seasoned and networked advisers, but also connects them with the venture capital community,” Mr Janes says.Competitions help a company “meet like-minded entrepreneurs and VCs who can really quiz you about your model in an intensive process”, he adds. “When you are at the coalface, it is very easy to think that everyone gets your concept as much as you do.”Shopa has raised what Mr Janes believes is the third largest Series A funding ever in the UK – just over $11m. “It has enabled the company to open an office in North America and we are just launching in China,” he says.An advisory board ideally comprises three or four “key people who can help you grow your business”, he says. “You don’t want yes men.”Growth Accelerator, a government-sponsored initiative run by Grant Thornton, the global accountancy firm, is open to all fast-growth UK-trading SMEs with sales of less than £40m per annum and growth ambitions of 20 per cent per year. While a joining fee is payable, match funding from the government is intended to make it affordable.“Growth Accelerator brings together fragmented advice in one place,” says Stephen Peacock, director of operations for business growth services at Grant Thornton.The project connects some 3,000 coaches with fast-growth UK-based businesses. The scheme works to solve a specific business challenge – be that strategy, leadership issues, finance or international expansion.Barbara Marchelle, an entrepreneur who sold her own business in 2007, says coaching for Growth Accelerator is a “second life”. One of the organisation’s strengths, says Ms Marchelle, is being able to match clients with consultants. “Chemistry is all-important,” she says.When Saiphin and Alex Moore, founders of Rosa’s Thai Café, wanted “a fresh set of eyes on the business”, Mr Moore was sure he “didn’t want a consultant”, he says. It was essential that his coach had successfully grown and exited a business – and Ms Marchelle had done just that.They went on to use Growth Accelerator to help them access growth finance, with the help of coach Tom Kristensen. Neither coach “wanted anything”, says Mr Moore, and this gave their advice objectivity although, ironically, both are now investors in the business.Advice that flows from experience has become a mantra for entrepreneurs.Silicon Valley Bank is, says Mr Brady, “narrowly focused on what we call the innovation economy. We banked Cisco when it was a start-up 28 years ago and we retain a banking relationship with Cisco today. Twitter is a more recent example.“The real test is when [you hit] the bumps in the road, not when the business is going well.”He points to initiatives by SVB to leverage the bank’s network of some 16,000 entrepreneurs and some 1,000 private equity and venture capital clients. SVB hosts networking events, offers clients a mentor network and runs a joint incubator with MasterCard in the financial technology space.Mr Brady has this advice for businesses seeking advisers. “Be aware of getting big names,” he says. “You need to be selfish. Have they got the time? Be aware too that, as the business changes, so does what you need of an advisory board. You may need to limit service terms to, say, 18 months. Finally, never forget: chemistry matters.”
106;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Google upbeat over brand advertising tools;Search group unveils tools to measure effectiveness of ad campaigns;Google has claimed promising early results from its latest attempt to draw brand advertisers, following years of disappointment over the slow growth of branded display and video ads to match its search business.Ads on YouTube, Google’s video platform, have so far failed to live up to the high expectations of Wall Street, despite the website’s surging traffic numbers.Google’s latest push relies on trying to prove to advertisers that their money is well spent.Neal Mohan, Google’s vice-president for display and video advertising products, said that its new tools for measuring the effectiveness of ad campaigns will be a “game-changer” for the industry.“The measurement tools we’re working on are the most significant way of bringing brand advertisers to digital,” he said.Some industry experts say that Google’s measurement tools are flawed, though that may not stop them from acting as a strong draw to advertisers.Google earns $50bn a year from advertising. But this is mainly from “direct response” advertisers who use the company’s search ads to prompt an immediate action such as a sale.Its success has been much more limited in the biggest part of the ad market – brand advertising.This type of advertising is designed to boost awareness and influence attitudes towards a brand, and many marketers believe it does not work as well online as it does on television.To prove to advertisers that it can help them grow their brands, Google has been building a range of brand measurement tools into all of its products – from YouTube to DoubleClick, which enables advertisers to buy display and video ads on numerous third-party sites across the internet.The latest tool, called Brand Lift, claims to show advertisers the “actual impact of your campaign on brand awareness, ad recall and brand interest”. Google obtains these results by conducting online surveys of people who saw the ad and others who did not.So far this year, Google has run “several thousand” Brand Lift studies for “several hundred” brand advertisers, including MasterCard and Oscar Mayer. It said that in early tests of the tool, advertisers saw an 82 per cent increase in ad recall, along with a 64 per cent rise in brand awareness.The tool will come to DoubleClick in the next couple of months.But not everyone is convinced of its efficacy. Paul J Lavrakas, former chief research methodologist at Nielsen Media Research, cautioned that the Brand Lift survey appeared to be a “quasi-experiment” with several methodological flaws.But he said the tool was likely to prove popular with advertisers in spite of its limitations. “Hundreds of billions of dollars in advertising have been allocated based on studies like these,” he added.Google has over the past two years taken a series of steps to coax brands further towards digital advertising.“Brand advertising is really starting to emerge as the next big growth opportunity for digital,” said Mr Mohan. “The addressable market is a couple hundred billion dollars if you think of the TV budgets out there today.”Google has not revealed the size of its display and video advertising businesses. But Pivotal Research has estimated that Google will this year generate revenues of $3.6bn from YouTube, $6.9bn from the Google Display Network and another $1.7bn from DoubleClick.
107;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-09-24T09:01:35Z;After the sanctions, prepare for the Russian counterattack;Moscow’s entanglements allow it to exact a price of its own, writes Juan Zarate;For all the costs that sanctions are inflicting on the Russian economy, the Russian flag still flies over Crimea, Moscow remains undeterred and the ceasefire in Ukraine is at risk. Worse still, Russia is using its own form of economic warfare as a shield and a sword.Western strategy has focused on blocking future deals with the Russian military sector, restricting Russian banks’ access to long-term capital, depriving elements of the Russian oil sector of technology they need for deep sea and shale drilling, and freezing the overseas assets of individuals tied to the Kremlin.But most existing contracts between western interests and their Russian clients have been allowed to continue. Rather than dealing an instant blow, the aim has been to starve the country of capital by sowing doubts among western investors about the wisdom of investing in Russia. Contracts and capital have evaporated, growth has slowed and major Russian companies such as Aeroflot have been unable to acquire necessary investment.But there is a limit to the amount of financial pain that the west can inflict on a major economy with substantial economic ties to Europe and the rest of the world. Russia’s entanglements are vulnerabilities but they also allow Russia to exact a price of its own.Companies subject to western sanctions are making moves to circumvent the restrictions. Rosneft, the Russian oil company, is set to buy 30 per cent of Norway’s north Atlantic Drilling, enabling it to access offshore drilling capabilities in the Arctic despite technology export bans and financial restrictions.Meanwhile, Russian investors deepen their economic interests in London, Frankfurt and New York. And the Russian sovereign wealth fund will be tapped for billions of dollars to shore up necessary capital requirements for its banks hit by sanctions.Sep 5, 2014: The EU is working on barring Russia’s state-controlled oil companies from raising funds on European capital markets. Lex contributors Joseph Cotterill and Alan Livsey discuss Rosneft.Watch the videoMoscow is biting back. In June it ended flows of oil and gas to Ukraine, and it is restricting exports to other European customers as winter approaches. The Kremlin has banned agricultural imports from countries that have participated in the sanctions. It has closed four McDonald’s restaurants, using health inspections as a pretext, and it is flirting with a national payment system that could replace Visa and MasterCard. Western airlines may find themselves unable to fly over Siberia, forcing flights to Asia to take big detours. American consulting and accounting firms may be prevented from operating in Russia.Russia has more cards to play. It could cut off supplies of engines to the US space programme. It is a big exporter of titanium and other resources needed by western companies. Moscow could emerge as a sanctions-busting financial partner to a country such as Iran, at the height of nuclear negotiations. The Kremlin could also enlist criminal networks to attack the computer systems of western targets, including major banks.The west needs a comprehensive strategy that intensifies financial pressure on Moscow while deterring Russian escalation. Sanctions should no longer be tied to diplomatic milestones. Instead, they should be seen as a continuous campaign that leaves Mr Putin and the markets guessing. This approach has proved highly effective in Iran.New Russian investments in the west need to be carefully scrutinised and western commercial contacts with suspect individuals and companies further constrained. Europe needs to secure alternative sources of oil and gas, though this will take time. Other countries, too, should seek back-up supplies of resources they buy from Russia.Unless Washington and Brussels are willing to endure some economic pain, their sanctions campaign will prove ineffective. They should be prepared for a frozen conflict in which Moscow is willing to use its own economic weapons.The writer is author of ‘Treasury’s War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare’
108;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-09-11T15:32:36Z;MasterCard loses EU appeal on cross-border fees;Legal decision could presage big compensation claims;MasterCard has definitively lost its seven-year legal quest to overturn an EU antitrust decision, leaving it vulnerable to hefty damages claims and further regulatory action to cap interbank fees for card transactions.The ruling from the EU’s highest court on Thursday dismissed MasterCard’s appeal, closing an antitrust saga that started in 1992 when British retailers complained about being overcharged for cross-border card transactions.Although the outcome was widely expected, the legal certainty the judgment brings could presage a new era for European card companies, with big compensation claims and tightly regulated fees that are more transparent to consumers.Most card users are unaware of the charges. About €13bn a year is paid by retailers in Europe to banks for handling transactions, about 70 per cent of which is accounted for by interbank fees.While retailers and regulators want to stamp out profiteering through overcharging, the big two card groups – MasterCard and Visa Europe – see the fees as underpinning cheap and secure service with benefits such as insurance and loyalty rewards.The defeat confirms the European Commission decision in 2007 that found the group restricted competition and inflated prices for retailers and consumers. Following that decision, MasterCard cut its interbank rates while it awaited the appeal.On Thursday, MasterCard said the “negative judgment will have little or no impact” on how it operates with regard to these cross-border interchange fees, where a consumer’s bank levies on a merchant’s bank for retail sales transactions.However these cross-border transactions represent a relatively small part of MasterCard’s overall business. It is now facing pressure from retailers to voluntarily reduce domestic interbank fees to match the restrictions on cross-border charges.The judgment also gives some momentum to a host of damages claims against MasterCard, as well as giving political impetus to a proposed law to cap fees for all consumer credit and debit card transactions.In Britain alone MasterCard is facing more than £1bn in damages claims from retailers including Tesco and Next, in cases that are in part based on the commission’s 2007 decision.Suits have also been filed against Visa Europe, the other big card payment group, and national competition watchdogs are considering opening or pressing on with cases on interchange fees.Most concerning for the card companies is a Commission proposal to impose a ceiling on debit and credit card rates, which was proposed last year and is moving through the Brussels legislative system.Backers of curbs on fees are pleased with the progress of talks, with the EU member states seeking to reach a common position and start negotiations with the European parliament by the end of the year.
109;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Mr Noyes said retailers were reluctant to sign up, partly because Apple Pay might trigger more use of credit cards, which impose more costs on merchants.We’ve tested lots of different wallet solutions and investigated many many others, this really was the best one that focused on the customer“What Apple has announced today is essentially an acceleration in the extinction in the physical card,” said Jason Oxman, chief executive of the Electronic Transactions Association, an industry group.He added: “Cynicism is well placed in that Apple did not announce anything new, but what they announced is that Apple is doing something – they didn’t invent the smartphone, they didn’t invent the tablet, they just designed it and deployed it better than anyone else,” he said.The new system is available on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and Apple Watch. The customer takes a photo of their card on their phone and then verifies the card with the bank. They can then hold their device near to a contactless reader and verify payments with their finger using Apple’s Touch ID system.Data security was high on the agenda, with Eddy Cue, Apple’s head of software and services, telling the audience Apple would not store credit card numbers or give them to merchants.The US has the world’s biggest fraud problem, with losses up 14.5 per cent to $5.3bn in 2012, according to The Nilson Report. Retailers and banks, which have suffered from high-profile bulk hacking of credit card information, are attracted to the fact that Apple Pay does not transmit the credit card number.“That card information will be replaced with a single-use token,” said Eileen Serra, head of card services at JPMorgan.Ms Serra suggested that the biggest advantage of Apple Pay might not be in stores but for online shopping, where the need to type in credit card information and shipping addresses is an annoyance for consumers. “While online commerce is growing, that’s where the friction is most severe,” she said.

Some 400 components are in an iPhone, and manufacturers jostle to join the Apple supply chain. One of the biggest winners this time should be NXP Semiconductors. Its share price has nearly doubled in the past 12 months.The iPhone 6 could be hugely significant for NXP, beyond sales of commoditised NFC chips, if Apple can create a world of mobile payments. IHS calculates NXP’s bill of materials for the new iPhones could be nearly double that of the iPhone 5s, if it wins the NFC slot and maintains its other design slots.NXP should benefit because it is the world’s biggest producer of secure NFC chips and of the chip cards commonly used in Europe under the Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) standard. NXP already makes three-quarters of the chips in EMV cards, a semi market that could double between 2014 and 2018, Barclays estimates. EMV and NFC chips go hand in hand because when retail stores upgrade to accept one, they often accept the other. The US has so far been slow to adopt advanced payment systems (such as chip cards); the question is whether Apple’s push will succeed in getting retailers and customers to switch to contactless payments.NXP expects a near-term revenue boost of 11 per cent sequential growth this quarter. Growth looks set to continue: Gartner forecasts payments processed by NFC chips will grow 64 per cent a year on average between 2010 and 2017. Is this already priced in? At $71, NXP is trading 15 times forward earnings, with revenues growing 16 per cent a year. Not exactly cheap – but in line with other Apple suppliers such as Qualcomm (14 times) or Broadcom (15 times). If magnetic strip credit cards soon go the way of the dodo, NXP is a very good bet.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"

It’s about one in a million, rare enough to think that it is near impossibility. But there are businesses that deal with one-in-a-million occurrences every day: hyperscale companies. As a business leader, you will have to think very differently if you are going to run one of these hyperscale businesses or compete against them.Even if these businesses use “six sigma” processes, described as being 99.9966 per cent defect-free, they will generate more than 3,000 problems from every billion transactions or processes they undertake. Such scale and complexity is almost unimaginable for most executives, but these are businesses that can sweep away old business models. If you face competition from a hyperscale business, be prepared for disruption.The internet and digitisation are clearly the main catalysts of the early hyperscale companies. Google processes 4bn searches per day. Twitter users tweet more than 500m times per day. Facebook has more than 1bn users, approaching the second-largest nation of earth. China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba conducts 200m transactions per week in the world’s fastest-growing e-commerce market.But even some traditional businesses fully enabled by digital technology are hitting hyperscale. China Mobile has more than 760m subscribers. Global payments networks run by Visa, MasterCard and Amex already process billions of consumer transactions per year. And as connected digital sensors and devices are embedded in the physical world – a trend described as “the internet of things” – even companies in traditional industries could face hyperscale challenges. GE and other large industrial companies are moving in this direction.Whether you are an entrepreneur, an investor, or a business leader, you must recognise the dawning of a new age of hyperscale businesses, and try to understand the unique management challenges and opportunities associated with them.We do not yet have a set of best practices about how to create and operate such a business. We are, nevertheless, starting to see some patterns in how they operate and the unique requirements for managing these businesses:Firstly, hyperscale businesses exhibit hypergrowth, at least at some stage of their development. WeChat, the mobile text and voice messaging communication service developed by China’s Tencent, added 300m users in two years, more than the entire adult population of the US. To sustain hypergrowth, you must offer value propositions that will resonate worldwide, invest ahead of the exponential adoption – focusing on capital rather than operating expenditure – and hire people who are vastly overqualified and therefore ready for each rapid wave of change.Secondly, hyperscale businesses achieve tremendous operating leverage, largely through process automation. Automation means that you do not have to suffer from diminishing returns to scale. Compare Detroit in 1990 and Silicon Valley in 2014. The three top companies in Detroit produced revenues of $250bn with 1.2m employees and a combined market capitalisation of $36bn. The top three companies in Silicon Valley in 2014 had revenues of $247bn, only 137,000 employees, but a market capitalisation of $1.09tnThirdly, hyperscale businesses exploit digital marginal cost economics. You can scale up hyperscale companies quickly because information goods have almost zero storage, transportation and replication costs. It took Buzzfeed, the online media organisation, only six years to attain 130m unique readers per month. In contrast, the New York Times has a monthly readership of 54m – despite the fact that the newspaper has existed since 1851.Fourth, if you run a hyperscale businesses, you will place yourself at the heart of rich ecologies of players (large and small). Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are embedded in the digital lives of their users and know how to generate value for advertisers and app developers. In turn, online hyperscale businesses provide rich – global – opportunities for many smaller businesses and service providers. On eBay, 97 per cent of commercial sellers export goods to customers in foreign countries, compared with less than 10 per cent in the case of traditional small businesses in most countries.Fifth, every hyperscale business is a big-data business. Online companies with large numbers of users can determine a great deal from their clickstreams and then monetise that information. Payment networks such as Visa, MasterCard, Amex and other players such as Square know a great deal about customers’ spending, and have created business lines based on mining this data. You must learn how to collect, integrate, manage, experiment and derive insight from big data to compete as a hyperscale business.Finally, hyperscale businesses create new business models that can quickly threaten incumbents. The characteristics that made Amazon successful in selling books armed the company for its assault on many other retail categories, its move into ecommerce and virtual-storefront services and eventually Amazon Web Services for cloud computing. As a business leader, you must consider what hyperscale businesses, existing and potentially emerging, could threaten your business model and how, and indeed whether you could grow a hyperscale businesses out of your existing company.Hyperscale businesses are already remoulding daily lives, and reshaping the ecology of business. Now is the time to get to know how to run them, or be ready to compete again them.

113;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-07-25T16:25:52Z;Visa falls after cut to sales guidance;Company points to Russia effect on cross-border transactions;Visa, which has found itself uncomfortably stuck in the middle of political wranglings between the US and Russia, was forced on Thursday to cut its sales guidance, a move that weighed on the company’s shares as well as those of rival credit card processors.The San Francisco-based company pointed to lower-than-expected cross-border transactions across a number of countries where geopolitical tension remains high, particularly Ukraine and Russia.Bryon Pollitt, the company’s chief financial officer, told analysts that while fourth-quarter revenues would rebound, they would be lower than anticipated earlier because of a drop-off in cross-border transactions and “unusually low levels of volatility across a broad range of currencies”.The company highlighted declining transactions between Russia and Ukraine with Europe, among other countries, for the dimmed view.Visa and MasterCard are also likely be hurt by a drive by the Russian government to establish a national payments system, which follows the suspension of services for customers of Russian banks affected by sanctions earlier this year.The comments on Russia came as the company reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $1.4bn, an increase of 11 per cent over the prior year.James Schneider, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the results were “disappointing” but that overall consumer spending would improve, lifting the company’s prospects.“We view this as a temporary phenomenon which is being driven by the simultaneous impact of lower international travel volumes in specific geographies, given regional unrest,” Mr Schneider said.Shares of Visa fell 3.58 per cent to close at $214.77, while MasterCard slipped 2.35 per cent to $75.75. American Express slid 1.31 per cent to $91.93.Pandora Media, the music streaming service, fell by more than a tenth as the company continued to rack up losses amid intensifying competition.The company, which has promised to spend aggressively on marketing to compete better with Spotify and Apple, said its loss swelled 70 per cent from a year earlier to $11.7m, or 6 cents per share.“Lack of near-term profits leaves shares vulnerable to shortfall in usage metrics, irrespective of Pandora’s clear success driving usage and ad share,” Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said.Pandora, however, said full-year sales would be above earlier estimates while earnings would range from 16 to 19 cents a share, slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Shares in the company, which counts 76.4m active users, slumped 10.34 per cent to end at $25.75.Wall Street wagged its collective finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Friday for spending that sent the world’s largest online retailer into the red last quarter.Shares in the company declined 9.65 per cent to $324.01.Amazon, which disclosed its second-quarter loss after the stock market closed on Thursday, said that some of the 24 per cent increase in spending last quarter came from investment in its cloud computing business, which competes with Microsoft and Oracle to host websites and store companies’ data digitally.Deckers Outdoor, the owner of the Ugg and Teva shoe brands, said its first-quarter loss was narrower than Wall Street estimates on strong consumer demand for its newer product lines as well as higher initial wholesale shipments heading into the fall.Sales rose 24 per cent from a year earlier to $211m in the three months to June 30. The company’s loss widened by a fifth to $36.8m, or $1.07 per share.Analysts with Jefferies lifted their view of the company to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ following the results. Deckers shares jumped 6.18 per cent to $90.50. Peer Skechers rose 0.17 per cent to end at $52.39.Overall, US equity markets slipped as geopolitical tensions continued to linger. Separately, a report from the Department of Commerce showed a better than expected improvement in durable goods orders in June, although figures for May were revised lower.The S&P 500 fell 0.48 per cent to close at 1,978.34 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.72 per cent to 16,960.57. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.5 per cent to end the day at 4,449.56.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

115;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-07-01T19:22:36Z;Russia boost for Visa and MasterCard;;Russia has raised hopes that Visa and MasterCard can continue operating in the country without paying hefty security deposits required under new legislation taking effect on Tuesday.If the two US credit card companies find ways by October 31 to process card transactions of Russian customers in Russia, the deposits – originally set at 25 per cent of daily turnover – will be reduced to zero, Russian media quoted Central Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina as saying in St Petersburg on Tuesday.The apparent softening of the new rules underlines Russia’s challenges in trying to reduce its dependence on the infrastructure of international finance as it is being threatened with further sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine.Visa and MasterCard have been caught in the crosshairs as political wrangling between Russia and the US have left them struggling to comply with the demands of operating in both countries.“Throughout this period, our message has been clear – we share the Russian government’s goal of moving more transactions from cash to electronic payments but not at any cost,” Ilya Riaby, general manager for MasterCard’s Russian business, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.After the two companies suspended services for customers of Russian banks affected by sanctions earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin ordered the government to work on the establishment of a national payments system.So far, Visa and MasterCard transmit information on all Russian transactions to their processing centres outside Russia for clearing. Russian banking experts said the two US card companies could either team up with Russian partners for onshore processing or would need to otherwise attain the status of domestic processors.MasterCard’s Mr Riaby said that the company had received responses from 20 Russian companies that could deliver switching and processing of MasterCard’s transactions in Russia and that it will choose a partner in the coming weeks. He also said progress had been made, including a delay to the introduction of the security deposit.“Final rules for payment systems in Russia still have not been adopted,” Visa said in a statement on Tuesday. “Visa has been in close and constant conversations with the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian government regarding the NPS [National Payment System] law.” The company added that it was actively working to localise domestic transactions.A law passed in May on such a payments system made it illegal for the two US card companies to block electronic payments for Russian customers and set the security deposit requirement. Visa has warned it expected the new rules to have an adverse impact on its earnings, and MasterCard said it was likely domestic processing would be required to move onshore.However, the preparations for the national payment system have been dragging on as the Central Bank has yet to decide which software to use and who should manage the new system. On Tuesday, Ms Nabiullina was quoted as saying the deadline for a working group to choose between a technology owned by state-owned Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, and another domestic software system had been extended until mid-July. The government expects that the new platform will not be ready until 18 months from now.
116;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;A first debit card for young people;A London-based start-up has launched a prepaid card that parents can put money on for children;"It may come as a surprise to some parents to discover that children as young as 11 can now get a bank debit card. Most are probably more concerned, however, that their children do not understand how to manage their pocket money wisely.A solution to this has arrived in the form of Osper, a London-based start-up.The newly launched service comprises a prepaid debit card, which is backed by MasterCard, and a mobile app. The app comes with separate logins for the young people and their parents, so a parent can put more money on the card and monitor how much is being spent. Children as young as eight can cope with it, the founders say.Rather than parents handing over cash or lending their own credit card for online purchases, which would be illicit, young people can use their Osper card to withdraw cash from a hole in the wall ATM or to buy stuff online. Because Osper Cards are prepaid, your offspring can only spend the money they have been given.Osper’s backers include: Travelex chief executive Peter Jackson; Brett Akker, co-founder of Streetcar and Lovespace; Index Ventures; and Horizons Ventures, the venture capital company of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing.The idea is to help parents transfer more responsibility to their children with regard to making decisions about money. The big opportunity for the company, it seems, is to capture potential banking customers at an early age, although Osper’s founder Alick Varma insists he has no plans to become a full service bank.While parents can put a block on websites and shops they do not want their children to visit, the worry now for parents will be wondering how their children are spending the pocket money they put on the Osper card.——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Financial learning for youngsters / From Dr Michal Macierzynski"
117;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Mobile payments groups set sights on winning over UK wallets;;"With banks, telecom operators and technology groups all scrambling to sign up Britain’s tap-happy mobile payers and shoppers, consumers are faced with a bewildering array of mobile payment options.The latest is from Klarna, the Swedish start-up whose service will launch with several British retailers this summer. Its selling point is its use of complex algorithms to check each transaction for fraud, based on factors like a customer’s purchase history and the time of day they buy something.“The UK is a mobile play,” the company said, adding that the country’s shoppers present an attractive opportunity because while Britain is Europe’s biggest ecommerce market, it lags behind in the percentage of users finalising purchases on mobile.The expanding number of mobile payment options reflects, in part, the growing popularity of the service.The value of goods and services purchased using a mobile phone is expected to almost triple from £4.8bn in 2013 to £14.2bn in 2018, according to a report by the Centre for Economic and Business Research. It believes that more than 20m adults will be using mobile payments by the end of the decade.It is also supported by a continually expanding network of infrastructure. London’s transport authority, for example, is negotiating a deal with telecoms groups to let users swipe on and off the Underground with phones with “near field communications” chips.Hard currency remains popular for small transactions, according to research on Monday, but there are other, heavily psychological, reasons for its resilience
See belowBut for many shoppers, using mobile payments is only marginally more convenient than traditional options. The credit card is also being transformed by new technology – contactless credit card payments topped £100m in a month in the UK for the first time in April, according to the UK Cards Association.This has led analysts and observers to say that the key to changing consumer behaviour is to expand mobile payments to include other, more valuable services.“It’s not just about being able to pay – it’s about being able to have your coupons, discounts, vouchers, rewards all in one place,” says Sandy Shen of research group Gartner. “This is the value proposition of the mobile wallet over the cash or credit card.”There is certainly no lack of enthusiastic parties trying to make that a reality. Here is a look at some of the players in mobile payments in the UK.The banksPaym is the big move by the banks into mobile payments. It allows people to transfer money to retailers or friends by typing in a phone number from within their mobile banking app. Since its launch last month, 500,000 phone numbers have been registered. More than 90 per cent of UK current account holders will be able to use to use Paym by the end of the year.However, it is not the first. Barclays’ Pingit app, which also used phone numbers for money transfer, was its precursor. Pingit is a standalone app that started out exclusively for Barclays customers but later expanded to all UK current accounts. Pingit has been downloaded by 2.8m people, who have made £475m worth of transfers on the platform since its launch in 2012.Almost all banks have their own apps, but beyond Paym most of them only allow customers to manage their accounts and make bill payments to preset recipients.The mobile operatorsEE allows contactless payments via smartphone for purchases under £20. Money needs to be “preloaded” on to a digital wallet and account details stored on a secure part of the phone’s SIM card.Vodafone is expected to launch a similar wallet service in the UK this summer, while rivals offer ticketing and online payment functions.However, the three largest mobile phone groups have also pooled resources in a venture called Weve, which began as a targeted advertising venture but has plans to expand into payments next year. Weve has access to details of about 22m customers of the three groups.Weve has already launched an app, called Pouch, which offers a sophisticated loyalty scheme for participating retailers.The payment providersPayPal is the best known provider of digital wallets, with card companies such as MasterCard and Visa instead choosing to work with other providers.The PayPal app, which needs to be preloaded with money, lets you pay from wherever you happen to be in a shop or restaurant that accepts the payment method, as well as transfer money to friends and order ahead.The technology groupsSome of the options available to shoppers overseas have not yet made it to the UK, but Google’s Wallet service – which allows people to put cash on their phone to spend online – has been rumoured to be arriving for some time. Other large US groups such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook are also said to be considering providing some form of financial services.Zapp, a smartphone app, will let UK bank customers pay for goods and services when it launches this autumn. Vocalink, owned by a group of banks that run the UK’s payments infrastructure and which has developed the app, wants it to work in-store, but initially it will only be available to make online purchases.Cash still king for small transactionsBritain might be a nation of shopkeepers, as Napoleon quipped, but how much longer will it be a country of cash handlers?The value of cash payments fell 14 per cent over the past five years as a proportion of all UK retail sales, according to research published by the British Retail Consortium.Cash accounted for less than a third of the value of retail sales in 2013, while the average size of cash transactions declined 3 per cent from the year before, to £9.78.Contactless cards and mobile payments are eating into the popularity of hard currency. But cash remains popular for small transactions and is still the cheapest way for shops to take money from customers. It accounted for just over half of all retail transactions in 2013, but made up 9 per cent of total transaction costs.“Customers are taking advantage of new ways to shop and pay,” said Helen Dickinson, the director-general of the BRC. “This is very much in line with the attention customers have paid to price and value during the recent economic uncertainty as they have sought to minimise payments from their budgets for everyday items.”The survey looked at £191bn worth of retail sales in store and online, accounting for 60 per cent of the UK total.The persistence of hard currency may have less to do with value for money than with its symbolic importance. Take how enthusiastically those pushing for greater female representation received last year’s news that the Bank of England would put novelist Jane Austen, pictured right, on its £10 note.David Graeber, the radical economic anthropologist, has argued that money did not emerge simply to make exchanging goods and services easier – rather, it came about as a way to facilitate certain kinds of moral and social relationships. “[T]he real origins of money,” he writes, “are to be found in crime and recompense, war and slavery, honour, debt and redemption.”"

(Quite possibly, no) | By Andrew Collier, Orient Capital Research What happens if China goes broke? China’s Rmb4tn stimulus package in 2008 – and its ballooning lending – has raised fears of a financial collapse. Certainly, debt has exploded. The China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) estimates that total government debt is now Rmb 27tn, or 53%, of GDP. Throw in corporate and household debt, and CASS estimates the total at Rmb 111.6tn ($18.3tn) at the end of 2012, or 215 per cent GDP. Chinese economists are quick to point out that the country has plenty of money to pay off its debts and could easily avert a financial collapse. The government, they say, could function as lender of last resort.- By some measures, China is far from a behemoth | This news that China is poised to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy in purchasing power parity terms has prompted plenty of discussion. But, as Jamil Anderlini, the FT’s Beijing bureau chief, points out, size isn’t everything. So here is yet another way of looking at China’s place in the global economy and another excuse to mull how we measure these things. In a new report, the big brains at the McKinsey Global Institute, the consulting house’s own think-tank, try to capture the ways in which globalisation and particularly “flows” of capital, goods, services, people, and data are exploding and finding new forms. They argue that the world today is as much about the flow of data and services as the traditional trade in goods. And they point out that, increasingly, trade is really about “knowledge-intensive” goods and service. In 2012 the trade in knowledge-intensive goods and services – think computer chips, smart phones etc – accounted for $12.6tn of the total $26tn in global “flows”.- India elections: would Pakistan vote for Modi? | It is a national holiday in India on Thursday, meaning there is less news than usual. The country’s more jingoistic television stations therefore seemed delighted to hear of remarks by Pakistan’s army chief General Raheel Sharif, who in a speech on Wednesday dubbed Kashmir the “jugular vein” of his nation.

119;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-05-01T19:31:58Z;Visa and MasterCard fear sanctions fallout;;"Visa and MasterCard, the two big US credit card companies, have found themselves in the line of fire between the US and Russia over Ukraine.Both companies warned on their earnings calls in the past week about the impact of proposed legislation in Russia – a response to US sanctions – that will increase the control of the Russian authorities over its payment systems.“I can see it will make it a more complicated situation for anybody that has a payment network in Russia,” MasterCard chief financial officer Martina Hund-Majean told the Financial Times on Thursday, as the company reported better than expected earnings.The Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, is working on draft legislation which is expected to require any payments services provider working in Russia to put its processing centre in the country, and people involved in the discussions said this would offer Moscow the chance to expropriate foreign service providers in the case of a risk such as sanctions.In addition, the Central Bank plans to set up a company to operate a national payments system resembling Germany’s Geldkarte or France’s Carte Bleue.The planned national payments system is not expected to be able to handle global payments but people involved in the discussions said working with China Union Pay, Beijing’s rapidly-expanding payments platform, might be an option for Russian banks to reduce their dependency on Visa and MasterCard.After the US Treasury put businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg on its sanctions list on 21 March, Visa and MasterCard temporarily suspended services for customers of SMP Bank, which the tycoon brothers jointly control.Following that, Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the government to start working on a national payments system.With Washington’s addition of SMP Bank and two other oligarch-controlled institutions to the sanctions list this week, those lenders announced that they were also cutting ties with Visa and MasterCard.The government has said that Moscow does not intend to “punish” the two American payments services providers or lock them out of the market, but Mr Putin said that by keeping their processing centres outside Russia and suspending services following the sanctions, they had “undermined their credibility”, and they would lose market share as a result.“It’s very complex but we’re a global company,” said Ms Hund-Majean. “Every time at this time of the year we work on a number of projects with companies around the world, those projects that we have going on in Russia have not stopped.”Russia represents around $167m in revenue for MasterCard, around 2 per cent of the company’s global annual revenues of $8.3bn.But the concerns are not unique to MasterCard. Visa chief executive Charles Scharf told an analyst call on April 24: “Keep in mind this is all still fluid. And while none of this is certainly helpful for Visa if passed, parts might even cause us to rethink our domestic processing opportunity in Russia. But we’re hopeful that there are still opportunities for Visa to participate in the growing electronic payments business in Russia.”Mr Scharf also provided some detail on the new proposals. While it’s not yet finalised, he said the law may demand all domestic data processing to move onshore and for most domestic transaction data to be domiciled in Russia.He said it would also require a payment network that demands continuity of service in compliance with Russian law and the creation of a settlement centre 100 per cent owned by the central bank of Russia. In addition, he said the proposed new law would demand a collateral requirement for foreign payment systems; and lastly, give Russia the ability to impose fines on foreign payment system providers.Byron Pollitt, Visa’s chief financial officer, said issues with Russia and Ukraine were already affecting cross-border volume and sanctions would impact on payment volumes. He said the company expects several pennies of earnings per share impact for the fiscal year.“We are fully engaged with all parties involved and will continue to adjust our outlook as the situation clarifies over time,” he said."
120;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-03-24T20:50:55Z;Monitise to raise £100m as part of overhaul;;Monitise, one of UK’s highest profile tech groups, is to raise about £100m as part of an overhaul of its business model aimed at increasing its revenues in the evolving mobile payments industry.MasterCard has pledged to take part in a fully underwritten placing of about 160m Monitise shares – joining rival Visa among the investors in the secure mobile payments provider.The company will shift from a licence business model, which required its customers to pay a large upfront fee, to a subscription-based model that will reduce costs, as it seeks to expand its customer base.Monitise said that its target was to increase its registered users from 28m to 200m by June 2018, by making it easier to connect to the network.However, the group also warned that revenue growth would be reduced to 40 per cent in 2014 – from previous guidance of 50 per cent – which, combined with a rise in operating expenses, would mean a higher loss of earnings in the second half of the year. The company has recorded pre-tax losses of more than £100m since listing in 2007.Revenue growth next year would also be at a lower rate than 2014, Monitise added, with a move to profitability in terms of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, achieved by 2016. Analysts had expected this to be achieved a year earlier. Revenue growth would also then “accelerate strongly”, the company said.MasterCard will also become a partner in Monitise’s global payments business, joining more than 350 banks and mobile operators. Barclays and Canaccord Genuity are acting as joint bookrunners to the placing.
121;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-03-23T19:26:42Z;Visa and MasterCard restart payments for Russian banks;;Visa and MasterCard have restarted processing payment transactions for customers of a Russian bank linked to oligarchs blacklisted by the US government on Thursday, in an indication that Washington’s latest sanctions could hit the corporate sector less than initially feared.SMP Bank said on Sunday that the two credit card companies had resumed payments services after cutting them on Friday.Visa said in a statement: “Based on clarifications provided to Visa by the US government, Visa has determined that we are not required to block SMP Bank’s access to our network. As a result, Visa has reestablished network connectivity with SMP.”SMP is jointly owned by Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, billionaire brothers with close links to Vladimir Putin, Russian president. Washington banned them alongside 18 other officials and tycoons from entry to the US and financial transactions with US persons in retaliation for Mr Putin’s annexation of Crimea, which Western leaders have criticised as the biggest threat to peace in Europe since the Cold War.Some of the men on the sanctions list own a web of businesses including large companies that play an important role in the global economy.Gennady Timchenko, another oligarch on the list, said after Thursday’s sanctions announcement that he had sold his entire stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, to shield the company from sanctions against himself. The share price of Novatek, Mr Timchenko’s listed oil and gas firm, fell 12 per cent on Friday.Western financial institutions were scrambling on Thursday and Friday to scan their loan and investment portfolios for exposure to businesses linked to sanctions targets. US lawyers said they had been inundated with calls from US companies trying to confirm whether they would have to cut links with Russian suppliers, especially companies owned by Mr Timchenko and the Rotenberg brothers.In a fact sheet published with the first US sanctions list against Russian officials on March 17, the White House said: “Our current focus is to identify these individuals and target their personal assets, but not companies that they may manage on behalf of the Russian state.”Therefore legal experts have so far expected state companies to be protected from the sanctions. This would apply to the state-owned Russian Railways, whose chief executive, Vladimir Yakunin, is also on the sanctions list.But for privately-owned companies, the situation is less clear. Washington-based sanctions lawyers said that such bans of individuals would normally also reach businesses they own or control.The reversal of Visa’s and MasterCard’s moves against the three banks could mean that Washington’s sanctions move will ripple much less far through corporate Russia than initially feared.“We are glad that the two biggest international payment systems have heard our arguments and reversed their decision,” said Dmitry Kalantyrsky, chief executive of SMP Bank.Reuters reported that Visa said it had also resumed services for clients of Investitsionny Soyuz and InvestKapitalBank after having been assured by the US government that the sanctions targeted individuals, not the companies they owned.Investitsionny Soyuz and InvestKapitalBank declined to comment.Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues in New York
122;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-03-19T15:50:38Z;MasterCard and Visa’s priceless business model;Valuations are frothy, but it is a well-protected oligopoly, writes John Authers;"Some things in life are priceless. It would appear that they include MasterCard as well as Visa, and several other companies involved in processing transactions.Both MasterCard and Visa started out as collaborations by bank consortiums. Since floating in 2006, MasterCard has gained more than 440 per cent. The larger Visa, which floated in 2008, has gained 180 per cent. Both flatten the broader market.Valuations are now in nosebleed territory. Using price-to-book multiples, the most popular measure for financials, Visa trades at more than six times book, while MasterCard is at some 12.5 times. Both have doubled their book multiples in the past three years. Large banks are typically selling at or near their book value.It is possible to put this down to the one-off gains when a well-protected business becomes a for-profit quoted company. Initially, there are huge gains as profits are squeezed out. This is what happened when stock and derivatives exchanges went public in a wave of flotations about a decade ago. But those gains were not sustained – the Dow Jones Global Exchange index has gained some 9 per cent since the end of 2009, while Visa and MasterCard have doubled.And it is not just MasterCard and Visa. Discover Financial Services, which offers the Discover card – a far smaller competitor – has vastly outperformed the big two, with its stock expanding eightfold over the past five years. PayPal remains one of the great Silicon Valley venture capital success stories of recent years. Estimates of the valuation that mobile payment company Square could receive whenever it floats continue to multiply. And of course Bitcoin, under several layers of hype and hysteria, is another very interesting transactions processing play.This looks dangerously frothy. Nevertheless, most bubbles start with at least some plausible case. Can the current share prices of Visa and MasterCard really be justified, or is the online payments industry moving into a bubble?One argument comes from growth. Projections for expansion border on the stratospheric. This growth should come from two sources: first, from growth in consumption expenditure, primarily from the developing world; and second, from encroachment on the territory of cash and cheques, neither of which can be used to complete an online transaction.Globally, according to figures tracked by Bloomberg Industries, payment volume rose 9 per cent last year, with PayPal gaining 24 per cent and MasterCard 13 per cent. For the future, Visa points out that cash and cheques made up 41 per cent of 2012 expenditure in developed markets and 62 per cent in emerging markets. This creates what it calls an $11tn opportunity.Meanwhile, it forecasts 4 per cent annual expenditure growth from now to 2016 in developed markets – 10 per cent in the emerging world.The problem with such projections is a familiar one. Growth could indeed be very impressive, but that makes it harder to calculate a present value for future earnings. History tells us that markets tend to overestimate and overextrapolate future earnings in an environment such as this. This happened most spectacularly during the dotcom bubble. Yes, there are good reasons to project growth, but that does not necessarily justify paying 12 times book for MasterCard.A second reason hinges on Warren Buffett’s principle of the “wide economic moat”. If a franchise is well protected, value investors can pay more than they would normally like. In the case of Visa and MasterCard, it would be prohibitively expensive to set up a rival with the same business model. This is as well-protected an oligopoly as it is possible to imagine. Various aspects of this model have been examined, and even punished, by antitrust authorities over the years: they still make lots of money.The case goes further. Hutch Vernon, who runs a “flexible equity” mutual fund for Brown Advisory in Baltimore, suggests that Visa and MasterCard can maintain their status as tollbooths for online commerce (even PayPal, arguably a rival, channels money through their systems) without needing to make reinvestments.Their networks are already built. The exchanges needed to invest in technology to fend off new competitors who still managed to chip away at their trading volume. For Visa and MasterCard, capital can safely go towards reducing shares outstanding, while growth continues.Does this make the case to buy at these valuations? Perhaps not. The low dividend yields the companies pay (neither pays as much as 1 per cent) leave little income to help out if investors do become risk-averse again. And investors have to pay up for the undoubted quality of their earnings.Those hoping to profit if the online payments area turns into a bubble, which it may have done already, might want to look hard for anyone with a business model that could encroach on the card networks’ revenues."
123;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-02-28T04:22:32Z;China falls out of love with cash;;China is rapidly ditching the centuries-old habit of paying its bills with trunkloads of cash, and making the shift to virtual forms of payment faster than any other country on earth.Figures released by the People’s Bank of China show a sharp rise in the popularity of anything other than cash – from debit cards to credit cards to electronic wallet mobile apps. China has a staggering 4.2bn bank cards in circulation, enough for every mainlander to have at least three.Ten times more of them are debit cards than credit cards (3.8bn compared with 391m), but credit card issuance also rose by 19 per cent in 2013, and Euromonitor predicts credit card usage will grow faster than that of other cards over the next five years. Overdue credit card debt – unpaid after six months – also leapt 72 per cent, but this is hardly US-style household debt: China’s overdue credit card debt is a mere 1.37 per cent of total credit outstanding.The shift away from cash is remarkable for a country which was the first to print paper money a millennium ago: until recently, cash was so popular in China that even large purchases like cars or houses were paid for with bundles of banknotes bearing the portrait of Mao Zedong.Very low rates of street crime make China, paradoxically, one of the safest countries for carrying around large wads of cash. And decades of deprivation coupled with an only rudimentary social safety net have left older Chinese with an almost pathological fear of debt – and a fondness for holding their wealth in their hands.But despite all that, MasterCard found in a recent global study that China is making the shift “from cash to cashless” far more rapidly than any other country surveyed, largely as a result of rapid urbanisation and government policies designed to encourage non-cash payments.Customers in China buy almost anything online – including fresh vegetablesAnd urban, affluent, internet-savvy Chinese consumers are even more wild about plastic. A recent Nielsen survey found that 71 per cent of shoppers in China’s top tier cities said they preferred bank cards over cash, compared with an average of half for other countries surveyed.Zhang Yujia is at the forefront of the shift from paper to plastic. In fact, she is something of a credit card evangelist, having converted her reluctant parents to the use of a low-limit card that they initially did not want.When it comes to the ways in which people pay for stuff, perhaps no country is as simultaneously futuristic and traditional as China’s neighbour, Japan. The country that first popularised mobile “e-wallets” is far from cashless: many restaurants won’t let you settle your bill with a credit card, let alone by swiping your phone across a screen . . .And she doesn’t stop at cards: over the recent lunar new year, she used Tencent’s social messaging platform WeChat to send traditional red envelopes full of virtual cash to her friends. Tencent says some 8m people sent Rmb400m ($65m) in electronic “hongbao” over the week-long holiday which ended in mid-February.Mobile payment apps are surging in popularity as an easy way to pay for smaller items such as taxi rides and movie tickets. When dining with friends who want to “go Dutch”, Ms Zhang pulls out her electronic wallet app from Alibaba’s Alipay to transfer her share of the bill to the friend sitting next to her.“Paper money stinks”, she says. Jason Chu, a Shanghai academic whose online alias is Big Bachelor, says he only carries Rmb100 with him at any one time: cash can be counterfeit and “carries bacteria and viruses”.Wu Weiyi of AlixPartners in Shanghai, an advisory firm, says it’s not just about convenience or even the extra cash flow that comes with buying goods now that are only paid for later: companies issue cards to staff to control and monitor their cash flow.But with many people signing up for cards to get the promotional gifts offered by banks, the number of active cards is much smaller than the total outstanding, he says. And in lower tier cities or among the less affluent, cash is still very popular: “Cash is more cost effective, vendors don’t have to pay fees for it, it can’t be so easily tracked and people use cash to avoid paying taxes.”The meteoric rise of online retail in China is also a big factor, says Saurabh Sharma of Ogilvy & Mather in Beijing. “Credit card adoption has taken off in the past two to three years primarily due to the explosive growth in online retail,” he says, noting “customers in China buy almost anything online – including fresh vegetables”.Zhang Yujia’s parents were tough converts to the credo of the credit card: “They weren’t accustomed to the concept of spending your money in the future,” she says.But now she’s got them buying everything from milk to soy sauce and newspapers with plastic. “They use their credit card as much as I do,” she says. These days, it seems, everyone in China is rapidly being weaned off their wallets.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan
124;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Brussels agrees Visa Europe antitrust deal;;Brussels has accepted Visa Europe’s antitrust settlement offer to cap interbank fees for handling transactions, which reduces its cross-border and credit card charges by up to 60 per cent.The approval is the latest leg of a two-decade battle between the European Commission and the region’s two main payments groups, Visa Europe and MasterCard.The deal sets the stage for formal charges to be potentially served against MasterCard this year for overcharging retailers seeking to reduce cross border fees – an alleged antitrust infringement also covered in the Visa settlement.Visa pledged to cap its interbank fees at 0.3 per cent for credit card transactions – a limit in line with undertakings given by MasterCard in 2009, which it provisionally offered while it pursued an appeal against the commission’s antitrust decision through the courts.This fits with legislative reforms proposed by the commission that set a ceiling on all interbank fees for consumer card transactions. While the cap has been endorsed by the European parliament, the law will not be agreed with member states until 2015 at the earliest.Under the deal, Visa will also remove conditions that stopped retailers from taking advantage of lower rates offered by banks outside the retailers’ home market. The company’s rules forced banks to apply the rate of the merchant’s country as a minimum, which the commission saw as choking-off competition.Joaquín Almunia, EU competition chief, said the commitment was “excellent news for European consumers since the fees paid by retailers end up on their bills”.Nicolas Huss, Visa Europe CEO, said: “This agreement provides legal certainty which will support our continued investment.”
125;MA;Mastercard Inc;2014-02-23T23:02:11Z;Rise of mobile commerce fuels rash of rival payment solutions;No winner has yet emerged in a highly fragmented market;With mobile commerce growing so quickly, banks know it is vital to enable customers to pay for goods with their smartphones.Many technology and tele­coms groups are hoping to help banks with their digital strategy.Meanwhile retailers, too, are having to adapt to the blurring of online and high street as shoppers use their phones to find and purchase goods.“This is a shift to a world beyond plastic where the smartphone becomes the platform,” says Marion King, president for UK and Ireland at MasterCard. “The infrastructure is different around the world, [but] people just want convenience.”However, the rapidity of growth of mobile payments has also caused the market to fragment, as the various groups that own different parts of the technology, banking or retail elements have looked to grab a share of the market.“It's a mess, isn’t it,” says David Sear, managing director of Weve, a company set up to develop mobile commerce and advertising initiatives on behalf of Vodafone, O2 and EE in the UK.“It is confusing for people and for banks, as well as being costly all round,” he observes. “Payment is the utility bit – you need scale to make it work. It’s questionable right now if it adds revenues for banks, but they will need to make it work in the future.”For many mature markets, cards and cash are so well embedded with consumers that digital wallets are seeing only gradual acceptance.However, the rollout of contactless payment pads in shops shows that the infrastructure is becoming established.Emerging markets are sometimes more open to mobile payments, in part because there are places where banking is at a basic level and where mobile payments can be used as a secure way to trade. Vodafone’s M-Pesa payment scheme in Africa is a notable success.Jean Lassignardie, at Capgemini Global Financial Services, has identified 12 success factors, all of which are needed for a successful mobile payments platform.“And, to date, no leading successful solution has come to the forefront except in the emerging countries in Africa with M-Pesa, where no alternatives besides cash are available,” he says.The options for mobile payments are “many and fragmented”, according to Alistair Newton, research vice-president for banking and investment services at Gartner.He blames differences in approach based on technology, local supplier and operator structures and the regulatory environment.A number of services allow the phone to act as a means of payment using contactless NFC (near field communication) technology, although again the market is fragmented.Most require separate digital wallets, and not necessarily linked to a bank account. In the UK, EE and MasterCard, for example, offer a service where customers can load up cash on to their phones.But MasterCard has also struck a deal with Weve in the UK that offers banks the means to launch mobile contactless payment services in an effort to build a more unified platform.Groups such as Google, Amazon and PayPal already offer payment schemes online, and are now making a push into the real world with services such as Google’s Wallet that puts cash on a phone.Technology experts predict that Apple could also become active in this market given the popularity of its iPhones, extensive data, fingerprint scanners and other technology that could support a payments system.Eden Zoller, analyst at Ovum, expects further mobile payments developments from Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple.“Facebook in particular needs to revise its lacklustre mobile payments strategy, which stands in stark contrast with its successful mobile advertising play.”In the US, Square, the company set up by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, provides technology at the other end, with a device that allows a mobile phone to take payments.However, shops using Square can also take payments directly from the app on a phone. PayPal and iZettle also allow shops to use a phone to take credit card payments through a chip and pin reader.Pierre Combelles, mobile commerce business lead for the GSMA, which represents the mobile industry, says the priority is greater integration.Mobile operators, retailers, banks, commercial organisations and industry associations need to work together to define a “consistent transactional journey”, he says, where customers do not have to adapt to multiple processes.Gartner’s Mr Newton says that the power lies with the user, “not the operator, banks or brands”.Ultimately, he says, the latter need to make mobile payments easier or safer, or offer incentives such as loyalty rewards, to persuade consumers to change their habits.“Way too many payment ‘innovations’ ignore these very basic principles, and as a result are doomed to failure.”
126;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;MasterCard, Visa back smartphone payment;;MasterCard and Visa are about to make it easier for consumers to pay for goods with a tap of a smartphone, a payment method frequently promised but rarely delivered.The US credit card groups on Wednesday announced separately their support for a type of technology that could resolve longstanding industry disagreements over how to develop mobile wallets that allow users to store their card data on their phones and then pay with near field communications, or NFC, technology.Interest in mobile payments has surged recently, as companies from PayPal to Visa and start-ups like Square try to find ways to get customers using their phones when buying on and offline. Encouraging mobile payments could let retailers collect better data on their customers, or give them new ways to push location-based offers to potential consumers near their stores.Yet mobile wallets have taken off slowly, in part because paying with cash or credit cards is fine for most consumers, and because existing mobile wallet apps are neither widely accepted by retailers nor easy to use.MasterCard and Visa are hoping to spur the industry by using technology known as “host card emulation”, which allows card data to be stored in the cloud rather than on a chip in the phone, says James Anderson, head of emerging payments at MasterCard.Crucially, the new host card technology means an app, such as a mobile banking app, can serve as a NFC-enabled mobile wallet regardless of which telecom provider the phone is used on.Previous attempts at launching mobile wallets required the co-operation of specific telecom companies.That situation led to the stalemate in the market as T-Mobile, AT&T and others invested in one type of wallet that has struggled to grow, while also blocking wallets developed by others, notably one from Google, from phones on their networks.The new approach around host card emulation will “drive the market quicker, larger, faster – all the good things we want in life,” said Mr Anderson. “We want to have as many options as possible to get people being able to pay with their mobile phones.”Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner, said that host card emulation technology, by freeing consumers from using only a mobile wallet app approved by their carrier, could speed up adoption by giving banks and retailers more freedom to build them in response to consumer demand.“Assuming everything goes well with this implementation, this does provide a valuable avenue for mobile payments,” he said.The first apps using the technology are expected on the market by the end of the year, he said, and for now are available only on Android phones.
127;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard creates contactless pay system;;MasterCard will create the UK’s most comprehensive contactless payments platform backed by the major mobile telecoms groups in the latest attempt to simplify the fragmented “m-commerce” market.Vodafone, EE and O2 will help establish a payments platform for use by retail banks and other financial groups, as part of a wider move by traditional telecoms groups to generate additional revenues using their mobile technology.MasterCard said that its involvement would “accelerate the development of the UK’s most comprehensive contactless mobile payments system”.The three telecom operators jointly own Weve, the company behind the plans, which was set up to develop mobile commerce and advertising initiatives that has access to 22m customers of the groups.The US credit card group said that the partnership between itself and Weve would create the “most ubiquitous platform” for contactless mobile payments in the UK, which will enable greater innovation in future in a growing payments market.The joint venture aims to bring greater simplicity and reduced costs to a fragmented mobile-payments market where almost every bank has its own service with technology that allows customers’ details to be stored securely on the SIM card.With the new system, smartphones can be used as a payment system by swiping across one of the many contactless systems already in operation in the UK. MasterCard will provide the mass-market contactless point-of-sale access in retailers across Britain, as well as protection from fraud.David Sear, Weve chief executive, said. “[Mobile payments] is a mess. It is very confusing for customers and costly for the banks to set up. But people are already using contactless and going cash free, and this gives banks a very strong position with a platform already with great scale.”Weve said that banks could reduce costs of development of their mobile contactless services by at least 10 per cent.Bank customers would need to swap traditional SIM cards with one equipped with technology able to detect the contactless payments. This will work even without internet connection or battery life in the phone.The interactivity of the phones will also allow banks and retailers to offer loyalty offers and customer incentives through Weve.Marion King, president for UK and Ireland at MasterCard, said that this was part of a wider “shift to a world beyond plastic”. She said that the UK had reached a “tipping point” where people were now comfortable with the “tap and go” contactless payment. “People just want convenience,” she added.Under the terms of their agreement, MasterCard will provide technology and integration services to banks and financial institutions that use Weve’s payments platform.MasterCard said that there had been a 220 per cent growth in the number of contactless transactions in Europe in the year to the third quarter of 2013.Groups such as EE already provide a form of mobile payment in the UK using stored value, where customers need to preload the phone with money, rather than with direct access to the debt account. Contactless transactions are capped at £20 although MasterCard is now working on allowing higher payments.
128;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard: sell now, pay later;Real risks to credit cards are long-term;"A credit card is the means and the symbol of short-sightedness: buy now, pay later. Yet MasterCard’s shareholders have managed to be imprudent in the opposite direction, by rushing to sell.The payments processor missed expectations in the fourth quarter. Analysts were hoping for 60 cents a share of earnings; the company delivered 57 cents, excluding a special item. Higher rebates for card-issuing banks for renewals and new deals were to blame. New deals bode well for growth, but incentives mean banks have extracted good pricing. Shares fell 10 per cent on Friday, before recovering some losses.There was another disappointment. The company reaffirmed its three-year targets for compound annual growth rate of 11 to 14 per cent in net revenue and at least 20 per cent in earnings per share, but warned that net revenue growth in 2014 will probably be at the low end of the range. The new deals will help, but MasterCard will be hurt this year by the loss of a credit card portfolio at JPMorgan Chase to rival Visa.Both MasterCard and Visa are closely tied to consumer spending. MasterCard’s management was upbeat about the economy in the US and Western Europe, where the company generates more than half of its revenue. The latest rumbling in emerging markets – a big area of secular growth as consumers convert from cash to electronic payments – cannot be ignored, but should not interrupt the long-term shift.Given the long-term trend toward electronic payments, investors should buy MasterCard and Visa on dips, as a rule of thumb. The risks are heightened regulation and disruptive technology, not a quarterly miss or the loss of one portfolio, even a large one. MasterCard trades at 25 times forward earnings. The size of the share pullback indicates how much optimism that valuation builds in. But prudent optomism remains the right view."
129;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Chipotle shares surge to record high;Analysts increase price targets on restaurant chain;Chipotle Mexican Grill shares surged to a record high on Friday as the company shrugged off broader weakness in the dining sector and reported the fastest pace of sales growth in more than a year.The restaurant chain rose 11.74 per cent to $551.96 by the close of trading in New York, off highs set earlier in the day.The gains follow Chipotle’s fourth-quarter results, which showed revenues rose 21 per cent from a year earlier to $844m, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Profits jumped 30 per cent to $79.6m, or $2.53 a share, a penny ahead of expectations.Analysts at a dozen investment banks increased their price targets on the restaurant chain following its results. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Kelter said improving traffic trends and the likelihood of price increases could boost the company’s profitability by the year’s end and into 2015.“Same-store sales are again bordering on double digits driven entirely by traffic growth,” Mr Kelter said. “While [Chipotle] does have a few drivers in place (marketing, catering, Sofritas), the reacceleration appears to be driven by a true underlying improvement in brand momentum and thus appears to be sustainable.”Toymaker Mattel shares fell 12 per cent to $37.84, leading the declines on the benchmark S&P 500, after the company said sales of its dolls came up short.Barbie sales were down a sharp 13 per cent in the final three months of the year and off by 6 per cent for the year.Total Mattel revenues declined 6 per cent from a year earlier to $2.1bn for the three months to December. Net income rose 20 per cent in the period to $369m, or $1.08 per share, although comparisons to a year ago were helped by past litigation expenses.Chief executive Bryan Stockton expressed his dismay on a call with analysts, noting that marketing and videos focused on Barbie’s “lifestyle and play patterns” had not been as successful as hoped.MasterCard shares were under pressure after the company missed fourth-quarter profit and sales expectations on Friday, which it blamed on rising operating and marketing costs as well as litigation expenses.The card processor said sales advanced 12 per cent from a year earlier to $2.1bn. Profits increased 3 per cent to $623m, or 52 cents per share. Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of 60 cents a share. Shares fell 5 per cent to $75.68.Ajay Banga, chief executive of MasterCard, told analysts that the company continued to see subdued economic activity in Europe, as well as declining consumer and business sentiment in Asia. Mr Banga said the company saw conditions in the US improving.“Overall, it feels like the US and western Europe markets that generate well over half of our revenue are slowly starting to regain their economic footing,” he said.Amazon shares tumbled 11 per cent on Friday to $358.69, their steepest decline in more than two years, after sales growth decelerated in the final months of last year.The world’s largest online retailer reported net income of $239m, or 51 cents a share, compared to $97m a year ago. Revenues climbed 20 per cent to $25.6bn, shy of analysts’ forecasts of $26.1bn.Equity markets continued their slide as the week drew to a close, with the S&P 500 bringing its losses for the month to 3.5 per cent, even as a report from the US Department of Commerce showed a rise in consumer spending.Separate figures from the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters confirmed a dip in consumer confidence in January, although it was not as sharp as first thought.The S&P 500 declined 0.6 per cent to 1,782.59 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 15,698.85. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent lower to 4,103.88.
130;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
131;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Ebay / PayPal: payment denied;Icahn’s proposal to split smacks of opportunism;Ebay management turned the $1.5bn acquisition of PayPal into a business worth $30bn-plus – a rare instance of success in technology dealmaking. Carl Icahn thinks he is wiser than them anyway. His proposal on Wednesday to separate the payment processor from the online retailer (called Marketplaces) reeks of opportunism. Ebay shares had a rare off year in 2013, underperforming the S&P 500 by 20 per cent. Its 2014 profit outlook has also disappointed. But shareholders should give eBay’s bosses the benefit of the doubt for now. If rival Amazon continues to best eBay and payments groups remain the darlings of Wall Street, the PayPal spin-off is a trump card that can be played.The PayPal/Marketplaces conflict reflects the common low growth/high profit schism. Marketplaces’ revenue growth is in the low double digits, while PayPal has been growing at about 20 per cent. While PayPal accounts for 40 per cent of group revenue, Marketplaces represents 40 per cent of operating margin, and that means it still contributes about two-thirds of total profits. And those profits come in handy given that PayPal has spent $1bn on recent acquisitions.What is clear is the hype around payments businesses. Shares in Visa and MasterCard jumped at least 45 per cent in 2013. Alternative payment start-ups Square and Stripe have received multibillion-dollar valuations. A JPMorgan analysis places a 15 times cash flow multiple on PayPal, nearly twice the valuation of Marketplaces. It figures the stock is a fifth undervalued.Profit differential aside, eBay firmly believes that PayPal’s exceptional growth comes from its tight integration with Marketplaces. New shoppers on eBay sign up for PayPal accounts to buy things. And shopper data help PayPal’s risk management. How those benefits break down if the two are separated is murky. But between 2009 and 2012 eBay shares nearly tripled, so management has earned the rope to execute its plan. PayPal is not going anywhere and, as a (passive) investor, neither should Mr Icahn.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
132;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-12-23T20:20:35Z;A year in a word: Bitcoin;It appeals to speculators for its frothy price and to libertarians for what it seems to stand against;"(noun) A unit of the first and most famous cryptocurrency. After “bit”, a contraction of “binary digit”, the basic unit of digital information.It all sounds very mysterious. The Bitcoin is a currency based on cryptographic principles; it was created by a pseudonymous programmer, or programmers, called Satoshi Nakamoto. New Bitcoins are “mined” and the entire system is maintained by a decentralised peer-to-peer database recording every transaction in the history of the currency.Bitcoin promises to be a new type of money. Economists like to say money has three properties: it is a medium of exchange, obviating the need for barter; a store of purchasing power; and a stable unit of account that serves as a standard of what is expensive.As a peer-to-peer processing network, Bitcoin has the potential to become a superb medium of exchange. Our current systems for digital payment require intermediaries such as MasterCard or PayPal, and fees can be higher than consumers realise. The Bitcoin network allows Andy to send money to Belinda and have the transaction verified “in the cloud”, so to speak, at no cost.As a stable unit of account, however, Bitcoin is a failure. The currency’s volatility would make a dotcom director blush. That need not matter: a price can be listed in dollars, then transacted using the Bitcoin system. The dollar’s superb record as a standard of value can be married with the Bitcoin network’s ability to process payments cheaply. Alas, Bitcoin is currently used for speculation not transactions. Everyone wants to own Bitcoins but few spend them.Bitcoin appeals to speculators for its frothy price and to libertarians for what it seems to stand against: it is not controlled by large corporations; it is not issued by a central bank; it is not really fiat money at all, even though the commodity that backs Bitcoin is a mathematical abstraction. Perhaps one day Bitcoin will gain momentum not because of the ideals it embodies, but because it turns out to be useful.

133;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-12-17T03:37:22Z;Big retailers back Brussels cap on card payment fees;;The chief executives of some of Britain’s largest retailers – including J Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer – have swung behind European Commission proposals to cap “excessive fees” charged by banks for processing card payments.Fees on payments via credit or debit cards cost British retailers £850m per year, according to the British Retail Consortium. Almost 70 per cent of retail sales are now put on plastic.The European Commission this summer proposed limiting charges at 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent for debit and credit cards, respectively. Fees in the UK range from 0.1 per cent up to 2.5 per cent.The Commission also wanted to scrap the “honour all cards rule”, which forces large retailers to accept all major cards. These proposals would save retailers in the UK about £350m per year.If the plans were introduced across the Europe Union, it could save retailers about €4.5bn in annual charges.Card payment providers, such as Visa and MasterCard – which together control about 90 per cent of the market – have criticised the proposals, arguing that retailers will not pass savings on to customers.In a letter sent to MEPs, the chief executives of Kingfisher, Asda, Morrisons, Home Retail Group and Boots – among others – denied that a cap on fees would simply boost their profits.They wrote: “The market in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete on price and value every day and put our customers at the heart of everything we do. Any savings in a reduction in card interchange fees will create capital to enable a range of investments.”The chief executives warned that “any dilution of [the proposals] will simply allow these excessive costs to continue, remove transparency and result in a lack of proper competition within the banking sector”.MEPs will debate the issue in Brussels on Tuesday.
134;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-12-12T17:14:06Z;Mastercard stock split evokes 1990s spirit;But analysts believe stock splits will remain few and far between;A large and unexpected stock split this week by Mastercard has revived memories of the roaring stock markets of the late 1990s.The move, designed to bring share prices down to more accessible levels for smaller investors, has tended to be a signal of confidence in a company’s growth prospects. But, until now, it had been missing from the powerful rally in share prices that has sent Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index to record highs.This time round, analysts believe stock splits are likely to remain few and far between, however, even as the share prices of many companies reach elevated levels.The reluctance to split shares speaks to a growing preference among financial officers to keep share prices higher, as well as a better understanding among investors that stock splits do not increase the equity value of publicly traded companies.Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services, says: “There’s been a shift in acceptance of higher priced stocks and a willingness for investors to still buy them. It may also have to do with more investor recognition that the lower price for a stock has nothing to do with how you would value it.”Companies have historically split stock to bring their share prices down to more accessible levels for individual investors while maintaining their overall market capitalisation. Mastercard shares hit a record high on Wednesday after the global payments company said it would go through with a 10-for-1 split next month.This year 12 companies have issued share splits, including Whole Foods Market, Gilead Sciences and Salesforce.com. That amount is in line with recent years and up from a low of just 1 share split in 2009 as the stock market bottomed, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Still, the level of activity has lagged behind both the period that preceded the financial crisis, when on average 36 share splits took place annually, and the dotcom boom when about 100 S&P 500 companies would split their shares each year.Instead, more and more companies including Apple, Google, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Priceline.com have favoured a strategy that keeps their share prices elevated even as they trade above $400 a piece each.Analysts say the rise of passive investing in index funds and exchange-trade funds in recent years has made investors less sensitive to the level at which a company’s shares trade.Companies may also prefer to keep their stock prices higher to deter volatility in its shareholder base, a response to the growth of high-frequency traders who try to capture rebates from trading large amounts of shares.Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx, says: “A high-priced stock will have less high-frequency trading in it than low priced stocks.” That is because trading firms have to commit more capital to trade in higher priced stocks even though the rebates they collect are the same as those in lower priced shares.Analysts at Credit Suisse say that Citigroup’s 2011 reverse 1-10 stock split that lowered the amount of shares it had on the market and increased its stock price tenfold reduced trading levels in its shares by 5 per cent.“Citi actually did a reverse split and went from being the darling of high-frequency traders to a normal stock,” says Mr Colas.
135;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard: hat trick?;Shares are pricey but the group is in a long-term growth market;"MasterCard has unveiled not one, not two, but three ways to fiddle with its capital structure: a stock split; a dividend increase; and a share buyback. With a share price approaching $800 and $3.4bn in cash at the end of the last quarter, each of these manoeuvres is understandable.But none should move the share price. A 10-for-1 stock split may make the shares more accessible for retail investors and boost trading. In terms of value, though, it is irrelevant. MasterCard is only cutting its pie into more pieces. Dividends and buybacks simply return to shareholders what they own anyway. There is, however, some value in the message. While the dividend yield will be just 0.6 per cent after the increase – not a level to inspire diehard investors in dividend stocks – an 83 per cent rise plus buyback for up to $3.5bn signals how cash management will work.The shares, up 60 per cent this year, are trading at a pricey 27 times forecast earnings. There is one reason to hold them: the company operates in a long-term growth market. MasterCard and rival Visa run the world’s largest payment networks. The more people buy with debit and credit cards and other forms of electronic payment, the more the groups make. MasterCard is expected to raise earnings per share by about 18 per cent both next year and the year after.MasterCard says that 85 per cent of the world’s retail transactions involve cash or cheques. Believe it and there is plenty of room for the two companies to grow, especially in the developing world. And there is no alternative, with the incumbents’ level of acceptance or penetration. For now. A threat is an evolution in technology that would enable someone else to circumvent MasterCard and Visa.

136;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Centrica appoints Rick Haythornthwaite as chairman;;Centrica has appointed Rick Haythornthwaite, one of the UK’s leading business figures, as its new chairman.The former BP executive takes on the role from Sir Roger Carr, who last week became embroiled in facing down accusations of profiteering by Centrica subsidiary British Gas, Britain’s biggest energy retailer, and the threat of price-capping made by Ed Miliband, the Labour party leader.Mr Haythornthwaite, who has chaired MasterCard since 2006, stood down as chairman of Network Rail, the taxpayer-funded operator of Britain’s train infrastructure, in the summer after three years in the role.The businessman rose to prominence as chief executive of Blue Circle, the cement supplier that was sold to Lafarge for £3.1bn cash in 2001, and then as chief executive of debt-laden engineering conglomerate Invensys, which he led through five years of restructuring.Sir Roger will formally hand over the reins at Centrica at the end of the year.Though Centrica is best known as the holding company of British Gas, the biggest of the UK’s leading “big six” energy suppliers, much of its profits are generated from its growing portfolio of oil and gas production assets and businesses in the US.Sir Roger was officially confirmed as the next chairman of BAE Systems in the summer. He joined the board of the defence and aerospace group this week and is scheduled to take over from Dick Olver as chairman early next year.Sir Roger publicly clashed with the Labour party’s leader last week over the threat to cap prices on energy suppliers should Labour win power at the next general election. He described Mr Miliband’s proposed price controls as “potentially a recipe for economic ruin”.On Friday, he welcomed Mr Haythornthwaite’s appointment as his successor at Centrica, stating: “He brings invaluable industry experience from his time at BP, a deep knowledge of consumer relations from MasterCard and a proven record of government and regulatory body engagement from Network Rail.”
137;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-10-04T14:15:58Z;MasterCard and Visa look to woo Africa’s unbanked;;"As incomes rise in Africa, the battle is on to snap up the millions of ‘unbanked’ – those without a bank account. The potential is vast: the African Development Bank says only 20 per cent of African families have bank accounts.As well as innovative new players, the old global payment technology rivals Visa and MasterCard are keen to join in. Both are looking to enlarge their footprint in different corners of the continent.According to the AfDB, sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest banking penetration (the proportion of people with accounts) in the world, standing at an average of 16.6 per cent compared with 63.5 per cent in developing countries. All sorts of products and players are sprouting up – whether it’s from traditionally established banks or from the newer but fiercely competitive mobile banking players such as M-Pesa in Kenya or South African MTN’s Mobile Money Account.But MasterCard and Visa aren’t sitting still. Here are just some of the initiatives in Africa from the two payments giants:Neither Visa or MasterCard give Africa-specific revenue figures in their financial reports. Beyondbrics asked both companies how much they have invested in Africa to date and what are their sales revenues for Africa, but they both declined to reveal their figures.For both companies, this is just the start in Africa. Visa, for example, says it aims to generate 50 per cent of its revenue from markets outside of the US by 2015, and wants to achieve this partly by extending its products areas where electronic payments are not yet widely used – Africa fits that description well. And at the announcement of the MasterCard-branded national identity smart cards, the Nigerian National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) revealed that it aims to introduce more than 100m cards to Nigeria’s citizens.But there are challenges, such as a lack of financial literacy, convincing consumers to trust the formal financial system, limited acceptance among merchants and difficult regulatory environments. Visa told beyondbrics: “It is difficult to educate and get people to understand the value of being formally included. This is a constant effort that we address through our financial inclusion and financial literacy efforts.”MasterCard President Middle East and Africa Region Michael Miebach highlighted the collaborative approach required to extend services in Africa: “Approaching payment infrastructure challenges across the continent requires a new model, where we as a payments technology company partner with governments, banks, merchants, NGOs and other technology companies at a country-level, and where as a result, doing well and doing good go together.”The flurry of initiatives from both companies shows the opportunity in Africa – and also the chance for newer players to win customers.Related reading:

138;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Visa, MasterCard and Amex seek new online payments standard;;Visa, MasterCard and American Express are proposing a new industry standard to make online payments more secure, by eliminating the need to enter account numbers when shopping online or on mobile devices.Instead, customers of the payment companies would be given individual identifying numbers for each of their smartphones or tablets, which they would enter when shopping online. This would create an additional level of security, as it would mean that merchants would not store credit card or account numbers.The proposed standard, to be applied worldwide, will be presented to payment companies and industry trade associations in coming weeks, the companies said in a statement.Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard, said that the proposal was for “a special and different number tied to that particular device. A one-time set-up, so that every time you use that device, you use that special number.”Other payment companies will be invited to adopt this new standard.Mr McLaughlin, who compared the proposed framework to the collective use of a magnetic stripe on plastic payment cards, said: “We want to agree to adhere to certain standards at the industry level.”MasterCard added that it would be “premature” to discuss the costs of implementation before the sector had agreed on a common framework.Peter Roe, research director at analysts TechMarketView, welcomed the move to tighten security. He noted that a “big leak of customer data” had the potential to shake confidence in mobile payments.“People I’ve been talking to are very aware of the need for greater security, so this is a good move. At the same time, payment authorities around the world are wanting new entrants, and that will reduce the power and market share of credit card operators.”The proposal comes as growing competition in mobile payment solutions has started to force down prices in Europe. Mobile payment start-ups SumUp and iZettle recently began charging retailers less than the standard 2.75 per cent transaction fee.Mr Roe suggested that innovators such as Square might be reluctant to use a system mandated by the credit card companies as “new companies with new ideas want to differentiate [themselves].”Mike Matan, head of Global Network Business at American Express, said in a statement that working together to form a global standard would help “drive the rapid adoption and expansion of digital payments”.Worldwide shipment of mobile phones with near-field communication technology– used for mobile payments – is predicted to rise fourfold between 2010 and 2014, according to iSuppli, the market research firm.
139;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Big Mother is watching you;Technology developers are allowing parents to keep their children under close surveillance;When Apple introduced the Find My iPhone app three years ago, its aim was to help people locate their lost smartphones. But EJ Hilbert, a 43-year-old former FBI officer, had a better idea – installing the app on his three children’s devices, so that he could track them wherever they went.“They have it on their phone and that’s the way it’s going to be,” says Mr Hilbert, whose day job is investigating cyber crime.By adapting the Find My iPhone app, Mr Hilbert is part of a wider trend. Until recently technology gave power to the children. Now it is starting to give something back to the parents.Yesterday’s parents did not know how to record their offspring’s favourite television programme. Today’s parents can record the child’s every move, email and purchase – with the help of a variety of new gadgets.“There are huge opportunities for disruption,” says James Wise, a venture investor at Balderton Capital. “The challenge for entrepreneurs is to build something both the parents and their children want to use.”For many parents, however, the priority is protecting their children from online pornography and bullying.In the UK, all internet customers are to be asked by the end of next year if they want to activate pornography filters. TalkTalk, the first provider to have offered the filters, says that about one in three households activate the filter.Parents worried about cyber bullying can go further. Dozens of software packages are available to install on desktops and mobiles to check children’s browsing history and read their emails and messages. By logging keystrokes, the programs can give parents access to sites and passwords.“Up until 13 or 14, it should be common practice for parents to sit down and go through what their children have been looking at [online], and who they are talking to,” says psych­ologist Catherine Steiner-Adair. “There is a whole new area requiring parental input, supervision and control.”This kind of surveillance should be done openly, she says. Parents should explain that they will be watching their children’s online activities as a condition for handing over a laptop or smartphone.Even so, that approach alarms some. “If very intrusive surveillance is deemed the norm during childhood, why would you ever expect privacy as an adult?” says Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, the privacy campaign group.Under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed by the US and European countries, children have a right to privacy from their parents, though the extent depends on their maturity.Parental surveillance technologies, which began with spy cameras hidden in teddy bears, have grown faster in the US than Europe. “There is a slight sense in America and increasingly the UK that, if you’ve got a problem, you should solve it with technology,” says Paul Bernal, a law lecturer at East Anglia University.Even parents may find the result creepy, however. Mathew Ingram, a tech­nology journalist, monitored his daughters’ online activities for nearly a decade. “I believed that what I was doing was justified because I wanted to protect my daughters from themselves,” he wrote recently. “In the end, I decided that the loss of trust was actually much worse than anything I was theoretically saving them from. ”Older kids, too, are under closer surveillance. With insurance premiums for young drivers rising, more parents are looking to install telematics boxes in their cars to monitor how their children drive. The boxes monitor actions such as ac­celeration, cornering, average speed and time of day. The data are available to the insurer and the policyholder – who is often the parent.“It’s inevitable that telematics will just be a normal thing for an under 25 to have,” says Charlotte Halkett of Insurethebox, which has about 50,000 parents with young drivers on its books.From apps to hardware, a range of devices are aimed at worried parents, including:●Life360 The app, left, which tracks the movements of family members, claims more than 30m users and has raised $10m in venture funding.●Filip Expected to launch this year, this smartwatch is designed to be worn by children. It can detect lost toddlers wherever they may be, including indoors.●Bemilo On the UK’s “safest mobile network”, children can only contact the phone numbers that their parents have authorised.Traditional insurers have also laun­ched telematics policies. “It’s only going to grow,” says Paul Felton, head of telematics at Direct Line. “More people are willing to share data and rec­eive something back for it. It’s all a trade-off.”The possibilities need not stop there.Tracking toddlers presents its own challenges. Sten Kirkbak was working in a telecommunications company when he lost sight of his son in a shopping centre: “It took a while for me to reflect on it, and even longer before I told my wife.” He came up with the idea of Filip, a smartwatch worn by children that tells parents where they are and allows voice calls. It has less functionality than a smartphone, which is the point of the device. “Approximately 70 per cent of parents in the US say they don’t want to buy their child a smartphone before the age of 12 or 13,” says Mr Kirkbak.Filip has raised $10m and plans to go into production this year. Because GPS does not work indoors, the smartwatch needs to run on WiFi and mob­ile phone signal too, which will push up the cost. The device is expected to retail at up to $200, with a $20 month­ly phone contract. But the big constraint is simplicity, rather than price, says Mr Kirkbak: “Everything has to be controlled from an app. Parents do not have time to read user manuals to control complex technology.”Many parents would like an insight into a child’s school performance. ClassDojo, a US-based service, allows teachers to email frequent reports to parents on their child’s behaviour.There is also parental interest in tracking how children spend their pocket money. Visa and MasterCard offer pre-paid debit cards that allow parents to see where their children have spent their money. This incarnation may not be foolproof. “If my parents gave me a pre-paid debit card to track my spending, the first thing I would do is buy an­other pre-paid debit card so they couldn’t,” jokes Jim McKelvey, co-founder of payments company Square.As more payments shift online, the opportunities increase for parents to peer over their child’s shoulder.But, as Mr McKelvey’s remarks highlight, children may try to outsmart the technology.Snapchat, a messaging service where the photos and text self-destruct after 15 seconds, allows children to communicate away from parents’ gaze. Those who want to play truantwithout being tracked can give their phones to friends who are at school. Some children also have two Facebook profiles, and accept their parents as friends on just one of them.The growth of parental surveillance is here to stay. “‘Won’t someone think of the children?’ is going to be a very potent marketing call for many years to come, as it has been for many years in the past,” says Mr Pickles.There is only one problem. If it is becoming ever easier to track a family member’s movements online and offline, what’s to stop the kids monitoring their parents?
140;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-08-18T11:58:29Z;Boom in plastic money as Nigeria spends, spends, spends;;"In 2002, when Mitchell Elegbe was starting his technology business, there were few proper bank cards in Nigeria, ATMs were rare and there was no inter-connectivity between banks. Drawing money meant walking into your branch, collecting a token indicating a number in the queue, and returning several hours later in the hope of being near the teller.“People used to keep a lot of money at home,” said Mr Elegbe. “We thought: why can’t people have cash just-in-time.”So his fledgling company built a “switching” infrastructure to connect the different banks. Interswitch also provided the technology for ATM cards, in the hope of becoming the Nigerian equivalent of Visa or MasterCard.A decade on, and the two American payment giants are scrambling to play catch-up in Africa’s second-biggest economy. Today, Nigeria has nearly 12,000 ATMs, 131,000 point-of-sales machines and several internet payment portals. Of the 25m bank cards in circulation, more than 18m carry Interswitch’s “Verve” brand, Mr Elegbe says.Its success is a clear example of the first-mover advantage is Nigeria, where for years the difficult operating conditions caused many multinationals to sit on the sidelines.With the economy expanding steadily at between 6 and 7 per cent a year since 2007, ever more foreign companies are looking for a way in, from supermarket chains such as Carrefour, which recently announced a deal to expand into west Africa, to Ermenegildo Zegna, the luxury men’s brand. And, as data from the banking sector show, later is better than never, for there is still huge room for growth.As in many other African countries, access to financial services has traditionally been limited to the wealthier class in Nigeria. In recent years, however, banks have courted lower-income customers. The number of people with bank accounts grew from 18.3m in 2008 to 28.6m in 2012, according to Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access, (EFInA), an organisation that promotes financial inclusion in the country.Even so, that represents just one in three Nigerian adults, compared with the two in three who formally bank in South Africa, the continent’s largest economy. Nearly 60m Nigerian adults – out of a fast-growing population of 160m people– do not use traditional banking services.“We have this massive market, and that gives us a natural advantage over other countries,” said Mr Elegbe, the MD of Interswitch, whose shareholders now include four local banks, the private equity firm Helios and the International Finance Corporation. “There’s still a huge opportunity to bring more people into the banking system.”Nigeria presents its own unique challenges too, from the chronic power outages that require standalone ATM’s to run on generators much of the day, to its reputation for fraud. In its early years, Interswitch used magnetic stripe cards that were susceptible to being cloned. Mr Elegbe said that fighting swindlers became “my full-time job”. Then Visa and MasterCard, whose presence in sub-Saharan Africa had mainly been limited to countries that drew foreign tourists, such as Kenya and South Africa, entered the market with chip-and-pin cards.The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) mandated that this become the new standard, and Interswitch adopted the technology for its Verve cards. Scamming has now been greatly reduced – by 90 per cent, the CBN says – and is today a much smaller issue than people might imagine, said Ade Ashaye, country manager for Visa.“[By coming in later] we have not repeated the mistakes made in other markets,” he said. “Fraud on our cards issued in Nigeria is significantly lower than global averages.”At the same time, spending on plastic is rising fast. According to the CBN, the volume of card purchases and ATM withdrawals nearly tripled between 2009 and 2011. The vast majority of transactions are made using savings account or debit cards; since Nigeria’s banking crash in 2008, when reckless lending was common, the percentage of bank customers holding credit cards has fallen from 12 per cent to 5 per cent, according to EFInA.One reason for the surge in e-purchases is the CBN’s efforts to promote cashless transactions, which has seen handheld point-of-sales terminals installed everywhere from church donation booths to hairdressers. Another is the rise of internet shopping and sites, such as Paga and Interswitch’s Quickteller that facilitate money transfers, bill payments and airtime purchases.MasterCard, which formally moved into the market in 2010, has seen a strong growth in revenues, according to Omokehinde Ojomuyide, its business head for west Africa, as people have become more comfortable using their cards. The company has an agreement with the government to rollout 13m MasterCard- branded national identity cards that will enable people to load money and make electronic payments.Along with Visa and Interswitch, MasterCard is also working with overseas vendors to improve acceptance of cards issued in Nigeria, which are sometimes still rejected because of a fear of fraud.“Like it or not, Nigerians spent a lot of money abroad,” said Mrs Ojomuyide. “There’s no reason that they should not get the same services as anywhere else in the world.”"

However, ExxonMobil was also hit by a fall in daily production.Poor results from ExxonMobil were overshadowed by positive earnings from other major US companies and news that the pace of manufacturing growth in the US reach its highest level in two years, soundly beating estimates.The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 1,706.82, as all 10 major sectors traded in positive territory.The financials sector led the way with MasterCard up 5.9 per cent to $646.38. The payment network reported earnings per share that beat estimates.Credit processors have come under pressure from scrutiny about fees charged on debit cards. A judge ruled on Wednesday that limits on such fees were not tough enough.That sent shares in MasterCard down sharply but investors have quickly turned back to the company on the strength of its earnings.Rival processor Visa has received no such support with the shares trading 6.4 per cent lower in the last two days.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 15,626.72, aided by a 1.7 per cent rise in Procter & Gamble.The consumer goods stalwart reported net sales that came in just ahead of expectations, and newly returned chief executive AG Lafley publicly pledged to focus on the company’s successful products.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4 per cent to 3,675.74.JC Penney shares fell 0.1 per cent to $14.58, extending Thursday’s losses that were triggered by reports that lender CIT Group had stopped deliveries between small manufacturers and the retailer.JC Penney denied the report but its shares remain down 10.3 per cent in the past two days.Coffee shop chain Starbucks rose 3.1 per cent to $73.648 on news that it will be switching to Google from AT&T as the wireless internet provider in its US stores. Starbucks said the new service will be up to 10 times faster.That news helped Google shares to rise 1.9 per cent to $904.22.The broad rally represented the best day on the S&P 500 in three weeks and comes after the benchmark index rose 5 per cent in the month of July.Investors had previously drove the S&P 500 near the 1,700 level but had pulled back to the 1,690 level for the second half of July.Thursday’s strong economic data added to recent positive reports, including rising US home prices and an ADP release that said the US private sector created 200,000 jobs in July.Combined with continued support from the Fed through its quantitative easing programme, recent economic data bolsters the case for US equities to continue higher, said Doug Cote, chief market strategist for ING Investment Management“I think the Fed is increasingly getting behind the curve on a growing economy,” he said. “Not only is the market getting back to normal, not only is the Fed saying we’re getting back to normal but investors should be getting back to their normal 60/40 [stock/bond] allocation.”
142;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-07-25T14:14:25Z;MasterCard, Google and the risks of Mega-Lobbying;;Is some lobbying in Brussels too heavy and contrived for its own good?Two examples spring to mind from some of the most over-lobbied issues handled by the European Commission: card fees and the antitrust case against Google.The commissioners involved are displaying some truly puzzling behaviour. For all the lobbying money, man hours and cunning plans launched to change their minds, the crucial policymakers seem more irritated than converted.Take Michel Barnier’s outburst on Wednesday. Not so long ago, regulating card fees was pretty low on his agenda. More often than not, he is wary of liberal competition arguments, and the antitrust war of attrition with MasterCard and Visa Europe was not his beef.How then then did it come to this? While unveiling a proposed cap on card fees, Barnier blasted MasterCard for launching a “mad campaign” of lobbying that did more harm than good. Note the comments are about MasterCard, not Visa, which took a more low-key lobbying approach:“I have seen a lot of lobbying over the past three years, but I never saw that: advertorials, biased information, solicited interviews, false information to contest a proposal by the European Commission.”“I can understand that a big American company like this defends its point of view, but frankly I found this campaign insufferable and counterproductive.”The translation is from the WSJ’s Tom Fairless, who did a good job of putting in English the passion and unusual venom Mr Barnier directed towards MasterCard. Such a public dressing-down of a major multinational is a rare thing in the Berlaymont.Did the lobbying actually achieve anything? Well MasterCard could argue that their arguments cut through. Barnier decided against the one radical option preferred by officials — an outright ban on debit card fees. Instead he went for a cap, phased in over time.Yet this is still bad news for MasterCard and Visa. There are plenty of other nasties in the text. And the fact that the proposal came out at all is in good part down to MasterCard angering Barnier beyond words. Until recently, the expectation was that the (modest) proposals would be delayed until the autumn, in the dying days of the Commission mandate.One lobbying tactic particularly upset him: long advertorials in the French press including allegedly biased information and even a picture of the commissioner. Barnier was put out by what he saw as an under-hand bid to swing public opinion against him. After months of sitting on the file and showing no interest, he was moved to act.The second example is the anti-Google coalition. Groups waging an antitrust insurgency against a corporate giant are typically cast as the good guys, or at least the friends of the competition enforcers in the Commission.Yet somehow the motley Microsoft-led army of complainants arrayed against Google at times seem to annoy Joaquin Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, more than Google itself. In one interview with the Financial Times, he made plenty of asides about “noisy” complainants.“Neither Google nor the commission have contributed to the noise and fury. The orchestra is in another place.”This is put down by some complainants as a side-effect of Google’s clever bear-hug strategy, where the commissioner was kept close enough to restrict his room for manoeuvre. Put another way, they allegedly drew Almunia into talks, prolonged the process, sapped the momentum of the investigation, and made him invest political capital in a settlement that ended up much weaker than he expected when he embarked on the process.Whatever may have happened, Almunia on the whole is not known for cosy deals or for being a soft touch. One lawyer frustrated by his immovable determination refers to him as “the mule”. Almunia tends to enjoy heavy lobbying, if only because he gets to stand up to it. Just ask Duncan Niederauer of NYSE Euronext, whose merger plans he blocked with some relish. This is how he described the NYSE lobbying efforts:“They tried a public-relations campaign, lobbying, political pressure to get a positive decision. I told them from the beginning: ‘you don’t know how to deal with the Commission’. This is not the best way to convince us – quite the opposite, it is the wrong way”That said, there are some signs that the anti-Google lobbying might be working. The anti-Google camp — after furiously denouncing a proposed settlement as worse than doing nothing — are buoyed by Almunia demanding more concessions from Google. Even so the odds remain on a settlement, which will almost inevitably fall short of the anti-Google brigade’s expectations.Whatever the outcome, from speaking to people involved with these cases, it might be worth companies with interests to promote in Brussels drawing some lessons from reactions of Almunia and Barnier.Like any commissioner, they prefer to know who they are dealing with when being lobbied. If a big company is the primary driver of an antitrust complaint, or simply wants to make its view on a policy clear, they would be more comfortable hearing from it directly, rather than through a grass-roots (or astro-turf) alliance that does not disclose its funding. At least then they have a better sense of its motives and agenda.A small archipelago of pressure groups, think-tanks, legal outposts, hired-guns, payroll academics and the like have been built up around the Google and card fees issues. A lot of money has been spent. Putting aside the substance of the issues, on a tactical level there is always a danger that creating lots of noise will drown out a legitimate argument. There is potentially a price to be paid in creditability. With these commissioners at least, the results of mega-lobbying are far from clear cut.
143;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Brussels’ ruling on card fees unleashes charged emotions;;"Arcane card fees can whip up considerable emotion in Brussels. Few policy issues have better padded the wallets of lawyers and lobbyists, generated more impenetrable jargon and novel economic theories, or been drawn out for so long.So the European Commission’s move on Wednesday to cap interbank fees for card transactions– after 20 years of grinding and only partly successful antitrust action against MasterCard and Visa Europe – naturally came with a flourish and a sting.Barely able to contain his frustrations, Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner responsible for the regulation, denounced MasterCard for launching “a mad campaign” of lobbying. “I have never seen anything like it,” he said.Card fees charged by banks to handle transactions “don’t represent costs”, Mr Barnier said. “It is just a device to make money”. Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition enforcer, in turn spoke of “vested interests” trying to “scare consumers”.The rare public rebuke – warranted or otherwise – far from closes the legislative policy fight over who ends up footing the bill and reaping profits for payment card networks underpinning Europe’s retail economy. EU member states and the European parliament must agree the proposed reforms – a process that could stretch from nine months to several years.About €13bn a year is – with considerable resentment – paid by retailers in Europe to banks for handling transactions, about 70 per cent of which is accounted for by interbank charges, or so-called “interchange fees”. Making fees more transparent, giving merchants more choice of provider and capping rates – which can vary tenfold between EU countries – effectively shaves about €6bn from bank revenues and hands it to retailers, according to the commission.The policy trade-off being debated in at least two-dozen countries around the world is whether this intervention will be fed through in lower retail prices, or merely force banks to charge consumers for the same card service in other ways. Brussels’ resort to regulation follows similar moves in the US, Switzerland, Spain and Australia, the results of which are bitterly contested.The debate is not short of rhetoric. During the consultation on the reforms, the French Banking Federation warned that limiting these legitimate fees for guaranteeing transactions could send Europe back “to the dark ages of payment methods”.Meanwhile EuroCommerce, the retail association, denounced the “fiendish beauty” of a system where “the ones who pay – merchants – cannot negotiate with the ones who benefit – the issuing banks”. Ian Cheshire, chief executive of Kingfisher, said “retailers and consumers have had enough”.Underlying the Brussels proposal are various assumptions; first, that retailers are more competitive than banks and therefore more likely to pass on savings. MasterCard argues that the “coerced reduction of interchange fees” in various countries has backfired, with cards becoming more expensive while retail prices barely change. In Australia, “the merchant pocketed the reduction”, it argued to the commission.By contrast, Brussels concludes that schemes with minimal or zero interbank fees can flourish (such as in Denmark), encourage more card use (Spain) and eventually bring down retail prices (Australia). Lower card fees do not mean higher bank charges: in Switzerland both fell in parallel.Any rise in consumer bank charges – such as those in Spain and Australia – are ascribed to poor competition in retail banking; charges were on the rise anyway. “In the US banks tried to increase cardholder fees after [card fee] regulation but had to back down due to a consumers revolt,” the commission proposal says.The second assumption is that consumers will be pleased to have light shone on a fee system that they were largely unaware of. Here Mr Barnier did, to a degree, hedge his bets for fear of a political backlash.While early Commission plans were for an outright ban on debit card fees– which risked driving up consumer bank charges, especially in undeveloped markets – Mr Barnier took a more modest approach. The 0.2 per cent cap on domestic transactions is imposed after a two-year transition and fits with the outlines of antitrust deals with Visa and MasterCard.The Commission will then review the situation, four years after the legislation is passed, keeping the Brussels lobbying industry busy for many years to come."
144;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-07-24T09:21:03Z;European Commission unveils plan to tackle high card fees;;Banks face curbs on “unjustifiably high” card fees, and a requirement to separate payment card schemes and the entities that process transactions, under a Brussels proposal to regulate a sector it has long targeted as anti-competitive.The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled legislative plans to cap the interbank fees for handling transactions based on consumer cards, which would save retailers across Europe about €4.5bn in annual charges.The ceiling of 0.2 per cent for debit card rates and 0.3 per cent for credit cards is in line with antitrust deals on cross-border fees and is a more modest intervention than an outright ban on debit charges, which was preferred in early drafts.Its impact is likely to be felt most in markets such as Germany, where average credit card rates stand at 1.8 per cent, and Poland, where average debit card charges are 1.6 per cent.Alongside the restrictions on so-called “interchange fees”, the commission proposes a wider overhaul of payment services to encourage competition, cheaper schemes and more transparent costs. The proposals must be agreed by EU member states and the European Parliament to become law, a negotiation that could stretch for years.Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner responsible for the reforms, said they would tackle a “fragmented and expensive” sector and “finally put an end to the unjustified high level of these fees”.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief whose staff have fought for decades with Visa and MasterCard, added that consumers would ultimately benefit through “lower retail prices”.“The interchange fees paid by retailers end up on consumers’ bills. Not only are consumers generally unaware of this, they are even encouraged through reward systems to use the cards that provide their banks with the highest revenues.”All payment schemes using banks to issue cards will be covered – a measure that means so-called “three-party” schemes such as Diners will be hit by the cap, as well as 9 per cent of all American Express cards.One of the more worrying interventions for Visa and MasterCard, which dominate the payment services sector, is a requirement to separate payment card schemes and the entities that process transactions – a forced split that would remake the business model. The separation is backed by the European Central Bank as a way to improve competition and efficiency.In 2011, about 727m payment cards were issued in the EU and the value of card transactions exceeded €1.9tn. Visa and MasterCard have a 41.6 per cent and 48.9 per cent market share respectively. Retailers across Europe pay banks about €13bn a year to handle transactions, and 70 per cent of this charge is accounted for by interchange fees between banks handling the process.Card schemes and banks resisted the curbs on fees, arguing the heavy-handed intervention would backfire. Card use would decrease, upfront banking fees would rise, while merchants would pocket the savings rather than reduce prices. MasterCard said last week that “history has shown that the biggest losers in the event of interchange regulation are consumers and small businesses”.Merchants welcomed the intervention as “a bold step” but made clear that they hoped for an outright ban on the fees, at least for debit cards. Christian Verschueren of EuroCommerce, the retail association, said: “Claims by card schemes that retailers would not pass on cost savings to consumers are nonsensical: price competition is in the DNA of retailers.”Other aspects of the proposal will permit retailers to encourage consumers not to use the most expensive cards and include a reform to allow three-party schemes to initiate payments, which could help new entrants to the payments market.Most consumers are unaware of the charges. The commission sees the fees as anti-competitive because card schemes attract issuing banks with better revenues, which drives rates up rather than down. At the same time consumers are encouraged to take cards with rebates, free insurance and air miles, which usually generate better rates for banks.The effects of similar regulations to limit card fees in countries such as the US, Australia and Spain are heavily contested. The commission argues that retailers are more competitive than banks and more likely to pass on savings to consumers.
145;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-07-16T20:00:12Z;Card transaction fees to be capped under EU proposal;;Lucrative fees to process card transactions are to be capped under a proposal by the European Union’s executive arm aiming to draw a line under a decade-long battle with payment groups such as Visa Europe and MasterCard.Under a draft European Commission plan, seen by the Financial Times, a ceiling would be introduced for charges on all consumer debit and credit card transactions, scaling back a multibillion-euro revenue stream for EU banks.The measure stops short of a full ban on debit card fees, a more far-reaching intervention envisaged in earlier drafts. Even so, the assault on fees will be a setback for the payments industry, which has warned it will raise banking fees for consumers rather than cut retail prices.In addition, the draft plan requires payment card schemes and the entities that process transactions to be legally separated – a forced split that would remake the business model for the main payment groups.Brussels’ recourse to regulation, an issue on both sides of the Atlantic, marks the culmination of years of trench warfare between EU competition authorities and the payment providers, which resulted in pacts with Visa and MasterCard to limit cross-border transaction fees.The Commission proposes a 0.2 per cent ceiling on all consumer debit transactions and 0.3 per cent cap on credit card transactions, introduced after a two-year transition period where the ceiling applies only to cross-border fees.According to Commission estimates, this will cut total EU debit card fees from around €4.8bn to €2.5bn, and credit card fees from €5.7bn to €3.5bn. “High [fees] paid by merchants result in higher final prices for goods and services, which are all paid by consumers,” the proposal said.The cap is broadly based on the proposed antitrust deals with Visa and MasterCard and aims to give “legal clarity” but it reaches deeper into domestic card markets, where fees can vary dramatically. Typical debit card fees range from 0.1 per cent in Denmark to 1.6 per cent in Poland. Average credit card rates in Germany stand at 1.8 per cent, compared to 0.5 per cent in France.A fee cap will disappoint hawks within the commission who pushed for an outright ban on debit card fees and a wider scope for credit card measures, so that premium commercial cards are also covered.An early Commission impact assessment argues that relying on a cap is harder to enforce and risks forcing existing domestic payment schemes with low fees to raise their rates. It also argues that a ban would “address the threat of ‘exporting’ the [interchange fee] model to new, innovative payment services” such as mobile and online systems.High [fees] paid by merchants result in higher final prices for goods and services, which are all paid by consumersMost consumers are unaware of the charges. The Commission fears card schemes compete to attract issuing banks with better revenues, which drives fees up rather than down. At the same time consumers are encouraged to take cards with rebates, free insurance and air miles, which usually generate higher fees for banks.By contrast banks and payment groups attack a cap as heavy-handed. Card use would decline, cardholder fees would rise, loyalty benefits would be cut back and retailers would be unlikely to pass on savings, they warn.In 2011, some 727m payment cards were issued in the EU and the value of card transactions exceeded €1.9tn. Visa and MasterCard dominate the market, with 41.6 per cent and 48.9 per cent market share respectively. Retailers across Europe pay banks around €13bn a year to handle transactions, and 70 per cent of this charge is accounted for by interchange fees between banks handling the process.So-called three-party schemes, such as American Express, do not have explicit interchange fees. But the commission argues there are “implicit” charges and any such scheme using payment service providers to issue cards or handle retail business will be covered by the same cap.Debate on the measure to separate payment groups is under way within the commission. Non-bank payment providers complained that bundling together the two sides of the business prevents new players entering the market.“As the cost of processing is a significant part of the total cost of card acceptance, it is important for this part of the value chain to be opened to effective competition,” the draft said. “On the basis of the separation of scheme and infrastructure, card schemes and processing entities should be independent in terms of legal form, organisation and decision making process.”Additional reforms to business rules will apply to all forms of payment systems, including greater transparency on fees. A limit is proposed on the “honour all cards rules” that prevents retailers opting for cards with lower fees.US efforts to clamp down on bank fees took a step forward on Tuesday when Richard Cordray won a vote paving the way for him to be confirmed as the first formal head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Senate Republicans, many of whom see the new agency as an unwarranted interference in private markets, had held up his confirmation for two years.The CFPB was created by the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul in the US, which also capped the debit card fees charged to retailers by banks, wiping out billions of dollars of revenue across the industry.Daniel Henry, chief financial officer of American Express, said last month that the new rules had “wiped out profitability in the debit space”, dissuading banks from serving poorer customers and “causing more people to leave the banking system”.Additional reporting by Tom Braithwaite in New YorkThis article has been amended since publication to correct an error.

148;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;China blocks MasterCard processing renminbi transactions;;China has blocked MasterCard from processing credit card transactions in renminbi, raising concerns about Beijing’s willingness to fully open up the sector after the World Trade Organisation found that it unfairly restricted foreign card companies.According to a document obtained by the Financial Times, the Chinese central bank ordered last month that EPayLinks, an online payment platform, stop issuing renminbi-settled credit cards in partnership with MasterCard.The ruling by the People’s Bank of China comes less than a year after the WTO declared that Beijing discriminated against foreign electronic payment providers by allowing UnionPay – the Chinese rival to MasterCard and Visa – to monopolise domestic renminbi-denominated transactions.China has said that it would study the WTO judgment and state-owned media have reported that Beijing might announce new rules for its domestic card market as soon as next month.But in what industry executives say is a sign that China might continue to take a hard line, the central bank put its foot down on the initiative by EPayLinks to launch renminbi-settled cards supported by MasterCard, which was announced earlier this year.“No payment institution is allowed to co-operate with foreign card companies in developing cross-border payment businesses involving renminbi bank accounts or renminbi payment accounts,” the Chinese central bank ruled.“Foreign currencies must be used when clearing and settling domestic acquisitions made by people holding foreign credit cards.”China is among the world’s fastest-growing credit card markets, with 46m cards issued in the country last year. MasterCard has predicted that China will overtake the US as the largest market for cards by 2020, when it is expected to have about 900m.The explosion in card use has been lucrative for UnionPay, which was set up under the auspices of China’s central bank and is owned by 80 Chinese banks and other state entities. Its revenues more than tripled over the four years to 2011, reaching Rmb6bn ($978m), according to local media reports.All transactions at Chinese automated banking machines and merchants must be processed via UnionPay’s payments system. Visa and MasterCard are normally required to pay UnionPay a fee on transactions made using their cards in China.The MasterCard-branded cards issued by EPayLinks were “virtual”, giving customers the ability to buy products online in renminbi, with the deals settled by offshore renminbi processed through the MasterCard payments system.A representative of EPayLinks said that it had not violated China’s rules because it was not directly co-operating with MasterCard but rather conducting the business through its Hong Kong subsidiary. It added that it would strictly adhere to the central bank’s regulations in its business operations. MasterCard declined to comment.“Looking at ecommerce, it is clear that there will be a trend of foreign cards being used in China,” EPayLinks said. “The big trend is that this business will be permitted, but the exact policies are still not clear.”In its ruling, the Chinese central bank appeared to hold the door open to the possibility of foreign card companies eventually being given greater leeway in the domestic market. “We are now researching and drafting regulatory policies for foreign bank card organisations to enter the Chinese payment services market,” it said.Additional reporting by Emma Dong

The proposed settlement, one of the largest US antitrust accords, was made on behalf of about 7m merchants in the US, including cities such as Oakland and businesses such as Safeway.The settlement consists of a payment of more than $6bn for alleged past damages to retailers and a temporary reduction in the level of interchange fees paid by merchants on Visa and MasterCard credit card transactions.Barbara Parker, city attorney for Oakland, said the proposed accord offered only nominal financial damages to victims.“Oakland will still have to pay excessive fees to credit card companies when we should be able to use that money for essential programmes and services,” she said.Visa and MasterCard charge Oakland a so-called interchange fee every time the City accepts credit or debit cards for payments of parking tickets, business licence taxes and other fees. The city estimates that higher charges resulting from Visa’s and MasterCard’s practices cost taxpayers an estimated $103,000 a month.In another dispute, the Californian city last November said it planned to boycott Goldman Sachs after the investment bank refused to unwind a $16m interest rate swap struck more than a decade ago.At the time, city council members said that they hoped boycotting the bank would encourage other municipalities to put pressure on banks.Municipalities use swap deals to protect themselves from volatile interest rate movements. With interest rates at historic lows, these swap agreements may cost local governments $2.5bn a year, according to estimates by the Refund Transit Coalition from late 2012.
150;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-05-14T17:00:29Z;Visa Europe bows to EU fees pressure;;Visa Europe has yielded to Brussels’ antitrust complaints with an offer to cap cross-border credit card fees at a “significantly” lower rate, a proposed settlement that will pile pressure on MasterCard to also sue for peace.The draft pact with the European Commission is the latest twist in a two-decade-long saga over allegedly overinflated fees for payment transactions, which Brussels argues harm consumers while generating large revenues for banks.Visa Europe, a bank-owned group that is separate from its listed US counterpart, pledged to charge no more than 0.3 per cent of a retail transaction for credit card “interchange fees” that a consumer’s bank levies on a merchant’s bank.This represents a cut of 40 to 60 per cent and applies to cross-border transactions within the European Economic Area, as well as the domestic fees charged in 10 EU member states. The cap is in line with undertakings given by MasterCard in 2009, which it provisionally offered while it pursues an appeal through the courts.However, Visa Europe goes further by removing conditions that prevented retailers from taking advantage of lower rates offered by banks outside the retailers’ home market. The company’s rules forced banks to apply the rate of the merchant’s country as a minimum, which the Commission saw as choking-off competition.Similar restrictions are the subject of a commission probe launched against MasterCard last month. The payment group denies wrongdoing and is not in settlement talks with Brussels.The banks and other financial groups that own Visa Europe are exploring an option to sell the company to US-based Visa and set up a rival payment system in Europe, according to people familiar with the matter. Visa has a call option to buy shares in Visa Europe. No formal decision has been announced.Visa credit and debit cards cover about 41 per cent of all payment cards issued in the European Economic Area. Some 35bn card payments were made in 2010, according to the Commission, with a total value of €1.8tn.Alongside the Commission’s actions, MasterCard and Visa Europe are under investigation or facing court proceedings in eight EU countries. Brussels is also preparing a legislative proposal, to be published this summer, which could effectively cut fee levels, require more transparency or open access to rival payments groups.While the Commission settlements relate to “interchange fees” on cross-border card payments, the EU reform drive could soon move to relatively untouched domestic card fees.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition commissioner, said the “excellent news” over the Visa Europe proposal marked a major advance in “putting an end to restrictions of competition in interbank arrangements”.Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe chief executive, said the draft deal was the “result of constructive dialogue” and “is in line with the level of 0.3 per cent established in the industry”.The Visa Europe settlement is a big breakthrough in the Commission’s revitalised offensive against card payment groups, which is clearing the way for a wider shake-up of card services to make fees more transparent for consumers.MasterCard last year lost a landmark case in the EU’s second-highest court, which tested how the Commission applied competition law to the payment card market. It is appealing against that decision.Rivals will have an opportunity to comment on the terms before Mr Almunia decides to formally accept the settlement.After receiving its first antitrust complaint in 2008, Visa Europe promised to cut its debit card fees to 0.2 per cent in a 2010 settlement. But it held out over credit card rates until now.Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodriguez in New York

153;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Nigeria signs up MasterCard to make dual-purpose identity card;;MasterCard is teaming up with the Nigerian authorities to launch identity cards that will double up as electronic payment cards.The credit card provider said it was rolling out a pilot scheme that will initially target 13m people. The project ties in with the Nigerian government’s plans to introduce identity cards and reduce Nigerians’ reliance on cash transactions.The dual-purpose identity and payment card could initially be used for recipients of Nigerian state pensions. But it is hoped it could ultimately be broadened to include public sector salaries and other payments such as agricultural subsidies.Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and leading oil producer with 160m people and one of the continent’s fastest growing economies. But it has trailed Kenya, in east Africa, in introducing a mobile banking system.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria’s finance minister, said at the World Economic Forum in Cape Town that the initiative with MasterCard would help boost financial inclusion by bringing more people without bank accounts into the formal economy where the vast majority of transactions are still conducted in cash.She added that the government was working on implementing a number of “electronic platforms” which would help build institutions to “stop leakages” and fight corruption.“This programme is good practice for us to bring all the citizens on a common platform for interacting with the various government agencies and for transacting electronically,” she said.Mastercard’s rival, Visa has chosen a different entry strategy into Africa, initiating a pilot scheme in the tiny central African state of Rwanda, where in collaboration with the authorities it has enlisted about 100,000 users into a mobile telephone banking system similar to Kenya’s.MasterCard has launched a scheme comparable to its Nigerian venture in South Africa where it has issued some 10m cards for recipients of social grants, or welfare benefits.Michael Miebach, president of Middle East and Africa at MasterCard, said the number of electronic card terminals in Nigeria had swelled from about 8,000 to 160,000 over the past two years. Access Bank, a Nigerian bank, will be the initial partner issuing the cards.Like other multinationals, MasterCard has been drawn to Africa’s strong economic growth in recent years and the emergence in many countries of a new consumer class.Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s chief executive, said recently that the governments in Nigeria and Kenya were talking about moving towards becoming “cashless” societies.“The markets in Africa, the people you take as being remote, they are actually more advanced in their thinking around this issue than some of the more developed world, which tends to think let this be laisser-faire, it’ll happen on its own,” he said.
154;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa and MasterCard: fortunes diverge;Each provider enjoys secular trend away from cash;"Visa and MasterCard, the two largest payment processors, are often lumped together. But lately their fortunes have diverged. In the first three months of 2012, revenue at MasterCard grew by 8 per cent from the year before but missed Wall Street forecasts. Visa beat expectations with 15 per cent growth. MasterCard made cautious noises about the global economy; Visa sounded upbeat.In the US, Visa has been doing better than its smaller rival in credit. Its volumes jumped 9 per cent in the quarter, against only 2.4 per cent at MasterCard. Debit had been a tough area for Visa during the past few quarters, but now things may get easier. Dodd Frank rules that took effect last April ended exclusivity rights on debit transactions. All transactions on Visa-branded cards could before be processed only on Visa’s network. The new rules require debit cards to offer more network options, allowing MasterCard and others to grab some transactions. That had benefited the smaller MasterCard during the past year but now Visa faces easier comparisons.Another difference: MasterCard owns its European operations. whereas Visa Europe belongs to a group of banks. There have been rumblings that the banks may exercise a put option, requiring Visa to buy them out. The price tag is expected to be in the billions of dollars – but the benefits of bringing the European business in-house are likely to outweigh the cost. Visa has capacity on its balance sheet, too: it holds $4.3bn in cash and securities and has no debt.The great similarity between Visa and MasterCard – they are both enjoying the secular trend to card and digital payments and away from cash – is also the biggest reason to own shares of either. In the near-term, Visa appears to have a greater tailwind but the shares reflect that. Visa trades at 23 times forward earnings to MasterCard’s 21. Any more premium between the two and MasterCard starts to seem attractive, especially if the economy were to rebound in the second half.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
155;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard fails to delay action over transaction fees;;MasterCard, which is being sued at the High Court by several high street retailers including Wm Morrison and Asda, has failed in its attempt to delay UK legal proceedings that centre on the fees charged for card transactions.MasterCard had sought to put the UK case on hold as it awaited a ruling from the European Court of Justice expected before next year.Last year the EU General Court in Luxembourg upheld a European Commission ruling in 2007 that fees set by MasterCard on cross-border card payments were anti-competitive and breached EU law.The dispute centres on “interchange” fees set by MasterCard and Visa that are passed on to the retailer by the card acquirers – usually the big banks.On Friday, Mr Justice Field rejected MasterCard’s application that the UK proceedings should be delayed and ordered MasterCard to lodge its defences to the lawsuits and prepare for a pre-trial hearing.The judge ruled that “there is a pressing need to get on with this litigation” and found that for MasterCard the cost of pleading a defence and preparing for a pre-trial hearing was “relatively modest”.Jonathan Sinclair, head of competition litigation at Stewarts Law, which is acting for the retailers, said: “Our clients welcome the court’s decision which allows their claims to progress and now requires defences to be served.“This is important as interchange fees continue to be levied on card transactions in the UK notwithstanding relevant findings by the EU Commission indicating that they are anti-competitive.”

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
157;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;MasterCard: spend, spend, spend;Growth is tied to a healthy economy and buoyant consumer;Well, you can’t have everything. MasterCard is benefiting from an enviable trend: the worldwide shift to paying with plastic instead of paper. But credit and debit cards are spending tools, so the company’s fortunes are also tied to a healthy economy and buoyant consumer. On that front, things are much less enviable.The payment processor has set a goal of 11 per cent average annual revenue growth, and 20 per cent earnings per share growth, from 2013 through 2015 – but warned that the uncertain global economy meant it might not get there right away. In the first quarter, reported on Wednesday, MasterCard produced top-line growth of 8 per cent. That is a rate that many companies would covet but it was slightly below analysts’ expectations for MasterCard. In the US, where the company earns about 40 per cent of its revenue, consumer spending was hit by higher payroll taxes, delays in tax refunds and bad weather. In March US retail sales, excluding cars, rose 2 per cent year on year, the weakest increase since late 2009. A year ago the growth rate was more than 6 per cent. And the US is, in theory, the strongest of the developed economies.Still, earnings per share rose 16 per cent to $6.23, ahead of Wall Street targets. A lower tax rate and operating expense leverage helped, but carefully managed earnings were not what investors were looking for. The shares fell 3 per cent.MasterCard’s stock is up more than 100 per cent in the past three years and 10 per cent in the year to date. At $540, the shares trade at about 20 times forward earnings. The cash-to-cards trend remains intact – though MasterCard faces new competitors, particularly in mobile payments. The question is how big a premium should be paid for a spending-driven company in a time of sluggish spending.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
158;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard lifted by credit card spending;;Rising credit and debit card spending boosted quarterly profits for MasterCard and Visa as a growing number of consumers worldwide shunned cash transactions.MasterCard, the second-biggest US payments network said on Wednesday that its net income climbed 12 per cent to $766m, or $6.23 a share, from $682m in the same period of 2012. The results were higher than Wall Street estimates of $6.17 a share in the quarter, according to a survey by Bloomberg.In a separate report after markets closed, Visa said net income for its fiscal second quarter $1.3bn or $1.92 per share, an increase of 17 and 20 per cent, respectively, over the prior year adjusted results. The prior year results were adjusted to exclude a one-time tax benefit of $208m.As purchases slow in the US, both companies are seeking to expand their presence in high-growth overseas markets, where reliance on cash transactions is still high.MasterCard customers made $690bn worth of purchases worldwide on a local currency basis, 10 per cent higher than a year ago. But in the US, the company’s largest market, growth in purchase volumes slowed to 4.6 per cent from a 13.2 per cent rate in 2012. By contrast, purchase volumes growth in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa rose 19.1 per cent in the first quarter.“We delivered solid performance that met our expectations despite the mixed global economic environment,” said Ajay Banga, MasterCard chief executive. “Since the start of the year, we have had steady momentum in new business, as well as product innovations.”For Visa, worldwide spending on its payment cards rose 8.8 per cent as cross-border volume, a measure of spending by cardholders outside their home countries, climbed 10 per cent.The payment processor raised its forecast for adjusted annual earnings per share growth to about 20 per cent.MasterCard shares fell 2.4 per cent lower at $539.82 on Wednesday after closing at an all-time high of $552.93 on Tuesday. The stock has risen 10.2 per cent so far this year.
159;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-04-09T15:30:38Z;Brussels opens MasterCard antitrust probe;;Brussels opened a new front in its battle over card fees as it launched an antitrust probe into MasterCard over concerns that it was distorting competition and overcharging retailers.The European Commission investigation will focus on fees relating to customers from outside the European Union and possible restrictions MasterCard places on retailers seeking to reduce the cross-border fees they pay.It is the latest twist in a long and complex tussle between MasterCard and Brussels that has lasted for more than a decade. The issues raised mirror parts of a parallel commission investigation into Visa.Alongside the commission’s actions, MasterCard and Visa are under investigation or facing court proceedings in eight EU countries. Brussels is also preparing a legislative proposal, to be published this summer, which could effectively cut fee levels, require more transparency or open access to rival payments groups.So far the competition cases largely revolve around “interchange fees” on cross-border card payments, which a consumer’s bank levies on a merchant’s bank for retail sales transactions. However, the push for reform could soon move to relatively untouched domestic card fees.MasterCard said it intended to “fully co-operate with the commission”. It added: “As a global electronic payments company MasterCard always aims to balance the interests of both consumers and retailers to ensure that each party pays its fair share of the costs for the benefits it receives.”The commission’s concerns relate to the relatively higher fees that retailers typically face when handling payments from customers – such as American tourists – from outside the EU.This issue was not touched by the commission’s 2007 decision against MasterCard, which applied to cross-border fees paid within the EU. After the ruling, MasterCard significantly cut its interchange fee rate on an “interim” basis, without accepting wrongdoing.In a landmark ruling from the EU’s second-highest court, MasterCard lost its appeal, which had become a test of the fundamental principles of how competition law is applied to the card market.Most consumers are unaware of the charges, which provide multibillion-euro revenue streams for card-issuing banks. MasterCard sees the charges as vital to a cheap and secure service with benefits such as insurance and loyalty rewards.The latest commission investigation will also look at other restrictions faced by retailers, including the requirement to “honour all cards” even when premium MasterCards – such as “gold” cards – carry higher fees.Brussels is also concerned about rules on “cross-border acquiring” within the MasterCard system that potentially stop retailers from benefiting from lower card fee rates in other EU countries. Charges on a €50 transaction can range from 10 cents in the Netherlands to 80 cents in Poland.
160;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-03-27T13:21:29Z;PayPal’s ‘free ride’ on payments to end;;PayPal faces a turf war with traditional credit card companies as the race to establish a widely used digital wallet heats up and friendly partnerships take on a more competitive edge.At PayPal parent eBay’s analyst day on Thursday, analysts are likely to seek more details about fees MasterCard, and possibly Visa, plan to charge the online payment company for using their networks to process mobile payments in physical stores.“PayPal rides for free on the back of other business models,” said Chris McWilton, MasterCard’s president of US Markets at a conference this month. “I think they’ve got to be cautious that they don’t get too big and start making people wake up and say wait a minute, I’m actually losing business here because of your moving into the physical space.”Ebay’s stock has fallen slightly in recent weeks over concerns about the fees, hitting a low of $50.11, after rallying steadily for the whole of last year.PayPal formed several partnerships with physical retailers last year, including Home Depot and Toys R Us, who agreed to accept PayPal digital wallet payments at their in-store registers – shoppers wave their phones over the register and the purchase amount is deducted from their PayPal account. In a January earnings call, John Donahoe, chief executive of eBay, said the company would focus this year on consumer outreach.Several other companies have been pushing to build their own digital wallet for consumers, and offer in-store point of sale systems for merchants to accept such payments. Google, Intuit and Square, a San Francisco start-up, have all been racing with PayPal to become the go-to product.Four out of five large and national retailers indicated mobility as a top store system priority in 2013, with about 50 per cent planning to install some form of tablet or handheld system for sales associates by the end of the year, according to Barclay’s research.Now that the technology is gaining traction, MasterCard said in a February regulatory filing that it would start to charge PayPal, and other digital wallet operators, a fee for using its networks.Last week, Charlie Scharf, chief executive of Visa, suggested his company might follow suit.“Some of the people we compete with started out as one thing and they morph into another thing,” he said at the Barclay’s Emerging Payments Forum. “And if they changed enough that we think it warrants us to change something with us, we will do that.”Analysts are hoping PayPal will reveal at its analyst meeting more details about the size of the new fee MasterCard is charging and indicate how margins will be impacted by such fees, especially if other credit card companies implement them.Analysts at Nowak Equity Research predict such fees will have minimal impact on eBay’s overall earnings per share, just about 1 per cent in 2014.“The runway for growth in payments is long,” they said in a report. “Competition is likely to remain fierce, but we believe there’s room for PayPal to serve as the fifth network.”
161;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Myanmar: credit card market hots up;;"In Myanmar, southeast Asia’s latest golden investment opportunity, being in first wins headlines for foreign companies, as Coca-Cola and Standard Chartered have recently shown.But as payment networks MasterCard and Visa have discovered, it doesn’t guarantee a lead over the competition.For the growing number of repeat visitors to Myanmar, including business people, foreign government officials and aid workers, the tedium of carrying massive wads of cash is the price of doing business in Myanmar. Not only that, but under unspoken rules observed by nearly all hotels, shops and businesses, the cash must be pristine US dollars.Running out of dollars always used to mean getting stranded, but since the government allowed the entry of foreign credit card issuers in November, the economy, at least for visitors, has opened, albeit tentatively, to card transactions and ATM machines. With the next step – enabling credit card issuance – just around the corner, the market for credit and debit cards has already become highly competitive.MasterCard, the number two payments network in the US, was the first to notch up an ATM transaction in Myanmar last November and since then has dispensed over $1.7m to foreigners, according to local media. As it completed its first ceremonial card payment at an airline on March 4, the company announced that it would increase the number of ATMs available to foreign card holders. By the end of 2013, it promises to enable card payments at over 500 restaurants, hotels and shops in four cities.But while MasterCard was early into Myanmar, it is no longer alone – or even ahead.China UnionPay, a 10-year-old credit and debit card group set up by China’s government, is now bigger globally than Visa and MasterCard by number of cards issued – 2.9bn by the end of 2011, 45 per cent of the world’s total. The company began offering payment services to foreigners in Myanmar in February, and already allows its cardholders to access 198 ATMs and 465 point-of-sale terminals.While MasterCard has arranged deals with individual banks to provide access to ATMs, CUP has negotiated a similar deal with the Myanmar Payment Union, an organisation of 17 local member banks which opened in September 2011. Myanmar is just the latest battle ground between the global card issuers.In Myanmar, Visa has taken a similar tack to MasterCard, signing its first licensing agreements with three banks in November and performing country’s first ever international card transaction in January, while competitor Japanese Credit Bureau also negotiated contracts with MPU member banks to supply branded credit cards to customers. Visa is shortly expected to announce several more partnerships with Myanmar banks which will expand its network to allow customers to use their cards in more places.To date, deals between local banks and card companies have mainly focused on visiting foreigners. Card companies are waiting on permission to issue credit cards in the country, and say it could be a matter of weeks. While Myanmar citizens are entitled to open bank accounts, the take-up has been low, partly due to deep-seated mistrust of banks following bank scandals and collapses in the early 2000s and the continuing lack of deposit insurance.Efforts by local banks to win back customers received a setback earlier this year amid rumours – eventually proven unfounded – that the chairman of Kanbawza Bank, one of the country’s largest banks, had been arrested. The damage was done by early reports, resulting in a run on the bank that led to the withdrawal of $10.5m in October last year.Despite these difficulties, private domestic banks have begun offering letters of credit to businesses and international banks have begun moving in. As Myanmar welcomes record numbers of visitors – over 1m in 2012 – and more foreign companies and hotels set up, the competition among payment networks will only intensify. But credit card companies know that their future in the domestic market also depends on the revival of consumer confidence in the banks – something which takes years to build and days to destroy.Related reading:

162;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-02-26T16:41:24Z;Visa and Samsung in mobile payments deal;;Visa and Samsung have announced an agreement designed to make it easier for smartphone users to use their devices to make mobile payments, and accelerate the adoption of NFC ‘tap-and-pay’ technology.NFC (near field communications) technology and mobile payments have emerged as one the key themes of the Mobile World Congress taking place in Barcelona, Spain this week.Earlier this week MasterCard launched MasterPass, an enhanced version of its mobile wallet PayPass, but the Visa Samsung global alliance is a first of its kind between a leading NFC handset manufacturer and payment network, paving the way for the implementation of large scale mobile payment programs.Smartphone makers and mobile operators believe that NFC technology could help spur adoption of smartphones by consumers and help consolidate the network operators’ position at the centre the emerging mobile e-commerce market.However, even though many new smartphones, including Samsung’s popular Galaxy family of devices, have NFC chips built into them, the technology has been slow to take off in most markets because of consumer confusion and the lack of a co-ordinated strategy involving handset makers, mobile network operators and financial institutions.Under the terms of the agreement announced in Barcelona, Samsung will preload Visa’s pay Wave application on to its NFC-enabled handsets. That will make it much easier for consumers and financial institutions to link their new handsets to their bank accounts.“The key to making mobile payments broadly available all over the world is to offer financial institutions a secure way to provision millions of smartphones with payment account information” said Jim McCarthy, global head of product, Visa.Won-Pyo Hong, head of Samsung’s Media Solution Center, added: “The partnership with Visa represents a step towards a global mobile payment platform. We believe that we have a strong value proposition for financial institutions that will ultimately allow consumer choice in NFC payments.”Visa claims that contactless payments have quadrupled over last year and now generate around 13m transactions per month, while ABI Research forecasts that a total of 1.95 billion NFC-enabled devices will ship in 2017.“This is a significant agreement that could give NFC a much-needed boost, given that Visa is a trusted payment brand, while Samsung is the top smartphone manufacturer in terms of shipments and a driving force behind the increasingly popular Android device platform,” said Eden Zoller, consumer analyst, at Ovum, the telecoms research firm.“Both Samsung and Visa are committed to NFC and we would expect them to put effort and marketing muscle behind making consumers aware of the potential benefits that NFC payments can bring. This is desperately needed as for most consumers, mobile payments – let alone NFC – are simply not on their radar.”
163;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard moves into mobile payments;;MasterCard unveiled its long-awaited foray into the mobile payments market at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday.MasterPass, which will incorporate both a digital wallet for consumers and a mobile-friendly checkout for merchants online and in-store, signals a break from the US-based credit card company’s traditional branding.Although MasterCard has offered online payment services for years, these have revolved around its credit cards, with users having to fill out card numbers, expiry dates and security codes – a process most consumers are reluctant to carry out on their phones.Jorn Lambert of MasterCard Worldwide said the service would be available to consumers through financial institutions in Australia and Canada by the end of March, and in the US and UK in spring and summer respectively.“We are working with our partners to make sure everything hits at the same time. We don’t want people to register for wallets before they can actually use it,” he said.Launch partners will include UK high-street retailers Argos and Boots, and American Airlines in the US. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Citi, Swedbank, UniCredit and Westpac have all signed up to support the service.Mobile payments are a hot topic at the Mobile World Congress this year. Although the number of retail apps has exploded, revenues have yet to match the hype. Most retailers build their own payment systems, forcing consumers to register and enter their payment details separately.MasterPass includes a digital wallet – in effect an app – that allows consumers to keep all their payment and loyalty card details as well as shipping addresses on their phone. MasterCard says this will accept cards and payment systems from competitors.The second, more crucial, element of MasterPass is digital checkout services for merchants. This will appear online as a MasterPass payment option – much like Visa, MasterCard and PayPal do now – or as a barcode-like QR code on items in stores, which customers can scan and pay for instantly.Mr Lambert said the strength of the new platform was that it could incorporate services such as loyalty discounts, based on location or purchase history.“The great thing about the phone is it’s an interactive device – let’s make sure we take full advantage of that and not just do what a plastic card can do. If a retailer wants to offer discounts or loyalty points as part of the transaction, that can happen.”The company says it expects all vendors who accept MasterCard to adopt the new system within two years.“There is no website today that doesn’t accept MasterCard and there will be no website that does not accept MasterPass in a while,” Mr Lambert said.MasterCard faces plenty of competition in mobile payments, with Visa expected to make further announcements about V.me, its upcoming digital wallet service, this week.In the UK last week, PayPal launched a cheap card-payment product for mobile merchants that will increase its presence, and other services such as Square in the US and iZettle in Europe are also targeting the sector. Google and Apple have both launched digital wallet products.Mobile payments have also been seen as a source of revenues for mobile operators, whose returns have so far failed to match the huge investments in infrastructure required to service the mobile internet.Mr Lambert said that although he welcomed moves by competitors – some of whom already accept MasterCard through their systems – merchants were unlikely to support many platforms.“In the physical world you can have three [payment systems] max,” he said. “Online you will have a few more, but I see a convergence towards a few brands that offer interoperability. You cannot have a website where you have MasterPass, V.me, Google Wallet, iTunes and several others.”
164;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa / MasterCard: cashed out;Driver of the gains has been move towards cashless society;When stockpickers dream, they dream of charts like those of Visa or MasterCard. The payment processors’ stocks have more than doubled since the start of 2011, in a beautiful steady climb. Sure, the shares were depressed back in 2010 – spending was weak in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and there was uncertainty about the part of Dodd Frank regulation that capped swipe fees on debit transactions. Spending has returned and the regulations have proven to be manageable, but the driver of the gains has been the move towards a cashless society.According to The Nilson Report, half of consumer payments in the US were done with cards in 2011, up from about 40 per cent in 2006. By 2016, over 60 per cent of payments are expected to be made with cards versus half that with cash, cheques, money orders and the like.But the thing about secular trends is that they eventually mature. This one still has room left, but most of the growth will come from outside the US, particularly in emerging markets. MasterCard estimates that 85 per cent of the world’s transactions are still done with paper. Both Visa and MasterCard are growing their presence in the developing world. And these companies will also prosper as global spending rises generally.There are threats. For a start regulators could crack down further on fees. And there is the risk of disintermediation, particularly in mobile payments. In the next phase of the shift away from cash – the move from paying with a piece of plastic to a phone – new entrants could try to change payment processing to capture, or in the case of merchants avoid, some of the fees.The incumbents have a key defence: banks, companies and consumers trust of their networks. That helps explain why both companies trade at multiples of more than 20 times this year’s earnings. At that level, the secular trend alone is not enough to ensure further outperformance. The economy has to co-operate, too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
165;MA;Mastercard Inc;2013-02-06T16:23:39Z;Kuwait considers bailout for consumer debt;;Kuwait is considering plans for a $6bn consumer debt write-off that would be the latest mass official bailout of Gulf citizens who have broken the region’s harsh debt laws and sometimes ended up in jail.Weeks after the United Arab Emirates released hundreds of debtors from prison, Kuwaiti ministers and the central bank are pushing back at proposals from a parliamentary committee to scrap interest payments equivalent to an average of $6,000 per Kuwaiti on all bank loans taken out by nationals between January 2002 and April 2008.The battle has reignited debate over how to control ever-climbing personal debt levels in the oil-rich Arabian peninsula. The indebtedness has left Gulf leaders in a bind, as they have to balance enforcement of their strict financial laws – including jail terms for bouncing cheques – against the need for the kind of benevolent gestures the citizenry expects from them in exchange for not challenging their right to rule.While Kuwait’s economic and finance committee has approved the interest cancellation initiative, it has triggered the same opposition from the government that derailed a similar plan in 2010. Mohammad Al-Hashel, the central bank chief, has estimated the write-off would cost 1.6bn dinars, while Mustafa Al Shimali, deputy prime minister and finance minister, has warned it would set a bad example to future borrowers.“Many people don’t know how to use the credit card,” said one long-time bank official in the UAE. “They treat it as free money.”The dispute underscores how Gulf customers’ traditionally strong appetite for loans has endured even the western financial crisis, with total consumer credit rising in the six countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council from $152.4bn in 2008 to an estimated $170.8bn last year, according to Lafferty Group, a financial research specialist.One bright spot for the region’s rulers – and consumers – is that credit card debt has bucked the wider trend, falling from $9.3bn to an estimated $7.4bn over the same period that total consumer credit rose, according to Lafferty Group. Debit card issuance is far outpacing credit card growth in the region, as authorities tighten lending rules in an effort to tame borrowers who over-reach themselves in part because they think they will never have to repay the money.Raghu Malhotra, Middle East and north Africa divisional president for MasterCard, said mass debit card issuance was now a “Gulf phenomenon”, with growth rates in double digits while the credit card’s once strong expansion flatlined.While some of the rise in debit card use is a natural evolution as the market becomes more sophisticated, enthusiasm also stems from the past bad experiences of some consumers, say bankers and customers.“People are using the credit card less,” said one Emirati bank worker, who added that she decided to pay off her own card after racking up hefty charges during a trip to Europe. “They say: ‘I have a bad history with [it] – and that’s a problem.’”Back in the UAE, another young Emirati professional flourished a debit card on which the personal data were all but faded away because she has owned it for so long. But she suggested her cautious approach to spending was still unusual in a society where, for all the nascent official efforts to curb indebtedness, the thirst for credit is still some way from being quenched.As she put it: “I don’t like Visa – I am different.”
166;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-12-12T18:28:08Z;Data scientists take byte out of Mad Men;;With its depiction of three-martini business lunches and a plot centred on the “creative types” who ruled the 1960s advertising world, the Mad Men television series defined the archetype of the industry. Not any more.A new generation of executives, armed with millions of terabytes of data, are taking over today’s advertising world. They are schooled in creating sophisticated automated systems for buying and selling ads, searching for patterns in the data to tell stories and tapping algorithms to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing.Take Becky Wang, whose first job in 1998 was at a financial technology firm on the cutting edge of building proprietary stock trading models that mapped the relationship between qualitative data, such as news reports or regulatory filings, to quantitative statistics, such as share price.Today Ms Wang, 35, leads a team of data scientists at Droga5, one of the hottest shops in the advertising industry, to mine information with the goal of uncovering insights about human behaviour and unlocking new creative ideas for ads, products and services.“All of the data that we are collecting is pushing us into entirely new directions,” she says. “We have really interesting and compelling conversations with our clients about new product developments, whereas before we were those kooky creatives.”Across the industry, advertisers are tapping big data in hopes of reaching marketing’s ultimate goal: targeting personalised ads to the right person at the right time.“There is a spectacular change occurring,” says Quentin George, chief innovations officer at Interpublic’s Mediabrands advertising buying group. “What big data is trying to do in the ad business is harvest consumer signals to deliver something more relevant and more meaningful.”Marketers have long mined consumer information – ranging from public records data about how much a person’s house is worth to surveys about whether they are married or have children – to send direct mailings and make telephone pitches to people most likely to buy their products. Even the “mad men” drew on panel-based research about the television shows people watched, the radio stations they listened to and the newspapers and magazines they read.Big data’s renewed heft in the advertising industry, however, came partly as a result of a concurrent disruption of the advertising business as smartphones spread and consumers digitised their lives.This not only unearthed a treasure trove of real-time data about individuals, but is also forcing the advertising and marketing industries into new ways of doing business.Marketers, eager to prove the return on investment of their ad dollars, suddenly could track the ads consumers saw and clicked on. They are discovering, for example, that nationwide US television advertising campaigns are failing to reach a large portion of their target audiences.The industry is, therefore, creating dossiers about individuals based on everything from the information revealed in online dating profiles to the pictures people posted to social networks, the items they put in their online shopping carts and the television programmes viewed on digital video recorders.These profiles are now the nexus around which an increasing part of the $518bn advertising industry operates. The rise of online ad exchanges, which operate much like stock trading platforms, means that marketers can now buy ads based on the profile of the person who sees the ad, rather than the site where it appears.Within the blink of an eye, marketers can evaluate the performance of an ad and alter the message, the way it looks or the audience targeted to see it. Most of the main advertising holding companies operate units to buy ads via these new programmatic ad-buying models and report that their clients are devoting an increasing share of their budgets to them.Marketers first tapped the model for buying online ads only but increasingly are deploying it to buy all advertising, from television to mobile phone ads.This emerging model of how ad buying works is built upon a foundation made up of a staggering amount of data. Interpublic’s Mediabrands ad buying group, for instance, sifts through trillions of messages each year, creating close to a petabyte, or 1m gigabytes, of information. For comparison, all the text of Wikipedia in all languages requires only about 100 gigabytes to store.Yet while the advertising industry is dazzled by the profusion of data and the possibilities it wields, many marketers struggle to sift through the information to track the most relevant details about consumers, let alone mine the data for insights and deploy sophisticated targeting models. Having to deal with too much information, and not all of it accurate, is a common complaint among ad executives. A recent survey of 120 top marketing executives, conducted by Publicis’ Razorfish digital ad agency, revealed that many businesses continue to deploy age-old strategies of tapping historical sales data instead of real-time information.“The business needs to catch up with the hype of the technology at this point,” says Ray Velez, global chief technology officer at Razorfish.Meanwhile, disputes rage within advertising agencies about whether data should be used to dictate the artistic and storytelling aspects of ad campaigns – sensibilities that traditionally were the territory of “big idea” creative types. Some argue a distance between creative departments and algorithms should remain to preserve a sense of serendipity.Even larger loom privacy issues, which threaten to limit the amount of consumer information marketers can track and use for ad targeting. This is becoming a bigger area of concern as companies marry information collected both online and away from a screen. MasterCard, for instance, recently started to make available an analysis of transaction data for ad targeting. Facebook, meanwhile, has worked with Datalogix, a data company, to track whether people buy products after seeing an ad on the social networking site.Some patent applications signal how much further marketers could go in the pursuit of futuristic ad targeting and personalisation. A Verizon patent application published in November details plans to create a digital video recorder that watches television viewers and listens to their conversations for ad targeting. A Visa patent application published in 2011 describes tapping information from DNA data banks.
167;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Rethink on access to personal records;;Customers will be able to demand their personal data records from banks, mobile phone companies and energy groups under legislation being considered by the government.The move comes against a backdrop of sharply rising energy bills and public concern about whether banks are offering competitive deals on mortgages and loans.A consultation begins on Monday into a law to force companies to release data relating to a customer’s transactions or consumption.Last year the business department and Whitehall’s so-called Behaviour Insights Team, who are trying to use “nudge” theory to change the way people make choices, initiated a scheme called “midata”.The scheme was designed to give consumers the right to ask companies for their personal data, but was voluntary. Only about 20 companies – including RBS, MasterCard, Google, British Gas and EDF Energy and Lloyds – signed up to the scheme.Ministers hope that by legislating against company non-compliance, the public will benefit by being able to use their own data to find the best deals available to them based on their spending and consumption patterns.Personal data has become an increasingly valuable asset to private companies, which have invested heavily in data analysis to target advertising based on the information.In 2010, a start up company in London called Allow offered to sell personal data to marketers on behalf of an individual, giving them a cut of the money made.The initiative comes as rising energy bills have become an increasingly political issue, with Labour and the coalition vying to come up with ways to force energy companies to show more restraint. Labour has vowed to legislate to put pensioners on the lowest tariffs while David Cameron, the prime minister, is trying to find a way to slash the number of tariffs to end confusion in the market.Richard Lloyd of Which? said the rules would help put consumers in the “driving seat of the information revolution”.But Richard Bates at Consumer Focus warned the scheme came with risks for consumers if their personal data are lost, leaked, misused or stolen. “Consumers will need a cast iron guarantee that their data are protected,” he said.
168;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-11-07T15:40:22Z;iZettle devices on sale in UK and Germany;;IZettle, the Swedish mobile payments start-up backed by MasterCard and American Express, has accelerated its expansion across Europe by launching its card-reading technology in Germany and the UK.Like its US rival Square, iZettle allows small businesses and sole traders – for example, plumbers, window cleaners and electricians – to accept payments using a card reader that plugs into mobile phones or tablets such as the iPad.Both Square and iZettle are betting that millions of small businesses across the US and Europe will adopt cheap, mobile card-reading technology to take payments on the move and reduce their reliance on cheques and cash.From today, iZettle’s card readers will go on sale in the UK for £20 each across 300 shops owned by mobile operator EE. Each card reader comes with a £20 voucher that can be used towards iZettle transaction fees.“Businesses and consumers are on the cusp of a mobile payment revolution, and we are delighted to bring iZettle to market,” said Gerry McQuade, chief marketing officer at EE, the UK’s largest telecoms group.Stockholm-based iZettle says it is already used by 75,000 small businesses and individuals across Europe, mainly in Scandinavia, where it launched in 2011.Last week, the company rolled out its payments service in Germany through a partnership with DZ Bank and Deutsche Telekom.IZettle has not revealed figures about its revenues or growth. However, Square, which is led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, claims to be processing $8bn in payments on an annualised basis and was valued at $3.25bn in its latest fundraising.While iZettle and Square both charge merchants a 2.75 per cent transaction fee on payments, there are key differences between the two companies.Most importantly, iZettle’s card readers are designed to accept chip cards, the standard format in Europe. By contrast, Square reads the magnetic stripe on cards, catering to the standard format in the US.Jacob de Geer, chief executive and co-founder of iZettle, said the volume of payments through the company’s card readers was rising “exponentially”.Mr de Geer said iZettle paid a unit cost of between $10 and $20 for its chip card readers and is able to recoup its costs if merchants each process more than “a couple of thousand euros” of payments through the devices. On average, he said, merchants process one payment a day through the device, with a typical value of €50.He added that the percentage of fraudulent payments through iZettle was just 5 basis points – several times lower than the industry average.
169;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;US consumer spending boosts card groups;Net income rises on international growth;Visa and MasterCard, the world’s largest payments networks, reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates on the back of a rise in US consumer spending.California-based Visa said fiscal fourth-quarter net income rose 89 per cent to $1.66bn, or $2.47 a share, from $880m, or $1.27 a year earlier. Profit per share, excluding one-time items, was $1.54, higher than the $1.50 estimate in a Bloomberg survey.MasterCard’s results were also upbeat, with third-quarter net income climbing 7.7 per cent to $772m, or $6.17 a share, up from $717m, or $5.63, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast earnings per share of $5.92.Both companies benefited from a 0.8 per cent rise in consumer spending in the US in September, which helped offset declines in global growth and concerns about the so-called fiscal cliff. Spending by US consumers accounts for more than half of Visa’s revenue and 40 per cent for MasterCard.Wednesday’s report will be Visa’s last before chief executive Joseph Saunders retires. Earlier this month, Visa named Charles Scharf, the former head of retail banking at JPMorgan Chase, as Mr Saunders’ successor.For the fiscal full-year, Visa’s service revenues were $4.9bn, up 14 per cent over the prior year as international transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border volume, grew 13 per cent to $3bn.Mr Saunders attributed Visa’s results to its focus on its core business and expansion outside of the US.Activity also picked up worldwide, with spending on MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards, adjusted for currency fluctuations, climbing 12 per cent to $676bn. Processed transactions rose 24 per cent to 8.7bn.“MasterCard continues to drive solid financial performance and focus on executing key deals, investments and partnerships,” said Ajay Banga, chief executive.“ Emerging geographies and governments continue to provide great opportunities for growth,” he said.The company continued with a stock buyback programme, spending $216m to buy 500,000 shares during the quarter. MasterCard also bought back an additional 255,000 shares this month for $119m and still has $1.1bn left to spend under a $1.5bn repurchase programme.For the nine months ended September 30, MasterCard reported net income of $2.2bn, or $17.18 per diluted share, excluding a special item taken in the second quarter.MasterCard and Visa this year put an end to a lengthy legal battle with US retailers by agreeing to a settlement of at least $6bn. The US merchants had accused the payment networks of fixing the level of fees retailers must pay every time consumers use cards for purchases.MasterCard has said its share of the settlement would cost $790m, while that of Visa was about $4.4bn.MasterCard’s shares have risen 22 per cent this year and Visa has gained 37 per cent, outpacing gains in the S&P 500 and a 13 per cent rise for the S&P 500 information technology group, which tracks the performance of 70 companies.MasterCard shares rose 0.7 per cent to $456 after the report and Visa traded 1.5 per cent higher to $140.85 in extended trading hours.

MasterCard said it was “committed to protecting individual privacy”.Regulators are increasing their scrutiny of digital privacy issues. On Tuesday, EU privacy commissioners called for Google to substantially change a controversial privacy policy or risk paying fines. The policy allows Google to deploy users’ information across a wide range of services.Internet and advertising groups, meanwhile, are in the midst of a contentious debate over the implementation of a “Do Not Track” preference in web browsers that would let consumers signal their interest not to be tracked or targeted with tailored adverts. The fight over voluntary standards threatens to deter its adoption.The US Senate Commerce Committee recently launched an investigation into the practices of nine consumer data brokers. “The digital footprint [that consumers] will inevitably leave behind will become more specific and potentially damaging, if used improperly,” John Rockefeller, chairman of the committee, wrote in a letter to one large data broker.
171;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-10-17T14:10:06Z;MasterCard mines data for marketers;;MasterCard is analysing transaction data to help marketers direct targeted advertising at consumers, after launching a controversial initiative to make money from its vast database of retail purchases.This year the credit card network, which processes 34bn purchases each year, began to help marketers target customers who are more likely to buy their products and services.MasterCard first explored the possibility of using customer data for targeted advertising last year, but delayed those plans because of legal and regulatory concerns over how financial services companies use the customer data they have collected.According to an online sales pitch titled “Leveraging MasterCard Data Insights to Reach Holiday Shoppers”, MasterCard analyses billions of transactions – noting, for example, which consumers are more likely to purchase consumer electronics or luxury goods. “The foundation of all of our solutions is transaction data,” Susan Grossman, MasterCard’s senior vice-president of media solutions, said during the pitch, which has been viewed by the Financial Times.MasterCard, which confirmed that it launched the initiative in February, told the FT it was “committed to protecting individual privacy”. It said the information it sells to marketers is anonymous and is aggregated into groups of potential customers – rather than broken out individually.The company said the transaction information it collects includes credit card numbers – which it does not share with advertisers – but not cardholders’ names or other personal details.MasterCard said that the product is US-based, and transaction data from cardholders outside of the US is not being used.As people spend more time in front of computers and mobile phones, companies are amassing vast profiles about people’s activities both online and away from a screen. Facebook, for example, is working with Datalogix, a data company, to track whether people buy products after viewing an ad on the social networking site.Other credit card companies have explored using data for marketing. Visa sells retailers the ability to send text messages to consumers based on their previous credit card transactions – but those targeted agree to receive the ads in return for discounts and other incentives. American Express also conducts custom research for marketers based on aggregated, anonymous credit-card transaction data.The fast-growing industry is raising concern among federal regulators and policy makers. Last week the US Senate Commerce Committee launched an investigation into the practices of nine consumer data brokers. In March the US Federal Trade Commission advocated for legislation to “address the invisibility of, and consumers’ lack of control over, data brokers’ collection and use of consumer information”.“The digital footprint [consumers] will inevitably leave behind will become more specific and potentially damaging, if used improperly,” John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, wrote in a letter to one large data broker.
172;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Battle on digital privacy policy heats up;;The battle over digital privacy is reaching a boiling point.At the centre of the debate is the implementation of a so-called “Do Not Track” preference in web browsers that would allow consumers to signal their desire not to be tracked or targeted with personalised ads as they surf the internet. Industry groups are fighting over voluntary standards for its adoption, threatening to grind its implementation to a halt.Lawmakers and regulators, meanwhile, are questioning whether self-regulation provides strong enough privacy protection and are stepping up their scrutiny over the fast-growing business of profiling consumers and selling data about their lives.“I worry that if you don’t have a process and an agreement, at the end of the day, you are going to have an arms race with privacy. That will not be helpful to the internet ecosystem,” Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission told the Financial Times. “[Advertisers] might be killing the goose that lays the golden egg.”One indication of regulators’ increasing concern over online privacy came on Tuesday when EU privacy commissioners called for Google to substantially change a controversial privacy policy, which allows it to deploy users’ information across a wider range of services, or risk substantial fines.Yet even as the regulatory battles brew, data brokers are continuing to create ever more robust profiles about individuals based on information collected both online and in the brick-and-mortar world.Those dossiers include information ranging from online searches and website visits to the products people buy at drug stores, their voting records and income and ability to pay financial obligations. In the latest development, MasterCard is selling advertisers the ability to use information based on credit card transactions to target ads and measure their performance.“The industry can no longer claim it is innocuous, business as usual,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington-based privacy advocacy group. “The reams of online and offline data being compiled today is an aspect that the industry would prefer not to talk about, but it is going to come out sooner or later.”That day should come soon. The US Senate Commerce Committee last week set in motion an investigation into the practices of nine major consumer data brokers. By November 2, the companies are expected to respond to a detailed query into what consumer data the companies collect, the specificity of the data, how the information is collected, who buys it and how it is used.“Because consumers are now able to conduct nearly all of their daily business online, an unprecedented amount of personal, medical and financial information about them can be mined, collected and sold,” John Rockefeller, chairman of the senate commerce committee, wrote in a letter to Acxiom, one large data broker.Scott Howe, the chief executive of Acxiom, said the company “looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to help the members gain a deeper understanding of Acxiom’s business and how people and the economy benefit from the appropriate use of data”.Sen Rockefeller last year introduced the Do-Not-Track Online Act, which would create a legal obligation for companies to comply with do-not-track requests, meaning advertisers would not collect information about users or target them with personalised ads, often called behavioural advertising.Lawmakers and the FTC have also encouraged industry groups to develop voluntary standards in addition to other self-regulatory privacy principles already in place. Industry groups pledged implementation by the end of the year.But the adoption has stalled. At a meeting of the World Wide Web Consortium over the global adoption of such standards, the head of a marketing trade group sparked controversy by requesting that marketing be included as an exception for why companies could ignore the do-not-track preference.Microsoft, meanwhile, is drawing harsh criticism from the advertising business because of its plans to automatically install a do-not-track feature in the latest version of its web browser. Last week, the Digital Advertising Alliance, a consortium of advertising and media industry trade groups that together include more than 5,000 companies, said its members should ignore the Microsoft do-not-track browser setting because it is set by the manufacturer rather than the consumer.The news drew scrutiny from lawmakers, who threatened that stronger laws are needed to protect consumer privacy. Joe Barton and Edward Markey, US representatives, said in a statement: “The Digital Advertising Alliance’s announcement made clear that it puts profits over privacy.”
173;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Fawry draws a line for Egypt’s unbanked;;"If you are a well-off Egyptian and you need to pay a household bill, you hand over the cash to your driver, office messenger or house porter and send them to queue and pay it on your behalf.Those not privileged enough to have people they can send on errands – that is, most Egyptians – have to do it themselves every month. To make life easier, utilities send cash collectors to customers (electricity companies dispatch 28m hand-carried bills every month). Often the client is not at home, or does not have the amount required at hand. The collector is then supposed to come back another day.It is in this environment, dominated by cumbersome cash transactions, that Egypt’s first electronic bill payment service, Fawry, was launched in 2010. Its aim was to tap a billing market that had barely been dented by the introduction of credit cards and online methods of payment.“The problem in Egypt is that companies which have bank accounts sell services to people with no bank accounts,” says Ashraf Sabry, chief executive and a founder of Fawry. Among its owners are the technology development fund; a public-private partnership, Raya; a local technology company; and a group of banks including HSBC. “You could say the sellers are at the top of a pyramid and the buyers at the bottom. We connect them.”According to research cited by Mr Sabry, $10bn in cash is paid every year by consumers for services such as mobile and fixed line communications, electricity, water, personal loans, insurance and education.Only 1.5 per cent of household consumption is paid electronically. Banking penetration is low, estimated at 10 per cent of a population of 85m. The use of plastic is minimal. Of 13m cards in circulation, the vast majority are debit cards used, once a month, to withdraw their holders’ salaries from ATMs. The money is kept at home to use for cash purchases. So even those who have accounts have a shallow relationship with banks, says Mr Sabry.In the past two years Fawry has introduced various “channels” to facilitate bill settlement, levying a “convenience fee” on bill payers and a “collection fee” for billing companies.It has teamed up with MasterCard to launch an online payments portal, and 12 banks (representing 80 per cent of Egypt’s banking capacity) offer its services through their ATMs, over the counter, or on their websites.For the majority of the population, who have never touched a keyboard or stepped through the doors of a bank, Fawry offers bill payment at the corner store. It has a growing network of collection points at small grocers, stationers and chemists, which are equipped with point-of-sale machines – the same ones used for credit card payments. Fawry’s services are available at 16,000 retailers and 1,300 post offices, advertised by its bright blue and yellow logo.To minimise risk, shops where the services are available buy credit in advance from Fawry before they collect any money from the public, earning a cut from the fees.Mr Sabry says transactions have quadrupled in the past year and the volume of money collected has tripled. In August the company clocked 12m transactions and collected $30m. By the end of 2012, $330m will have been collected.Fawry, which employs 250 people, is expected to start making profits next year.The company receives payments on behalf of all Egypt’s phone companies, fixed-line and mobile, and the big internet providers. So far 70-80 per cent of its business is in the telecoms sector. However, other clients include electricity distributors, banks, charities, airlines and e-commerce websites.Mr Sabry points out proudly that the software underpinning Fawry’s complicated system linking clients, billers and banks is Egyptian and designed in-house. “When we started we looked at payments systems in countries like Turkey and South Africa,” he says. “The South African example bore a closer resemblance to conditions in Egypt, but they had to no appetite for collaboration, so we ended up building our own model.”He points out that Fawry is contributing to the expansion of banking services by placing machines that accept credit cards in shops that the card companies overlook because of the small potential take.Magdy Hassan, MasterCard vice-president and manager for Egypt, says that his brand of card is accepted by more than 30,000 retailers in Egypt and, by sharing Fawry’s infrastructure, the group is adding a further 10,000.“Acceptance is critical to us and we have been keen to develop solutions to expand the acceptance footprint,” he says. “The alliance with Fawry helps this by adding segments that were not accessible before. It is a typical fit with our strategy for penetrating the unbanked segment.”"
174;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-09-30T21:07:36Z;Powa in card reader deal with SA bank;;A British challenger to Square, the system that enables credit card payments with a smartphone, has signed its first large multimillion pound deal with one of South Africa’s biggest banks.First National Bank, the retail and corporate division of First Rand, one of the country’s big four banks, will use Powa Technologies’ card reader and software to replace its existing payment infrastructure for an annual fee.While Square, created by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and valued at $3.25bn, sells to small traders new to using cards, Powa’s product, called mPowa, targets existing users through banks and retailers.Dan Wagner, chief executive of Powa, said banks and mobile telephone companies were looking for a way to allow mobile payments while retaining control.His system, which unlike Square works with cards that use a Chip and PIN, is compliant with Level One PCI, the highest security standard.“I take the view that Visa and MasterCard are not going away,” he said. “Google will not be my provider of credit.”“We are a white label solution. Square is a closed system, we are Android,” he added, referring to the ability of anyone to write software for the operating system created by Google.Mr Wagner, a technology entrepreneur who has spent around £8m of his own money developing the product, said it was negotiating with 15 brands, including at least one British bank. Powa already runs ecommerce websites for many stores.He has already attracted the ire of Square, whose lawyers in June sent a letter asking him to stop using an image of a hand holding the card reader similar to Square’s publicity shot.As well as a dongle that plugs into a phone, he produces a chip reader that connects via Bluetooth to send a receipt by text or email to the cardholder’s phone.Users enter their pin as with existing systems. Mr Wagner said it could be used by those with mobile sales forces, such as the AA or Avon, the cosmetics company.Informa, the business information group, uses mPowa to take payment at trade shows.In September, Square closed a $200m fundraising and takes $8bn of payments annually.A 0.25 per cent fee per transaction is levied by mPowa on top of what the card services provider charges, usually around 2.5 per cent.FNB operates in six southern African countries and is about to enter Angola, Ghana and Nigeria. The company, which had sales in 2011 of R25.8bn and 7.1m customers in South Africa, declined to comment.
175;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Apple snubs key NFC mobile payment method;;Apple’s decision to exclude a near field communications (NFC) chip from its new iPhone handset will threaten the adoption of contactless mobile payment systems, analysts have warned.NFC is being promoted as the payment method of the future, with Visa, MasterCard and Google – as well as mobile phone manufacturers Samsung and Nokia – making substantial commitments to the technology.But, following the iPhone launch, Tudor Aw, KPMG’s European Head of Technology, said that Apple’s snub could hold back the adoption of NFC.“It had been hoped that Apple would turn its famous ability to deliver new technology through great user experience to kick-start the widespread adoption of mobile payments by consumers,” he said. “The interesting question is whether this omission will mean further delay in mobile payments taking off – or if it presents an opportunity for its competitors to take a lead in this field.”Instead of NFC, Apple’s iPhone offers the ‘Passbook’, where users can store electronic coupons, vouchers and even airline tickets. They can make payments using a barcode displayed on the phone’s screen.Widely reported comments from Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, suggest Apple still sees NFC as a technology in search of a problem and that it believes Passbook fulfils most users’ needs.However, some industry observers believe Apple may still include NFC in future phones.“The reality is that we’re still two to three years away from mass adoption of mobile payments and, with so many companies jostling for attention in this space, it’s likely Apple will wait another 12 months before including NFC in iPhone technology,” said James Richards, vice-president of mobile at Intelligent Environments, the digital banking company.NFC technology developers insist Apple’s snub will not stop wider adoption of the technology.“NFC is going to progress at a pace without Apple – this could be Apple’s loss,” said Miles Quitmann, managing director of Proxama, a company that offers NFC wallet technology.Aside from NFC, the other significant hardware omission was the lack of support for the microUSB connector standard backed by the EU and the GSMA, the European-based mobile phone trade group.MicroUSB is already used by Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Research In Motion and Nokia for charging their handsets and for exchanging data with other devices.But Apple has introduced a new proprietary connector called ‘Lightning’ with the iPhone 5. In a minor concession to the EU and GSMA lobby, however, it has agreed to sell a Lightening-to-microUSB adaptor in its European stores. The adapter will cost £15 in the UK (€19).
176;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-09-07T11:23:29Z;Indonesia credit cards: going solo;;"After restrictions on foreign banks, foreign mining companies and foreign fruit and vegetables, the latest protectionist push in Indonesia is focused on credit card payment systems.Bank Indonesia, the central bank, and a number of major state-owned banks are trying to breathe new life into an old proposal to develop a national credit card payment system to break the dominance of MasterCard and Visa, as has been done in China with UnionPay.Y F Sri Suparni, BI’s director for payment systems, told local journalists at a briefing this week that discussions on the plan had become “more intensive” recently.Although there are still only around 7m credit card holders and 15m credit cards in this nation of 240m people, the numbers are growing by around 7 – 8 per cent a year as the large middle-class continues to expand.Credit card sales, which average around Rp1,700bn ($178m) per month, are growing at 12-13 per cent a year, according to Dodit Probojakti, who manages the credit card division at state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia, Indonesia’s fourth-biggest bank by assets.While this growth is steady rather than spectacular, bankers believe the number of card users is likely to take off in the coming years as credit cards become more widely used and more and more people shop online.With more than 90 per cent of credit card transactions in Indonesia involving two domestic parties, local banks, backed by the central bank, want to grab a bigger slice of the rapidly expanding fee income that Visa and MasterCard earn.“I think its time for state-owned banks to start thinking in that direction and BI has asked us to drive this,” Probojakti told beyondbrics. “It will drive the cost down because we can negotiate with Visa and MasterCard to have a better pricing structure or we can create our own.”Another senior banker in Jakarta said that BI’s plan was not just about economic nationalism but was part of a bigger global shift by emerging market governments keen to keep financial data and transactions onshore.“Following the 2007-08 global financial crisis, regulators and national governments are much more concerned about the safety of payment systems, banking systems and information,” he said.Creating a trusted nationwide payment system is costly and complicated but Indonesia’s Bank Central Asia already has its own extensive closed loop system.“It’s technically possible and it is likely to take a long time but this will be worrying for Visa and MasterCard,” said the senior banker. “It’s a challenge to their dominance.”Visa and MasterCard both said they were open to discussing collaboration with the Indonesian authorities and that they were happy to compete on a “level playing-field”.The problem for the credit card giants is that Indonesian officials, with an eye on national elections in 2014, are increasingly talking about tilting the playing field toward domestic companies.Still, Visa and MasterCard can take some comfort from the fact that while Indonesian officials like to issue proposals about many things, from building a national car to creating a unified time zone, they are not so good at implementing them.Related reading

177;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-09-05T22:23:54Z;MasterCard sets pact to enter Myanmar;;MasterCard Worldwide has become the first international payments network to grant a licence to a Myanmar bank, paving the way for issuance and acceptance of branded credit and debit cards in the country.The move follows an agreement last month by Visa, MasterCard’s rival, to train selected local banks to use electronic-payments systems as a first step towards a similar, but yet to be finalised, deal to license local banks for card issuance. China UnionPay and Japan Credit Bureau are among other financial services firms negotiating with local banks to bring in branded cards.International sanctions against Myanmar and domestic restrictions on currency exchange and other transactions have prevented the use of credit card facilities and international ATM networks for decades in Myanmar. The result has caused problems for tourists and business travellers alike. Since the easing of most sanctions earlier this year, financial services firms have been negotiating with banks on a vast range of services and products.A new foreign investment law, which is expected to facilitate the entry of foreign business to Myanmar, has been bogged down in parliament, frustrating many would-be investors.On the financial front, new laws will have to be enacted to open up the banking sector. However, domestic banks have already received approval to move forward with some aspects of liberalisation, including on foreign exchange, letters of credit and other international transactions, while more than 14 foreign banks have gained permission to open representative offices.MasterCard’s licence agreement with Myanmar’s Co-Operative Bank, one of the country’s 19 private commercial banks, will see the issuance of MasterCard branded cards and the acceptance of MasterCard/Maestro/Cirrus cards by a new network of automated teller machines.ATMs were only introduced in Myanmar earlier this year and the system is still in its infancy, with a total of about 82 ATMs throughout Myanmar. Co-Operative Bank claims the biggest ATM network in the country with 24 machines. Foreign cards are still not acceptedIssuing the licence is the first crucial step in the process of building up credit card acceptance in Myanmar, a MasterCard spokesman said. While Co-Operative Bank would ultimately determine the timing, “in our experience, the first MasterCard branded cards can be issued anywhere from three to 12 months after the licence has been issued”, he said.International financial institutions have forecast that Myanmar’s economy will expand by 5.2-6 per cent in 2012-13, while tourism industry projections suggest tourist arrivals could increase in 2012 by 40- 50 per cent from last year.Already, 2011 saw a record 816,369 tourism arrivals in Myanmar, almost double the 2003 level and up from 791,505 in 2010, according to official figures. In the first four months of 2012, the country received nearly 130,000 foreign visitors, a 36 per cent increase from the same period last year.The tourism industry is set for further gains next year when Myanmar hosts the Southeast Asian Games and a regional World Economic Forum meeting, and in 2014 when the country becomes chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.The issuing and acceptance of branded cards in the country will inevitably “have a huge impact on tourism and travel, and will bring more of Myanmar’s citizens into the financial system”, said Vicky Bindra, MasterCard Worldwide’s president for Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa. “Electronic payments will also be crucial in helping Myanmar connect to the global economy.”
178;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-08-26T21:33:55Z;TV ad campaigns fail to reach audiences;;Nationwide US television advertising campaigns are failing to reach a large portion of their target audiences, according to new research based on TV viewing data.Using figures from Nielsen and Kantar Media, ad targeting company Simulmedia has found that in many cases as many as three-quarters of marketers’ TV ad impressions are viewed by just 20 per cent of their target audiences.According to its report, Unilever’s $6.3m TV ad campaign for its Axe body spray was not seen by 60 per cent of the 18 to 24-year-olds it was intended to reach in March this year.Similarly, Progressive Insurance spent $31.9m on television ads in June, but a fifth of all adults older than 20 did not watch any of its TV ads that month. Similar patterns were observed during ad campaigns run by several of the largest advertisers in the US.In spite of the fragmentation of audiences across new media, TV ad spending remains the bulk of many companies’ marketing budgets.US advertisers are expected to allocate 42.2 per cent of their total spending – $64bn – to TV ads this year, an increase on the 39 per cent share five years ago, according to WPP’s GroupM.But the new research provides further evidence of the long- suspected shortcomings of TV as a medium for reaching broad audiences – which is likely to have ramifications for budget allocations across the media business.“When you are sitting fat and happy, there is not a lot of impetus to make a change,” said David Cohen, global chief media officer at Interpublic’s Universal McCann, whose clients include Coca-Cola, MasterCard, Sony and Microsoft.“But I am fairly certain that whether we like it or not, the horse is out of the stable.”Wenda Millard, president at consultancy MediaLink, which works with advertising companies and marketers, including Simulmedia, said: “TV advertising always has been spray and pray. Because we couldn’t do anything about it, we used to laugh.“Now that joke is long over. It’s not funny to waste billions and billions of dollars.”Unilever did not respond to requests for comment, and Progressive declined to comment.

Shares plummeted 32.8 per cent to $6.94.The S&P 500 struggled higher as the day opened but fell as much as 0.5 per cent before paring back some of its losses. The benchmark index closed 0.3 per cent down at 1,375.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.3 per cent lower at 12,977.13, while the Nasdaq dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,920.21.Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, noted that many observers were already expecting the Fed to take action next month rather than in August because the most important issues facing markets remained in Europe.Market commentator Mike Ingram of BGC Partners also continued to focus on European monetary policy, noting: “Supportive statements from the leaders of France and Germany have helped to maintain the momentum and create the expectation that we are about to see some game-changing move in the ongoing eurozone crisis saga.”No single sector dominated on Wednesday as trading patterns fluctuated throughout the day. By the market’s close, nine out of 10 sectors on Wall Street were in negative territory.In healthcare, Humana rallied 4.8 per cent to $63.91. The shares traded at an all-time low on Tuesday after the US health insurance company lowered its full-year outlook.In materials, DuPont, one of the world’s largest chemical companies, saw its shares rally in the morning session after it was reported that Monsanto’s $1bn suit over patent infringement would go to a jury. However, the stock gave up most of the gains to close 0.5 per cent higher to $49.94,United States Steel added 4.6 per cent to $21.61 while Dow Chemical rose 1.8 per cent to $29.30.One of Wall Street’s best performers on Wednesday was Frontier Communications, whose shares rose 10.7 per cent to $4.34. The phone and internet provider to consumers and businesses in rural and small towns beat analysts’ earnings estimates.The telecoms sector continues to be Wall Street’s strongest performing sector, with the S&P telecom index gaining 20 per cent in the year to date.Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, rose 3 per cent to $33.55 after reporting a 6 per cent increase to $9.9bn in cable revenue over the second quarter. The largest US cable network by market capitalisation has gained more than 40 per cent since the beginning of the year.Direct rival Time Warner, which owns television networks such as HBO, reversed earlier losses to rise 1.2 per cent to $39.60, despite missing earnings estimates.The automotive sector was also in the spotlight as carmaker GM is due to release earnings on Thursday. GM shares traded 0.2 per cent higher at $19.66, while rival Ford lost 2.2 per cent to $9.04.The industry was buoyed by strong second-quarter sales news from Chrysler, which saw a 13 per cent rise in sales in July, its best performance in that month in the past five years.GM and Ford, however, did not fare as well over the month, reporting a 6 per cent and a 4 per cent drop in US fleet purchases, respectively.In other earnings news, Harley-Davidson shares fell 3.6 per cent to $41.67 after reporting better than expected earnings, but the group lowered its outlook for the year’s second half.There was grim news from MasterCard, which saw its shares decrease by 2.2 per cent to $427.20 after it reported worse than expected net revenues and it issued a warning of a worldwide slowdown in consumption.In technology, Facebook and Zynga continued to hit record lows. Shares in the social networking site fell 3.8 per cent to $20.00, while the games manufacturer slid 4.8 per cent to $2.81.Bank stocks were mixed. Bank of America closed 1.6 per cent lower at $7.22, Wells Fargo added 0.3 per cent to $33.90 and JPMorgan Chase was unchanged at $36.00.
180;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-08-01T15:56:37Z;MasterCard warns on consumption slowdown;;MasterCard, the payment processing network, reported worse than expected net revenues for the second quarter and warned that a slowdown in consumption around the world would likely impact its full-year sales.Ajay Banga, chief executive, added that US retail sales growth was likely to continue slowing as consumer confidence remained weak and the effects of lower gas prices had not set in on spending habits.The company said net revenues for the three months to June 30 were $1.8bn, slightly below analysts’ forecasts and 9.1 per cent better than the same period a year ago.Net income rose 15.1 per cent to $700m, ahead of expectations, but was hit by a previously disclosed pre-tax charge of $20m related to a US court settlement with retailers over allegations of fee fixing for credit and debit cards.The company said earnings per share were $5.55, an improvement of 16.5 per cent for a year ago.MasterCard said it now expected the pace of full-year revenue growth would be “somewhat lower” than levels from the first-half of the year, blaming global economic uncertainty.Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer, added that July data and the second-quarter results revealed the continued headwinds from the global economy, which could temper both consumer and business spending for rest of the year.But analysts warned that the company was spending too much on rewarding existing customers and using rebates to bring in new business. As a percentage of gross revenues, rebates and incentive programmes increased to 27 per cent, up 300bp compared with a year ago.Darrin Peller, analyst at Barclays, said: “We believe MasterCard missed on the revenue line primarily because they paid their bank card customers higher-than-expected amounts of rebates and incentives.”Shares in the company dropped 2.2 per cent to $427.18 by mid-morning in New York.Mr Banga said: “Though economic uncertainties continued to persist, we experienced solid volume and processed transaction growth in all regions as we are focused on driving our global business to expand the reach of electronic payments.”Earlier this month, Visa, MasterCard and leading US banks proposed a $7.25bn settlement with retailers over allegations of fee fixing for credit and debit cards.MasterCard’s share of the cash portion of the settlements is expected to total $790m on a pre-tax basis. The $20m pre-tax charge for the second quarter followed a $770m writedown in the fourth quarter of 2011.“We understand it will take some time for passions around these issues to settle down,” Mr Banga said, referring to the case.
181;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-07-25T22:49:55Z;Visa reports loss after settling suit;;Visa, the world’s largest payments network, reported a quarterly net loss of $1.8bn after it set aside more than $4bn to cover litigation costs related to a dispute over fees charged to US merchants.Excluding the provision, Visa’s net income for its fiscal third quarter was $1.1bn, or $1.56 per share, up 25 per cent over the same period a year ago and ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.45 per share, according to a Bloomberg survey.The company raised its full-year earnings forecast for the second time this year, saying a growing number of customers are moving to card-based payments globally. The company also announced a new $1bn share repurchase programme.Joseph Saunders, Visa’s chief executive, said growth in global payments volume, cross border and processed transactions outside the US was “solid”.Net operating revenue rose 10 per cent to reach $2.6bn in the quarter. The increase was driven by double-digit growth in service, data processing and international transaction revenues.There was no significant impact on the results related to movements of the US dollar, the company said.Earlier this month Visa and MasterCard put an end to a seven-year legal battle with US retailers by agreeing to a settlement of at least $6bn. The US merchants had accused the payment networks of fixing the price of fees retailers must pay every time consumers use cards for purchases.Visa’s share of the settlement was about $4.4bn, while that of MasterCard, which is scheduled to report results next week, previously announced the settlement would cost it $790m.Visa shares have risen almost 40 per cent this year in part because investors have welcomed the terms of the settlement. Visa shares were up 1.5 per cent in extended trading after the earnings release..“We are pleased that we were able to come to a resolution in the merchant litigation which was acceptable to most parties while ensuring the long-term health of the US payments industry,” Mr Saunders said in a statement. “We remain focused on launching new payment solutions and products for our financial and merchant partners and consumers, while supporting the Visa brand and the advancement of electronic payments.”

Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
183;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-07-18T21:36:42Z;High card usage boosts Amex profits;;American Express cardholders increased spending in the second quarter even as the pace of economic growth in the US and other global markets cooled, helping the group report profits which beat analyst estimates.The world’s largest credit card issuer by purchases reported on Wednesday that net income from continuing operations rose 3 per cent in the second quarter to $1.34bn, or $1.15 a share, from the same period last year. Analysts had forecast earnings on average of $1.10 a share, according to Bloomberg.Kenneth Chenault, chairman and chief executive, said the company was closely managing discretionary expenses in response to an “uncertain economic outlook” but it would continue to make substantial investments in marketing initiatives and on its loyalty programmes.Consolidated expenses rose 2 per cent to $5.6bn in the past quarter versus $5.5bn in 2011. Amex had the benefit of these expense levels being reduced in the previous period by settlement payments from MasterCard and Visa totalling $220m, related to a lawsuit over anti-competitive behaviour.The US commerce department reported on Monday that retail sales in the country, which accounts for about two-thirds of Amex’s revenue, fell for a third month in June. Still, Amex’s net income from US card services rose 8 per cent in the second quarter to $718m.A shift towards global commercial services, which reported a 24 per cent jump in second-quarter income to $219m, also boosted Amex’s results.“Consumer, small business and corporate card member spending, along with the business volumes generated by our network of bank partners, remained healthy despite a very uneven economy,” said Mr Chenault.Earlier this year, Amex boosted its quarterly dividend by 11 per cent to 20 cents a share, from 18 cents a share, after passing the so-called “stress test” by the Federal Reserve.Amex shares are up more than 20 per cent this year, making it one of the top performing stocks in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. The shares fell 0.8 per cent to $57.73 in extended trading hours after the earnings report.Earlier this year, the company announced plans to repurchase as much as $4bn of its outstanding shares by the end of December and an additional $1bn in the first quarter of 2013. The company said on Wednesday that it had so far bought back $2bn of shares, Bloomberg reported.
184;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;WTO rules against China on payment cards;;The World Trade Organisation has ruled that China discriminates against foreign electronic payment providers, handing the US its latest victory in a trade dispute over market access in the Asian nation.A panel of the global trade body said China was maintaining a monopoly for certain types – but not all – renminbi-denominated card transactions, in a manner that was inconsistent with WTO rules.China only allows one company – China UnionPay – to process domestic currency transactions and requires that all payment cards issued in the country bear its logo, limiting foreign providers such as Visa and MasterCard.Although the US did not prevail in every argument it made before the WTO panel, the ruling was being treated as a win by the Obama administration, which is seizing every opportunity to tout its tough stance on trade enforcement with voters.“Today’s win highlights that tackling unfair Chinese trade practices has been a priority of this president,” said Jay Carney, White House press secretary, as Mr Obama travelled to Cincinnati in the swing state of Ohio for his latest campaign rally. “This is another judgment in the US’s favour,” Mr Carney said.Last month, the WTO ruled in favour of the US in its challenge to antidumping and countervailing duties imposed by China on a certain kind of high-tech steel product manufactured mostly in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, the US challenged other duties imposed by China on US car exports, with the announcement coming just as Mr Obama embarked on a two-day bus tour through Ohio.The win on electronic payments may have less political impact than the cases directly related to manufacturing, which affect a number of key swing states. But Tim Reif, the general counsel at the office of the US trade representative, said it would still yield job gains of about 6,000 across the country.Mr Reif signalled that the Obama administration would continue to be as aggressive as possible in bringing trade cases against China.“Where China intends to use measures that discriminate against foreign providers, we will figure it out, we will do our homework, we will put the case together, we will bring it to the WTO and we will win, “ Mr Reif said on a conference call with reporters.China said it welcomed aspects of the WTO ruling but had reservations over others.Visa and MasterCard are among the US companies that stand to benefit the most if China overhauls its rules in response to the ruling, though this may take some time, especially since China now has the right to appeal.“We are hopeful that this ruling will pave the way for international payment companies to participate in the domestic payments marketplace in China,” said Will Valentine, a Visa spokesman.Jim Issokson, a spokesman for MasterCard, said: “Today’s news from the WTO clarifies the market situation and makes those opportunities for our company all the more interesting in this important region.”“If the WTO adopts these findings, they will require reform in the sector,” said Carolyn Gleason, head of the international trade group at McDermott Will & Emery, a law firm. Ms Gleason says there have been relatively few WTO cases challenging China’s practices in the services sector, so the ruling could embolden countries and business interests to seek greater access to China’s services market.
185;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-07-13T23:35:40Z;MasterCard and Visa in $7.25bn settlement;;Visa, MasterCard and leading US banks have announced a proposed $7.25bn settlement with retailers over allegations of fee fixing for credit and debit cards.The news on Friday afternoon sent Visa and MasterCard shares up more than 2 per cent in after-hours trading. Both companies have outperformed the broader stock market this year as investors anticipated a settlement of class action and individual retailer claims over card fees they pay to banks on each transaction.The settlement includes the Visa and MasterCard card networks and banks that issue cards such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, Wells Fargo and Capital One.The $7.25bn settlement would consist of a payment of more than $6bn for alleged past damages to retailers and a temporary reduction in the level of interchange fees paid by merchants on Visa and MasterCard credit card transactions.The case dates to 2005 and was set for trial in September. The settlement was made on behalf of a class of about 7m merchants in the US, said Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, a law firm that revealed details of the settlement.Visa said its share of proposed settlement payments for both the class and individual claims would represent about $4.4bn. “We believe settling this case is in the best interests of all parties,” said Joseph Saunders, Visa chief executive.MasterCard said its share of the cash portion of the settlements will total $790m on a pre-tax basis. It will incur an additional $20m pre-tax charge for the second quarter after a $770m charge in the fourth quarter of 2011.“Although we have strong defences to all claims, a settlement avoids years of litigation and uncertainties that are inherent in such cases,” said Noah Hanft, general counsel for MasterCard. “We believe that today’s settlements should resolve all issues with the merchant community.”Peter Welch, a Republican member of the US House of Representatives who has led on card fee issues, said: “This proposed settlement does not solve the problem of excessive fees or the opaque business practices of these financial institutions, but it is a step in the right direction.”In after-hours trading on Friday shares in Visa were up 2.4 per cent at $127, while MasterCard was up 2.2 per cent at $439. Both have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 this year.Visa will pay its settlement out of an escrow account set up ahead of its public offering.
186;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Credit data breach may be worse than thought;;Global Payments, the payment processor, said that a breach of its systems reported earlier this year may have compromised more information than previously thought.The company, which processes transactions involving Visa, MasterCard and American Express, said on Tuesday that its ongoing investigation had revealed that hackers may have gained access to servers containing personal information from its merchant customers.“It is unclear whether the intruders looked at or took any personal information from the company’s systems,” it said.When Global Payments first revealed the breach in March, the company said that the thieves may have accessed card numbers, but not cardholders’ names, addresses and social security numbers.Global Payments said that its investigation has established that the actual card numbers that may have been stolen did not exceed its previous estimate of 1.5m.Company officials were not immediately available to elaborate on what kind of personal information may have been compromised.Global Payments works behind the scenes in card transactions, serving as the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.The breach has prompted Visa and MasterCard to remove the company from a list of data processors that meet industry standards for security.In the coming days, Global Payments will notify individuals whose personal information may have been hacked and provide them with identity protection insurance at no cost.Paul Garcia, the chairman and chief executive of Global Payments, said: “We sincerely apologise for this incident and are working diligently to conclude our investigation. We are committed to fully resolve any issues arising from this matter and we, of course, continue to provide uninterrupted transaction processing for our customers worldwide.”The company plans to provide information on how much the breach will cost no later than its July 26 earnings call.The share price of Global Payments has fallen about 20 per cent since news of the breach surfaced. On Tuesday, the stock rose 0.8 per cent to $42.19.
187;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-06-05T20:59:35Z;Wall Street higher as investors look to central bank action;;Fastenal, the construction supplier, saw its shares tumble on Tuesday as the company that sells key industrial components to some of the world’s largest economies reported that its business slowed in May.Shares in Fastenal closed 9.8 per cent lower at $39.15 after it said that daily sales in May were up 13.1 per cent from the same time a year ago.Michael Jaffe, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said that figure amounted to a deceleration from the past couple of years, when same-day growth exceeded 20 per cent in many cases.Mr Jaffe added that economic uncertainties would pose a challenge in coming periods for Fastenal, but demand in its primary markets such as the US, China and Mexico was “solid”.Despite the losses on Tuesday, shares in Fastenal are still up nearly 25 per cent over the past year.Overall, the S&P 500 moved higher for the day. Activity on the index, which has given up nearly all its gains for the year after peaking in April, was muted for much of Tuesday’s trading session as investors eagerly sought signs of stimulus from the world’s central banks. But an afternoon rally helped the benchmark index gain 0.6 per cent to 1,285.50.Financial stocks, particularly the major US banks, were the best performers. The S&P 500 financials index rose 1.7 per cent as shares in Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase all recorded gains of more than 2.9 per cent.Goldman Sachs was up 1.3 per cent to $92.21 as reports suggested the US investment bank had laid off about 50 people last week.MasterCard, the global payments provider, rose 0.5 per cent in after-market trading on Tuesday as its board approved a $1.5bn share repurchase plan. MasterCard gained 2 per cent to $408.20 during the trading day, but appeared to be set to open higher on Wednesday after the announcement.Starbucks shares dropped as much as 4.2 per cent after the global coffee store chain announced the acquisition of a bakery brand for $100m.Late on Monday, Starbucks said it would acquire San Francisco-based Bay Bread and its La Boulange bakery brand. The coffee retailer said it planned to use the bakery’s pastry line to improve its food offerings in its stores around the world. It also wants to grow the number of La Boulange units from 19 in the coming years.The news, however, fell flat on investors, who had sent shares higher a day earlier on speculation that there might be an announcement involving Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the large US coffee retailer, which has been a target of short sellers in recent months.“Needless to say, we have overarching concerns of distraction from the core coffee platform and damage to the existing customer experience, similar to concerns from other recent non-coffee initiatives,” said Jeffrey Bernstein, analyst at Barclays.Mr Bernstein added that the bakery platform acquisition was a logical next step for Starbucks but that the new business must learn to crawl before it could walk, while integration costs could affect the group’s overall performance until 2013.Starbucks shares lost 2.8 per cent to $52.41, giving back all gains from Monday. Shares in Green Mountain Coffee fell 2.3 per cent to $22.94, leaving them down 48.9 per cent since the start of the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 0.2 per cent higher to 12,127.95.Fresh economic data released on Tuesday showed that the US services sector grew slightly more in May than a month earlier. But the report from the Institute for Supply Management did little to encourage wary investors, who have encountered a slew of downbeat economic data in recent weeks.Meanwhile large manufacturing companies on the blue-chip heavy Dow edged up. Earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar rose 0.5 per cent to $83.65, while shares in aircraft manufacturer Boeing inched ahead 0.1 per cent at $67.58.The Nasdaq Composite Index moved 0.7 per cent higher to 2,778.11. Shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the Nasdaq, lost 0.3 per cent to $562.83.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, an investment bank, said that Apple sales remained strong even as consumers waited for a series of updated product releases later in the year.After spending the morning in positive territory, shares in Facebook were trading 3.8 per cent lower to $25.87. The social networking site has fallen more than 30 per cent since its public offering last month but received an upgrade from Scott Kessler, analyst at S&P Capital IQ. Mr Kessler changed his rating to “hold” from “sell” as he said the stock’s decline from its debut price of $38 puts it in line with its peers.FedEx, the global package delivery company, lost 1 per cent to $84.34 after it said on Monday that it planned to retire some of its large fleet of jets.
188;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;MasterCard overcharged, EU court rules;;European consumers will face more transparent credit and debit card fees and potentially lower retail costs after a landmark court ruling confirming MasterCard overcharged for cross-border card transactions.The judgment from the EU’s second highest court is an important victory for the European Commission, which found in 2007 that the card payment group restricted competition and inflated prices for retailers and consumers.While MasterCard will appeal the ruling, in the short term the decision may be enough to trigger an overhaul of card services in Europe and a new regulatory clampdown on relatively untouched domestic fees.Most consumers are unaware of the charges, which provide multibillion-euro revenue streams for card-issuing banks. MasterCard sees the charges as vital to a cheap and secure service with benefits such as insurance and loyalty rewards. But consumer groups denounce the hidden fees as “profiteering”.The legal certainty from the ruling will add new urgency to the EU investigation of Visa’s credit card fees, multiple national court cases on domestic fees and an ongoing probe by the UK Office of Fair Trading.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, told Visa Europe and MasterCard to “consider carefully” how to bring their fees “in line with competition rules”. “In 2006 card payments in the EU cost merchants about €25bn ($31bn) . These fees ultimately impact consumers.”After the Brussels decision in 2007, MasterCard significantly cut its interchange fee rate on an “interim” basis , without accepting wrongdoing. Its appeal – backed by big European retail banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBCand Banco Santander – became a test of the fundamental principles of how competition law is applied to the card market.MasterCard failed to convince the court that the cross-border fees were “an objective necessity” to making the card system viable. The judges dismissed that the card system contributed to “technical and economic progress” and found the method of fee setting “tended to over-estimate the costs by the financial institutions”.Javier Perez, president of MasterCard Europe, warned that if the ruling stood it would tip the balance of costs “decidedly against consumers”. He argued that reducing fees might force consumers to lose benefits and pay more upfront for cards, while merchants would not pass on cost reductions.The commission sees this greater transparency as a benefit that will generate competition to reduce the hitherto hidden costs, which consumers eventually pay for in higher retail prices.This closely watched appeal related to so-called “interchange fees” on cross-border card payments, which a consumer’s bank levies on a merchant’s bank for retail sales transactions. But the implications are as significant for domestic fees.Monique Goyens, head of the European Consumer Organisation, said the decision marked a “major victory” and called on regulators to “put a final, legal stop to such unfair and regrettably common profiteering”.Christian Verschueren of EuroCommerce, a merchant association involved in the case, called on the commission “to follow this up with radical and decisive regulatory solutions to make payments in Europe truly competitive”.
189;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-05-22T00:04:57Z;Olympics: Sponsorship keeps rivals out;Overt marketing and ‘splash’ advertising give way to more subtle promotions;"Olympism is a philosophy of life based on the joy of effort, good examples, social responsibility and ethical principles. It is an attractive idea that big brands are keen to be identified with.“Olympic sponsor brands start with a huge advantage,” says Peter Walshe, Global BrandZ director at Millward Brown. “Sponsorship acts both as a flag waver for the brand in some very important areas, as well as a defence against some key competitors.”Five top 100 brands, Coca-Cola, GE, McDonald’s, Panasonic, Samsung and Visa, are members of the International Olympic Committee’s The Olympic Partner (TOP) programme. Meanwhile the London 2012 Olympic Partners include Top 100 Adidas, BMW and BP, and Cisco is an official supporter.BrandZ compared the TOP sponsors with their closest competitors. These were Coca Cola with Pepsi, GE with Siemens, McDonald’s with KFC, Samsung with Sony and Visa with MasterCard. They scored 118 on leadership, against 105 for their competitors, 113 on brand desire (104) and 108 for corporate reputation (101).“They are powerful brands that are leaders in their field,” says Mr Walshe, “There is no evidence that they are stronger and more powerful simply because of the Olympics. The bigger, more successful brands tend to be the sponsors.”It is no coincidence sports sponsorship is dominated by large global brands as multinational companies need to extend the reach of their products.“Global sporting and other events are ideal platforms for businesses to move from national to global brand identities and become familiar around the world,” says Terry Tyrrell, worldwide chairman for The Brand Union, a global branding agency within the WPP Group. “These platforms are good value when you compare them with standalone global corporate advertising campaigns. If a big organisation is not building its reputation on a global basis, it will be ‘gobbled up’ by 2030.”However, he warns clients to be wary of associating themselves with sports tarnished by bribery, corruption, match-fixing and bad behaviour. This is why aligning with the Olympic philosophy is a great opportunity.The BrandZ research shows that discontinuing TOP sponsorship would give competitors an opportunity to replace them. “There can be almost as much value in stopping someone else doing it as in you doing it yourself,” says Mr Walshe.He adds: “Being in possession of a great property, and the leadership stance that confers on you, gives you powerful support.”While Beijing was an opportunity for brands to establish themselves in a growing market, London is a mature market and is a popular tourist destination.Heather Hancock, lead 2012 partner at Deloitte, a London 2012 Official Supporter, she believes Olympic sponsorship has reached a turning point.“Big, heavy overt marketing-style brand activity and ‘splash’ advertising is
giving way to more subtle values-led activity,” she says. She cites the example of BP, oil and gas and also sustainability and carbon offset partner, positioning itself to being a new generation energy company rather than just linked to fossil fuels.Steve Martin, chief executive of M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, a communications agency, says sponsors are linking culture and the “look and feel” of London. “Creatively, London is a rich territory,” he says. “It is globally renowned with a unique personality that travels very well, and brands can attach themselves to that.”An example is Coca Cola’s “Anywhere in the World” 2012 song and its Beatbox interactive musical pavilion in the Olympic park. “We aim to bring teenagers closer to the Olympic Games, and to sport in general, by harnessing their passion for music and drawing inspiration from London’s musical heritage,” says the company.One problem for the TOP sponsors is that they have to commit several games ahead, without knowing which cities and national markets they will be supporting. Matt Rogan, managing director of Two Circles, a sports business consultancy, and a board director at the European Sponsorship Association, says “second world”’ nations are increasingly interested in hosting such events and the Olympic movement is aspiring to drive long-term societal benefit.This may be very worthy, but Mr Rogan can see a possible tension with sponsors who want to be in first world nations or at least in very fast-growing emerging markets.“We should not underestimate the reach and power of sport to engage with large audiences, both consumer and business,” adds Mr Walshe. “If you can link your brand positively, without interrupting the audience’s enjoyment, and actually be seen as helping to deliver it, then the credit that comes to you as a brand is absolutely enormous. You are getting to people with something that is highly enjoyable and engaging, rousing those emotions like few other things can do.”"
190;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-05-08T19:01:42Z;MasterCard unveils ‘digital wallet’ network;;MasterCard, the payments processing network, unveiled new digital wallet services designed to enable banks and retailers to take advantage of anticipated growth in electronic payments.Under the name PayPass, MasterCard is creating a unified network that will enable merchants to accept digital payments made by consumers either electronically in stores or online using a smartphone, computer or tablet.MasterCard will also offer services to help retailers, banks and technology companies to build digital wallets as well as let other parties that have their own wallets plug into their PayPass network.The services will be rolled out in the third quarter first in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia, and then in other countries.Edward Olebe, head of PayPass wallet services at MasterCard, said the services are meant to encourage adoption of digital wallets. “We have smartphones and we have the technology. Why aren’t we getting broader adoption?” he said. “The one thing missing is connecting these.”For PayPass wallet services, MasterCard is partnering with merchants including American Airlines and Barnes & Noble as well as financial institutions such as Citibank, National Bank of Canada, Banesto and Intesa Sanpaolo. Technology partners include Intel, Sage Pay and Vantiv.MasterCard made its announcement at the start of the CTIA wireless industry trade show in New Orleans which began on Tuesday, underscoring the importance of the telecommunications industry to the deployment of digital wallet services.Mobile payments are expected to grow as consumers increasingly use devices such as smartphones equipped with technologies such as NFC (near field communications) instead of cards to purchase goods and services.MasterCard is already partnered with Google and Sprint on digital wallet services while Verizon Communications, AT&T and T-Mobile USA have created their own wallet consortium called Isis.Isis is due to start trial of its NFC-enabled digital wallet service in several cities this summer ahead of a nationwide commercial rollout.US telecommunications companies view mobile wallets as a new growth opportunity. “Mobile payments is a very promising area for us,” Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&T’s mobile unit told the Financial Times at CTIA. “I don’t think it will be long before electronic wallets replace physical wallets,” he added. “With ISIS we are building the ‘back office’. We have to make sure that mobile wallets are both simple to use and secure.”Like other telecoms executives, Mr de la Vega believes the success of mobile wallets will depend on enabling consumers to use their existing credit and debit cards with their digital wallets, rather than forcing consumers to sign up for new cards.The Isis consortium has already announced partnerships with all the major card processors including MasterCard.
191;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa reveals DoJ demand as card groups shine;Profits driven by shift away from cash;Visa shares fell as much as 3 per cent as it disclosed that it had received a civil investigative demand – the official request for information that is the first indication that a formal investigation is under way – from the US Department of Justice in March.The disclosure came as Visa and MasterCard, two of the world’s largest payment processing networks, reported strong quarterly profits driven by a global shift by consumers from cash to card payments.Programmes to encourage credit card usage over debit cards helped lift Visa’s second quarter operating revenues 14.8 per cent to $2.6bn compared with the same period a year ago.Adjusted net income jumped 23 per cent to $1.1bn, with earnings of $1.60 a share coming in 10 cents better than analysts had forecast.Speaking to investors on a conference call, Joseph Saunders, chief executive, raised full-year profit guidance and said earnings per share growth could be as high as the “low-twenties”, up from previous guidance in the “high-teens”.“Our strong financial performance this quarter was fuelled by continued growth of US credit products, strong cross-border spending and expansion of Visa’s core business in international markets,” said Mr Saunders.Regarding the justice department letter, Darrin Peller, analyst at Barclays, said the intermediary companies who process payments between retailers and the card companies may have lobbied the government to look into Visa’s pricing adjustments. Visa has made changes to its payments business in response to new regulations that are designed to increase competition among providers.Mr Saunders said that the company had received other requests of this nature before and that the process may take up to a year to resolve.“My impression is Visa will get through this. They’ve been through multiple reviews before and have come out extraordinarily strong or well-positioned before,” Mr Peller said.Earlier on Wednesday, MasterCard said that its net income rose to $682m, or $5.36 a share, in the first three months of the year from $562m, or $4.29 a share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts’ expectations.“We had a good start to the year with solid first-quarter results driven by an increase in processed transactions, the highest quarterly growth rate since our initial public offering, as well as positive volume growth in all regions as consumers continue to adopt electronic payments,” said Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s president and chief executive.Net revenues rose to $1.76bn from $1.5bn in the year-over-year quarter, but officials warned that growth would probably slow as the year progressed.The extra day from a leap year and the US tax season helped results in the first three months, while growth was strong last year, making for tough comparisons as the year progresses.Company officials nonetheless reiterated guidance that MasterCard could achieve a compound annual growth rate of 12 to 14 per cent in net revenues and at least 20 per cent in earnings per share this year and next.Worldwide purchase volume during the first quarter was up 17 per cent on a local currency basis versus the first quarter of 2011 to $629bn. Processed transactions jumped 29 per cent in the quarter to 7.7bn and MasterCard branded cards issued reached 1.8bn.The rise in cardholder spending was partially offset by an increase in rebates and incentives. Total operating expenses were $758m, up 14 per cent from the first quarter of 2011.Gross dollar volume, a combination of purchases and cash withdrawals on cards, grew by 19 per cent in Europe in spite of the problems in the region. Growth rates exceeded 20 per cent in the Asia Pacific, central Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer, said MasterCard had gained market share in the US versus Visa, its larger rival, following the changes to regulations on transaction fees and processing.Shares of MasterCard dropped 1 per cent to $451.45 during the regular session.

The exact change is in your hand. Is there anything more frustrating than that person in front of you buying a loaf of bread with plastic? Well, get used to it. MasterCard’s first-quarter results on Wednesday showed a 29 per cent rise in global processed transactions versus last year – the fastest rate of growth since the company went public in 2006.Sometimes it is easy to complicate a story.This is particularly true in electronic commerce with opaque financial arrangements between customers, retailers, banks and the big networks such as MasterCard and Visa. Then there are new regulations such as those that recently capped transaction fees. But the simple story here is that people are using credit and debit cards more. In the US, for example, three-quarters of spending in the early 1990s was via cash or cheques – today it is about a third. More exciting is the developing world. Across all of MasterCard’s credit, charge and debit programmes, gross dollar volumes grew by almost a quarter in Latin America in local currency terms compared with a year ago, and by even more in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Globally, 85 per cent of transactions are still by cash or cheque. The death of cash is always exaggerated, but an $80tn untapped market is exciting over any timeframe.The trouble with simple stories, however, is that they tend to be reflected in share prices. This is the case with MasterCard and Visa, both trading on about 20 times forward earnings after outperforming the S&P 500 index by more than 75 per cent over the past five years. Such racy multiples would normally be worth it given the growth potential. But margins at both companies are at record highs. Any investor who thinks margins could normalise should not reach for their wallets.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
193;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Fresh blow for Global Payments;;Global Payments, a processor of debit and credit card transactions that reported a breach in March, said late on Tuesday that “certain card associations” had removed the company from their lists of processors that meet industry standards for security.The company processes transactions involving brands including Visa, MasterCard and American Express.Global Payments reiterated assurances it gave in March that no more than 1.5m card numbers were at risk in the breach and that it was confined to its processing system in North America.Days after the breach was revealed, Visa, the world’s largest payment processor, removed Global Payments from a list it publishes for merchants of data processors that meet industry standards for security.A spokesperson for Global Payments was not available to comment on card associations that may have taken similar steps.Global Payments said it hoped to regain its security status following an investigation into the breach.“We anticipate that we will be reinstated to those lists at the conclusion of the revalidation and any required remediation,” the company said on a website it set up to provide information on the security breach.In April, MasterCard had said it would consider what steps to take based on the findings of an external and independent investigation.Losing the seal of approval on security from Visa or other brands does not preclude Global Payments from processing transactions.Global Payments is the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to the Nilson Report, a payment industry newsletter. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.Global Payments said it continued to work with third parties, regulators and lawmakers to minimise the impact of the breach on cardholders.On Tuesday, Global Payments shares rose 1.1 per cent to $46.92.
194;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Governments embrace e-payments;;Governments around the world are increasingly using electronic platforms to collect taxes, procure goods and services and other key transactions as part of a global shift away from cash payments, a study released this week showed.Advancements in technology and heightened security measures to bolster the public’s trust in transferring funds through the Internet are driving adoption, the research conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, the research arm of the publisher of the Economist magazine, and sponsored by Visa, showed.Visa and MasterCard, the world’s largest payments processors, stand to gain from the move away from cash and both are aggressively pursuing opportunities to promote the acceptance of e-payments, particularly in emerging countries where large parts of the population may not be using banks at all.“Submitting a tax return online, swiping an electronic card to pay for a bus journey or even, perhaps, receiving government health and/or social benefits directly in a bank account are now a way of life in many countries,” the study said. “The ability of governments to offer these services via electronic platforms benefits all parties in the form of reduced costs and increased access.”Of the 62 countries studied, not surprisingly, wealthy and developed countries have the most widespread adoption of e-payments. The US, UK and Norway were the top performers in the study, while Nigeria, Uganda and Ukraine were the bottom three.Elizabeth Buse, president of Visa’s business in the Asia Pacific countries, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa, said that government adoption of e-payments “engenders trust,” paving the way for other types of electronic transactions.“In developed countries it is simply more convenient to make or receive a payment electronically, but it emerging countries it can drive economic development,” Ms Buse said.Advocates argue that e-payments reduce costs and corruption by increasing transparency and that they help to bring citizens into the mainstream economy.With more than 5bn mobile phone users worldwide, the study predicts that mobile payments will “boom” in the coming years. Visa is hoping that mobile devices will be the link to legions of “un-banked” people in developing areas where mobile phones may be more ubiquitous than bank accounts.“There are places where we have made very significant progress to electronify the economy and there are places where we still have lots of room for additional focus and investment,” said Bill Sheedy, president of Visa’s business for the Americas. “It is a huge business opportunity.”Among the most common services now available, more than 90 per cent of the countries researched have a system in place to enable citizens to calculate and file their income taxes electronically, while eight-six percent have an electronic system that helps governments collect sales tax from businesses. Nearly 84 per cent have electronic or automated systems for vehicle-related costs such as tolls and fines.The development of e-payment facilities for obtaining or paying for identification cards, requesting unemployment and other welfare benefits and the disbursement of loans to businesses fared lower.
195;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-04-19T01:10:07Z;Amex spending boosts quarterly earnings;Cardholder credit quality remains high;American Express cardholders spent more and defaulted little, boosting the group’s net income by 7 per cent in the first quarter of 2012.Net profit increased to $1.3bn in the first three months of the year, or $1.07 per share, from $1.2bn, or 97 cents, in the same period a year ago, the company said on Wednesday. That compares with analysts’ estimates of $1.01 per share, according to Bloomberg.Consolidated revenues, net of interest expense, rose 8 per cent to $7.6bn in the first quarter from $7bn in first quarter of 2011.“Spending on the American Express network rose 12 per cent, remaining strong throughout the quarter, both in the US and internationally,” said Kenneth Chenault, the company’s chairman and chief executive. “Credit quality continues to be among the best we have ever experienced, and our lending portfolio continued to grow at moderate levels.”Billed business to Amex cards totalled $211bn in the quarter, up 12 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2011, helped by the extra day a leap year added in February. Average card member spending rose 10 per cent to $3,772 in the first quarter from $3,438 in the previous quarter.In spite of economic stress in the region, billed business in Europe rose 6 per cent in the first quarter in line with the “stabilising” trend seen in the fourth quarter, said Dan Henry, chief financial officer.Consolidated expenses totalled $5.4bn, up 4 per cent from $5.2bn a year ago as higher salaries, employee benefits and other operating costs were partially offset by lower marketing, promotion and expenses related to card member rewards.In the year ago period, consolidated settlement payments from MasterCard and Visa, the payment processors, totalling $220m related to a lawsuit over anticompetitive behaviour reduced consolidated expenses.A pledge by the company to contain expenses has raised concerns about its ability to stave off growing competition. “Our concern is that expenses typically do not go down or stay flat when competition is going up,” said Jason Arnold, an analyst at RBC Securities. “The concern for the year ahead is: Will [American Express] be able to control expenses and how well, if indeed the competition is heating up?”In particular, Mr Arnold noted efforts by JPMorgan and Citigroup to attract American Express’ customer base of affluent individuals and businesses.To expand to other types of customers, American Express itself has been investing in digital technology focused on the so-called alternative payments sector, which includes online and mobile payment platforms.American Express earlier this year boosted its quarterly dividend by 11 per cent to 20 cents a share, from 18 cents a share after passing the so-called “stress test” by the Federal Reserve. The company plans to repurchase as much as $4bn of its outstanding shares this year and an additional $1bn in the first quarter of 2013.Mr Henry said that the company would also consider strategic acquisitions. “If we see strategic acquisitions, we will do them,” he said. “If not, we will use capital to do share repurchases.”American Express shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $57.80 in after-market trading.
196;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-04-03T03:17:23Z;Concerns remain over data security standards;;The data security breach at Global Payments, an Atlanta-based credit card payment processor, has highlighted once again that those companies involved in the complex payment processing chain are among the prime targets for hackers and cyber criminals.Global Payments said the breach involved the “export” of “Track 2” data related to about 1.5m Visa and MasterCard-branded cards, but insisted that cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers were not compromised.Global Payments is the latest in a long list of companies including Citigroup, Epsilon Data Management, Heartland Payment Systems and CardSystems Solutions that have suffered data breaches in recent years affecting hundreds of millions of consumers and causing considerable expense for card issuers, banks and others in the payments chain. The Heartland Payment Systems attack alone in 2009 is estimated to have compromised up to 130m credit and debit cards.Despite detailed investigations, the perpetrators of these attacks are often never caught. However the arrest and subsequent conviction of Albert Gonzalez, a former law enforcement informant, who pleaded guilty in 2010 to the Heartland attack, provided a rare insight into the shadowy world of cybercrime.During a five-year cybercrime spree Gonzalez, who was given a 20-year prison sentence for the Heartland attack, is believed to have netted almost $3m which he used to buy an apartment in Miami, a car, Rolex watches and a Tiffany ring for his girlfriend. After his arrest, federal investigators found more than $1m in cash buried in a barrel in his parent’s backyard in Florida. Meanwhile, his crimes cost companies, banks and insurers almost $200m, according to the justice department.So far, Global Payments has made few details about the breach available and has yet to quantify the costs that it might incur though it has acknowledged that it is likely to record a charge once all the costs have been tallied.It may, however, have already suffered what some security experts term a “reputational hit” to its brand. Visa’s decision to drop the company from its registry of providers that meet the PCI credit card processing security standards is an inevitable consequence of security breach.Global Payments executives said they are confident that the company will regain its compliance rating with Visa and MasterCard “as soon as possible”. But the latest breach is likely to raise questions about whether the industry’s security standards are set high enough.As one security expert told a ZDNet blog, “the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is highly prescriptive in nature, but simply complying does not ensure credit card security. Companies that rely on PCI DSS to solely dictate their security measures will continue to remain vulnerable to attack.”It may also reignite demands for a comprehensive review of security breach notification rules in the US – currently a patchwork of mostly state-level laws requiring disclosure to consumers when personal information is compromised.While the Global breach reportedly happened between January 21 and February 25 and was discovered in early March, it was not until Friday after trading of its stock was halted following press reports that the company publicly acknowledged the breach.
197;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-04-02T22:35:01Z;Scale of credit card breach revealed;;Global Payments, a processor of credit and debit card transactions involving brands such as Visa and MasterCard, on Monday sought to ease concerns about a security breach that put up 1.5m card numbers in North America at risk of being stolen.Officials stressed that the company detected the hacking itself and Paul Garcia, the chairman and chief executive, said it was “making significant progress in defining and rectifying the event”.That was not enough to convince Visa. The world’s largest payment processor removed Global Payments from a list it publishes for merchants of data processors that meet industry standards for security. The move does not preclude Global Payments from processing transactions, including those involving Visa, but it could be a disincentive for some customers to do business with the company.Global Payments works behind the scenes in card transactions, serving as the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.MasterCard said it would consider what steps to take based on the findings of an external and independent forensic investigation.Global Payments said it was too soon to even estimate the cost to the company, but that it has insurance for these events.“This is manageable,” Mr Garcia said. “We will get through this.”The company also plans to spend more money on security and will work to get back on Visa’s registry.The breach occurred on a small number of Global Payments’ servers. The thieves did not obtain cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers. Company officials said Global Payments was “on the hook” for replacement cards.The three largest consumer credit lenders – Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan – would not comment on whether they had detected any fraudulent transactions. Discover, a card issuer that also owns its own network, said it had seen “some fraudulent activity that we believe is related to this compromise and will reissue accounts as appropriate”. American Express said it was still trying to ascertain any related theft using its cards.Chris Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said that “there is some concern about how much the breach will cost Global Payments in the future and what it says about their technology platform and their franchise”. But 1.5m accounts was “rather small” for a breach of this kind, Mr Brendler said, referring to a 2009 hacking at Heartland Payment Systems, which compromised 130m accounts. “If they can act quickly and get back on Visa’s approved list, the damage could be contained.”On Monday, shares of Global Payments fell 3.7 per cent to $45.74. The shares dropped 9 per cent on Friday before they were suspended from trading.
198;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-04-02T21:06:38Z;Groupon shares sink on revenue revisions;;Shares in Groupon sunk by nearly 17 per cent on Monday as investors reacted to a restatement of revenue figures by the offers website as well as the company’s admission of “material weakness” in its internal controls.Revenues for the largest online offers website by sales were lowered $14.3m to $492.2m, the company said late on Friday after trading. Groupon blamed the revision, which wiped out its operating profits for the final months of last year, on its failure to account properly for the increased likelihood of customers seeking refunds in its newest markets.Analysts were mixed in assessing the impact the restatement would have on its shares, which are trading almost 25 per cent below their initial public offer price of $20.“We do not view the restated financials and internal process weakness as indications of fundamental softening in Groupon’s model, as indicated in the [first quarter 2012] guidance affirmation,” said Doug Anmuth, analyst at JPMorgan.“Instead we believe they reflect Groupon’s dynamic deal mix and the company’s extremely rapid growth in a very short amount of time,” Mr Anmuth added, while reducing his price target for the company’s shares to $22 from $24, but maintaining his “hold” rating.Justin Post, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said Groupon has been his team’s most disappointing call of 2012. “While we remain constructive on the local deals opportunity, and we see this accrual change as an estimation mistake in an evolving hard-to-predict business, it should take several quarters for Groupon to gain investor confidence,” he said, downgrading the company from “buy” to “hold” and lowering its price target from $30 to $20.Shares in Groupon finished down 16.9 per cent to $15.28 and have fallen by more than 26 per cent in the year to date.Avon, the door-to-door cosmetics seller, rose 17.3 per cent to $22.70 as it rejected a $10bn cash bid from Coty, the privately owned fragrance group.Avon rebuffed the latest Coty proposal one hour after the fragrance group made the bid offer public. Avon said the proposal undervalued it and that it was “substantially the same as” an offer made two weeks ago, which it had also rejected.Shares in the cosmetics group are now up by more than 30 per cent in the year to date.After a negative start to the day, the S&P 500 climbed 0.7 per cent to 1,418.90 and reached cyclical highs yet again, as the first session of the second quarter commenced.The benchmark index was buoyed by US manufacturing data that showed growth picked up in March on stronger hiring and production.The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.4 in March from the February reading of 52.4, beating economist estimates of 53. Readings above 50 indicate growth in the sector. Elsewhere, the commerce department said construction spending unexpectedly dropped by the most in seven months despite the unseasonably warm weather.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 13,264.49, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.9 per cent at 3,119.70.Express Scripts, the health benefits manager, climbed 2.4 per cent to $55.50 as the Federal Trade Commission approved its merger with rival Medco Health Solutions. The takeover bid was valued at $29.1bn. If the deal is completed, it would create the biggest manager of prescription-drug benefits for corporate and government clients.Shares in Medco were down 1 per cent to $71.85, having risen nearly 30 per cent in the year to date.Lions Gate Entertainment, producer of the television series Mad Men, fell 4.5 per cent to $13.30 as the company’s latest blockbuster, Hunger Games, dominated box office returns for a second consecutive weekend, grossing $61.1m in ticket sales. The movie has generated more than $250m in the US and Canada in its first 10 days of release.Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, added 3.2 per cent to $618.63 as a report said one analyst at Topeka Capital had set a price target of $1,001 for its shares, with “no end in sight” to its recent gains.Hartford Financial Services Group, the insurance provider, rose 4.1 per cent to $21.95 as the company said it would repurchase $2.43bn worth of securities it sold to Allianz, the German insurer, during the depths of the financial crisis. Under the terms of the deal, Hartford will replace $1.75bn of debt – yielding 10 per cent – it owes to Allianz with lower yielding new debt.Global Payments, a processor of credit and debit card transactions involving brands such as Visa and MasterCard, fell another 3.7 per cent to $45.74 as it updated markets on the security breach of its system. The processing company said on Sunday up to 1.5m card numbers in North America may have been stolen by hackers.Visa and MasterCard, the world’s largest payment processors, were both up however on Monday, gaining 0.8 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively.
199;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-03-30T22:52:12Z;MasterCard and Visa warn of data breach;Visa and MasterCard;Visa and MasterCard, the word’s largest payment processors, warned that their cardholders’ account information may have been put at risk as a third-party processor of card transactions reported that its systems had been breached.Both companies said they had alerted card issuers regarding accounts that may have been affected. Visa said card account information from “all major card brands” may have been affected.Global Payments of Atlanta, Georgia, a provider of payment processing services for credit, debit and gift cards, said on Friday that it had determined in early March that card data may have been accessed, and contacted federal law enforcement. It said it identified “unauthorised access into a portion of its processing system” and continues to investigate.Global Payments, Visa and MasterCard all declined to comment on how many cardholders were potentially at risk. Visa and MasterCard said their systems were not compromised.The US Secret Service was investigating the breach, said George Ogilvie, a spokesman for the agency.Global Payments also said it “promptly notified appropriate industry parties to allow them to minimise potential cardholder impact”.Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, the three largest consumer credit card lenders, declined to comment, but people familiar with investigations said lenders were working with payment processors and were preparing to field customer inquiries about suspicious charges on their cards. It was unclear if any fraudulent charges had been made.American Express and Discover also said they were monitoring their accounts for suspicious activity.Global Payments is the seventh largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. Last year, it processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.Global Payments’ shares fell 9.1 per cent to $47.50 before they were suspended from trading early Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.“This situation speaks fundamentally to questions about how safe and secure our data is with those who have been entrusted with it,” said Denee Carrington, an analyst at Forrester Research.Last year, Citigroup fell victim to a hacking attack that exposed data on hundreds of thousands of credit card holders and raised broader concerns about online protections. This prompted the US Department of Homeland Security to join with federal law enforcement authorities to advise financial institutions on how to protect themselves from online breaches.Ms Carrington said she was troubled by the lack of information that card issuers and payment processors were providing on how the latest breach happened and how many cardholders were affected. She said the timeline of when the breach occurred and how quickly Global Payments detected it will be key for future consumer confidence in these systems.Additional reporting by Kara Scannell in New York

But the results were flattered by the sale of two businesses to Western Union and MasterCard for £896m.Revenues from continuing operations rose by 9 per cent to £586.7m steered by Travelex’s online currency exchange service. The online business contributed more than a third of sales in the UK.Travelex’s fastest growing business was prepaid currency cards, which allow customers to put foreign currency on a card that functions like a credit card.Michael Ball, chief financial officer, said Travelex planned to focus on “big opportunities” in emerging markets where it recently acquired Grupo Confidence, Brazil’s largest foreign exchange provider by revenues, and FX Africa.Mr Ball said despite the large number of tourists expected to visit London this summer for the Olympics, Travelex was not expecting this to boost sales significantly.

202;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-03-20T20:38:25Z;Finance: More flash than cash;New payment systems are raising concerns about privacy and security;It was an assignment out of a Dick Tracy cartoon strip. Last year, Lucas Scheybal challenged himself to live for two weeks in New York handling no cash or payment cards – instead using only a futuristic watch with a wireless chip.It turned out to be easy. With a swipe of the device across a special reader, he was able to buy coffee at 7-Eleven or Starbucks, meals from outlets including McDonald’s and Subway, as well as cinema tickets and even petrol. “I did survive. Gasoline and food were not a problem. It was easy getting around New York because there are 20,000 taxis that accept contactless payments,” he says.Mr Scheybal received some odd looks. His company, Laks, has only recently brought out its Watch2Pay system, and it is not yet widely used. But the idea of paying or transferring money with a single tap of a new-style bank card or a text message is increasingly common. Laks’ wrist-worn devices are among dozens of alternatives to notes, coins and traditional cards that are on trial.Google has linked up with the MasterCard payment system and US telecoms operator Sprint to bring out its Wallet service for making one-tap payments with a mobile phone. La Caixa, the Spanish retail bank, has flooded Barcelona with contactless payment cards and terminals enabling payment in any shop with a single tap of a card. From the realm of online retail, cashless consumer transactions are spreading to the street – faster than was possible while they still relied on the previous generation of cards fed into a reader and requiring a personal identification number.Nor is all this innovative activity confined to the west. Indeed, developing countries with their limited networks of traditional banks can show the most rapid take-up. In Kenya, a system of mobile payments called M-Pesa has become an alternative banking service for 15m people. According to a 2010 report from the Central Bank of Kenya, the value of transactions being carried out using M-Pesa amounted to Ks727.8bn ($8.81bn), as people use mobile phones to pay school fees, collect their salaries, shop for groceries and buy everything from beer to airline tickets.“I was joking with the governor of the Kenyan national bank that he doesn’t need to print money any more, as M-Pesa is taking over,” says Michael Joseph, the former chief executive of Safaricom, which pioneered the M-Pesa network in Kenya.A number of countries – including Turkey, Sweden, Estonia, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan – have started to discuss ending the use of cash all together. One of the most prominent campaigns has been in Sweden, where the anti-cash lobby group has high-profile support from Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus, co-writer of pop hits including “Money, Money, Money”.So is cash on the way out? If so, what are the implications for citizens, businesses and governments? And, in a world where the notion of a cashless society has long ranked alongside the paperless office as something frequently predicted but never achieved, what factors will now make it work?One reason experts believe we could be coming to a tipping point is that smartphones have made it easy not just to make but also to receive electronic payments. Gadgets and services are emerging that can turn any phone into a virtual cash till – just as accessible for small traders such as window cleaners and babysitters, who have hitherto had to operate on a cash basis, as for bigger enterprises.Square, launched last year by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, and iZettle, a Swedish start-up, have both developed card readers that can be attached to the bottom of an iPhone to take payments. Ingenico, a French provider of transaction terminals, is developing something similar.Salvation Army bell-ringers in a number of cities across the US used Square to take donations last Christmas. Earlier in the year, girl scouts in Ohio used devices made by American software company Intuit to take payments for cookies, a move that reportedly increased sales by 13 per cent.With the Pingit service, launched in the UK last month by Barclays bank, people need not even attach a device to their phone. They can send payments from mobile to mobile simply using the recipient’s phone number. “As the mobile replaces the shop payment terminal, suddenly the whole scenario changes. It is the crucial pivot for electronic payments,” says Dave Birch, director of Consult Hyperion, an electronic transactions consultancy.Cash is unhygienic, risky and inefficient, say those who yearn to escape dependence on filthy lucre in its physical form. Apart from bacteria accumulated through the handling of notes and coins by thousands of people before they are retired after a few years, one in 10 banknotes in Britain carries traces of cocaine, according to a 2011 UK police study.Large-denomination notes in particular are associated with organised crime. The UK banned the use of the €500 bill in 2010 because the country’s Serious Organised Crime Agency estimated that about 90 per cent of them were being used for purposes such as money-laundering. The Swedish bank workers’ trade union argues that counter staff would be less vulnerable to robberies if they did not have to store cash on the premises.Some economists are concerned that a move to electronic payments could dilute governments’ ability to influence the economy by controlling the money supply. “The central bank has control over the monetary system because it can produce cash. If it can’t do that, it is not obvious whether it can still influence the system,” says Andrew Scott, professor of economics at London Business School.But Jon Matonis, an e-money consultant and author of The Monetary Future blog, maintains this is a concern only if shifting to electronic payments also involves moving to a different, non-government-issued currency. Most existing payment schemes, such as Google Wallet, are linked to a regular bank account holding national currency. It makes little difference to central monetary control whether the populace uses these or physical notes and coins.Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, recently revealed that the internet company had considered issuing its own currency, Google Bucks, but had moved away from the idea because of the complex regulations that surround such schemes.Alternative currencies are beginning to gain ground, however. For instance, Facebook credits costing 10 US cents each can be used to pay for digital items on the social networking site. They are most commonly used for buying things such as virtual tractors and shovels in games including Farmville, but a number of film studios have experimented with letting people rent films online in exchange for Facebook credits.Some retailers, such as Shoebuy.com, the online footwear store, are using Facebook credits as incentives, offering a certain number with every purchase of their goods. Facebook, which is in the process of applying for money transmitter licences across the US to legitimise the scheme, takes a 30 per cent cut on every purchase and last year generated $557m from payments.If the use of such credits continues to spread, it would be a step towards the vision of Friedrich Hayek, the Nobel prizewinning economist, who argued as far back as 1976 that companies could compete with governments to issue money.One main obstacle has been the difficulty for people to keep track of the value of multiple competing currencies. Technology is starting to solve this problem. “With an electronic wallet on a mobile phone, the cost of adding another currency collapses. You can pay in pounds or dollars, or kilowatt hours, and it is just another menu on the handset,” says Dave Birch at Consult Hyperion, a payments consultancy.Apart from anything else, there is a cost to handling cash, in terms of storing, guarding and shifting it. A 2010 report by Visa cited a European Commission estimate that the cost to society of all payment methods is the equivalent of about 2-3 per cent of Europe’s GDP, of which cash accounts for two-thirds. A 2008 study by the McKinsey consultancy estimated that in Europe €60bn-€100bn annually is spent on processing cash payments, a figure that includes the production of notes and coins, transport and security. A similar study by the Dutch central bank puts the price tag at €300 per family. A number of Dutch supermarkets are talking about moving exclusively to cashless payments by 2014, in part to get away from cash handling costs. The motivation is the same for governments.In the UK, the percentage of cash transactions has already declined from about 73 per cent of all those taking place in 1999 to just 59 per cent in 2009, according to the Payments Council, the body responsible for ensuring that the country’s payment services work. During the same period, direct transfers from accounts and debit cards have increased rapidly. The council said the decline could accelerate as mobile payments take off, and that by 2050 using cash could be a minority activity.Economists have been puzzling for decades what a move away from cash might mean for the economy and the central money supply. Governments, after all, earn money from seigniorage – the profit from issuing coins and notes rated at more than their intrinsic value. The US Treasury department, for example, received $77bn in profits from the Federal Reserve in 2011. As long as most cashless payment systems are denominated in national currencies, as they are today, they are unlikely to change the government’s control over money supply.For now, however, while electronic payments remain mainly linked to national currencies, the biggest issues are security and privacy.Consumers are worried about thieves stealing their mobile phones and gaining access to their electronic wallet. A YouGov survey last year found that 20 per cent of UK consumers were concerned about security of mobile payments. These concerns are being addressed by protecting both the phone and the payments application with pin codes. Most mobile payment services permit just £15 to be spent before requiring a security code.Privacy is harder to deal with. Proponents of electronic payments, such as Visa, argue that they increase users’ command over their finances. “If I had taken out £40 from an ATM, I might have no idea where it went. With a mobile wallet, I can ask it for information – what my balance is, what my credit line is, and get electronic receipts. I can even arrange them in a pie chart to show how I am spending my money,” says Sandra Alzetta, head of mobile business and innovation at Visa Europe. “It provides me with a feeling of control and being able to budget. Consumers get that and like it very much.”But the idea that retailers, or governments, might be similarly tracking our spending through a trail of transactions raises fears. Some governments, such as France’s, have already indicated they hope moves to electronic spending will help cut criminality. It is estimated that Italy, a heavily cash-based economy, loses more than €100bn in unpaid tax every year. Notably, one of Mario Monti’s first acts upon taking over as Italian prime minister last November was to ban cash transactions of more than €1,000.A number of companies are planning to use electronic wallets to target consumers with personalised offers. “It’s aimed at making it easier for you to pay for and save on the goods you want, while giving merchants more ways to offer coupons and loyalty programs to customers,” Google wrote in a blog posting announcing the Wallet concept last May.But Google and others are already facing controversy over how they handle consumers’ private information, and these concerns are likely to be amplified when it comes to their use of data about people’s finances. “It is a human rights issue. You can’t take away people’s transactional privacy,” says Jon Matonis, an e-money consultant and author of The Monetary Future blog. “Do we really want a future in which there are no private transactions? It is not a world I would want to live in.“If a woman wants to have a private abortion, she can only do that in cash – or if a husband wants to support an illegitimate child without his wife knowing, he has to make those payments in cash. Privacy is only possible in cash, every other form is trace­able,” he says.For this reason, many believe cash will survive as a payment method. “Whether it is for illegal activity such as the drug trade or just for buying Christmas presents, there will always be a need for something like that,” says Professor Andrew Scott of London Business School.“Just as we have seen a huge reduction in the number of coins in use, we will see a huge reduction in cash. Whether it is going to be 10 per cent or 50 per cent less than today, we don’t know. But it is unlikely to ever disappear altogether.”
203;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-03-09T19:46:29Z;Cyberhackers are the most sinister of troublemakers;The practice has become a much more serious, society-threatening crime;There is at first sight a mystery about the six internet hackers revealed to be facing criminal charges in related cases in New York and Chicago on Tuesday. It is that one of the group’s ringleaders, Hector Xavier Monsegur, should have turned state’s evidence. Mr Monsegur pled guilty to several charges of hacking and conspiracy last August. He has since closed the net around his comrades. Intelligence agencies and prosecutors dream of finding a “grass” near the boss. But actually having an organisation rolled up by one of its key figures is rare.What made Mr Monsegur turn? After all, he and his associates were not just ideologically committed to a “free” internet – they were the best in their shady business. Between them, those indicted face allegations such as disrupting PayPal, MasterCard and Visa last autumn to protest their refusal to process donations to the secret-divulging website WikiLeaks. Government servers were allegedly infiltrated: Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen and Zimbabwe, the US Senate, and the Fine Gael party in Ireland. Prosecutors imply they took particular delight in hacking anti-hacking organisations: the FBI, the CIA website, the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Irish Garda and a number of private security companies.Many of the intrusions cited in the indictments were of media outlets sceptical of hacking in general and WikiLeaks in particular. Someone stole information about a Fox TV show, filched personal codes from employees of the Public Broadcasting System in the US, broke into Sony’s computers in Belgium, Russia and the Netherlands, and hacked the Tribune Company. One operation involved leaked passwords and emails from the online foreign-policy newsletter Stratfor. (Defenders of this attack who described Stratfor as a “shadow CIA” used the word “shadow” the way conspiracy theorists do: as a portentous and sinister-sounding synonym for “non-”.)The groups Mr Monsegur belonged to and the broader movement of hackers, known as Anonymous, cast themselves as either good-humoured or idealistic pranksters. Until recently there was sympathy for this view even among hackers’ most dogged adversaries in law enforcement. One of the Americans arrested this week had been sentenced to two years for a hacking offence half a decade ago. One of the Soca hackers had been arrested last year and released.But there has been a sea change in attitudes towards hacking. When the internet was a corner of the economy used by a few relative sophisticates, it was easier to analogise hacking to crimes such as breaking and entering or pickpocketing. But increasingly, the internet is the economy. Although hackers aim at institutions they find noxious, they inflict collateral damage on a lot of poor schlubs minding their own business.The charges unveiled this week include misuse of login credentials, publication of other people’s mail and filching hundreds of thousands of credit cards together with fraudulent use. Mr Monsegur had four car engines sent to him and used hacked credit cards to pay his own bills. Prosecutors in the Anglo-Irish case allege a “deliberate campaign of online destruction, intimidation, and criminality”. A favourite practice is doxing – revealing a great deal of personal data “with the object of, among other things, intimidating the victim and subjecting the victim to harassment”.To borrow the distinction Johan Huizinga drew in Homo Ludens, hackers are not cheats but spoilsports, a far more dangerous class of troublemaker. They don’t just threaten the outcome of a particular game or convention. They threaten the existence of the community that makes the game possible. Over time, hacking has become a much more serious, society-threatening crime – less like pickpocketing, say, than counterfeiting. All governments are bound to come down on it like a tonne of bricks. That is what flipped Mr Monsegur. Authorities were able to threaten him with 124 years in prison.Why did the US government permit the group around Mr Monsegur to carry out several devastating hacks in the seven months since they turned him? Perhaps it believes the group had the potential to engage in even more destructive operations. Anonymous has tried to feed this unease, posting on its Twitter feed: “LulzSec was a group, but Anonymous is a movement. Groups come and go, ideas remain.”True, but there is an ironic role-reversal here. Hackers used to be savvy futurists. They understood something about technology’s impact on society that others did not. But now it is they who have been passed by. Are hackers cyberterrorists or cyber-activists? The public is increasingly inclined to say the former. You have to be a bit stuck in 1998 to say the latter.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard
204;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-03-06T22:24:35Z;Anonymous hacker turns FBI informant;;Federal prosecutors have charged six alleged members of the Anonymous “hacktivist” group with conspiracy and computer hacking-related crimes after it emerged that an alleged leading member of the collective had turned informant of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Among those charged by the US Department of Justice in the US and elsewhere was Hector Xavier Monsegur, a New York resident whose online identity is alleged to be Sabu, one of Anonymous and LulzSec’s most prominent figures.Mr Monsegur has been co-operating with the FBI for months, a law enforcement official said.Others charged in the case include Ryan Ackroyd, alleged to use the online name Kayla, and Jake Davis, the teenager who police believe operated as Topiary, both among several arrests made in the UK last year as part of an international swoop against the hacker network.Anonymous is a large, amorphous group of so-called hacktivists who have aligned themselves with the anti-capitalist protesters Occupy Wall Street and the whistleblowing site WikiLeaks. They have carried out hacking raids on corporations and institutions including Sony, the CIA, News Corp’s British tabloid The Sun and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency.Court documents said that Mr Monsegur had been involved in denial-of-service attacks – whereby a site is flooded with so much traffic it becomes swamped and is knocked offline – against Visa, PayPal and MasterCard in December 2010. The attack was dubbed “Operation Payback” after the companies refused to process funds for WikiLeaks.The court papers said he had also hacked government IT systems in the Middle East, including Tunisia and Algeria.In an attack on News Corp’s Fox Broadcasting, Mr Monsegur is alleged to have stolen confidential information relating to contestants on the reality TV show X Factor. He is also accused of having used his hacking skills for personal gain, including credit card fraud and hijacking the systems of an automotive parts supplier to have thousands of dollars of engine components shipped to him.Although a key part of Anonymous’s philosophy is that it lacks hierarchy and is open to any volunteers, Sabu was among the most prominent members of the group alongside others with the online names Kayla, T-flow and Topiary, who claimed to execute some of its most aggressive online attacks, including on the security firm HBGary.In a posting to his Twitter account, which has remained silent since news of the arrests broke, Sabu told his 45,000 followers that the US government was run by “cowards”: “Don’t give in to these people. Fight back. Stay strong.” In his last public post, in German, he quotes Rosa Luxemburg, the German communist revolutionary: “The revolution says I am, I was, I will be.”“This is not the end of Anonymous,” said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, an internet security firm. “But it’s going to take them a while to recover from the paranoia they must be feeling right now. While Anonymous is often characterised as having no leaders, Sabu was clearly one they were looking up to. Now that they realise they should not have trusted Sabu, who can they trust?”
205;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-02-19T03:39:21Z;Success is built on concentrated effort to find bargains;Focusing on a few select stocks can pay off over the longer term;"Running concentrated funds is one way for active managers to avoid being labelled as index-huggers, failing to depart significantly from their benchmark indices. The question is whether investing with conviction delivers outperformance.Judging by the results from one such strategy, focusing on a few select stocks can pay off over the longer term. The Concentrated Value Equity Composite strategy, run by Chicago-based Harris Associates, which holds only 24 US stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 on an annualised return basis over three, five, 10 and 15 years, net of fees.It beat the index in 11 of the past 20 years, often substantially (in 2001 by 44 percentage points and in 2009 by 30 percentage points), while its worst underperformance was 9.5 percentage points in 1998. In 2011, it trailed by 4.5 percentage points.A Luxembourg-based mirror fund, the €146.86m Concentrated US Value Fund, launched in September, has underperformed so far, having returned 6.15 per cent (annualised) since launch in September, against 8.97 per cent for the S&P 500.Michael Mangan, one of three portfolio managers running the Concentrated US Value Fund, says all the portfolios run by Harris Associates are concentrated, typically holding either 18-22 stocks or 40-50. This approach is “born of a feeling that active management should be active”, he says.The group, which is owned by Natixis Global Asset Management and has $44.5bn under management, looks for companies it can buy at a discount to perceived value – ideally 60 cents on the dollar, a dollar representing what a “rational business person would pay”, says Mr Mangan. It looks also for “a business value that is growing over time”, and for management teams that “think and act like owners”, and have significant ownership.Finally, “we want the comfort that, when they have free cash flow they will use it in the best way for the business”.Managers select stocks from an approved list – of 160 for US portfolios, and tend to hold them long term. Mr Mangan says annual turnover on the portfolios is around 35 per cent.The focus on value means the Harris funds did not participate in the tech boom of the late 1990s, and like others who stuck to their style were “considered dinosaurs”. But, “we didn’t believe the math had changed”, says Mr Mangan. So they did no better than the market, sometimes worse, “only to be rewarded post crash”.In 2008, once again, “the math had not changed in terms of present value and future cashflows”, and although during the panic period, Mr Mangan and team did not perform any better than others, “we thought if we were right on valuation we should get paid more than average on the other side. We were up 57 per cent in the Concentrated [strategy] in 2009.”Being right on valuation is not just about buying cheap companies with low price/earnings ratios, he adds, pointing to the group’s holdings in Visa and Mastercard, which could be seen as growth businesses. “Our focus is on discount to value,” he says, describing how an opportunity came up late in 2010 to buy these companies cheaply thanks to one of the Dodd-Frank rule changes that capped the transaction fees for large card issuers.The stock price fell a lot on news of this change relative to the impact it would have on the business of Visa and Mastercard, says Mr Mangan. Debit card business makes up about 15-20 per cent of Visa’s US business, for example, and 50 per cent of its business is outside the US. “So 80 per cent of its business was not affected by the rule change – and that is growing at 13-14 per cent.”Investing in a few companies clearly has capacity implications. Harris has closed products in the past, says Mr Mangan, generally to ensure it has flexibility to pursue the best ideas and move the portfolio around.“In the current environment, for the concentrated strategy, we have $2bn-$3bn of additional capacity.” Much depends on the market environment: “If the market went to eight times earnings, there would be some good ideas to exploit; if it went to 20 times, there would be a lot less.”The group’s US balanced fund is closed to new investors, he adds, “because we can’t stomach buying any more bonds”, and its equity exposure is already close to 70 per cent – at the high end of the permitted range."
206;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-02-09T21:57:41Z;Muted share price reaction to foreclosure deal;;US bank stocks saw a mixed reaction, as US regulators announced a deal that could be worth up to $39.5bn to resolve allegations that the largest US mortgage lenders improperly foreclosed on homes.The five biggest lenders will take a $25bn hit on mortgage principal writedowns and interest payments but the majority will come out of existing reserves.This is just a shuffling of losses. There will be almost no impact on bank balance sheets this quarter,” said Richard Staite, US bank analyst at Atlantic Equities. Bank of America, which has $30bn in loan loss provision and an additional $8bn in litigation reserves according to Atlantic Equities research, climbed 0.6 per cent to $8.18, its highest level since August.But JPMorgan fell 1.2 per cent to $37.86, despite announcing that it will not require new reserves to cover its share of the settlement. Citigroup was off 1.7 per cent to $33.66 and Wells Fargo fell 0.2 per cent to $30.58.Exposure to legal risk stemming from the housing crisis has weighed heavily on bank share prices.But Tom Burnell at Wells Fargo cautioned that the banks remain open to litigation on mortgage origination and securitisation practices, as well criminal prosecutions by federal and state governments and claims brought by individual homeowners.News that leaders of the main Greek parties had reached a deal on spending cuts broke just before markets opened in New York, but US stocks barely flickered in response.“The market has seen such a big move up, that to break out again we need to see a significant catalyst, which the Greek deal is not,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.The S&P 500 closed up 0.15 per cent to 1,351.95 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1 per cent to 12,890.46.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,927.23, as Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, set an all-time high of $496., before falling back to $493.17, still up 3.5 per cent on the day.Reports suggested the company may launch a new iPad model in March, while Canaccord Genuity analysts said Apple shares could climb as high as $665 after its retail checks showed “strong sales trends for the iPhone 4S at all three US carriers and overall strong iPhone sales in international markets”.The S&P 500 is just 12 points short of its post-financial crisis closing high of 1,363 hit last April with Apple at the centre of that recovery.Technology stocks now account for 20 per cent of the benchmark US index’s market capitalisation, an increase of more than 10 per cent since April. The weighting of financials remains a full percentage point lower than last April. Payment processing companies have been one of the few bright spots for financials and Visa climbed 3.8 per cent to $112.42 yesterday, after reporting strong results that suggested new regulations on card payments were not weighing on the company.Visa’s shares are now up 60 per cent since the start of 2011, while those of MasterCard have climbed 77 per cent over the same period.But Donald Fanetti at Citigroup warned that credit card companies are likely to see a seasonal uptick in delinquencies when they publish data on parts of their portfolio next week, which could weigh on the stocks.Shares in PepsiCo fell 3.7 per cent to $64.27, after the company said it would cut 8,700 jobs and said “structural” changes, such as divestitures or joint ventures, would be considered if the North America beverage business does not show improvement in the next 18 months.Shares in Groupon fell 13.7 per cent to $21.75, after the discount coupon website declared a loss in its first quarterly earnings report as a public company.That eradicated gains made in the first two days of February, when Facebook’s IPO filing triggered a rally in social media stocks. It may also have generated profit for short-sellers, who had borrowed and sold more than two-thirds of available Groupon shares ahead of earnings.TripAdvisor fell 14.6 per cent to $28.29, after the online travel-recommendation service missed analyst estimates with its first earnings report since being spun off from Expedia.Lorillard, a cigarette maker, climbed 9.7 per cent to $124.37, after it lifted its dividend 25 cents to $1.55 in strong results. That helped rival Philip Morris climb 2.8 per cent to $80.06.Akamai Technologies surged 10.5 per cent to $38.06. The network server provider reported quarterly sales and profit that topped analyst estimates.Shares in Diamond Foods fell 37 per cent to $23.13 after the company ousted its chief executive and said it would restate its accounts after a probe. That put at risk Diamond’s planned purchase of the Pringles brand from Procter & Gamble, although shares in P&G were up 0.6 per cent to $64.04.Hospital operators sold off as a note from Gary Taylor at Citigroup said inpatient admissions in January fell 1.75 per cent compared to the same month in 2011.Tenet Healthcare fell 4.8 per cent to $5.58 and HCA was off 4 per cent to $27.80.
207;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
208;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-02-07T22:16:03Z;Regulatory fears weigh on money market managers;;Asset managers sold off Tuesday on reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to issuing proposals for the regulation of the US money-market fund industry.Federated Investors, whose $250bn in money market fund assets generate approximately 50 per cent of company profits according to analysts, fell 3.3 per cent to $18.03.Charles Schwab Corp, which manages approximately $160bn in money market fund assets, fell 2.8 per cent to $12.34. Bank of New York Mellon, another large player in the industry, was off 1.2 per cent to $21.69.Money market funds, which invest in highly liquid securities such as US Treasuries, are used by institutional investors to park large amounts of cash not invested elsewhere. But their reputation as safe havens suffered during the financial crisis, when investors in one fund were hit by losses.According to reports, the SEC will propose scrapping the funds’ fixed $1 net asset value and require the funds to set aside capital against losses. Floating net asset values would reduce the funds’ appeal as a cash substitute, while capital charges could eat into already meagre returns.“The proposals as reported could decimate the industry,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, “but if the market thought the proposals would go through unaltered, we’d be seeing bigger share price falls. The expectation is that the SEC has aimed high but will compromise.”Elsewhere, US stocks followed European indices lower in early trading as Greek default worries continued to weigh on sentiment but reversed course after a positive job openings report.US employers ended the year needing to fill 3.38m jobs, 258,000 more than at the end of November.“The total level of unfilled vacancies matches the peak in September and indicates the willingness of private employers to step up the pace of recruiting,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,347.05, within 16 points of its post-2008 high reached last year.UBS equity analysts argued the rally could have further to run, with risk appetite still well short of extreme levels and many investors yet to rotate out of defensive sectors into cyclical names.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,878.2, as shares in Coca Cola rose 0.8 per cent to $68.55 after earnings, and some adjustments, beat analyst expectations.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.1 per cent to 2,904.08, as shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the index, hit an all-time high of $469.43, before paring gains slightly to $468.83, a gain of 1.1 per cent.Coal miners sold off after an Environmental Protection Agency official told Congress the agency’s rules were “underpinning” a transition from coal to gas among US power producers.Alpha Natural Resources fell 5.2 per cent to $22.31, and Peabody Energy was off 3.8 per cent to $37.41.Banks stocks traded slightly lower, with Citigroup falling 0.7 per cent to $33.07, as it faced pressure from a key shareholder to raise its dividend.MasterCard hit an all-time high of $394.48 in the afternoon session, after announcing a doubling of its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share. The shares closed up 0.4 per cent at $392.91.Harman International climbed 3.9 per cent to $46.23, as the audio equipment manufacturer increased profits for a second successive quarter.Yum! Brands rose 2.6 per cent to $64.85, as the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut delivered a 30 per cent growth in profits and said it would open more restaurants abroad in 2012.John Ivankoe at JPMorgan was impressed that earnings growth accelerated in China despite the impact of inflation, while Credit Suisse analysts said the company might be able to increase margins further as commodity price inflation eased.Oil and gas explorer Anadarko Petroleum increased 5.2 per cent to $87.21 despite swinging to a fourth-quarter loss because of charges related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Adjusted earnings and revenue beat expectations.Shares in Leggett & Platt fell 5.9 per cent to $22.00 for the worst performance in the S&P 500, after fourth-quarter earnings declined on restructuring charges and weaker margins. The diversified manufacturer also guided below expectations for 2012 earnings.Groupon shares rallied 2.7 per cent to $24.19 ahead of the company’s first earnings report as a publicly traded company, which is scheduled for after the close of trading on Wednesday. The stock is down 1 per cent for the week, after gaining 22 per cent last week in a Facebook-fuelled social media rally.Despite generally positive numbers on Tuesday, analysts continued to fret about a relatively disappointing earnings season.“Year-over-year earnings per share growth for the index is undershooting expectations, tracking 8.5 per cent versus forecasts of 8.9 per cent,” noted Gina Martin Adams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo.
209;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-02-07T19:04:32Z;Itaú to buy out Redecard;;Itaú-Unibanco plans to spend almost $7bn to buy out credit card processing company Redecard, as Brazil’s biggest private sector lender fights for control of one of the most lucrative sectors of the country’s banking industry.Redecard and its rivals have posted some of the biggest gains on Brazil’s stock exchange recently as the surging middle class increases demand among retailers for card processing services.The São Paulo-based bank said on Tuesday it planned to buy the 49.99 per cent of Redecard it did not already own, offering R$11.77bn ($6.84bn) to take the company private.In the past 12 months, Redecard’s shares have risen 60 per cent, while the sector’s biggest company, Cielo, has soared about 80 per cent.However, competition has become fierce after Redecard and Cielo lost exclusivity agreements with MasterCard and Visa respectively in July 2010. Although the two groups still hold more than 80 per cent of the $400bn-a-year industry, new competitors have started to enter the market, such as Elavon from the US, following the end of the so-called duopoly.“After the market opened, new opportunities became available for lots of different companies as commercial establishments could just choose whatever machine they wanted,” said Luis Miguel Santacreu, an analyst at Austin Asis, a banking sector consultancy.According to a securities filing on Tuesday, Itaú will offer R$35 for each of the 336.39m Redecard shares currently trading on São Paulo’s stock exchange.The offer, which represented about a 9 per cent premium to Redecard’s closing price on Monday, caused the card processor’s shares to surge almost 10 per cent on Tuesday and notch up their biggest daily gain since October 2009.Provided the offer was approved by shareholders, Itaú said it planned to delist Redecard after acquiring the company’s outstanding shares.Aside from giving Itaú greater access to Brazil’s growing consumer class, the credit card processing sector was attractive because of its relative low costs and high returns, said Mr Santacreu.“The operational cost of credit cards is much lower than that of cheques, and banks can make money both from the commercial establishment where the machine is and also from the high rates the customers have to pay,” he said.“Also many Brazilians who don’t have current accounts at banks, have credit cards. It’s their first introduction to the banking system, so we are seeing an explosion in the number of credit cards being emitted.”According to Abecs, Brazil’s credit card and services association, more than half of purchases of groceries, petrol, and clothes in Brazil last year were made using electronic payment methods.However, when it came to leisure spending, 71 per cent of purchases were made using traditional methods such as cash.
210;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-02-03T11:35:36Z;The halfway mark;;This morning I received a call from a new admit who’s recently received his Kellogg offer, and has the same doubts that I had when I reached out to my Kellogg buddy around this time last year. The call made me realise that we’re past the halfway mark and have a little less than five months remaining of what has been an exceptionally fulfilling year.We’re a few weeks into the winter quarter and Jacobs (the main building of Kellogg, named after Donald Jacobs who dean from 1975-2001) seems like a repeat of the fall semester, with students walking about purposively with CVs and ensuring their hair is in place before entering the interview rooms.This time it’s mostly the first years looking for internships for the summer. Of course this is accompanied with hours of preparation, often with the final year students who’ve been there and done that recently. I can’t stress enough the collaborative culture at Kellogg. Just glad to have been able to be a part of it. It provides you with an opportunity to experience everyone’s successes and also share your lessons with your classmates.Of course I cannot write a post on Kellogg and Evanston in January without mentioning the snow! Those who’ve been following the column for sometime know how I had never seen snow and was eagerly awaiting the white blanket.I’m told it’s been a very mild winter by Chicago standards but we have had two-three days of continuous snowfall, which left this scenic suburb looking like a fairyland. A slippery one though.We also had the annual Kellogg marketing conference earlier this month. The sell out crowd of over 500 were thoroughly engaged by the keynote speakers – Mark Addicks, chief marketing officer of General Mills and Alfredo Gangotena, chief marketing officer of MasterCard.They day also included some highly stimulating conversations on the different panels on brand perception turnaround, creating dialogue with consumers: value co-creation and changing the game, mobile marketing (moderated by the superstar Prof Sawhney) and others.#kmc12, the chosen hashtag for the conference was making frequent appearances in all our Twitter timelines.I have to end the post on the epic basketball game played between Kellogg & Chicago Booth prior to the Chicago Bulls V Milwaukee Bucks NBA match at the United Center.It was an incredible experience to watch our classmates playing on the same court as Derrick Rose and others. Our boys made the evening that much memorable by giving us a 15-10 win over our friends from the city!
211;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-02-02T21:06:21Z;New tech stocks surge on Facebook’s IPO fizz;;Facebook’s $5bn IPO filing was a fillip for recently debuted internet businesses.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,859.68, handily outperforming other big US indices as stocks from Chinese social network Renren to offers website Groupon surged.Zynga benefited the most. Shares in the social-game developer climbed as much as 20 per cent to hit an all-time high of $12.91 before closing at $12.39, a gain of 16.8 per cent.That came after Facebook’s filing revealed Zynga accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook’s 2011 revenue, up from 10 per cent in the prior two years. Zynga shares ended the day comfortably above their $10 IPO price, for the first time since the company’s own stock market debut in December.But other moves appeared to have little to do with any Facebook-specific information.Professional networking website LinkedIn climbed 8.2 per cent to $76.87, Groupon climbed 7.4 per cent to $23.08 and Renren was up 8.2 per cent to $5.42. SINA, a Chinese social-media company, which owns a Twitter-like service, climbed as much as 5 per cent before closing up 1.9 per cent to $75.30.“This rally is really all about sentiment,” said Herman Leung, a tech analyst at Susquehanna. “We’re seeing big share price moves for anything with a whiff of social about it on no real news, while old school internet companies underperform.”Yahoo slipped 0.1 per cent to $15.72 and Google climbed 0.7 per cent to $585.11.Elsewhere, US stocks were generally flat with the S&P 500 inching up 0.1 per cent to 1,325.54.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,705.41, as Pfizer fell 0.9 per cent to $21.11 after the drug maker recalled 1m packets of birth control pills amid fears that faulty packaging could potentially lead to unwanted pregnancies.Merck shares also fell 0.5 per cent to $38.44 although Pfizer’s rival swung to a fourth-quarter profit, beating analyst expectations. The second-largest US drug maker by revenues predicted a relatively flat 2012, with profits expected to be hit by cheaper generic forms of its biggest product, asthma drug Singulair.Retail stocks were volatile as clothing stores updated investors on fourth-quarter expectations.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 13.7 per cent to a 52-week low of $40.40, as the clothing store warned fourth-quarter profit will come in well below expectations.The company said sales growth of 16 per cent in the quarter ended January 28 was driven almost exclusively by new store openings, as same-store sales came in flat.Rival clothing company Gap jumped 10.6 per cent to $21.52, despite forecasting a fall in same-store sales across its brands of 4 per cent and a 2 per cent fall in overall sales. Analysts had been braced for much worse, but sales at Banana Republic stores surprised on the upside.However, Robert Drbul at Barclays Capital noted that apparel, footwear and textiles stores underperformed the S&P 500 in January, while, “exposure to Europe remains a concern given the soft macroeconomic environment”.Earnings were responsible for other big movers, with JDS Uniphase falling 7.2 per cent to $12.19 even though quarterly earnings came in better than expected as the fibre optics manufacturer recovered strongly from supply-chain disruption in Thailand.Nikos Theodosopoulos at UBS downgraded JDS to “neutral” from a “buy” recommendation, telling clients that, “while orders looked good we struggle to place a higher than 15 [times earnings] multiple on JDSU’s cyclical business.”Qualcomm shares climbed 2 per cent to $60.73 as strong sales of smartphones drove demand for its wireless networking products, helping deliver better than expected fiscal first-quarter results and strong guidance for 2012.“A healthy market, ongoing share gains and conservative guidance should yield further upside in the shares,” said Jeff Kvaal at Barclays Capital.CME Group rose 8.4 per cent to $257.13. The largest US exchange group by market capitalisation said fourth-quarter profit rose, with a tailwind from an Illinois tax benefit. Meanwhile NYSE Euronext rallied 1.9 per cent to $26.94 after retreating on Wednesday, as the European Commission blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.Electronic Arts gained 6.1 per cent to $19.57 after the second-largest US video-game publisher reported a 70 per cent increase in third-quarter profit.MasterCard shares, which climbed 66 per cent in 2011, were on the move again, gaining 6.7 per cent to $381.57. The credit-card company delivered strong earnings, once a $495m after-tax charge against litigation was stripped out of fourth-quarter numbers.
212;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard profits sunk by litigation costs;;MasterCard, the payment processing network, on Wednesday said that it took a $495m after-tax charge in the fourth quarter related to litigation against what otherwise were better than expected earnings.MasterCard and Visa, its rival, face lawsuits from merchants alleging price fixing over fees. MasterCard said that the fourth-quarter charge represented the company’s financial portion of the potential settlement in these cases, which have carried on for several years. A trial is expected to commence in September.Excluding the charge, consumers’ increasing propensity to spend money using credit and debit cards drove a 24 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit from the same quarter a year ago. Net income was $514m, or $4.03 per share, in the three months ended December 31, beating analysts’ estimates for net income of $498m and $3.91 per share. Net revenue increased 20.2 per cent to $1.7bn, matching Wall Street forecasts.“We are seeing sustained momentum driven by new deals and the ongoing shift away from paper-based payments,” said Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s president and chief executive officer.Including the charge, however, MasterCard reported net income of just $19m, or $0.15 cents per share in the fourth quarter versus net income of $415m and $3.17 per share in the same quarter a year ago.By mid-morning in New York, shares had surged 6 per cent to $379.02.In the quarter, processed transactions rose 23.2 per cent to 7.7bn, the company said, while the amount spent on MasterCard branded cards rose 16.3 per cent to $863bn. As of December 31, the company’s customers had issued 1.8bn MasterCard and Maestro brand cards, up more than 11 per cent from the previous year.The increase in MasterCard’s volumes came in spite of sluggish US economic growth in the second half of last year and an escalating debt crisis in Europe.“For the full-year, despite ongoing uncertainties, we posted strong performance ahead of our long-term objectives,” Mr Banga said.For the full-year 2011, the company had net income of $2.4bn, or $18.70 per share, excluding the litigation charge in the fourth quarter. Last year, MasterCard stock rose 66 per cent, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500.Company officials said they were confident MasterCard could achieve a compound annual growth rate of 12 to14 per cent in net revenues and at least 20 per cent in earnings per share this year and next.MasterCard’s financial results are seen as a barometer of broad-based consumer spending. American Express last month reported higher than expected earnings for the fourth quarter, capping a year of record cardholder spending, but its customers are more affluent.
213;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-01-23T12:59:19Z;Look to history for profitable stockpicking;Sector trends can deceive: there is no substitute for stock selection;The growth, proliferation and popularity of exchange traded funds has had consequences not all of which are beneficial.Today investors need no longer discern and analyse the differences between Exxon and Chevron since the Energy Select Sector ETF provides an opportunity to own both. And while the Technology Select Sector ETF, the short-cut to own S&P tech stocks, gives you both Apple and Google, you also end up with some MasterCard stock.As might be expected, this has created more interest in group, sector and top-down approaches. No longer need investors analyse individual balance sheets or income statements. Instead, analysts focus on macro issues such as the price of oil, or the trend of consumer spending, while strategists and chartists detail correlations, sector rotation, and group movements.Leaving aside the critical issue of whether ETFs truly track the intended group or basket (which too often they do not), the reality is that historically we have had limited information on group movements. Some stocks have been labelled “early market cycle”, which contends that they should be leaders in the early stages of a bull market. Foremost among these have always been small stocks that, the conventional wisdom holds, are sensitive to slight changes in the economy and can react quickly. Unfortunately, the data do not support this and only in the 1974 rally were small stocks in the vanguard.One of the difficulties in analysing historical sector performance has been the lack of data. For one, the S&P had approximately 100 groups, 20 of which might have been considered consumer-orientated. In 2001 S&P introduced 10 economic sectors, which made analysis somewhat easier but their data were only backdated to 1989. My firm subsequently took the data back to 1962 and then beyond.Like most analysts I have always been intrigued by the idea that there is some map or trend of group movements. Surely, as an economy expands, individuals spend more and corporations invest in new plants, but when does this show up in stock prices? While there has always been an abundance of anecdotal commentary, there has been little in the way of detailed, rigorous analysis.Using our extended data we produced a detailed three-volume analysis of stock, bond and economic cycles, with a view towards developing a road map. We found that the cliché “it’s different this time” was true. It was different every time and, while there are trends and tendencies, none is chiselled in stone templates. Nevertheless, we found that understanding historical tendencies and making intelligent adjustments could be profitable.One tendency that soon became apparent was that financial stocks perform best in the early stages of a bull market. There have been eight bull markets since 1962 and financial names have outperformed with an average gain of 129 per cent versus 117 per cent. But excluding the 1990s rally when banks, insurers and other financials gained 664 per cent or more than double the markets’ 301 per cent, this group underperformed in the other seven bull markets: 70 per cent versus 96 per cent. More importantly, 44 per cent of the ultimate gain was made in only the first two months.In effect, bank stocks underperformed after their initial surge and in the 1974 and 1998 bull markets lost money after the initial stage. In the current rally, financials have gained 50 per cent in the first eight weeks and were up 75 per cent after only 10. To date the sector is up 101 per cent so, by coincidence, almost half the gain was in the first eight weeks and 75 per cent in the first 10.I have regularly recommended that investors do not buy financial names, not necessarily because of housing, Europe or regulations, but rather as a result of history.Healthcare is a sector that has sometimes prospered early in bull markets, sometimes at the later stages. In the past, when drugs were considered growth names, they did well at the end of the rally. More recently, they are viewed as defensive and have become early cycle names. Hence, like financials, I view them as stocks to own no longer.In the debate regarding correlation and its allegedly negative impact on individual stock picking, I dissent. Avoiding the banks, insurers, and brokers would have added 359 basis points to an S&P portfolio in 2011 and – as we did – avoiding GE as well, which many view as financially related, would have taken a portfolio gain to well over 4 per cent.This exercise not only refutes the contention that stock selection is unrewarding in today’s environment but also suggests that elements of market timing can be beneficial. Here I am not suggesting the day-to-day effort of trying to outguess the market but a better understanding of historical trends and reality.Laszlo Birinyi is the founder and president of Birinyi Associates
214;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Barcelona first ‘tap and go’ city in Europe;;La Caixa, Spain’s largest retail bank, will on Thursday begin rolling out contactless, “tap and go” payments cards and terminals across Barcelona, in one of the biggest deployments of the financial services technology in Europe.The bank will issue 1m cards to its customers containing a wireless computer chip which transmits payment straight to a merchant’s terminal when it is waved or tapped on a special reader. La Caixa is providing 17,000 payment terminals to merchants across the city, to ensure that customers can pay with a single tap everywhere from the largest department store to the smallest tobacconist’s shop.The bank, which has teamed up with Visa Europe for the project, will also provide 500 ATM machines with contactless readers.Contactless payments are beginning to be introduced in many parts of the world, with banks and payment services companies such as Visa and MasterCard hoping the system will gradually replace the use of physical cash for small purchases.Banks receive a small fee for processing card payments – typically about 0.5 per cent per transaction for La Caixa – and are keen to extend the use of cards as far as possible. Card payments also allow them to collect data on their customers shopping and lifestyle habits, which can be valuable for sales and marketing purposes.“The payment industry is changing and we want to have a leading position in this technology. It is a tool that creates a lot of convenience for customers, and will increase the share of card payments,” Antonio Massanell, managing director of Caixabank, said.Although La Caixa is issuing the wireless chip embedded in traditional-looking bank cards, they can also be embedded in mobile phones or watches. Samsung already makes handsets containing payment chips and a number of other contactless-enabled mobile phones are expected on the market this year.Last year, Google partnered MasterCard and Sprint, the telecoms operators, to launch the Google Wallet, for mobile payments. Restaurant chains such as McDonald’s and Starbucks have introduced contactless card readers across their stores, and Orange and Barclaycard launched a mobile payment system in the UK last year.However, Barcelona will be the first European city in which the technology will be close to ubiquitous. Barcelona was selected as a starting point because La Caixa hopes to showcase the technology during next month’s Mobile World Congress, the key trade show for the mobile phone industry.Mr Massanell said the bank would spend about €9m on equipping Barcelona, and would spend between €35m and €40m extending the programme across Spain over the next three years.La Caixa, which has 10.5m customers, carried out pilot programmes for the payment system in Sitges, a small town in Catalonia, and in the Balearic Islands, which Mr Massanell said had been a “great success”.Some 86 per cent of cardholders in those trials said they preferred using contactless cards, and merchants saw a 23 per cent increase in sales volumes.
215;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-01-11T17:32:04Z;Brussels turns its sights on card fees;;Brussels has launched a fresh assault on fees charged to process card transactions, arguing that new legislation may be needed to promote competition and reduce costs for consumers.The European Commission has unveiled proposals for payments – by card, online and via mobile phones – that are designed to reshape a market they believe is fragmented, costly, averse to improving and serves consumers badly.The most controversial proposal is a legislative solution to so-called interchange fees which are charged by banks to process credit and debit card payments. These have been the subject of regulatory trench warfare in Brussels for more than a decade and have involved competition inquiries and court cases.Opening a consultation on new rules to “increase legal clarity” tacitly admits that Brussels’ previous attempts to curb interchange fees using existing competition law may have failed. The commission believes a big increase in the volume of card payments handled by groups such as Visa and Mastercard has not been translated into lower fees.The US and Australia already have laws on such fees. The commission is examining whether new EU rules are needed to lower fee levels, to enforce transparency on charges – now largely hidden to consumers – or to open access to competitors.Harmonising rules more closely has also been suggested for surcharging. Merchants would have to make clear the different charges associated with card transactions so that consumers would have more choice.The payments industry is wary of more legislation on fees and transparency. It argues that intervening in a market that works relatively efficiently may end up backfiring by reducing investment in new technology and by increasing costs.In 2007, European competition regulators decided that interchange fees on cross-border payments violated EU rules. In coming months, a legal ruling is expected from the European Court of Justice on an appeal by Mastercard against this decision.After gathering views on whether new laws are necessary, European officials will decide later this year whether to make proposals towards the end of 2012 or in 2013.Alongside the initiative on interchange fees, the commission is putting forward measures to promote competition in electronic payments. These measures could involve promoting more transparency, separating card schemes from payment processing, and providing stronger incentives for standardisation.“Inefficient payments systems within the EU unduly raise transaction costs, undermine the global competitiveness of the European economy and limit its potential for growth,” said Joaquin Almunia, the EU competition commissioner.One area of particular concern is payments by mobile phone. Europe has lagged the world in introducing this technology. Michel Barnier, the internal market commissioner, said that “the US, Japan and Korea are ahead of us and we want to catch up”. The proposals examine what security and data privacy is required around such transactions, as well as what level of harmonisation of standards and of inter-operability would be needed to foster a pan-European market for mobile and online payments.
216;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-01-10T22:41:20Z;Enabling mobile payments;;"Since mobile phones first became popular, technologists have been looking for ways to turn them into electronic wallets. The aim is to let customers leave cash and plastic cards at home by enabling them to use their handsets to buy anything from a cup of coffee to a new car.Several technologies have emerged to facilitate payment, including simple text messaging, infra red, and radio frequency systems such as Bluetooth and near field communication (NFC).The problem is uncertainty over which will predominate. As with video recording in the 1980s, the myriad companies keen to participate in mobile payments are worried about making the wrong technical choice. They don’t want to be a Betamax equivalent in a world of VHS.“It is still early days, and the lack of services using existing standards is making mobile payments relatively slow to take off,” says Ted Bissell, managing consultant at PA Consulting in New York.NFC, the most technically advanced option, stores relevant information on a chip and has been installed on some Android handsets for three years. Yet relatively few customers have used it because most service providers have not yet activated the chip for financial products.Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone does not include NFC, and the company remains publicly uncommitted as to whether it will be built into iPhones in future.There has been some progress. Last year saw: the launch of Google’s Android-based eWallet and MasterCard’s PayPass in the US, while in the UK Starbucks trialled the Quick Tap PayPass service, and in France BNP Paribas and Orange introduced NFC mobile payments.But with industry practices not yet established, it is unclear whether customers would easily be able to switch between services and suppliers. “The operators are still bickering about who will control the mobile wallet,” says Mr Bissell.“Many customers may not want to be ‘locked in’ to one company or consortium. Legislators are looking at it, to the discomfort of participants such as mobile operators,” he adds.One mobile payment technology based on well established standards is M-PESA, which is has proved hugely popular in Kenya and Tanzania. It enables people without bank accounts to settle bills and transfer funds via text message.The funds are held in accounts managed by the mobile operator Safaricom. “Some 80 per cent of the population adopted M-PESA within five years of launch, and similar uptake is expected in Bangladesh, Pakistan and South America,” Mr Bissell says.In these regions, there is a lack of banking infrastructure and text-based payments work well because they are more secure than cash. However, they are unlikely to be approved by regulators in more developed regions.Even NFC is not seen as particularly secure, says Keith Brown, chief executive of Paythru, which enables people to transfer funds via the cloud for applications such as parking charges.The maximum budget limit of £100 for NFC transactions has not been increased in the three years since it was introduced. This suggests not much progress has been made on security, says Mr Brown.“By using the cloud, nothing is stored on the phone, making the system much more safe and secure.” People will authenticate themselves with biometrics such as fingerprint or voice identification, he says.One reason why mobile payment has not taken off in the developed world is that there is no compelling reason to use it, says Benjamin Ensor, a director at Forrester Research. “There are no payments that you can only use mobile for. It lacks the sort of trigger that PayPal had on eBay.The fact that there are always alternatives means people will use the system they are familiar with, Mr Ensor says.He believes one of the biggest opportunities could be creating an easy way to pay small traders such as taxi drivers, music teachers or sports clubs, for which cheques are typically used. Companies focused on this market include US-based Square, and iZettle, headquartered in Sweden.As for establishing a standard, Mr Ensor says there is no reason why only one technology should dominate or be the winner; there could be several approaches.“The danger of financial institutions focusing too much on standards is in missing the boat. It increases the likelihood of an outsider such as Apple, Google or PayPal coming in and catalysing the business, leaving the banks flat-footed behind.”Another impetus could be the ability to offer real time vouchers and coupons relevant to people’s location.Technology is accelerating and unleashing creativity, Mr Ensor says. “In the past two years, we have seen a lot of change and we think there is quite a big chance for a disrupter to come in, perhaps using existing processes and networks in a new way that is faster, cheaper and better.”The list of companies competing for a slice of what most believe will be a huge market, is formidable. It includes mobile operators, banks, handset manufacturers, operating system suppliers, e-commerce companies, retailers and social networks.There need to be standards, says Mr Ensor. The last thing anybody wants is systems that are not interoperable.“But whereas we only needed one way to record TV, VHS or Betamax, there is no reason why we shouldn’t have several standards to make mobile payments depending, for example, on whether we are buying petrol at the pump, paying a utilities bill, or shopping online.”"
217;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-01-06T22:00:11Z;US stocks start year on front foot;Strong US data buoy markets;US stocks started the year on an upbeat note as economic data continued to surprise on the upside.By the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was 1.8 per cent higher over the week at 1,280.68, breaking above its 200-day moving average, an indication some investors think the rally has further to run.After opening lower on Wednesday and Thursday, the benchmark index turned positive each day as stocks gathered momentum, almost repeating the trick on Friday but closing down slightly.“At open, the market is still dominated by European fears,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers Investment Research. “But it’s a positive sign that bulls are tending to take charge on the realisation that the US economy appears to be improving faster than expected.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average produced a weekly gain of 1.2 per cent at 12,359.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.7 per cent to 2,674.22.Stocks along the hard disk drive supply chain rallied on higher than expected fourth-quarter shipments. Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices. Several analysts are predicting a quarterly loss for the company on Monday.
218;MA;Mastercard Inc;2012-01-05T20:03:10Z;US groups have $2tn to play with this year;;The biggest US companies may have as much as $2tn in cash available to spend in 2012, powering a potential surge in share buy-backs and dividend payments.A combination of cash on the books plus low levels of leverage and strong expected profits add up to just under $2tn that could be available for non-financial groups in the S&P 500, according to figures compiled by JPMorgan Chase.Amid a struggling global economy, US companies in most industries have been hesitant to launch major new investments or complete large acquisitions, and have been primarily using cash to repurchase their shares and pay dividends.“If more firms were optimistic about the future and seeing new opportunities, this money could go to investment,” said Marc Zenner, head of Corporate Finance Advisory at JPMorgan. “Doing share buy-backs is a less risky option, especially when valuations are low. It shows capital discipline and enthusiasm about the stock’s future, and can also fend off activists,” he said.With large, non-bank companies continuing to delever from peak levels in 2007, the average debt-to-earnings ratio of two times is below the 2.4 times average seen from 1996 to 2009. They also have 11.3 per cent of their assets in cash on average, versus 7.3 per cent from 1996 to 2009.If these figures reverted to historical averages, in part through new issuance of debt, it would generate about $1.2tn in cash, JPMorgan said. That would be in addition to roughly $800bn of cash on hand and anticipated 2012 free cash flow.Last year, large US corporates spent $336bn on share buy-backs from the fourth quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2011, the most recent quarter for which figures are available, the most since 2007. They also raised dividend pay-outs by 11 per cent in 2011.Some $40bn of those buy-backs were financed by issuance of debt. Fitch Ratings has projected that figure will probably increase this year, as yields for the most creditworthy corporate borrowers are near record lows due to investor demand for the relative safety of bonds.“I don’t think buy-backs are going to slow. There’s so much cash on the sidelines that shareholders want,” said Robert Leonard, managing director of the special equity transactions group at Citigroup.Mr Leonard projects that buy-back activity will remain in the $75bn-$100bn a quarter range, and that companies will continue to raise dividends, given investor demand for yield.Groups such as Intel and Home Depot raised debt to fund share buy-backs of more than $2bn last year. Companies that enter 2012 with cash greater than 10 per cent of assets and low debt include many software companies, such as Microsoft and Google, but also groups such as MasterCard, the payment processing firm, and Accenture, the consultancy.Cash spent on shares and dividends has also been a positive factor for the stock market’s performance during a volatile year.

220;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:26:46+0000;Assange final extradition appeal date set;;Julian Assange, founder of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks, will get a final opportunity to avoid extradition to Sweden in relation to sexual allegations after the UK’s Supreme Court said it would hear his case.The UK’s highest court said it had granted him permission to appeal against an earlier court ruling that he should return to Sweden to face claims by two Swedish women of “non-consensual, coerced” sex. He denies the allegations.The Supreme Court hearing will take place over two days in February and is critical because it represents Mr Assange’s last chance to avoid extradition.If Mr Assange loses the case he will have exhausted his legal options in the British courts, although he could potentially appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.The Supreme Court has assigned seven justices to hear the appeal because of the great public importance of the issue that it raises – namely whether a prosecutor is a judicial authority.The decision means the Australian campaigner, who is on bail, will spend a further Christmas at Ellingham Hall, the Norfolk manor from which he has been running WikiLeaks for the past year.The decision gives fresh impetus to Mr Assange’s team after a legal battle that has dragged on for a year and comes at a critical time for WikiLeaks, which is focusing its efforts on fundraising.Mr Assange has said that the site must raise $3.5m (£2.2m) before the end of the year to continue operating, after what he called a “financial blockade” preventing payments to the group through Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and other online transaction providers.The release of thousands of US diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks last year has led to growing hostility to Mr Assange in the US.News of Mr Assange’s new court hearing comes as Bradley Manning, a US army intelligence analyst suspected of being behind the biggest leak of classified US documents in history, makes his first court appearance in a pre-trial hearing on Friday. He faces multiple charges including aiding the enemy, which could bring life imprisonment.Mr Manning is suspected of being the source of documents that last year eventually made their way to the WikiLeaks website.

The news sent the shares up 15 per cent on Thursday.“In times of economic strife, fraud goes up,” Rob Cotton, chief executive said, adding that companies were becoming increasingly aware of cybercrime.UK government officials have said hacking and other cyber-related crimes cost the economy £27bn a year, and a number of recent high-profile corporate hacking cases have helped to highlight the issue.In the past year Visa and MasterCard have been attacked, as well as the CIA and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency. In April this year, Sony hired NCC after more than 70m user records were compromised.The Manchester-based group said it now expected pre-tax profits of between £21m and £21.5m for the year to May 2012 compared with analyst forecasts of £19.6m.It cited stronger growth in its assurance business, which tests the security of websites and carries out forensic investigations for companies that have been attacked. Mr Cotton said demand for his “ethical hacking” teams – dispatched to determine security loopholes – had grown significantly.He added that iSec, the Californian security company NCC acquired last year, was now “paying a dividend”.The company, which counts 94 of the FTSE 100 companies as clients, also said its escrow business, which holds the source codes for clients’ software, was in line with expectations.While this side of the business is higher margin, contributing over three quarters of group profit, its growth rate has slowed in the past year.“Trading in escrow is recovering,” Alex Jarvis at Peel Hunt said. Jonathan Imlah at Collins Stewart said the escrow business would continue to grow, albeit slightly less than in the first half of last year.NCC shares, which have risen by 22 per cent since the start of the year, closed up 102p at 778.5p on Thursday.
222;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-12-06T19:57:10Z;Mobile payment: Verizon must take care;If it appears to be forcing customers to use its own payments tool it will alienate them;"To understand the mobile phone payments gold rush, look at the volumes of the traditional payment networks. Visa processed a total of $5.8tn in payments in the past year; MasterCard had $3.1tn. Even little newcomer PayPal (owned by Ebay) handles well over $100bn a year in transactions. The potential is huge.Wireless network operators, internet companies and phone manufacturers look at numbers of that magnitude and get excited. If the mobile phone replaces credit or debit cards as the default payment tool for even a small proportion of consumers, and the companies that make this happen capture even a sliver of the value of those transactions, or add just a bit of value to them, the resulting profits will be large indeed. The idea is not to replace existing payment networks such as Visa’s, but to use smartphones on top of those networks, combining payments with coupons, Groupon-style daily deals, and other services.The first handsets with “near-field communication” chips, enabling payments with a wave of the phone, are appearing now. Every big carrier globally wants in. AT&T, T-Mobile USA and Verizon have formed a US mobile payments joint venture called Isis. Payment start-up Square raised $100m in funding this summer. Google has rolled out its “Wallet” application on Sprint’s network.There is already friction. Google disclosed on Monday that when Verizon rolls out the Nexus, an NFC-enabled Samsung handset running on Google’s software, it will not support Wallet. Verizon claims there is a hardware integration issue; Google says the Nexus is Wallet-ready. Verizon must tread carefully. The mobile payments war will be won on service quality and on the number of retail outlets at which the payments are accepted. If Verizon appears to be forcing its customers to use its own payments tool it will alienate, not profit from, them.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

225;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:26:46+0000;Visa warms to jump in LatAm card growth;;Credit and debit cards payments in Brazil are expected to grow at rates in the “mid-20 per cent levels” for the foreseeable future, according to Visa, the world’s largest payment processing company.The increase is being driven by the growing number of people joining the middle-class in Latin America’s biggest economy coupled with increasing formal employment and internet use, said William Sheedy, group president for the Americas of Visa.“The combination of high growth and sustainability not to mention the size of the Brazilian economy – it’s a bit of a triple play,” Mr Sheedy said.Brazil and other Latin American countries have become one of the most promising new frontiers for payment-processing companies led by Visa and MasterCard at a time when their core US and European markets are slowing down.Visa reported a 40 per cent surge in quarterly profit in the three months to the end of June while MasterCard said net profit had risen 32.8 per cent during the same period, helped by a rise in their global businesses, including in Brazil.Billing volumes using cards in Brazil increased 22 per cent last year to R$541.9bn (US$309.2bn) compared to a year earlier while the number of cards in circulation rose 11 per cent to 628m, according to the Brazilian association of credit card and services companies.The association predicts that the volume of transactions will increase 18.6 per cent this year after growing annually between 2000 and 2010 at 23 per cent.“The increase in bank account penetration and credit, higher personal spending, increasing consumer acceptance of credit cards, and movement to a more formal marketplace are the main drivers that should support rapid growth of the market,” Fitch said in a report earlier this year on Redecard, the Brazilian credit card company.Electronic payment penetration remains low in Brazil at about 30 per cent of transactions compared with about 60 per cent in the US, Visa’s Mr Sheedy said.Visa’s payment volumes in Brazil, the amount of transactions directly paid for using its cards, was about US$200bn.But consumers were also using Visa cards to withdraw an additional $300bn in cash from automatic teller machines, which they then used to pay for transactions.Converting this additional $300m into transactions paid for electronically with cards rather than cash represented a tangible near-term opportunity, Mr Sheedy said.“When you look at the total Brazilian economy which is just around US$2,100bn, it’s a place that for far into the future is going to continue to drive strong double-digit growth rates,” he said.Brazilian consumer defaults have risen steadily this year in line with an increase in interest rates. But Mr Sheedy said these trends were not expected to affect Visa’s margins, which mostly depend on transaction volume rather than trends in credit quality.
226;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-11-03T22:28:43Z;Consumers to reclaim personal information;;Consumers will soon be able to reclaim their personal information from banks, telecoms providers, utilities and other companies, to help them learn about their consumption habits and switch for better deals.Under the Midata scheme put forward by the government, dozens of businesses are expected to make customer data available in a standardised, reusable digital format by early next year.They include banks such as RBS and Lloyds, utilities such as British Gas, EDF and Scottish Power, credit firms such as Callcredit, MasterCard and Visa, and internet companies Three, Google and Moneysupermarket.com.Ctrl-Shift, a consultancy on consumer empowerment which has been advising the government, estimates that the companies’ combined customer base amounts to about 20m people.For example, a money management service could be created without having to share online banking passwords with a third party, allowing analysis of spending on groceries or links to price-comparison sites.“We believe if we can pull this off, it has huge growth potential for our economy and for British businesses,” said Ed Davey, employment minister. “There are many service providers across business sectors who increasingly have personal data on individual citizens but it’s not a data relationship that’s balanced. The ability of citizens to access that data are limited.”Nigel Shadbolt, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Southampton and an adviser to the prime minister on data issues, including opening up public-sector information, added: “We believe this is a new kind of environment that promises absolutely new kinds of services.”Ctrl-Shift believes that industries will emerge to help manage personal data, aggregate information to help consumers manage their lives better, and help them make better decisions.Few such companies currently exist. One example is Billmonitor, a partner in the Midata initiative which obtains information about phone bills by “scraping” information from websites. “That’s a huge amount of effort with needless amounts of friction,” said Mr Shadbolt.Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, an internet freedom campaign group, warned against potential abuses of the newly-freed personal information.“Getting your data back is good,” he said. “But Midata must be accompanied by a stronger Data Protection Act, with a right to delete your data, or consumers could be victims of parasitic data or finance companies tempting people to share more than is good for them.”Mr Davey said that he hoped greater transparency would foster trust between businesses and consumers, which is “not as great as it may have been a few years ago”.The Midata initiative, though not enforced by regulation, set out nine principles, such as using standardised formats, secure storage, and a licence for unrestricted reuse of personal data.In the coming months, partner companies will develop “personal data inventories” detailing what information is available about each customer and set out privacy and security protocols. The first data are expected to be released by the middle of 2012.
227;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-11-02T23:50:47Z;MasterCard reports strong growth;;MasterCard reported strong revenue growth in the third quarter as chief executive Ajay Banga said “we are still seeing the consumers spend” in spite of sluggish economic growth in the US and worries that Europe will fall into recession.Revenue rose 27 per cent year on year to $1.8bn, the company said on Wednesday, with net income up 38.4 per cent at $717m and earnings per share 43 per cent higher at $5.63.“We are really not seeing any significant impact on our numbers on what’s going on [in the global economy] even in the US or in many countries in Europe,” said Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer.Mr Banga acknowledged that inflation played a part in the increased US revenues in the three months to the end of September but he also pointed to a 22 per cent increase in debit card volumes in the US as consumers preferred plastic to cash and MasterCard persuaded banks, including SunTrust to adopt the company as its card payment network rather than Visa. The US accounts for a third of the company’s transactions by volume.Even if the economic picture darkens, MasterCard said it should still benefit from the long-term move from cash to electronic forms of payment. “Eighty-five per cent of the world’s transactions are still in cash,” said Ms Hund-Mejean. “That is a real piece of work that we are going after. You can see that as a huge opportunity that will last us for many many years to come.”But company executives also suggested that the sharp increase in revenue and profits might not be matched next year. They said they were sticking to a pledge for operating margin to be at 50 per cent, even though it rose to 55 per cent in the third quarter.The company faces regulatory challenges in the US, where last year’s Dodd-Frank Act caps the fees charged to retailers for processing debit card transactions. But analysts said that Visa, a much bigger player in US debit, had the most to lose.“There are still a lot of moving pieces in the US debit landscape,” said Mr Banga. “We are in a completely different competitive situation from others in the debit space and do not have the need to defend a large incumbent position.”The company also set aside $500m for lawsuits by retailers alleging price fixing. “At this time, it is not possible to put an upper limit on this loss due to the significantly higher demands by the class plaintiffs, which are unacceptable to MasterCard,” said Mr Banga.Shares in the company rose 7.4 per cent by midday in New York. The stock is up 60 per cent this year compared with a 30-60 per cent decline for some of the biggest US banks.
228;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-11-02T22:21:19Z;MasterCard surges after rise in card spending;Wall Street sees wider bounce;Shares in MasterCard surged on Wednesday after the credit and debit card company said spending on its cards was up 18.1 per cent in the quarter to the end of September, compared with the same period last year. Shares rose 7 per cent to $357.66.“The MasterCard results show no signs of a macro slowdown, even in Europe,” said Glenn Greene at Oppenheimer Securities.The spending surge did not appear to be driven by higher consumer borrowing: spending on US credit cards was up 7 per cent year on year, whereas debit cards were up 23 per cent.Wall Street saw a wider bounce, with the S&P 500 up 1.6 per cent to 1,237.90. The benchmark index had pared early gains as Fed president Ben Bernanke said inflation would stay below its 2 per cent target through 2014, but the index moved higher again in the afternoon.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 2.8 per cent, as much as any other sector, in a clear sign of a Europe-driven rally. Bank of America rose 5 per cent to $6.72 and Morgan Stanley 3.3 per cent to $16.76.But insurer Genworth Financial saw the biggest bounce, up 5.7 per cent to $6.17. Genworth has been one of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500 in recent months, with investors wary of its vulnerability to the eurozone.Bank stocks had plunged on Tuesday after the Greek prime minister’s call for a referendum on his country’s eurozone bail-out, but on Wednesday some investors found reasons to be cheerful about the latest twist in Europe’s saga.“Because politicians can change their minds once in power, a referendum could bring more clarity on the issue and force more decisive resolutions than we have seen through the negotiation process,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 11,836.04 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.3 per cent to 2,639.98.Wireless network providers surged after the House of Representatives voted on Monday to bar new state and local taxes on wireless services. The bill was passed on Tuesday. MetroPCS, a national wireless provider, was up 11.9 per cent to $8.57, while Clearwire was up 10.3 per cent to $2.04.Infrastructure contractor Quanta Services was up 11.6 per cent to $22.14 after it said one of its units would be part of a venture that would build Transcanada’s Keystone XL Pipeline.EOG Resources jumped 11.8 per cent to $96.04 as it raised its output of lucrative liquid gas and oil. Liquids production was up 49 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. EOG was spun off from Enron a decade ago as a domestic natural gas driller, but the company has turned to crude oil as natural-gas prices have slumped.Pioneer Natural Resources, which has also struggled to navigate falling natural gas prices, leapt 12.6 per cent to $91.16. The company has suffered significant hedging losses in recent quarters, but this quarter it booked profits of about $200m by marking derivative contracts to market prices.Time Warner was off 0.8 per cent to $33.57, as investors appeared to put a more than 50 per cent year-on-year jump in third-quarter profits down to the box office success of its last Harry Potter film.Fibre optic manufacturer JDS Uniphase rose 8.5 per cent to $12.46 as earnings, excluding some items, of 18 cents per share, easily beat expectations because of high sales of laser products.BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion fell 2 per cent to $18.91 to close below its book value for the first time in nine years. That means RIM’s market capitalisation is now lower than the market value of its property, patents and other assets.Intercontinental­Exchange fell 0.5 per cent to $122.62. Shares had increased as much as 5 per cent after quarterly results showed a 38 per cent surge in income, driven by strong trading volume in its oil futures contracts.CME Group, the largest US exchange group by market capitalisation, bounced back 7.5 per cent to $259.39. The stock had sold heavily on Tuesday, after Craig Donohue, chief executive, said the derivatives broker-dealer MF Global had broken CME’s rules on segregating customer and broker accounts.Medical technology company Becton Dickinson fell 4.6 per cent to $72.60, as income for the quarter ended September 30 fell to $300m and the company’s full-year earnings forecast disappointed analysts.
229;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa reports jump in credit-card spending;Company surpasses expectations with 14% rise;Visa, the world’s largest electronic payments company, reported better than expected fourth-quarter earnings as credit-card spending jumped.The San Francisco-based company reported a 14 per cent increase in net income to $880m for the three months to September 30, or $1.27 a share, beating consensus forecasts of $1.25 a share.The company said it saw the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in its US credit-card business, driven by affluent cardholders. Its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $92.02 by the market close in New York.“Visa continues to deliver strong results, with fourth-quarter and full-year performance reflecting a business that is both resilient and flexible enough to adapt and flourish in a changing business environment,” said Joseph Saunders, chairman and chief executive.“We have been diligent in our efforts to grow our core business, while successfully unlocking new revenue opportunities through strategic investments, both in our core business and into innovations that will ensure our foundation for future growth remains strong,” he said.Mr Saunders also announced a $1bn increase in its share repurchase programme.Operating revenue in the fourth quarter stood at $2.4bn, a 13 per cent increase from the previous year. Net income for the full year to September 2011 was $3.6bn, inclusive of the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option. Net operating revenue for the year was $9.2bn, an increase of 14 per cent year on year, driven by double-digit revenue growth from service, data processing and international transaction revenues.The positive earnings came as US regulators put a cap on so-called swipe fees that companies such as Visa, and its rival MasterCard, can charge merchants for each debit-card purchase made.Visa and MasterCard have been grappling over regulations on debit-card transactions that prevent banks from setting exclusive deals with payment networks. As of October 1, the Federal Reserve capped debit fees at 21 cents per swipe, higher than the 12 cents proposed by regulators. It is thought that the rules may limit processors’ revenues, increasing the importance of the industry’s shift towards electronic and mobile payments.The company said it was too early to comment on debit transaction volume changes as a result of the new rules.For the full year of 2011, service revenues increased 22 per cent year on year to $4.3bn, while data processing revenues rose 11 per cent to $3.5bn. International transaction revenues, which are driven by cross-border payment volume, grew 17 per cent over the previous year to $2.7bn.Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by VisaNet for the year to September, totalled 51bn, a 12 per cent increase year on year.Visa, which generated about 59 per cent of revenues from the US in the 2010 fiscal year, aims to generate more than half its earnings from international markets by 2015.The company affirmed its 2012 financial outlook, saying that it expects high single to low double-digit net revenue growth for the next year. Visa announced a 47 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend payment to 22 cents a share on October 19.
230;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;WikiLeaks suspends publishing to raise money;;Julian Assange has declared that WikiLeaks, the whistleblowing site he founded, must suspend its publishing operations to raise funds to prevent bankruptcy by the end of the year.The site has been fighting what it calls a “financial blockade” after payment firms and banks including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Bank of America stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks in December last year.Mr Assange said that this now posed an “existential threat” to WikiLeaks’ work, arguing that it had deprived the organisation of tens of millions of euros in funding.“In order to ensure our future survival, WikiLeaks is now forced to temporarily suspend all publishing operations in order to direct all our resources into fighting the blockade and raising funds,” Mr Assange told a press conference at the Frontline Club, a private members’ club for journalists in central London.“If WikiLeaks does not find a way to remove this blockade, given our current levels of expenditure, we will simply not be able to continue by the turn of the year.”WikiLeaks needs $3.5m (€2.5m) to continue operating for the next 12 months, Mr Assange said, with dozens more leaks yet to be published.Donations to WikiLeaks spiked when it first published its revelations, including the files from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and a cache of 250,000 US diplomatic cables.In 2010, the average donation to WikiLeaks each month exceeded €100,000. But in the first nine months of 2011, average donations have mostly been between €6,000 and €7,000. WikiLeaks blames the shortfall on the blockade, although the period has also seen Mr Assange fighting claims of sexual assault in Sweden.Mr Assange, who has always denied the allegations and is awaiting a British court’s ruling on Swedish authorities’ attempts to extradite him to Stockholm for further questioning, said that WikiLeaks donations were never used to fund his legal battle.Over the summer, WikiLeaks and Datacell, the Icelandic payment processing firm it used, filed a complaint to the European Commission over financial companies’ actions.WikiLeaks had hoped that the situation would have rectified itself by now. It intends to turn to other sources of funding.“We hope to put together a constellation of wealthy individuals from different nations so we are able to keep our political independence, together with a broad mass appeal using alternative [funding] mechanisms,” Mr Assange said.The financial services’ firms actions against WikiLeaks raise issues of freedom of speech and could threaten the work of charities such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International, he added. “These few companies cannot be permitted to arbitrarily decide how the whole world votes with its wallet.”Mr Assange also told reporters on Monday that WikiLeaks would provide a new secure method to leak documents next month, declaring that it was “not possible to trust” existing online submission systems.He pointed to the recent case of DigiNotar, a Dutch company selling certificates to authenticate sensitive websites such as banking or email, which was infiltrated by Iranian intelligence agencies, as an example of the lack of security inherent in today’s internet.“A number of certificate authorities are in effective state control, they are run directly by branches of the state,” he said. “It is not possible to trust any regular web-based encryption system.”WikiLeaks has had to re-engineer its own submission system “from scratch” because it “could not be trusted”, Mr Assange said. For the last 12 months, all WikiLeaks submissions have been made in person rather than through its website.“On November 28, we will launch our new-generation submission system,” he said. “That includes not just a public interface but also several other mechanisms that are necessary to deal with an attack on the entire internet security system that has been established over the past few years by intelligence agencies and criminal groups.”

It is already processing a run rate of $2bn worth of payments a year through 800,000 merchants, raising $100m at a reported $1bn valuation in June.But iZettle’s backers still think it can steal a march in Europe because its payment system works with chip-and-pin credit cards – which are rare in the US but predominant in much of the rest of the world.Chip and pin is more secure but also more complicated. iZettle has nailed not only the hardware and the payment process but also obtained relevant regulatory clearance in its native Sweden, of which there is a more than a little. It is compliant with EMV (the Europay, MasterCard and VISA card approval body) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).“It’s really democratising the payment terminal. Part of what they are doing is making a much lower-cost device by leveraging the screen and computing power of the phone,” said Ben Holmes, the Index partner who is joining iZettle’s board.“It’s absolutely not trivial what the company has done [so far] but we have to delight consumers and merchants to make it a successful business.”Pricing will help with at least part of that. Credit card machines by incumbents Verifone and Ingenico require both upfront investment and fixed monthly costs, making them too expensive for sole traders with lower volumes of sales. iZettle is giving away its terminals (for now, at least) and has no ongoing overheads beyond a 2.75 per cent commission and €0.16 fixed fee per transaction.However, the traditional players aren’t standing still: Ingenico are already working on their own iPad attachment and Verifone is working with Google Wallet, an NFC-based mobile payments service.iZettle’s press release provides the obligatory customer quote from a Mexican food truck in Stockholm (which feels more San Francisco than Scandinavia) but average transaction values are approaching €100.iZettle plans to use the funds for expansion into the rest of Europe. To that end, it has a strong ally in Charles Dunstone, the British entrepreneur behind the Carphone Warehouse mobile-phone retailer and TalkTalk broadband provider.“When I started Carphone Warehouse [in 1989], the people who had mobile phones were the people who had small businesses – so this feels like it’s going full circle and giving those people the ability to take payment by credit card wherever they are,” Mr Dunstone told the FT.“It transforms those small businesses where otherwise you’re relying on your customer to pay you, getting a cheque or having to take cash… It’s a very inefficient process for a self-employed, mobile workforce.”Mr Dunstone isn’t one of the UK’s most prolific early-stage investors but recently joined Index in investing in Funding Circle, an online “peer-to-peer” lending marketplace which promises to speed up borrowing for small businesses feeling the squeeze from traditional banks.He sees common ground between the two start-ups.“If you look at the economy at the moment, [one of] the areas where there are real inefficiencies – and it’s all quite opaque to customers – is financial services,” Mr Dunstone said.In the UK, he’s already invested in Mobile Money Network, a home payments system for consumers using near-field communication, along with mobile banking provider Monitise. “We’ve always thought that the mobile networks or the banks would somehow own mobile payments. I’m increasingly getting the sense that it’s actually going to come from innovative start-ups rather than existing players – the people that just get on and solve problems rather than being overwhelmed by them.”
232;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-09-30T16:52:25Z;Notion of free financial services is a harmful myth;To get better financial outcomes, we need to get the message: banking and investing can never be free;"Greetings from sunny Liverpool, where I’ve been on a day trip to the Labour party conference. I haven’t been up to the north-west for a while, so wasn’t sure what to expect.First impressions: the regenerated city centre is impressive, with its de rigueur dockside developments now completed – but everywhere you look there are very young people carrying BlackBerrys. Half appear to be girl-band wannabes straight out of The X Factor, instant messaging each other incessantly on Day-Glo clad devices; the other half appear to be suit-clad spin-doctor wannabes straight out of The Thick Of It (via Aberystwyth Students’ Union), emailing each other frantically in search of their shadow spokespersons.One observation: all those news stories about kids with BlackBerrys were spot on (as was the casting of the youthful Chris Addison in the BBC political satire).I’m up here to speak at a Social Market Foundation fringe debate: “Creating better financial outcomes: how do we empower consumers?” I haven’t read many policy pronouncements on this of late, so I wasn’t sure what would be said.First impressions: the ideas from the panellists were impressive – each of them carrying practical applications. Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary, stressed the importance of implementing the Vickers report proposals on banking competition– to reward consumers with investment choices, rather than “tapping them on the shoulder” and telling them they’re bailing out the banks. Matt Mayo, from MasterCard, looked to the role of technology in helping customers manage money – citing his company’s work in mobile phone payments. Brian Pomeroy, former chairman of the Treasury’s Financial Inclusion Task Force, leant weight to the argument for a suite of simple financial products– plans for which the government is already consulting on.One observation: any notion that policymakers underestimate the loss of trust in financial services is clearly wide of the mark.When it came to my turn to put forward ideas for reform, I agreed with some of my fellow speakers – as is de rigueur in political debate these days – but questioned the message that consumers were being sent. I hadn’t been able to conduct a vox pop on the streets of Liverpool One, so I tried to imagine what a customer, on walking into a bank or financial advice firm, might think.First impressions: all financial advice, and all banking products, still appear to be “free”. To many consumers, there must seem to be a long-enshrined right to receive these services free at the point of delivery – just like the National Health Service, comprehensive education and The Guardian website. I suggested this belief – like two of the others – could probably be traced to the 1940s, when banks and their managers were deemed pillars of the community. Some of Vickers’ reforms even evoke a return to the ethos of Captain Mainwaring’s bank in Dad’s Army. But, as I pointed out, that would see them full of spivs, panickers and stupid boys – not so different from the management structures of 2007.My argument was that perpetuating a belief in free financial services has done customers the worst disservice of all. It’s why recent polls show that between 31 and 46 per cent of consumers will refuse to pay fees for advice from 2013, when this becomes the only way advisers can be remunerated. But consumers only think advice should be “free” upfront because they don’t understand the backhanders paid behind the scenes – payments that resulted in every mis-selling scandal of the past 30 years. I warned that we still have a customer-provider relationship based on a lie. Banking is not free – it is based on hidden subsidies, from cross-selling of dubious products to savers seeking only a decent interest rate. Advice is not free – it is based on charges that are used to promote only expensive funds to investors, and fee structures that can deplete personal pensions by up to 39 per cent.I agreed that simple “kitemarked” products might help. But I worried they could lead to an abdication of responsibility and misconception of risk.My recommendation was for simple contracts setting out all costs over the term of a product, risk in terms of the probability of loss over different time frames, and service levels guaranteed by the provider. Consumers and providers both sign and take responsibility for their side of the outcome. Could such contracts work?One last observation: the Vickers report considered making bank account numbers portable, because young people understood this concept, thanks to mobile phones.What Liverpool showed me is that everyone – from a young age – can understand a contract if they want to. Why else have they all signed up for the smartphone where getting the message really is free?matthew.vincent@ft.com"
233;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;They’re watching. And they can bring you down;Why the world is scared of hacktivists;"It took more than being arrested at his home in the Netherlands by a swarm of police officers to shake 19-year-old Martijn Gonlag’s faith in Anonymous, an amorphous cyber-collective that has terrorised law enforcement and leading companies on five continents.Gonlag, who lives in Hoogezand-Sappemeer, 100 miles north-east of Amsterdam, was interrogated for two days last year before being released pending a trial that could send him to jail for six years. But the college student stood by his decision to download attack software and participate in 2010’s electronic assaults on the websites of Visa, MasterCard and others that had stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks as it published secret diplomatic cables. “WikiLeaks hasn’t been charged, but they were being worked against by governments and companies. That wasn’t right,” Gonlag told the Financial Times.The state of technology security overall is so weak that intelligence officials see hacking as one of the largest threats to western powers. While their top concern is nation-backed attacks, the lines between protesters, criminals and spies can be hard to discern. Gonlag is one of thousands who have joined an unprecedented wave of what has been dubbed “hacktivism”, referring to the combination of computer hacking with political activism. The largest and best known of these groups is Anonymous, a virtual mob that makes it easy for people with little technological aptitude to participate in protests, many of them illegal.The increasingly likely threat of apprehension isn’t enough to dissuade many Anonymous supporters from what they compare with “sit-ins” – conscious acts of trespassing that inconvenience their targets while bringing the underlying issues to wider attention. Yet though such dedication persists even after dozens of recent arrests in the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere, there are signs that Anonymous is being torn apart from the inside. Internal feuds thus might finish the job that law enforcement – infuriated by attacks on the CIA, FBI and US defence contractors – has barely begun.The most important split is between the leadership and the rank and file. Gonlag underwent his own change of heart when he watched an administrator in an Anonymous chat channel encourage a minor to download the same software that had led to his weekend behind bars. The old hand told the teenager that he wasn’t in danger because the attack tool would mask his internet address.“LOL,” Gonlag typed in the chat channel, for “laughing out loud”. He meant it as a warning born of hard-won experience. But the administrator immediately shot him a private message: “Shut the f*** up.” “That showed to me they are trying to use kids to do their dirty work,” Gonlag recalled. “That’s when the tide turned and I left Anonymous.”To admirers, the hacktivism trend reflects the increased importance of technology in more and more aspects of life. The net is now democratising both legitimate political expression and hacking in the same way it once democratised media, allowing anyone to blog or publish an electronic book.But others, including the companies that have lost business due to web outages or been robbed of customer information by hacktivists, believe Anonymous sets a dangerous precedent. “Motivation-wise, I think these guys are on a massive power trip. There is definitely some criminal element,” says Karim Hijazi, founder of tech security start-up Unveillance, which had its internal e-mails published by hackers with Lulz Security (commonly known as LulzSec), an Anonymous offshoot.Even some supporters worry that if the group continues on its current path, it could trigger a legislative backlash that would bring heightened monitoring at the expense of the privacy that Anonymous prizes.Steven Chabinsky, FBI deputy assistant director, says the bureau is placing “a lot of emphasis and focus on Anonymous and other groups that would be like them. These organisations have managed to use new technologies to connect to otherwise disenfranchised hackers to gather force and momentum in a way we have not seen before.” Since July, the FBI’s most useful ally has been Scotland Yard and its beefed-up e-Crime unit, which says it has arrested three of the four founders of LulzSec.…Anonymous began as a small group protesting internet censorship, using novel ways designed to grab press attention. As idealists swelled the ranks, though, its unusually open and officially leaderless structure allowed it to be penetrated by cyber criminals and career hackers, who launched direct attacks on law enforcement. This was a long way from the chatter on teen-oriented message boards inside the 4chan website, which was founded in 2003. (The name “Anonymous” comes from the identity given by default to anyone posting comments there.)These message boards were all about ephemera, with pictures or other material disappearing automatically after a short period. But some items caught the imaginations of enough people in the nameless crowd that they spread to the rest of the web world. The boards were the take-off point for the annotated cat pictures known as LOLcats and for the prank that tricked people into clicking on links to singer Rick Astley’s 1987 song “Never Gonna Give You Up” – the infamous “rickrolling”.Little on 4chan was political and anyone trying to do something positive risked being tagged as a self-righteous “moral fag”, as the lingo had it. Still, given the off-colour taste of many of the 4chan items posted, internet censorship naturally hit a nerve.It was the Church of Scientology, which had a history of using copyright laws to go after critics and suppress internal documents, that was the catalyst for transforming Anonymous from online hangout to activist power. The process took less than a fortnight.In January 2008, 4chan visitors and others passed around a YouTube video of Tom Cruise talking about Scientology. Ignoring the maxim that, on the internet, squashing something makes it bigger, the church served YouTube with a copyright warning and got the video taken down. This offended 4chan regulars such as Gregg Housh, an anti-establishment website programmer.A debate began over what to do. One suggestion was that since YouTube videos are often downloaded and reposted, the group should look out for a repost and grab a copy for distribution to other sites. It did just that, adding text naming another internet chat that viewers could join to plot next steps. More than 50 people signed in. Some suggested an answering video, with a digitised voice reading a press release where “Anonymous” declared “war” on Scientology. As Housh and his online peers put the finishing touches to the press release, someone suggested the ominous tagline: “Expect Us”. Housh loved it. “You win!” he shouted.Housh, who is now 34, thought the video would last for a week or so before new people stopped watching. “This is the internet,” he shrugs. But the online tech tabloid The Register found the fresh imagery and tone irresistible, embedding the video on its front page. High-traffic gossip site Gawker followed and then came cable channel CNN.The chat channel grew so crowded with new participants that communication was close to impossible – the messages scrolled too quickly up the screen. Housh dispersed the flock to new channels for every big city and set up a secret one for core organisers to thrash through plans to keep the movement going.The group held real-world demonstrations in front of Scientology churches. In keeping with the nameless spirit of their movement and to guard against lawsuits, they picked a uniform disguise – Guy Fawkes masks like those used in the movie V for Vendetta. Thousands appeared at the appointed hour and Anonymous took on new life as an outward-facing social force. And the more its members intersected with other activists, the more they thought about where internet freedom was imperilled on the world stage.Anonymous’s attention on Scientology flagged but participants put up a website, WhyWeProtest, to explain their reasoning on net censorship and related issues.After the suspect Iranian elections in 2009, local activists appeared and asked how to organise online without being caught by the government’s surveillance techniques. Housh and his colleagues coached them with the best research they could find. At one point he was speaking to five activists inside Iran. Then came days of silence before one got back in touch using the code word. The other four were dead, he said, and he wouldn’t be in contact again.Housh was shattered. So much for the fun and games. “I’m done,” he said. Anonymous would play a role in the Arab uprisings that began in December 2010, but he and others merely provided resources instead of trying to shape events.Anonymous has received nowhere near the press coverage for its Middle East activities as it has for its web attacks. To some, though, the former were a high-water mark, showing that the large and haphazard collective could unite to do good.“They have done some spectacularly stupid things, but they should be commended for what they did during the Arab Spring,” says a technology activist from Canada, who uses the name Oxblood Ruffin. Now 60, Ruffin has worked on monitoring-circumvention tools for people in repressive countries since 1996, and his group is sometimes credited with coining the term “hacktivism”. “There were a lot of Anons involved in keeping servers running [during the Arab Spring], in telling people how to use the net and mobile phones safely. That’s 10,000 per cent hacktivism.”But like the topics on the message boards where Anonymous originated, an infinite number of “operations” can be presented in the quest for sufficient support. The next natural winner on the chat channels was WikiLeaks. Interest surged as it began to expose government secrets, and even more so when MasterCard, PayPal and other companies refused to process donations.Anonymous could have taken any number of avenues to express itself, but the main one favoured by members was denial-of-service attacks that overwhelmed financial websites and temporarily knocked them offline.With help from the press, Anonymous’s attacks on behalf of WikiLeaks brought it to its widest ever audience, attracting thousands of people like Martijn Gonlag: college students, slackers and office workers who were rooting for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, himself a hacker of some repute 15 years previously.It was both easier and more effective than traditional forms of protest. Sign into a chat channel, download the software and afflict the comfortably off while spreading the word. “Going on the street with a flag is not going to get you any media attention. It won’t help any more in a digital world,” Gonlag reasoned. “We need to do other things.”…At a psychological level, firing away at corporate or government websites echoes a shift in media habits that is rewiring people who grew up with the internet, the so-called digital natives. Global revenue from gaming has overtaken movies as active participation replaces passive consumption of video.Like many other hacktivists, Gonlag was an avid player of “first-person shooter” games, the protagonist in his own adventures. Digitally attacking MasterCard and Visa elevated that engagement to the real world, a literal dream come true.As Anonymous grew during the WikiLeaks period, it expanded its pioneering use of social networks and other technology. Leaders of various operations coordinated via chat channels and Facebook groups, reaching out to the masses through YouTube and multiple Twitter accounts.The electronic equivalent of a paper trail, though, also attracted security researchers. This posed a potential threat to the biggest players within Anonymous – those whose computers ran the group’s chats or controlled the botnets, or networks of compromised machines, that were being used in some of the assaults and that could also be used for sending spam or stealing data.Law enforcement has a dismal record on cybercrime, arresting fewer than 1 per cent of the perpetrators, according to technology research firm Gartner. The limited expertise typically can’t overcome the difficulty in proving who was at which keyboard at what time and the logistical challenge of chasing cases across national borders.Most of the best cyber crime sleuths work for private security companies, where they can make a name for themselves by exposing new problems or major hackers. In February of this year, I wrote an article in the FT citing chief executive Aaron Barr of security concern HBGary Federal. He told me he had uncovered the true names of many Anonymous leaders and planned to explain his techniques at an imminent security conference.The article set off a panic. A small group of Anonymous leaders and their associates set out to determine what Barr knew – by any means necessary. Taking charge was “Sabu”, a hacker whose first political acts online had come a decade earlier, when he disrupted communications during US Navy bombing exercises in Puerto Rico. He was joined by “Kayla”, “Tflow” and “Topiary”, later the spokesperson for LulzSec.It took them less than a weekend to gain access to HBGary Federal’s e-mails. When the hacktivists subsequently discovered that many of Barr’s identifications were off-base, they published them, devastating the security company and forcing Barr’s resignation on February 28.If the Arab Spring had been the zenith for Anonymous in politics, the HBGary hack marked a peak in industry impact. Sabu, Topiary and some of the others didn’t stop there. They formed LulzSec and went on a 50-day rampage, largely against western law enforcement agencies and security companies. With fewer people, they could move faster than Anonymous and communicate more effectively, soon amassing more than 300,000 followers on Twitter.LulzSec briefly took down the public sites of the CIA and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency. Such stunts ensured more media coverage and redoubled a police effort, eventually forcing LulzSec to merge back into the safety of Anonymous.In a break from Anonymous tradition, LulzSec also published what it rooted out from hacked companies, including the phone numbers of police officers and thousands of credit card numbers belonging to Sony customers, among others. Sony said the spate of attacks on its networks, which shuttered the PlayStation online system for more than a month, will cost it in excess of $170m.In theory, the dumps of private data were designed to keep the news reports coming and thereby embarrass companies into improving their defences, as well as to expose any security contractor complicity in internet surveillance or other repression.Indeed some security professionals say that Sony’s massive brand damage and LulzSec’s antics, which included announcing details of the security holes it had crawled through, have prompted executives to take a harder look at their practices. Warnings by officials and experts about the state of technology security had long gone unheeded, in part because costly breaches often aren’t disclosed and public embarrassment is rare.Ironically, the criminal hackers within Anonymous and LulzSec therefore might have done more to advance corporate security than any initiative from White House officials or the burgeoning private security industry.“It is a great classroom to illustrate all the concerns that security people have had for decades,” says Jeff Moss, founder of the DefCon hacking convention and a US administration adviser.Chris Wysopal, a co-founder of the security firm Veracode, who in 1998 testified before a Senate committee about internet vulnerabilities, agreed that in some ways LulzSec was fulfilling a mission that at times seems impossible to complete through legitimate channels.“I struggle with trying to figure out a way to raise awareness that there are a lot of systems out there that are insecure,” says Wysopal. “There is a benefit to the community hearing this information. When doctors tell patients they have a given illness, they can take action. What LulzSec is doing is pointing it out in a more sensational way.”…Yet many of the Anonymous members who supported the denial of service attacks didn’t like the antisecurity operations that were generating so much new press. Others choked at the wanton dissemination of financial data and passwords of random citizens.“Anonymous does have a leadership and they don’t give a **** about us,” one member known as SparkyBlaze wrote in a self-published list of parting complaints. “Does Anon have the right to remove the anonymity of innocent people? They are always talking about people’s right to remain anonymous, so why are they removing that right?”Some followers came to believe that the leaders sought only personal aggrandisement or were effectively in cahoots with the organised criminals who may have raided Sony’s credit-card hoard after Anonymous knocked down the door. Even stalwarts such as Housh are unhappy that much of Anonymous’s infrastructure is now housed on computers used by Russian criminals. “It’s not like the Russians wanted us to get HBGary, but I want to know personally why they are doing this,” he says of the chat hosts. “Where is the money coming from?”Gonlag began actively working against Anonymous after the HBGary hack, as did other ex-followers. Private security experts, including Aaron Barr, bent on professional redemption, joined PayPal and other victims in gathering documents pointing to real identities. Gonlag has passed on tips to the FBI. “I don’t like being a snitch, but what they are doing is wrong.”In July, Scotland Yard’s e-Crime unit arrested young British men it accused of being Topiary and Tflow; Kayla’s arrest was claimed in early September. Once irrepressible on Twitter, Sabu, too, has gone quiet. Suspicions about who is ratting out whom abound, hindering collaboration on new projects.The annual DefCon hacking convention in Las Vegas this August drew many current and former members and sympathisers of Anonymous. The latter included a surprising number whose day jobs involve warding off such threats but who welcome the increased scrutiny Anonymous has brought to cyber-defence.Opinion was divided. At one panel, professional analysts suggested ways the mob might improve on itself, such as by setting criteria for responsible behaviour for security firms that wish to avoid being attacked. At another meeting, former Anonymous member Jennifer Emick railed against what the organisation had become and fended off hecklers, including one in a Guy Fawkes mask.Speaking to me outside the convention, Barr agreed that Anonymous has brought internet activism to a level that will be maintained or exceeded regardless of whether the group itself survives.Less clear is whether the anarchic hacking carried out against security companies like his own former employer will continue. Although he says it may depend on who is arrested and convicted, Barr guesses that it will go on regardless. “I think it’s reached a critical mass.”Joseph Menn is an FT technology correspondent in San Francisco……………………………………………………………..Technology specialBillion dollar brainsSailing away with the NobelBirth of the global mind"
234;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-09-23T19:46:13Z;Credit card spending slows;;Credit cards have fallen out of favour with British shoppers, as consumers eschew high interest rates in favour of sensible spending and turn to debit cards.Some 40 years after they were introduced, credit cards have suffered a reversal in popularity after years of growth.Figures from the UK Cards Association, passed to the Financial Times, reveal that debit cards outnumber credit cards, indicating a big change in consumer attitudes to spending and borrowing during the past decade.Between 2000 and 2005 credit card use in the UK accelerated, as high consumer appetite for borrowing and fierce competition from providers drove up demand. The number of cards in this period rose from 47m to 70m.But in the middle of the decade borrowers re-thought their spending habits, and reduced their credit card use years before the credit crisis came along.Paul Rodford, head of card payments at the UK Card Association, said no single factor could explain the falling popularity of credit cards. The change, he insisted, had been led by consumers rather than regulatory change.“This was not some sixth sense anticipation of the crisis to come, but rather a variety of things,” Mr Rodford said. “By 2005 the market was saturated, and there was an increase in negative coverage from the media surrounding debt and the costs associated with credit cards.“There was also an increase in home equity release, which let individuals use their mortgages to borrow on.”By the end of the decade the number of credit cards in the UK fell to 55.6m, and outstanding balances were £10bn lower.Banking customers have turned to debit cards. Spending on debit cards doubled in the five years to 2010. By 2010 some 84m cards were in circulation in the UK.Those consumers who still use credit cards have become more cautious about outstanding debts. Last year almost two-thirds of borrowers paid off the full sum owed each month, compared with about half in 2005.Providers appear to have reacted to the changing customer spending habits by raising costs for credit cards.The Co-operative Bank, Sainsbury’s and Santander charge monthly fees for some of their credit cards, and other providers have introduced fees that penalise low usage.A recently launched prepay Ryanair-branded MasterCard will levy a fee of £2.50 if the card is not used for six months.
235;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-09-19T23:15:25Z;Google launches Wallet service;;Google has launched its Wallet service for making one-tap payments with a mobile phone and announced plans to include Visa, American Express and Discover credit cards in addition to its current partner, MasterCard.Using Nexus S 4G phones on Sprint’s network in the US, Google has moved ahead of a similar joint venture called Isis, set up by the AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon mobile operators.Isis is expected to start limited trials next summer, but Google Wallet went live on Monday with Nexus S owners receiving updates on their phones that enabled mobile payments.The Wallet is an app that links to a near-field communication (NFC) chip inside the phone. The technology allows the handset to make a payment by simply tapping on a reader in a shop.“This is just a beginning for us, it’s version 1.0, but we expect the product to move quickly and add new features over the coming months, as well as us increasing the number of banks and handset providers that we partner with,” Osama Bedier, Google vice-president of payments, told the Financial Times.Mr Bedier said Google hoped to make the service available to European consumers in 2012.Initial users will have to have a Citi MasterCard or a Google prepaid card to fund their payments through the Wallet. Their phones will work on MasterCard PayPass tap-to-pay terminals – of which there are more than 120,000 in the US and over 300,000 globally.Visa said in a statement on Monday it had given Google a worldwide licence to use its Visa payWave technology, which is similar to PayPass and is accepted at hundreds of thousands of retail locations worldwide.Google is also working with major retail partners including Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s and Subway to install next-generation tills that work with NFC chips.For retailers, the attraction is not just to ease the payment process for customers, but also to increase engagement with them – tapping on the readers can also add loyalty points or allow digital coupons to be spent.Google Offers is being launched in conjunction with Google Wallet to allow it to be loaded with coupons from retailers.While only one phone model will now work with the service, Google estimates 50 per cent of US smartphones – about 150m devices – will contain NFC chips by 2014.Google may be first in NFC mobile payments, but it is far from the only company that may offer payment services. Apart from the Isis joint venture, PayPal has its own mobile app and Apple is rumoured to be including an NFC chip in the iPhone 5 expected next month.
236;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-08-03T21:19:02Z;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
237;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-08-03T14:46:08Z;MasterCard shares surge as profits jump;;MasterCard profits rose 32.8 per cent in the second quarter as consumers spent more on its debit and credit cards.The company’s shares surged more than 7 per cent to $23.55 in morning trading.The world’s second-largest payment processor said net income increased to $608m, or $4.76 a share, from $458m, or $3.49 a share in the same period last year, ahead of market expectations of $4.23 a share. Revenue was up 22 per cent to $1.67bn from $1.37bn on higher spending around the world.“Solid global performance, including strong increases in volume and processed transactions, fuelled double-digit revenue growth this quarter,” said Ajay Banga, chief executive, in a statement.Worldwide, debit and credit spending rose 16 per cent to $608bn, and usage of cards outside of customers’ home countries increased 19 per cent. In the US, debit card purchases surged 19 per cent to $98bn, while credit and charge card payment volumes were up 6 per cent at $129bn.MasterCard has made a push to expand internationally at a time when US consumers are facing lacklustre job growth and a stalling economy. The company said it was benefiting from new business in Brazil and the Netherlands, as well as new relationships with SunTrust and Sovereign, two regional US banks that had previously partnered with rival Visa.Operating expenses rose 21 per cent to $782m from $648m a year ago, driven mainly by acquisition costs. MasterCard bought UK-based DataCash last summer in a bid to be more competitive in online payments and acquired Travelex’s pre-paid card business in December.The company, along with Visa, is also facing new US regulations limiting debit swipe fees and preventing banks from setting exclusive deals with payment networks. While the 21 cents cap per transaction set by the Federal Reserve was higher than the 12 cents proposed by regulators, the rules may limit processors’ revenue, increasing the importance of the industry’s shift towards electronic and mobile payments.MasterCard said it had expanded its presence in mobile commerce through agreements with Google and Isis in the US, Orange and Barclaycard in the UK, China Union Pay in Asia and Swedbank in Nordic and Baltic countries.MasterCard’s results followed Visa’s report last week that its quarterly profits surged 40 per cent to $1bn.

That came a week after a 16-year-old believed to be Tflow was picked up in South London.The tender ages of the suspects surprised some private security experts who have been involved in the international hunt for the group, which had gone on an unprecedented public hacking spree that touched everyone from the CIA to Sony to News Corp. to Sony again and Sony some more.Lulz officially disbanded a month ago and called on its followers to rejoin Anonymous, the broader collective made famous for its brute force denial-of-service attacks on the websites of MasterCard, Visa and PayPal after those firms stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks last year.Last week, the US made its first 16 arrests in the Anonymous and Lulz probe, and 14 of the suspects were picked up for the attacks on PayPal, which is owned by Ebay.Court filings emerged this week showing that PayPal went to some trouble to help the FBI build those cases, and the former Lulz leader known as Sabu urged people on Tuesday to show their disapproval by closing their PayPal accounts.Anonymous members claimed tens of thousands of such cancellations, but a PayPal spokesman said the volume was within normal bounds.Sabu didn’t pledge to give up on more dramatic gestures, such as electronic breaking and entering. But with more reason to fear that spree may come to an end in the near term, he may be trying to package a legacy with more claims to legitimacy.As Topiary put it in his final Tweet: “You cannot arrest an idea.”

Instead of a shiny briefcase often carried by the bank’s executives, Mr Jain is known to sling a backpack over his shoulders – regarded in Germany as refreshingly different.Josef Ackermann, his predecessor, once said that the real home of a Deutsche Bank chief executive was in the cabin of an aeroplane, but Mr Jain will have a house in Frankfurt am Main as well as London. His two passions are cricket and shooting wildlife – with a camera that is. Having enjoyed trips to Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania, he is planning a few more holidays in the near future. In the meantime he will have to deal with Germany’s big banking beasts.…Indian summerThe rise of Mr Jain is mirrored by other Indian executives as they climb the ladder of international companies.Reckitt Benckiser has named Rakesh Kapoor as chief Bart Becht’s successor, while at Unilever, Harish Manwani has been appointed chief operating officer. Unilever has a history of promoting Indians, with Vindi Banga – now an operating partner at Clayton Dubilier & Rice – having held many senior positions. Across the pond, Mr Banga’s brother Ajay is MasterCard chief and Indra Nooyi heads PepsiCo.…Project approvalPaul Skinner, former Rio Tinto chairman, has not been idle since leaving the miner. As chairman of the government’s infrastructure project delivery unit’s advisory council, he has helped appoint Geoffrey Spence as the new chief for Infrastructure UK. A former banker at Deutsche and HSBC, Mr Spence has worked in infrastructure finance and Whitehall, where he was most recently a member of the Treasury’s Council of Economic Advisers.…City sweetenerXavier Rolet’s arrival at the London Stock Exchange two years ago put a temporary stop to the Frenchman’s hobby of rally driving. Insuring the new chief would be too expensive, the board decided.But Mr Rolet has managed to mix business with another of his hobbies: beekeeping. The former Goldman Sachs banker has decided to place some beehives on the roof of the LSE’s offices in Paternoster Square, to show that the bourse is doing its bit for global pollination. The project is in partnership with The Golden Company, a social enterprise based in east London that works with inner city youth to produce and sell “urban honey”.It seems to be a growing trend in the City. This week, Nomura held a “bee breakfast” at which it showed off the first honey from beehives on the roof of its headquarters. By sweet coincidence, Dame Clara Furse, Mr Rolet’s predecessor, is on the Nomura board.…Power player: Gerard Kleisterlee, Vodafone chairmanVodafone’s new chairman Gerard Kleisterlee kept a low profile at the mobile operator’s annual meeting, where his predecessor Sir John Bond officially handed over the baton.The German-born 64-year-old former Philips head arrives as Vittorio Colao, Vodafone’s chief, seems to have come to grips with the company’s issues.He has finalised the disposal of various minority stakes, while the pressure to sell the Verizon Wireless holding has lifted with the US group’s indication that it is to resume dividend payments next year.The Verizon holding remains an issue in the long term and Mr Kleisterlee will need to assist in Mr Colao’s decision-making process.More worrying for Mr Kleisterlee is the performance of his old company, Philips.Having spent his career at the Dutch group, including a decade at the helm, he was credited with transforming the former semiconductor maker to an all-round electronics group.However, since his exit, Philips has issued a profit warning and its shares have been marked down.Having studied electronic engineering at the Eindhoven Technical University, Mr Kleisterlee joined Philips in 1974 and became chief in 2001.A father of three, he enjoys music and history.people@ft.com
240;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-07-14T18:00:08Z;Brussels urged to act on WikiLeaks cash curb;;Visa Europe and MasterCard are facing a competition complaint in Brussels over their decision to block credit card payments to WikiLeaks, the whistleblowing website.Julian Assange, WikiLeaks’ founder, said the payment processors’ “economic blockade” had cost the website tens of millions of euros and that the site could become financially unviable if the action did not end.DataCell, the Icelandic internet hosting and data centre company that handled payments for WikiLeaks, filed a complaint to the European Commission on Thursday, saying the payment processing companies had acted unlawfully in stopping payments to the site.Visa and MasterCard and a number of other financial services companies such as PayPal restricted payments to WikiLeaks in December after the website angered governments by publishing thousands of secret US diplomatic cables. The payments companies were later targeted by activist computer hackers in revenge.The block on payments has made it difficult for supporters of WikiLeaks to make donations to the site. DataCell was handling about €130,000 ($186,000) worth of donations a day to WikiLeaks before its payment processing services were stopped. WikiLeaks relies on a large number of small public donations to continue its work.“We have lost around 90 per cent of our donations in value terms and the estimated loss based on those rough figures we have so far is some €15m,” Mr Assange said.He added that WikiLeaks’ work had been “tremendously impeded” by lack of funds, but that it continued to release thousands of cables from its cache of US diplomatic memos.Mr Assange compared WikiLeaks’ position with that of News International, which has faced many allegations of phone hacking and other illegal activity at its UK newspapers in recent weeks.“WikiLeaks and its employees have not been charged with any illegal activity,” he told reporters in London. “Compare that to News International who has had staff, employees and contractors imprisoned for illegal activity yet still we do not see US financial companies cutting off their services to News International. Why not?”Mr Assange is fighting a UK High Court battle against a decision to extradite him to Sweden to face charges of “non-consensual, coerced sex”.DataCell said Visa and MasterCard’s block on payments was unjustified and an abuse of their dominant position in the market. The data centre company maintains it has violated neither Icelandic law nor Visa and MasterCard’s terms of service in serving WikiLeaks as a customer.Visa Europe has a 67.7 per cent share of the payment card market in Europe, while MasterCard has 27.7 per cent.DataCell’s lawyer, Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, said the block on payments had left the company unable to carry on with its normal data centre business, as it could not take card payments from any of its customers. He said the company had suffered business losses of about €50m as a result.The Commission confirmed it had received the complaint and was reviewing it. Officials declined to comment further.EU competition officials do, however, know both card companies well after a decade-long tussle over their fees charged on cross-border card payments. Although these cases have been resolved to some extent, Visa is still in dispute with the commission over fees on credit card payments while MasterCard last week faced off against Brussels in the European courts over principles involved in determining fees on credit and debit cards generally.Visa Europe has a 67.7 per cent share of the payment card market in Europe, while MasterCard has 27.7 per cent. The companies told the Financial Times that it was usual practice to suspend payments to companies suspected of illegal behaviour.Visa said on Thursday that it was “happy to discuss [the complaint] with the Commission”. MasterCard declined to comment on the complaint.Additional reporting by Nikki Tait in Brussels.
241;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-07-13T15:59:11Z;Monitise’s revenues from mobile payments soar;;Monitise, the mobile payments technology company, has more than doubled full-year revenues to £14m in the past year, indicating growing interest by consumers in using the mobile handset to pay for items.London-listed Monitise said it had nearly 4.5m registered customers, double the number seen a year ago. About 3.5m of those customers are in the UK, indicating that roughly 10 per cent of UK bank account holders are using Monitise in some way.Monitise said it was handling mobile payments of about £100m a month for customers, which implies more than £20 per month per user. Mobile payments have often been for relatively low-value items of £2-£3, but Monitise’s figures show customers are becoming comfortable with larger sums passing through their handsets.Shares in Monitise rose more than 7 per cent on Wednesday to 37p.Mobile payment transactions could reach up to €82bn in value in western Europe in the next three years, according to Frost and Sullivan, the technology analysts.Interest has increased in mobile payments over recent months. In May Google unveiled a “Google Wallet” application together with MasterCard, Citibank, and Sprint Nextel. Research in Motion said earlier this year it was integrating mobile payments into its BlackBerry devices and Apple is widely expected to be planning its own mobile payments solution for the iPhone.PayPal and Moneybookers, the online payments providers, are also increasingly moving to provide payments on smartphones. PayPal recently bought mobile payments company Zong for $240m to increase its reach in this area.“The market has really taken off in the last four to six months,”said Bob Liao, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “We are seeing more and more announcements from operators. But it is clear that Monitise is well positioned, with exposure to the major banks and Visa.”Monitise, founded in 2002, is emerging as a key technology provider to many mobile money schemes. It has developed an iPad banking application for Royal Bank of Scotland, and is part of the Mobile Money Network, a platform for mobile payments set up by the UK’s Carphone Warehouse and Best Buy, the US retailer. It also signed a $50m deal with Visa to supply mobile banking software, and has a relationship with Fidelity National Information Services, which processes payments for hundreds of US banks.Monitise, which is due to report full-year results in September, is still loss-making, with operating losses expected to be about £16m this year. In spite of the rapid growth in user numbers the company is spending heavily on expanding into regions such as Asia.
242;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-07-12T16:53:47Z;Hacking group targets Booz Allen Hamilton;;The US defence department is investigating a cyber attack on a government contractor in which hackers claimed to have obtained 90,000 e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords of military personnel.A Pentagon official said on Tuesday that it was looking into the breach at consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton but lacked “concrete information”.“We don’t have all the details”, the official told the Financial Times on condition of anonymity. “That said, there may be some information that we can’t share once we do.”The cyber-activist group called Anonymous took credit for the breach and posted the data on the Pirate Bay file-sharing site. It said that data had been taken from a poorly-protected server on the Booz Allen network and that it was “surprisred” at how easy it had been to hack into a company working for the US military.Booz Allen Hamilton confirmed on Tuesday night that it had been subject to a hacking attack, and said it was investigating the extent of the breach. The company said it believed hackers had only been able to reach data that related to a learning management system it ran for a government agency.The breach is an embarrassment for the company, which has a former US director of national intelligence as its head of national-security contracting.Experts said the type of encryption used for the passwords could be broken, with the difficulty of that task determined by factors including whether numbers and special characters were required. “If they are smart, [the military] will reset the passwords”, said Jerry Dixon, former director of the cyber security division of the US homeland security department.Otherwise, hackers in control of accounts could send e-mails tricking still more defence employees into installing malicious software on their machines.“At this stage it will be important to focus on suspicious traffic leaving the network and making sure the problems are contained while forcing the password resets”, Mr Dixon said. “This is why two-factor authentication is so important.” But even two-factor techniques, such as requiring tokens with fast-changing numeric codes, are no guarantee of security.In May, Lockheed Martin, the largest defence contractor said it had been subject to a significant attack on its IT system that included a compromise of tokens provided by RSA.The Lockheed attack appears to have been a targeted attempt to steal intellectual property or defence secrets, while Anonymous says it hacks companies in order to publicise their security flaws. In a tongue-in-cheek move, the hackers posted an invoice for $310 to Booz Allen Hamilton on the Pirate Bay site for their “audit” of the security system.
243;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-07-08T06:37:38Z;High-profile hacking attacks to benefit NCC;;NCC Group would benefit from digital security concerns after a string of high-profile attacks, the ethical hacking specialist said, as it announced strong earnings growth for the year to May.“We’ve got probably the best piece of marketing and advertising you could ever imagine, which is the hacking world moving …into out-and-out war,” said Rob Cotton, chief executive. “The marketplace is the best it’s ever been.”About two-thirds of NCC Group’s revenue came from its assurance division, which tests the security of websites and performs forensic investigations after hacking attacks. The division’s turnover rose 87 per cent to £46.1m ($73.6m), helped by two acquisitions.Companies including Visa and MasterCard, as well as state agencies such as the CIA and the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency have suffered cyberattacks in the past year. Sony enlisted NCC Group’s help after hackers stole more than 70m user records, a person close to NCC Group said.Group revenue rose 49 per cent to £71m, with adjusted profit up 21 per cent to £17.3m. But pre-tax profit was down slightly at £12.8m (£13m).There was slower growth in the high-margin escrow business, which holds source codes for companies in case the provider ceases to support their software. Its revenue rose only 8 per cent to £24.9m.Mr Cotton blamed this on underperformance in the UK escrow operations, in part because of high staff turnover among sales executives, who were not being properly “looked after”. Senior managers in the division had been “underperforming”, and had now been replaced, he added.Analysts were unperturbed by the weaker performance in that division, expecting it to be boosted by the takeover of the US company Escrow Associates, and focusing on the potential for rapid growth in the assurance business.“They have had a number of issues with personnel over the years. But to have consensus-beating results, even though the main profit driver was underperforming, is testament to the depth and breadth of the business,” said Jonathan Imlah at Collins Stewart.The company is hoping for rapid growth in the US assurance market after the acquisition of California-based iSec. “iSec is the biggest player in that market – they work for all the great and the good in Silicon Valley,” Mr Cotton said.Arun George, at Altium, said “the momentum [in the assurance division] has clearly increased”, with NCC boosting revenues by selling higher-value services to existing customers.Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 36.7p, while the final dividend rose to 8.85p (7.25p), lifting the total by 21 per cent to 13p.The shares rose 5p to 650p on Thursday.
244;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-07-01T20:30:24Z;Wall Street rally gathers pace;Rising optimism over economy;Wall Street saw its sharpest weekly gains in two years after better than expected manufacturing data buoyed risk appetite, helping the major indices achieve their fifth consecutive session of gains.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.4 per cent to 1,339.67, led by the consumer discretionary, financial and industrial sectors, after strong data raised hopes that the US economy was coming out of the recent slow patch.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performing, led by Apollo Group, which jumped 6.4 per cent to $46.46 after the operator of for-profit schools reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings.Elsewhere in the sector, Darden Restaurants was up 6.1 per cent to $52.78 while Wynn Resorts added 4.2 per cent to $149.57.But the gains were broad based, with all 10 major sectors moving forward after the reading for the ISM manufacturing index came in at 55.3 for June. This was ahead of the 53.5 in May and better than the 52 expected by economists. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.This number followed news on Thursday that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index had come in at 61.1, which was also well above economists’ expectations and raised hopes that the economy was improving after weeks in the doldrums.“This data are a strong sign we are coming out of the recent soft patch,” said Mark Lamkin, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Lamkin Wealth Management.This feeling on Wall Street lifted risky assets. The S&P financial and industrial sectors were up 1.7 per cent while the consumer discretionary sector added 2 per cent and technology stocks were up 1.7 per cent.Defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecoms were some of the worst performing, rising only 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Gains in the industrial sector were led by Cummins which put on 3.8 per cent to $107.42 while the technology sector was dominated by gains from Visa and MasterCard.The credit card companies continued to be lifted by news on Wednesday that the US Federal Reserve set a higher than expected cap on debit card transaction fees. Visa was up 4.4 per cent to $87.97 while MasterCard added 4.4 per cent to $314.47.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average index up 1.4 per cent at 12,581.86 and the Nasdaq Composite 1.5 per cent higher at 2,816.03.The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 5.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, over the week.The S&P 500 added 5.6 per cent over the five days, the best week on the index since July 2009. The Dow and the Nasdaq also saw their best week in two years.The only real downbeat news in the session was that the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence index came in at 71.5 for June, slightly short of the 72 reading expected and down from 74.3 in May, but the markets shrugged this off.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 4.8 per cent to 15.72, adding to the 21.7 per cent drop it had already seen this week as investors positioned themselves for a steady climb in the equity markets.The week on Wall Street kicked off in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the big indices bounced off key technical support levels reached the previous week after nearly two straight months of losses.The S&P 500 had fallen 7 per cent from the start of May, reaching a bottom at the end of last week. The index found its support level just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound that followed over the news five days was sharp, with the S&P index putting on around 1 per cent every session.The markets were helped by a partial resolution to the situation in Greece on Wednesday and then the stronger manufacturing data on Thursday and Friday. Investors were also positioning themselves for the upcoming earnings season – starting in earnest on July 11 – which is expected to be quite strong.In recent quarters markets have generally rallied before and during the earnings season as investors turn their attention away from macroeconomic concerns and on to companies news.This repositioning took form of a rotation into risk assets. The best performing sectors over the week were energy, which was up 7.2 per cent, technology, which added 6.8 per cent and consumer discretionary, which rose 6.6 per cent.One of the biggest pieces of corporate news from the session was the strong earnings results from Nike, which came as a relief to investors, who were concerned after the company missed expectations last quarter.Shares in Nike were up 13.1 per cent to $91.82.
245;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-07-01T17:23:40Z;Airlines oppose ruling on card fees;Budget airlines say they will not be affected by ban on debit card charges;Budget airlines look set to oppose an order to stop charging fees to customers who pay with a debit card.This week, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) called for an end to the debit card surcharges imposed by travel companies, which are often added at the very last stage of a transaction.It wants the cost of processing debit cards, estimated to be 20p per transaction, to be absorbed into the price of the ticket. Costs forusing credit cards must also be clear to shoppers from the start of a transaction, the OFT said.Which? has identified 16 airlines that charge customers for paying with a debit card, including Europe’s largest low-cost airline, Ryanair.Budget airlines were found to be adding up to £8 to the price of a single ticket for paying with a debit card – costs that were “dripped” into the final price only after customers had almost completed the purchase.Some carriers have already decided to remove fees. Monarch Airlines scrapped its 3.5 per cent debit card charge in June.But Ryanair, which charges £6 per flight, per person, for payment with a debit card, insisted that its charges were “optional”. It argued that customers can avoid a charge if they use a pre-paid MasterCard – a not widely-held payment card that comes with its own charges and a set-up fee.Flybe, which charges a £5.50 debit-card surcharge for a single flight, said that its charges were “clear and easily accessible from stage one of the booking process”. Jet2, which charges a £4.99 flat rate, also claimed to be upfront about its non-optional charges.BMIbaby, which levies a £4 charge for each person flying, even if payment is made on a single card, said it was investigating the new ruling and would work with the OFT.Consumers in the UK buying travel tickets are estimated to have spent £300m on surcharges last year.The OFT pointed out that other retailers that accept credit and debit cards, such as supermarkets and clothing shops, do not add charges for payment.However, analysts have warned out that if debit card surcharges are banned, travel companies may seek to make up the cost elsewhere.“It could mean higher fees for credit card use or baggage allowances later,” said Bob Atkinson, travel analyst at Money­supermarket.com.
246;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-06-29T20:47:11Z;Financials lead Wall Street higher;;Financial stocks saw some of the strongest gains in an upbeat session on Wall Street as the big indices continued to bounce off some technical lows last week and sentiment was lifted by news that the Greek parliament had passed a package of austerity measures.The financial sector, which has been one of the worst performing in recent months, falling 14 per cent from its last cyclical high in February, bounced up 2.1 per cent led by the large investment banks.Morgan Stanley was up 4.8 per cent to $23.39 while Goldman Sachs rose 2.6 per cent to $132.58. The S&P investment banking index was up 3.1 per cent.The S&P financial sector has now added 3.7 per cent in the past three days, and is on course for its best week in nearly seven months.Elsewhere in the sector, Visa was up 15 per cent to $86.58 while MasterCard added 11.3 per cent to $309.70 on news that the Federal Reserve is proposing to rework limits on fees that banks can charge each time a consumer uses a debit card.Bank of America added 3 per cent to $11.14 as investors reacted positively to news that the bank will pay $8.5bn to finally settle claims by investors that mortgage-backed securities sold by its Countrywide Financial unit failed to meet underwriting requirements and other guidelines.These gains helped the S&P 500 put on 0.8 per cent to 1,307.41, pulling the measure back over the psychologically significant 1,300 mark and reacquainting the benchmark index with its 150-day moving average lost three weeks ago.The materials sector saw the next strongest gains in the session after financials as the sector benefited from the uptick in global risk appetite after the Greek vote and some strong analysts’ reports on the steel industry.US Steel rose 5.9 per cent to $45.85 while AK Steel added 5.2 per cent to $15.51 after the companies received a ratings upgrade from Deutsche Bank. The sector also benefited from a Goldman Sachs note saying that steel demand in the third quarter may surprise to the upside.Elsewhere in the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was up 2.3 per cent to $51.62 while Allegheny Technologies rose 4.3 per cent to $64.29.Monsanto, the largest seed company by revenue, which is also a member of the S&P materials index, was up 5 per cent to $70.26 after reporting a 77 per cent jump in earnings on higher sales of Roundup weed killer and genetically modified crop seeds.The energy sector saw the next strongest gains. The S&P energy index was up 1.1 per cent as Halliburton, the oilfield services company, added 2.3 per cent to $49.82 and Schlumberger rose 1 per cent to $85.22.All these gains left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.6 per cent to 12,262.78, moving to within striking distance of its 100-day moving average line, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,740.49.The 3.1 per cent gains on the S&P 500 index so far this week, following nearly two straight months of losses, have led some investors to argue that the market reached a bottom last week when the index neared its technically significant 200-day moving average line.Sentiment on Wednesday was helped by better-than-expected housing data. Figures showed that pending sales of previously owned US homes rose 8.2 per cent in May ahead of the 3 per cent rise expected.This follows news in the previous session that April saw a rare monthly rise in home prices on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the pace of decline in the beleaguered housing market may be abating somewhat.But most argued that there was still little reason to be bullish on the downtrodden sector, particularly as the gains in pending sales last month followed a 11.3 per cent drop in pending sales in April.“In absolute terms this is a very depressed level, and with prices in most areas either still declining or flat, there is little incentive for buyers to be aggressive,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Shares in KB Home fell 15.4 per cent to $10.08 in the session after the homebuilder reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss, in a further confirmation that the sector was far from healthy.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in BJ’s Wholesale Club were up 4.6 per cent to $50.29 after the discount retailer announced that it was selling itself to the private equity firms Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital Partners for $2.8bn, wrapping up a months-long sale process.
247;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-06-22T18:20:44Z;Google’s Schmidt predicts widespread “tap and pay” within a year;;Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, believes that a third of check-out terminals in retail stores and restaurants will be upgraded to allow wireless “tap and pay” from mobile phones within the next year.Such a development will prepare the ground for what he believes will be a “trillion dollar” industry of mobile advertising and payments.The Californian internet company announced a new “Google Wallet” for its Android mobile-phone software last month, alongside partners including Sprint Nextel, the mobile operator, and MasterCard, the payments firm.Speaking at the Cannes Lions advertising festival on Wednesday, Mr Schmidt said Google was working to encourage payment processors to upgrade a third of their terminals, which will be sufficient for wide adoption of the technology.“That money is going to be spent not by Google and not by the phone guys but by the credit card companies, because the fraud rates are so much lower,” he said. “Nobody knows how quickly this will occur but it’s in their interests to convert as fast as they humanly can.”Because of the number of different players involved in deploying such a system, Mr Schmidt said it was impossible to make a firm forecast of the timescale.“I judge that based on how long I think it takes, because the terminals are available now, the software is available now or this summer,” he said. “How long does it take an infrastructure player to upgrade a significant percentage of their infrastructure – it’s on the order of a year, it’s not a week, it’s not a month but it’s also not five years… It’s an educated guess.”He added that “most [mobile-phone] vendors” have announced they will include the necessary “near-field communication” chip in their devices in the next year, referring to LG, Sony Ericsson and Apple’s rumoured new iPhone. Google will make its wallet available for the iPhone if NFC is included in a future version of the device, he said.As Google and other companies focus their attention on handheld devices, Mr Schmidt said that “all the really clever stuff” would happen in mobile technology, particularly in emerging markets where fixed-line broadband was scarce.Google is also looking to harness social networking information and personalisation technology to help users manage the huge quantity of information which is posted online everyday.“If we have the equivalent of a social graph, we can help select videos that you’d want to watch,” Mr Schmidt said. “We can suggest literally infinite television.”Gmail’s “priority inbox” feature was an existing example of how computer algorithms can help to intelligently filter an overwhelming amount of information, he said.Artificial intelligence at the server can take such data and “begin to understand things that we care about”, he said.“The best thing would be if Google knew what you wanted without you having to type it in. With your permission, with a mobile phone we can trigger search queries about where you are.”But he added that in spite of these and other Google initiatives, such as its self-driving car: “It’s going to be a long time before computers have volition and hope and all the things that make humans special.”
248;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Phones move closer to usurping cash;Phone users can use their mobile to pay for items costing up to £15;"Orange and Barclaycard have launched the first mobile phone payment system in the UK, dubbed Quick Tap.Phone users can now
use their mobile to pay
for items costing up to
£15 in shops across the country.So far, only one phone, the Samsung Tocco Lite, has been enabled to allow the user to swipe it against readers installed in 50,000 stores and restaurants, including Pret a Manger and Eat.But news this week that Google launched the same contactless mobile payment system in the US for its popular Android phones has made the industry more confident that mobile phones could soon overtake cash and cards as consumers’ payment option of choice.Google’s system will allow users to make payments using a Citibank-
issued MasterCard credit card number or a pre-paid card.Both the Orange phone and Google’s US version will require users to load up their phone with a sum of money from their bank account first. They will then be able to use this money to purchase small-change items.The technology necessary to turn phones into mobile wallets has existed for some time.So-called “near field technology” is already used in millions of payment cards that can be swiped against readers in certain shops, and in the Oyster
cards used by London’s commuters.In Japan, millions of consumers now use their phones to buy products.But although mobile phone companies such as Nokia have been open about creating phones that can be used to make payments in the US and Europe, the plans have stagnated.In order for phone payments to become popular, there needs to be a significant number of handsets with the capability to make payments, sufficient retailers who accept the payments and enough consumers willing to buy a new phone with the technology embedded in it.Until now, there has been a lack of consumer interest and handset availability but with two new systems running, this looks set to change.Industry experts say that the new plans may still need to be accompanied by special offers and discounts in order to kickstart widespread usage.Apple is reported to be looking into including the technology into the new iPhone model.Microsoft and BlackBerry maker RIM are also thought to be making similar plans.Samsung and Visa say that mobile payments on smartphones will be available in time for the London Olympics in 2012.Providers are keen to reassure consumers that contactless payments are no less safe than conventional credit or debit card payments.Any unauthorised purchases will still be covered by the card provider."
249;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-05-27T00:15:28Z;Google reveals mobile payment plan;;Google and a group of partners including Sprint Nextel, Citibank and MasterCard plan to jump-start the mobile payments market in the US with a system based on a free ‘Google Wallet’ app and a technology called NFC (Near Field Communications.)“Today, we’ve joined with leaders in the industry to build the next generation of mobile commerce,” said Stephanie Tilenius, Google’s vice-president for commerce and payments. “With Citi, MasterCard, First Data and Sprint we’re building an open commerce ecosystem that for the first time will make it possible for you to pay with an NFC wallet and redeem consumer promotions all in one tap, while shopping offline.”While the outlines of the Google NFC scheme had been widely expected, Google also revealed that Google Wallet will also come pre-configured with the internet advertising group’s daily-deal coupon service called ‘Google Offers.’ This service will compete directly with rivals including Groupon and LivingSocial and will provide Google with a new mobile revenue stream.Google said it will not derive any revenue from financial transactions made using its secure mobile wallet system which will enable consumers with some Android-based handsets to ‘tap and pay’ for goods and services instead of swiping a traditional credit or debit card. Retailers, restaurants and other service providers will need new or modified NFC-enabled readers to accept payment.Google Wallet will launch in New York and San Francisco this summer where many retailers including CVS, Jack in the Box, Sports Authority and Sunoco as well as Coca-Cola vending machines and taxis are PayPass-enabled. It will be offered initially to Sprint Nextel customers with the NFC-enabled Samsung Nexus S 4G smartphone.At launch, people who already have a PayPass eligible Citi MasterCard will be able to add it to Google Wallet ‘over the air’ – PayPass cards are currently accepted by about 124,000 merchants across the US. Alternatively Google Wallet will also come with a virtual Google prepaid card that can be topped up using a bank payment card.Ms Tilenius emphasised that while Google is launching the Google Wallet and the NFC service in conjunction with a set of partners, it is an open system, “that others are welcome to join.” She said Google hopes to offer the mobile payments system outside the US and that it will eventually be expanded to include “everything you find today in your wallet.” Google Wallet will start with offers, loyalty and gift cards but some day items like receipts, boarding passes and tickets will all be seamlessly synced to your Google Wallet.In the US, the Google Wallet partners will compete directly with another NFC initiative called Isis that brings together three of the top four US mobile network operators – Verizon Wireless, AT&T and T-Mobile – and plans to launch with multiple payment networks and banks when it goes live in 2012.“There seems to be a clear land grab in terms of owning the digital money space right now,” said Fred Huet, analyst at UK-based Greenwich Consulting. “A lot of players are serious about making it happen. Mobile operators are creating digital wallets, handset makers are creating digital wallets, PayPal has a digital wallet.”Separately, PayPal on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Google, claiming the search group misappropriated trade secrets from PayPal’s mobile-payment business, according to the AP.
250;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-05-25T18:46:57Z;Android mobile wallet service planned for US;;Google and Sprint Nextel, the US telecoms company, plan to unveil a payment service that would turn Android handsets into mobile wallets.MasterCard and Citigroup are also understood to be involved in the service, which could turn paying by mobile phone into a mainstream practice in the US.The service, using near-field communications (NFC) technology would allow users to pay for goods by simply swiping or tapping their mobile phone against a special reader at a store’s till.NFC technology is available on Sprint’s Android-based Nexus S handset made by Samsung. It is thought the service will be rolled out in five US cities, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.Eric Schmidt, Google chairman, has predicted NFC technology could eventually rival the credit card.Companies such as Nokia have been experimenting with NFC mobile payments for several years, and such payment systems are widely used in Japan. However, the Sprint service will be one of the first widespread offerings of the technology in the US.Last year, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, the other three big US telecoms carriers, created a joint platform, called ISIS, for mobile payments. ISIS plans to roll out its own service in two cities, including Salt Lake City, in early 2012. Apple is also thought to be working on including NFC technology in the next version of the iPhone.It is unclear whether any of these mobile payments services will be compatible with each other, and the industry could face a battle to establish which platform will become the standard.Analysts have predicted that there could be as many as 50m NFC-enabled phones in the market in 2011, and mobile transactions could reach $245bn in 2014.The mobile payments market could provide lucrative opportunities for companies such as Google. It could, for example, target advertising to mobile phone users based on their purchase history. Mobile payments would also increase the appeal of Google’s Checkout internet payments service.This month, Orange and Barclaycard launched a mobile payments system in the UK, installing special mobile phone readers in 50,000 stores, including Pret A Manger and McDonald's.The details of the US service are expected to be announced at a press conference in New York on Thursday. Google, MasterCard and Sprint all declined to comment.

252;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Visa lifts profits 24% on higher spending;;Visa has reported a 24 per cent increase in second-quarter profit as a result of higher consumer spending.The company also introduced a new $1bn stock repurchase plan and reiterated its financial outlook for 2011.Nevertheless, Visa shares fell in after-hours trading, with the stock down $1.06, or 1.35 per cent, to $77.64 in New York.The world’s largest payment processor said it earned $881m, or $1.23 for each class-A common share, in the quarter, compared with $713m, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier.A consensus of Wall Street analysts had been expecting the company to earn $1.20 a share.Revenue climbed to $2.2bn, a 15 per cent increase, while payment volume, or the spending on Visa-branded cards, rose 13 per cent on a constant dollar basis compared with a year earlier.The total number of transactions was 12bn in the period, a 13 per cent increase.Visa, and its smaller rival MasterCard, have benefited from a global rebound in consumer spending as the world economy recovers.Both companies face uncertainty over regulations expected to come into effect in July that could curb the fees banks collect from merchants each time their debit card is swiped.The rules may loosen Visa and MasterCard’s grip on the market.
253;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-05-05T11:13:39Z;Credit card rates soar;Interest rates on credit cards are at their highest level for 13 years;"Interest rates on credit cards are at their highest level for 13 years, according to research by Moneyfacts.The financial information service said that the average rate has risen steadily to 19.1 per cent in April, despite the Bank of England base rate remaining at 0.5 per cent.Card providers have pushed up rates following new changes to the order of payments came into effect in January and April of this year. The news measures, which were recommendations from the Office of Fair Trading, now mean the most expensive debt will always be paid off first which is cheaper for the customer but means less revenue for the provider.Michelle Slade, spokesperson for Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: “Card providers have also been hit by the PPI ruling which has seen them having to repay money to customers deemed to have been mis-sold the insurance.“At the same time, there has been a sharp increase in the number of providers raising the interest rates charged on their credit cards.”Several of the biggest providers of credit cards, including Barclaycard, Halifax, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander, have increased their rates. Bank of Scotland pushed up its Mastercard rate by 2 per cent to 17.9 per cent. And Royal Bank of Scotland increased the interest payable on its platinum branch MasterCard by 1 per cent to 17.9 per cent.“It is unlikely we have seen the last of the increases and Moneyfacts expects more providers to follow suit,” said Ms Slade. “While credit card interest rates have risen, customers are now being offered the longest ever 0 per cent balance transfer and introductory purchase deals ever seen.”She said providers hope to bank on customers’ reluctance to keep switching so they can claw back the lost interest during intro periods once they end.“In an ideal world customers should look to repay their balance in full each month; that way no interest is payable,” she said."
254;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-05-04T17:50:19Z;High petrol prices fuel jump in US online shopping;;Online shopping grew by its fastest rate in nearly four years in the US last month as rising fuel prices prompted Americans to cut trips to malls and buy on the internet instead, according to MasterCard Advisors.US consumers spent $13.8bn online last month, a 19.2 per cent jump from April last year, according to the SpendingPulse survey, which is based on spending on MasterCard credit cards and estimates of other forms of payment.The increase is likely to outpace sales growth at bricks-and-mortar stores, due to be released on Thursday. The consensus of economists’ forecasts is that sales at stores open a year or more rose 7.7 per cent in April.Mike Berry, director of ­industry research for MasterCard Advisors, said: “We’ve started to see demand distortion, with people pumping fewer gallons and driving less.”Petrol prices are squeezing consumers as they approach $4 a gallon. The average national price was $3.96 a gallon on Wednesday, up from about $3.10 at the end of February.US consumers had more money in their pockets in the first quarter because of a ­temporary cut in payroll taxes but while consumer spending increased during the period, around a third of the rise went on energy costs.The growth in e-commerce was evident in the quarterly results of the leading online retailers last week. Amazon reported US sales up 45 per cent at $5.5bn and Ebay said its gross US merchandise volume rose 10 per cent to $5.6bn.PepsiCo said last week it had noticed consumers spending more at small convenience and dollar stores as soaring petrol prices deterred them from driving to bigger retailers.Mike Duke, chief executive of Walmart, which relies on customers driving to its “big box” stores, said its shoppers were “not yet” feeling the effects of an economic recovery.Walmart is seeking to boost its online presence. Last month it launched a test service that lets shoppers order fresh food on the internet for home delivery.When it reports its quarterly results this month, it will be watched closely to see if it can end a seven quarter sequence of falling US store sales.April was the 21st consecutive month in which online sales grew and the fourth consecutive month of accelerating growth, said MasterCard.The last year-on-year decline in online spending came in the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008 and the first half of 2009 when consumption plunged across the board.MasterCard’s Mr Berry said consumers today were becoming more comfortable shopping online, a trend that helps explain a longer-run expansion in e-commerce that began in the late 1990s.E-commerce has risen gradually from 0.6 per cent of total retail spending at the end of 1999 to 4.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year, according to Census Bureau figures.
255;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-05-03T18:43:07Z;MasterCard profits rise by 24 per cent;;MasterCard on Tuesday reported a 24 per cent increase in first-quarter profit, as consumers and businesses continued to loosen their purse strings around the world.But the second-largest payment processor also sounded a cautionary note about the effect that rising gas and commodity prices would have on consumer spending in future.MasterCard said it had seen no evidence of a slowdown so far, but continued to monitor the situation carefully.“If you add food and gas price inflation to the US, where house prices are still weak and unemployment is high, that could crowd out discretionary spending and be a drag on economic growth,” said Martina Hund-Mejean, MasterCard’s chief financial officer.Despite those concerns, the volume of transactions processed by MasterCard in April, the first month of its second quarter, exceeded the pace set in the first quarter.That was partly due to a flurry of spending which normally took place around Easter Sunday, but also reflected a continued “pick up in spending, not just by the affluent, but also the middle class”, Ms Hund-Mejean said.Investors seemed willing to shrug off inflationary concerns and other lingering questions about the impact that soon-to-be enacted debit card regulations will have on MasterCard’s future US business and pushed shares up by $7, or 2.5 per cent, to $282.30 a share in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.MasterCard reported first-quarter net income of $562m, or $4.29 a share, compared with $455m, or $3.46 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 15 per cent to $1.5bn.The company now derives 60 per cent of its revenue outside the US and those global markets are showing the strongest growth.The gross dollar volumes of transactions in the first quarter grew 20 per cent in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, compared with 6 per cent in the US.MasterCard has raced to sign up customers in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America for its mobile banking services and is also working with the Indian government to provide payment options to local farmers and others who have been traditionally locked out of the financial system.In addition to threats of an inflationary-induced slowdown in consumer spending, MasterCard is also grappling with new regulations designed to limit the money that merchants collect from banks each time a debit card is use.The hotly contested new rules, still being written by the Federal Reserve and scheduled to take effect in July, could lead banks to renegotiate the fees they in turn pay processors such as Visa and MasterCard.The banks and processors have been lobbying Congress to delay the rule-making in the hope that, given more time, they will be able to soften its effect on their bottom lines.
256;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-03-30T21:00:57Z;Wall Street stocks boosted by jobs data;;Deal news helped to lift the pharmaceutical sector on Wall Street while the wider markets were buoyed by promising employment data ahead of the big monthly payroll report on Friday.Valeant, an acquisitive speciality pharmaceutical company, said it was making a $5.7bn hostile offer for Cephalon, another drugmaker.The news sent shares in Valeant up 12.8 per cent to $50.08, while Cephalon jumped 28.4 per cent to $75.44, the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 index. The $73-a-share cash proposal, which represents a 29 per cent premium to where the shares have traded over the past month, comes after Valeant tried and failed to engage Cephalon’s management and board in takeover discussions.Elsewhere in the sector Merck was up 1.6 per cent to $33.30 while Forest Laboratories rose 4.3 per cent to $32.48. The S&P healthcare index was up 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,328.26 after the ADP National Employment Report estimated that private non-farm employment had risen by 201,000 in March.The figure was broadly in line with expectations, but kept traders’ hopes alive for a strong official employment number on Friday. This was the fourth month where the ADP figure showed about 200,000 jobs being added, compared with the previous four months where the average was 74,000.“In short, there has been a clear and sustained acceleration in private payroll gains,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.The S&P 500 has bounced back 5.7 per cent in the past two weeks as traders have turned their attention to the US domestic economic recovery and away from global tensions.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the marketplace, fell 3.2 per cent in the session to 17.6, falling below 18 points for the first time since the tensions began in Middle East and north Africa in the middle of February.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,350.23 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,776.79.Financial stocks gained ground in the session, led by Visa and MasterCard, following speculation that US curbs on debit card fees will be delayed or modified.Visa was up 2.8 per cent to $74.23 while MasterCard added 0.8 per cent to $253.66 in reaction to comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in the previous session that the central bank would not meet an April 21 deadline to come up with a final rule on debit card transaction fees.Jon Tester, Democratic senator, is also pushing for a chamber vote on a bill that could delay the cap by two years.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs was up 0.4 per cent to $159.07 while JPMorgan Chase added 0.9 per cent to $46.45. The S&P financial sector put on 0.7 per cent.Among telecoms, AT&T rose 2.2 per cent to $30.71 after Randall Stephenson, the chief executive officer, struck an upbeat note, saying that the company’s takeover of T-Mobile USA would boost network capacity and improve service for devices such as the iPhone. He also said that he expected some divestiture before the deal was allowed to go ahead by the regulators.Shares in AT&T are up 9.9 per cent since the $39bn deal, which would create the largest wireless carrier in the US, was announced early last week.These gains helped lift the S&P telecoms index 1.4 per cent in the session with Verizon Communications also gaining ground, up 0.4 per cent to $38.46.Among the individual stocks in focus BlackRock, the world’s largest listed investment manager by assets, gained 6.7 per cent to $198.98 on news that the company was replacing Genzyme, the biotech group, in the S&P 500 index.The stock rallied on the expectation that mutual funds and other investment vehicles that track the S&P 500 index will now buy its shares.Qihoo Technology, China’s largest provider of free antivirus software, traded on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time after an initial public offering. The stock rose 135 per cent on its opening day, to $34, more than double its IPO price of $14.50.Oxford Industries, an apparel maker, climbed 33.4 per cent to $33.37 after reporting an 18 per cent rise in its dividend and strong fourth-quarter earnings.Citrix Systems, the software maker, was up 3.1 per cent to $72.24 after Morgan Keegan & Co initiated its coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating.
257;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-03-29T23:22:46Z;‘Excessive’ debit card fees face OFT probe;;Merchants charging artificially high fees to customers using debit or credit cards are facing investigation.A diverse group including budget airlines, estate agents, and taxi and insurance companies, are accused of levying “excessive” fees to customers paying with cards, often springing the charge at the last point of transaction.Consumer group Which? issued a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading on Wednesday asking it to probe “rip-off” charges.Credit card surcharges are standard practice among some retailers, but a growing number, including estate agent Foxtons, broadband provider AOL and airline Ryanair, are charging for debit cards.Budget airlines came in for particular criticism, with Ryanair charging customers a £6 administration fee per passenger per flight with a debit or credit card.The airline website says fees are charged “to defray substantial costs incurred”. It claimed they were not surcharges and pointed out that bookings made with a MasterCard Prepaid Debit Card were free.Use of debit cards now exceeds payment in cash in the UK, driven by the popularity of shopping online.Retailers say they are passing on fees charged by banks for card use, but untangling such fees is difficult, because they vary depending on retailers and cards. Chip and pin payments with bank cards carry a lower fee than online or telephone transactions because of the lower risk of fraud.Which? claims the cost of processing is no more than 20p for a debit card and 2 per cent of the transaction value for credit cards.Admiral Insurance charges a £5.95 fee for credit card use. “All credit card providers charge companies for processing card payments and we do not charge the customer this full amount,” it said.Train booking website thetrainline.com said its £3.50 credit card charge “reflects all the costs associated with payments which includes the charges levied by credit card companies”.But card providers sought to distance themselves from the retailers. The UK Cards Association said it supported an investigation. “It is not good enough for some businesses to generate profit by imposing inflated surcharges when their actual card processing costs are substantially lower,” said chair Melanie Johnson.John Holmes, principal economist at Which?, accepted that card payment created a small cost to companies, but questioned the discrepancy with what was passed on to consumers.“Large clothing retailers accept a large number of credit and debit card payments and do not charge, yet cab firms charge 12.5 per cent for debit or credit card use. We just don’t see how that can possibly be a direct pass-on charge.”
258;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

260;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-03-16T02:26:13Z;Battle over US debit card fees;;A proposed delay to rules that would force Visa and MasterCard to cut the costs of debit card swipe fees was slapped down on Tuesday by Richard Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate.Members of Congress from both parties are trying to amend, delay or kill a rule that limits the cost of “interchange” fees to 12 cents per transaction, a reduction of more than 70 per cent, which caused shares of the payment networks to fall by more than 10 per cent when it was announced in December.John Tester, Democratic senator from Montana, introduced legislation on Tuesday with eight bipartisan co-sponsors that would delay the implementation of the rule by two years while a broad group of regulators look again at the issue.He said he was worried that small banks and consumers would be hurt inadvertently, and cited the criticism it has attracted from regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Mr Tester said he had detected “buyers’ remorse” among colleagues who had supported the interchange amendment. But Mr Durbin, who sponsored the provision as part of last year’s financial regulatory overhaul and is backed by US retailers, stood firm against any delay to the rule.“I will strongly oppose any attempts to line the pockets of the credit card giants and Wall Street banks by delaying this common-sense, pro-consumer legislation,” he said.Tim Johnson, chairman of the Senate banking committee, whose state of South Dakota is a base for financial services companies, said he was “still reviewing the [Tester] legislation” and would work with lawmakers and regulators to “find the best solution”.However, he added: “At the same time, I want to make sure we don’t open the doors to the misguided efforts aimed at repealing the entire Wall Street reform law.”Others close to the Senate leadership said it was unclear whether Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, would ever allow the measure to come to a vote.The best chance for a change to the rule now lies with the Federal Reserve, which has until April 21 to produce a final version. However, Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, has told lawmakers that they have left the central bank with little leeway in their wording of the law.“While early indications are slightly encouraging, they are not enough to get materially more optimistic on the stocks of Visa and MasterCard just yet,” wrote Adam Frisch, analyst at Morgan Stanley, in a note to clients.“Despite the fact that a legislative fix seems more possible today, we are still not counting on it and continue to view potential litigation and industry fixes as more viable.”
261;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Credit card fraud at 10-year low;;Credit and debit card fraud has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, in spite of expectations that the economic downturn would drive up financial crime.The UK Cards Association, which represents card issuers, attributed the fall to improved industry information sharing and investment made by banks in sophisticated new fraud detection tools.Banks have employed increasingly aggressive tactics to deal with illegal card activity, such as freezing payments if card usage appears irregular and usage of fraud prevention initiatives such as MasterCard’s SecureCode, which requires card users purchasing items to enter additional security information.As a result total fraud losses on cards fell to £365.4m in 2010, a 17 per cent decrease on 2009. The figure is the lowest since 2000, when card fraud was £317m. The decline marks a radical reversal in the success of card fraud, which peaked in 2008 at £610m.Chip and pin technology, which replaced signatures with chips embedded into bank cards, was introduced in 2004 and almost immediately helped to cut retail fraud. But criminals moved swiftly to exploit other vulnerable areas such as online transactions.As website shopping and online banking became more popular, the amounts stolen through online fraud rose.Wednesday’s figures show that efforts by banks to repel online criminals through new fraud detection software and campaigns to encourage use of antivirus software on personal computers have resulted in online banking fraud falling by over a fifth.Cheque book fraud has also become less common, reflecting the gradual elimination of cheques used in financial transactions.But it seems criminals frustrated with new technological barriers are returning to old-fashioned methods to extract information. Phone banking fraud, which involves telephoning consumers and asking for their personal details, rose by 5 per cent in 2010.
262;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-03-09T20:17:38Z;Proposed rule to cut debit card swipe fees is stalled;;"A controversial rule to cut debit card swipe fees would be delayed and kicked back to regulators for more study under new legislation set for a US Senate vote next week, according to congressional aides.Shares in Visa and MasterCard slumped by more than 10 per cent when the Federal Reserve announced in December a proposal to limit the “interchange” fees charged to retailers for the use of debit cards to 12 cents a transaction, a 70 per cent decline from current levels.Large and small banks have joined the network operators in the biggest lobbying effort since last year’s passage of financial reform in a bid to prevent the rule coming into force.The financial institutions argue that consumers will bear the price of any reduction in interchange fees through debit cards that are more expensive and less available. Some banks have already started to charge a monthly debit card fee and eliminate reward programmes.“We’re very appreciative of members’ willingness to step back and understand how this harms consumers, community banks and all members of the financial sector,” said Ken Clayton of the American Bankers Association.John Tester, a Democrat from Montana, and Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, are leading an effort to stall the implementation for up to two years and allow other regulators to participate in the rule-writing.“Senator Corker doesn’t believe the federal government should be telling private companies what they can charge for goods and services,” said a spokeswoman for the senator.The Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have both criticised the Fed’s rule, while Ben Bernanke, chairman of the central bank, has acknowledged problems but suggested that Congress left it little alternative.Participation of the other banking regulators in the rule-writing could increase the fee limit and include a more workable exemption for smaller banks, which the industry and its regulators say are likely to be particularly hard hit by a reduction in a key revenue stream. The OCC has said the issue is a threat to “safety and soundness”.But a legislative change is by no means certain. The interchange amendment was the signature contribution to financial reform by Dick Durbin, a powerful Democratic senator from Illinois. Fellow Democrats say that they have detected no willingness to soften the rule from Mr Durbin, who is supported by US retailers.The merchants argue that any delay in implementing the rules will hurt consumers. Since retailers already pass on much of the cost of interchange to customers in the form of higher prices; they say a delay in capping the fees will result in consumers paying an extra $1bn a month at the tills.According to a report by Compass Lexecon, a consulting firm, the five countries with the largest debit card use per capita have no “swipe” fees at all. They include New Zealand, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Denmark. The European Union has also moved to cap the fees."
263;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Credit and debit card fraud falls;Card fraud is at its lowest level for a decade;Credit and debit card fraud is at its lowest level for a decade, following intense action taken by banks to crack down on losses.The total losses recorded by the UK Cards Association and Financial Fraud Action UK for 2010 were £365.4m, almost half that recorded in 2008 when card crime hit an all-time high of £610m.UK banks have been employing increasingly more aggressive tactics to deal with credit and debit card fraud, freezing payments if card usage appears even slightly irregular.Card users who travel abroad are now required to inform their bank ahead of the trip or run the risk of their card not working. As a result fraud committed abroad has more than halved in the past two years.And despite the rise in so-called “phishing” attacks, which target online users with emails purporting to be from their provider or other trusted source, online banking fraud fell by over a fifth in 2010 from the previous year to £46.7 thanks to an increase in the use of sophisticated fraud detection software by banks and customers becoming more aware of the need to ignore such emails.Unsurprisingly cheque book fraud losses have fallen, reflecting the gradual elimination of cheques for financial transactions, but phone banking fraud has risen by 5 per cent as criminals realise that online contact with potential victims yields less results.Card providers attribute the fall in fraud to the use of fraud detection systems by the banks and card companies, which monitor for unusual spending, and the roll out of chip and PIN machines abroad. A number of banks now use additional measures such as MasterCard’s SecureCode or Verified by Visa, which requires card users purchasing items to enter extra security information.The Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit, an industry-sponsored specialist police unit set up in 2002 to deal with fraud, recommends that customers employ simple methods such as shielding their PIN entry and checking that their personal computer has up to date anti-virus software.Provided they have acted with reasonable care UK victims of card fraud are entitled to protection by the Banking Code. In most cases providers will refund the full amount stolen.Overall card and banking fraud accounts for just one per cent all fraud committed in the UK, which is estimated by the National Fraud Authority to cost the country over £38bn each year.
264;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-03-01T02:28:28Z;JPMorgan faces up to $4.5bn costs;;JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries face more than 10,000 legal proceedings that could ultimately cost as much as $4.5bn beyond what the bank has already set aside in reserves.The financial crisis left a raft of litigation in its wake, as regulators, investors, counterparties and borrowers found fault with lenders’ actions on everything from lending and packaging mortgages to selling auction-rate securities and serving as banker to Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff.The US Securities & Exchange Commission has urged banks recently to disclose forecasts for legal losses under certain worst-case scenarios. Last Friday, Citigroup and Bank of America estimated that losses from pending litigation could exceed their reserves by billions of dollars.In the New York-based lender’s annual report, filed on Monday, JPMorgan said it was “reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to $4.5bn at December 31.”JPMorgan based its range “upon currently available information,” and relied on “significant judgment” given that many cases remained in their preliminary stages, the bank said in its filing.“We believe we’re fully reserved for our probable losses,” a JPMorgan spokesman said.The bank does not disclose its current legal reserves, although it has noted it set aside additional funds in 2010.For financial companies that acquired troubled institutions that were unlikely to survive the crisis, the cut-rate deals also came with additional legal headaches. JPMorgan added Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, and faces actions stemming from each purchase.American Express said on Monday that losses related to various lawsuits could total as much as $500m more than what the company had already set aside to cover those liabilities.Amex is the target of a civil antitrust suit brought by the Department of Justice, which alleges that Amex prevents merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payments. A hearing on the matter is set for March 2. MasterCard and Visa last year settled similar DoJ charges.Morgan Stanley did not include a similar range of forecast losses in the “legal proceedings” section of its annual report, which was also released on Monday.The investment bank said its traders reported losses on 38 days in 2010, the same number of money-losing days they produced a year earlier.The traders generated at least $100m in daily revenues on 25 occasions, Morgan Stanley said in its filing.
265;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-02-24T01:57:37Z;FDIC hails cuts in loan loss provisions;;Big banks cutting their loan loss provisions capped a “turnround” year for the industry in 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said on Wednesday, as its chairman called for more lending.Sheila Bair said the industry had recovered from the dark days of 2008 and called on healthy banks to extend more credit. “Banks need to get back to the basics of making loans,” she said.The FDIC, which guarantees consumers’ deposits up to $250,000 and supervises much of the country’s smaller banks, said the industry’s profits increased from a net loss of $1.8bn a year ago to $21.7bn in the fourth quarter, mainly as a result of fewer reserves being set aside for loan losses.Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at MF Global, noted that with seven large institutions accounting for more than half of the reduction in the provisions for losses, the improvement did not mean medium-sized banks did not “still have credit quality issues to resolve”.Loan balances fell, according to the FDIC’s Quarterly Banking Profile, with construction loans down 28.7 per cent year on year to $321.5bn as banks worked through their losses in the troubled sector and the stagnant housing market continued to weigh on new loans. But loans to businesses and individuals increased modestly.Investors’ return on equity became positive in 2010, the data show, but at about 6 per cent remains at less than half the level of the years before the crisis began to take hold in 2007.“I’m hoping that as we emerge from this crisis that investors will appreciate the trade off perhaps with somewhat lower ROEs with more sustainable, less risky long-term business plans and bank management,” said Ms Bair.New regulations are crimping banks’ profits and investors’ returns. Deposit account fees fell 20 per cent for the second quarter in a row, while Ms Bair said more needed to be done to ensure that small banks could escape proposals to limit the fees charged on debit card transactions.She said there were “broader issues” about the impact of the so-called interchange fee cap, which is being drawn up by the Federal Reserve, but MasterCard and Visa might have to be corralled into helping enforce an exemption for smaller institutions.“We’re looking at, [with] the current authorities, whether the Fed can require the networks to do two-tier pricing,” she said. “That would be one possible way to fix this.”The FDIC closed 157 failing banks in 2010, the report said, but Ms Bair noted that the rate of failure was slowing. The number of institutions on the FDIC’s problem list rose from 860 to 884 in the fourth quarter.
266;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-02-17T20:08:09Z;Fed plan to cap card fees contested;;The US Federal Reserve came under sustained pressure in Congress on Thursday to alter, delay or abandon a plan to cap debit card fees, which has rocked the shares of Visa and MasterCard.A proposed rule from the Fed would limit the fees charged to retailers to 12 cents a transaction, a move cheered by the likes of Walmart but fiercely opposed by banks and card companies.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, acknowledged that a proposed exemption for smaller banks from the mooted cap might not work. “It is possible that because merchants will reject more expensive cards from smaller institutions . . . that exemption will not be effective in the marketplace,” he told the Senate banking committee.Community banks are a powerful force and their lobbying effort was evident in the questions asked by lawmakers in the Senate and a parallel hearing in the House financial services committee on Thursday.Jeb Hensarling, a Republican representative from Texas, said: “My mailbox is full from community banks telling me this is going to harm their bottom line.”Ed Royce, a Republican from California, said it “could be the final nail in the coffin for many of the smaller institutions”.Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said she was “sceptical” that small banks would in practice be exempt from the rule and were likely to increase the fees they charge customers on accounts. “That would not be helpful for consumers,” she said. “This really needs to be fixed.”In apparent criticism of the Fed, Ms Bair said “who’s going to pay more, who’s going to pay less . . . [wasn’t] dealt with as thoroughly as it might have been”.Although the Fed’s rule was much tougher than expected and has come under attack from Democrats and Republicans, it has a powerful champion in the Senate in the form of Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois, and legislation to change it looks unlikely.More likely is a change by the Fed in the proposal to mollify small banks, although Mr Bernanke said Congress might need to consider legislation. “One way to address it, if Congress wants to, is [to] require the networks to differentiate [between large and small banks],” he said.Both Visa and MasterCard, which operate the networks, collect fees and pass them on to card-issuing banks, saw their shares fall by more than 10 per cent in December when the Fed announced the proposed rule.Joshua Floum, Visa’s general counsel, said the proposal “represent[s] a direct attack on American consumers and this nation’s financial institutions, and their combined efforts to recover from the worst economic conditions this country has faced since the Great Depression”.But David Seltzer, vice-president of 7-Eleven, the convenience store chain, accused the card companies of levying charges well beyond their costs on retailers and supported the rule that would dramatically curb such charges.“This conversation illustrates the fact that interchange rates are not set to cover the reasonable costs of running the clearing system,” he said.“Rather, they are a tool to encourage banks to issue more and different card products at the expense of our franchisees and our customers.”
267;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-02-07T22:53:10Z;‘Hacktivists’ retaliate against security expert;;The cyber-activist group Anonymous reacted quickly over the weekend to infiltration by a US security analyst, hacking into his personal online accounts and computers and distributing thousands of e-mails and other documents.The attack embarrassed researcher Aaron Barr, head of HBGary Federal, a contractor for US intelligence and other government agencies, while demonstrating that Anonymous has considerable technical abilities.Members of Anonymous – that last year marshalled attacks which crashed the websites of MasterCard, PayPal and other businesses that had broken ties with whistle-blowing site WikiLeaks – said they hacked into the company to read the documentation behind Mr Barr’s claim, first reported in the Financial Times, that he could identify most of the group’s top leaders.In statements posted to the web, the activists ridiculed his methods and conclusions, maintained that they are part of a broad movement without established leaders, and claimed that, in spite of his comments to the contrary, Mr Barr had hoped to sell his findings to the Federal Bureau of Investigations.Mr Barr denied the allegation on Monday, saying that Anonymous misinterpreted a pitch to sell the agency software tools. He said he had received death threats but that his customers were being supportive.Other security experts said they were alarmed by the hacking attack on HBGary Federal and a part-owner, HB Gary Inc., which employed a combination of tactics, including tricking an administrator into sending a new password.The incident “makes me want to change all my PWs [passwords] and re-evaluate my processes”, Jeremiah Grossman, founder of WhiteHat Security, wrote on Twitter. “Do not poke the bear.”Penny Leavy, HB Gary Inc. president, said the data disclosure would cost the two companies millions of dollars and that it would work with the authorities to catch those responsible.“They have committed a crime against our company and, unfortunately, we are legally bound,” she said. “I wish it had been handled differently.”Mr Barr again said on Monday that he did not intend to publish the names of Anonymous leaders, adding that his research, to be presented later this month at a security conference in San Francisco, was part of a study on how social networking sites make it easier for hackers to penetrate secretive organisations.In the Anonymous case, he matched Facebook log-in times with the times when group members signed in to Anonymous’s internet relay chat groups. At a nuclear plant and a US military outfit, he used LinkedIn, Classmates and Facebook to assume identities and build trust before inducing targets to click on internet links that could have infected their machines with spy software.Anonymous has been under pressure from a co-ordinated international law enforcement effort that has included five arrests in the UK and 40 court-authorised searches in the US. But it continues to organise what it sees as legitimate protests, including attacks on Egyptian government websites, and has now signalled that it is more than willing to take the fight elsewhere.
268;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-02-04T00:42:33Z;BofA to sell insurance unit to QBE;;Bank of America agreed to sell its Balboa insurance arm to Australia’s QBE for more than $700m in cash, in the US lender’s latest bid to shed businesses and other assets as it recovers from the financial crisis.The disposals, which have included stakes in Brazil’s Itau Unibanco, Mastercard and BlackRock, have helped shrink BofA’s balance sheet and fulfil its agreement to repay government bail-out money.BofA will receive about $700m in cash up front, as well as future additional payments. The bank said on Thursday it will record an after-tax gain on the sale, while retaining about $1.7bn in net tangible equity that can be redeployed as Balboa’s insurance liabilities expire.Under the accord, QBE will assume Balboa’s liabilities. Two companies also agreed to a long-term distribution pact.BofA had inherited Balboa through its 2008 acquisition of Countrywide Financial, and the business never appeared part of its long-range plans.QBE has grown into a top 25 global insurance and reinsurance group as measured by net earned premium on the back of more than 100 acquisitions since the mid-1980s. Since 2006, it has spent about A$3.5bn($3.5bn) on deals in the United States.The Australian-listed group also announced that 2010 after-tax profit would fall by 17 per cent to US$1.3bn. The group’s insurance profit margin is forecast to slip to 15 per cent, below previous guidance of between 16 and 18 per cent.QBE said the frequency of small and large weather-related and earthquake catastrophe claims had risen to their highest level since 1999, from events such as earthquakes in Chile and New Zealand and storms on Australia’s east and west coasts.Flooding in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria last month has led to 4,500 claims and estimated costs of about $100m.QBE’s preliminary estimate for cyclone Yasi, which unfurled across the Australian continent this week before being downgraded to a tropical low pressure system, is around $100m.Shares in QBE surged 7 per cent, up A$1.21 to A$18.15, as investors welcomed the latest acquisition and the absence of an equity raising to fund the deal.
269;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Mastercard posts strong net income;;Mastercard’s fourth-quarter net income jumped 41 per cent, driven by the first positive growth in US consumer credit card spending in nearly three years.US consumers spent $135bn on Mastercard-branded credit cards in the fourth quarter, a 2.2 per cent increase over the prior year, and the first growth in 11 quarters.Ajay Banga, Mastercard’s chief executive, said that spending on both necessities like groceries and non-necessities like restaurants and travel had returned to pre-recessionary levels. But he said he remained cautious on future US growth barring improvement in key economic factors.“It’s hard to see sustained growth until unemployment and the housing market improves,” Mr Banga said.Mastercard’s fourth-quarter net income totalled $415m, or $3.16 a share. Wall Street analysts had been expecting the company to earn $3.04 a share. Revenue climbed 11 per cent to $1.4bn.Worldwide gross dollar volume on Mastercard-branded credit and debit cards grew 11 per cent to $752bn. Cross-border volume increased 18.7 per cent, the strongest growth in 10 quarters, said Martina Hund-Mejean, Mastercard’s chief financial officer.Improvements in Mastercard’s operational results were overshadowed by new regulations that could curtail the fees that banks collect from merchants each time their debit card is swiped. Investors are concerned that banks will try to renegotiate the fees they pay to Visa and Mastercard for use of their networks to help offset declining merchant revenue.Mr. Banga said that the impact of the changes to Mastercard’s debit revenue would be “manageable”. But he added that the consequences for consumers were serious. “Consumers stand to bear these additional costs and in some cases face a loss to banking services,” Mr Banga said.Mastercard, along with larger rival Visa and card-issuing banks have been lobbying Congress to rethink the rule before it takes effect later this year.The fight among the card networks and banks with large merchants like Walmart and Target over these so-called “swipe” fees has been brewing for years. In 2003, Mastercard agreed to pay $1bn over 10 years to settle a class action lawsuit against itself and Visa brought by large merchants.On Thursday, Mastercard said that it had reached an agreement with Visa and card issuing banks who are defendants in another merchant-driven lawsuit that would limit any damages that Mastercard would be required to pay in the event of a settlement to 12 per cent of the total. A trial date for that case had not yet been set.Visa reported similarly strong results and concerns over the regulatory environment when it reported earnings Wednesday evening.
270;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-02-03T02:20:51Z;Visa volatility over regulation fears;;Visa’s shares suffered share price volatility in spite of strong results from the first quarter, as investors remained concerned about how new debit card restrictions would affect the company’s revenue.Visa is playing a leading role in an industry-wide effort in the US to delay the implementation of new rules that would limit fees banks collect from merchants each time their debit card is swiped.Joseph Saunders, Visa’s chief executive, said in a conference call late on Wednesday to discuss the company’s first-quarter earnings: “The enactment of this legislation should be delayed and the unintended consequences should be studied.”Following the release of its results on Wednesday, the shares fell $1.09, or 1.51 per cent, to $71 in after-hours trading, before recovering the lost ground on Thursday morning.Banks say the new rules, which the Federal Reserve is in the process of writing, will result in higher costs for consumers. Large merchants such as Wal-mart and Target, which aggressively lobbied for the passage of the rules as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, say banks have overcharged them on debit card purchases for years.The debate over the fees overshadowed Visa’s first-quarter earnings, which increased 16 per cent on a continued rebound in consumer spending.The San Francisco payment processor earned $884m, or $1.23 a share, in the most recent three months, 2 cents more than Wall Street analysts had expected. Spending on Visa cards jumped 15 per cent to $897m compared with the prior year. Total transactions processed were $13bn, also a 15 per cent increase over the year-ago quarter.The new rules may loosen Visa’s and MasterCard’s grip on the debit market by requiring cards to use at least two networks, potentially opening the door to competition from rivals.The draft proposal would limit the fees set by Visa and MasterCard that merchants pay to card-issuing banks to 12 cents a transaction, an 80 per cent cut over current levels.Mr Saunders said: “We believe the government is engaged in price fixing to the benefit of no one”.To offset the lost revenue, banks have said they will start charging a monthly fee for debit cards and limit the size of transactions.J. Craig Shearman, vice-president for governmental affairs for the National Retail Federation, said: “The banks are about to lose a huge revenue stream and they are trying every last ditch effort to continue skimming money out of consumers’ pockets”.Several congressmen recently signalled that they would be open to revisiting the rules, including Barney Frank and his successor as the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Spencer Bachus, who has scheduled a tentative hearing on the matter for February 17.
271;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-01-31T16:27:04Z;Assange signs deal with UK’s Telegraph;;Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has done a deal with the UK’s Telegraph newspaper to publish further cables following a breakdown in his collaboration with the Guardian Media Group.There is speculation that the whistle-blowing website intends to turn its focus to the finance industry with the next batch of cables and, in particular, Bank of America. Last autumn Mr Assange said WikiLeaks could release thousands of documents about a “major American bank” and that the leak would come in at the start of 2011.The Telegraph declined to comment.In an CBS interview on Sunday Mr Assange was asked about the next leak and said there would be a “process of elimination if we denied some banks and admitted others”.“I think it’s great to have all these banks squirming thinking maybe it’s them,” he said.Mr Assange entered into a partnership with The Guardian and other, non-UK media groups last year and published tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables which caused severe embarrassment to the US government.But a recent serialisation in The Guardian disclosed that the newspaper’s negotiations with Mr Assange were highly fraught. On one occasion the Australian and his lawyers “ambushed” Alan Rusbridger, The Guardian’s editor-in-chief, and threatened to sue him for endangering WikiLeaks’ financial assets.Bank of America saw its shares suffer on the back of speculation that it could be a target for the site and in December the bank blocked all payments to WikiLeaks along with MasterCard, PayPal Visa Europe and others.Mr Assange is wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual assault in Sweden and is under house arrest in a country house in England awaiting an extradition hearing, charges that he has vigorously denied. US officials have been looking into the possibilities of filing charges against him, but so far no specific charges haves been made.
272;MA;Mastercard Inc;2011-01-30T19:52:32Z;Visa and MasterCard warn consumers over fees;;Visa and MasterCard are spending tens of thousands of dollars on a soon-to-be-unveiled public awareness campaign designed to educate consumers on the perils of new debit card restrictions, according to people familiar with the plan.Working with major credit card issuers and smaller community banks, Visa and MasterCard are taking advantage of a rare opportunity potentially to delay the implementation of the new restrictions, which would limit the fees that banks charge merchants each time their debit card is swiped.Banks claim the changes could cost them $12bn a year in lost fees, while benefiting large retailers such as Walmart and Target.Several Congressmen recently signalled that they would be open to revisiting the rules, which became law last year as a last-minute amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act.Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who was one of the architects of the regulatory overhaul, said he would be willing to work with Republicans now controlling the House of Representatives on redesigning the restrictions.Spencer Bachus, who replaced Mr Frank as the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee following the midterm elections, has scheduled a tentative hearing for February 17.The Federal Reserve is currently accepting comments on a proposal to cap the fees at 12 cents per transaction, roughly a 70 per cent reduction from current rates.If finalised, the restriction would be a victory for large merchants, which have long argued that banks overcharge them for processing debit card transactions.“A debit card is nothing more than a plastic cheque,” said J. Craig Shearman, the vice-president of governmental affairs for the National Retail Federation. “It draws money out of the same account as a paper cheque, yet paper cheques clear at face value.”Banks claim that debit cards carry additional costs, including fraud protection and an instant guarantee of payment. They have warned that the cap being proposed by the Fed would only cover one-fifth of those expenses.To make up for the shortfall, some banks say they could add monthly fees to debit cards or restrict their use – ultimately forcing consumers to pay more for everyday banking services.Other perks are also likely to disappear. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, is doing away with a programme that allowed customers to waive current account fees if they used their debit card five times a month.In addition to curtailing bank revenue, the rules would hurt Visa and MasterCard, which set the fees, by potentially opening the debit card networks they run to more competition.
273;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Global police moves against ‘hacktivists’;;An online “hacktivist” group that brought down the websites of perceived opponents of WikiLeaks has itself become the target of an international police crackdown.The London Metropolitan Police arrested five men in connection with a recent spate of attacks by Anonymous, behind last month’s revenge assault on the websites of a number of organisations that had severed links with WikiLeaks.In the US, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it executed “more than 40” search warrants on Thursday to gather evidence likely to lead to arrests.The FBI said it was working on the case along with the UK, “authorities in the Netherlands, Germany and France”. Spokeswoman Jenny Shearer said no US arrests had been made by late afternoon on Thursday. “Evidence is being gathered and the investigation is ongoing”, she said. “These things do take time”.The Met’s e-Crime unit said five men aged between 15 and 26 were being held following a swoop on residential addresses in the West Midlands, Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire, Surrey and London on Thursday morning in the UK in relation to offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990.The maximum penalty under the UK act is 10 years imprisonment and a £5,000 fine. The FBI said those convicted in the US also could face 10-year sentences.Anonymous, a disparate group of online activists that has previously carried out campaigns against the Church of Scientology and the record industry, claimed last month’s attacks on companies including MasterCard and PayPal were a response to attempts to hinder WikiLeaks’ freedom of speech campaign.The internet activists used a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, overloading the targeted websites by bombarding them with requests. “Facilitating or conducting a DDoS attack is illegal”, the FBI said. “The victims included major US companies across several industries”.An FBI spokeswoman told the FT that the US warrants were under seal. Since the attack software distributed by Anonymous members does not disguise the internet addresses of those participating in the electronic assaults, former law enforcement officers have predicted that traffic logs from the companies affected would lead to internet service providers – the likely recipients of at least some of Thursday’s search warrants – and then in short order to the attackers themselves.In response to the UK arrests, Anonymous issued an open letter to the government via Twitter, the messaging site, explaining that it saw DDoS attacks as the modern digital equivalent of a sit-in demonstration, rather than a criminal action.“Just as is the case with traditional forms of protest, we block access to our opponents infrastructure to get our message across,” the letter said. “It is clear then, that arresting somebody for taking part in a DDoS attack is exactly like arresting somebody for attending a peaceful demonstration in their hometown.”The letter accused the arrests of being “politically motivated, and were being carried out under pressure from the US government”, adding that the potential punishments were disproportionate.Activity in Anonymous chat rooms has been subdued recently. Activists have been fretting about a rumoured international “swoop” by the authorities since mid-December. Dutch police arrested two teenagers last month in connection with the DDoS attacks.“Most of us have been laying low for a good while now. People were getting arrested and our VPN [virtual private network] got taken down by the feds [police],” one Anon told the FT on Wednesday.He said that recent arrests had exposed a weakness in the group’s shroud of anonymity. “They logged our IRC [internet relay chat] servers … stupid people. So the feds know about every one of us.”One of the Dutch people arrested has been released but the other remains in “deep trouble”, the Anon said.French police launched an investigation in the immediate aftermath of the cyberattack by Anonymous. In December they detained a 15-year-old on suspicion of participating in the hacking, holding her for several hours of questioning, according to a report on the website of Le Parisien newspaper. The girl was later released, but an inquiry is underway to determine her exact involvement, the paper says.The WikiLeaks website and its controversial founder, Julian Assange, are immersed in a political storm following the leak highly sensitive US government cables.Earlier this month, it emerged that Twitter had been asked to hand over documents to the US government including internet addresses and phone numbers of Mr Assange and WikiLeaks supporters in multiple countries.Many lawyers say the US government faces stiff obstacles in its bid to build a case for the extradition of Mr Assange. The Pentagon describes as “premature” reports that the US government had failed to establish a link between Mr Assange and Bradley Manning, a former US intelligence official, facing charges of leaking classified information.But establishing conspiracy charges against the two, or prosecuting Mr Assange on other grounds, could prove especially demanding.Meanwhile, Mr Assange will appear in court next month to decide whether he should be extradited to Sweden in connection with alleged sex crimes.Undeterred by the furore surrounding WikiLeaks, the group’s former spokesman this week launched his own whistleblowing website. Daniel Domscheit-Berg’s OpenLeaks website bills itself as “a non-profit community and service provider for whistleblowers and organisations, media, and individuals who engage in promoting transparency. It makes leaking at a local, grassroot level possible and allows for certain scalability.”Other WikiLeaks imitators have also sprung up in Russia, the Balkans and Indonesia.Additional reporting by Daniel Dombey in Washington and Peggy Hollinger in Paris
274;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-27T20:16:22Z;Confident shoppers set US tills ringing;;"US retailers have taken a further step away from the sales slump that followed the 2008 financial crisis, with preliminary sales estimates for the end of season pointing to steadily strengthening confidence among consumers.Heavy snowfall on the east coast and in the Midwest is likely to have dented sales on the day after Christmas, an important day for returns and spending with gift cards. But data from MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse survey pointed to strong overall growth in sales of clothing in the run-up to Christmas, and to positive sales of home furnishings, a sector that has fallen for the past three seasons.Michael McNamara, vice-president of SpendingPulse, said: “The headlines are that it was a positive season.”SpendingPulse bases its sales estimates on data from MasterCard’s card network and estimates of other forms of spending. It calculated that sales of clothing increased 11.2 per cent against last year, in the 50 days between November 5 and December 24, after remaining largely flat last year.Mr McNamara said the value of clothing sales had been supported by cold weather in many areas of the US, since sales of coats and other winter clothing tend to cost more. He said that retailers had largely kept to their planned promotions. “I didn’t see any broad emergency discounting come in this year; it was more strategic.”Jewellery sales rose 8.4 per cent against last year, according to SpendingPulse, while luxury sales excluding jewellery rose 6.7 per cent.Sales of electronics remained sluggish, increasing only 1.2 per cent during the period, reflecting in part the pressure from falling prices for televisions, which have declined by 10 per cent to 15 per cent.Amazon, the online retailer, said on Monday it had seen continued strong sales of the company’s Kindle e-readers, with the latest version having overtaken the last Harry Potter book to become the best selling item on its worldwide sites.Spending Pulse estimated that overall online sales rose by 15.4 per cent year-on-year in the run-up to Christmas.It also highlighted the 1.6 per cent increase in sales of home furnishings and furniture. The sector’s sales are still down about 18 per cent from 2007.Mr McNamara said the holiday sales performance provided more evidence of a return to “sustained growth” in retail sales, which picked up at the end of the summer with a robust “back to school” season.“In 2008, US retail got knocked down. In 2009, we got back on our feet. In 2010, you are seeing first steps forwards.”SpendingPulse estimated that total retail sales excluding cars, but including petrol prices, rose by 5.5 per cent against a year ago."
275;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-26T23:35:01Z;Assange signs book deals worth more than £1m;;Julian Assange has signed book deals worth more than £1m in the US and UK, to allow the WikiLeaks founder to cover his legal fees and maintain the whistleblowing site.He will be racing a disgruntled former colleague to release an autobiography telling his side of the WikiLeaks story. Both books are to be published by divisions of Random House next year.Mr Assange is fighting allegations of sexual assault in Sweden while trying to continue the gradual release of thousands of US diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks.Released on bail by the British high court in mid-December, he spent Christmas wearing a tracking tag, confined to a friend’s mansion home in East Anglia.The US administration, which has been angered and embarrassed by successive leaks of its foreign-policy secrets through WikiLeaks, is believed to be exploring ways to prosecute Mr Assange.The controversy did not dissuade readers of Time magazine voting Mr Assange their “person of the year” for his campaign for freedom of information and radical transparency from governments.He has agreed an $800,000 (£520,000) contract with Knopf, a US imprint of Random House, the Bertelsmann-owned publisher, and another £325,000 deal for the UK with Canongate, an independent publishing house based in Edinburgh.But although the deals are expected to net Mr Assange more than £1.1m ($1.7m) after the book is sold in other countries and serialised in newspapers around the world, Mr Assange said he had agreed to write his autobiography only reluctantly.“I don’t want to write this book, but I have to,” he told the Sunday Times. “I have already spent £200,000 for legal costs and I need to defend myself and to keep WikiLeaks afloat.”Mr Assange did not describe how he would divide the proceeds from his autobiography between his own personal legal costs and the operational funds required by WikiLeaks, which he has described as a large and distributed organisation that is not solely reliant on him.WikiLeaks’ operational costs have more than tripled since it drew up budgeting plans at the beginning of the year, due to the increased scope of information it has reviewed and published. Before “cablegate”, it released huge amounts of files about the Iraqi and Afghan wars.The whistleblowing site relies largely on donations from individuals, but had its fund-raising channels curtailed after several US financial services firms stopped processing payments to its account.Bank of America, MasterCard, Visa and PayPal have all stopped directing funds to WikiLeaks in recent weeks. They deny Mr Assange’s accusations that the actions were politically motivated. Mr Assange’s Swiss bank has also frozen his account.Last week, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a former WikiLeaks spokesman, announced he would publish a tell-all book next year about his time with the site.Crown Publishing, another division of Random House, will release “Inside Wikileaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World’s Most Dangerous Website” in 14 countries in February.The author, who called himself Daniel Schmitt when he worked at WikiLeaks, fell out with Mr Assange over the running and strategic priorities of the site.He has said that the allegations of Mr Assange’s sexual misconduct would be better handled privately and have become a burden to WikiLeaks.
276;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-24T02:12:49Z;Online sales in US grab bigger slice of pie;;Almost one-fifth of the dollars spent by Americans on clothing during this holiday season went to online purchases, according to spending estimates of the pre-Christmas shopping period by MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse survey.SpendingPulse, which estimates spending using MasterCard data and projections of other forms of payment, estimates that total online spending on clothing from the beginning of November to this week rose 25 per cent compared with last year.Online sales accounted for 18.9 per cent of all clothing purchases over the same period, up from 16.9 per cent last year, and compared with about 9 per cent three years ago.Overall e-commerce spending increased by 15.4 per cent during the same period, according to Michael McNamara, vice-president of SpendingPulse, with the total value of online sales estimated at $36.5bn, up from $31.5bn last year.Online sales rose last year by 15.5 per cent.“It’s been a good season for retail in general, but online has done particularly well,” Mr McNamara said, noting that daily online sales surpassed $1bn on six shopping days this year, compared with three days a year ago. SpendingPulse estimates that the Tuesday after the Thanksgiving holiday saw the strongest daily sales, at $1.1bn, with a second surge in mid-December as shipping deadlines approached for online orders.The National Retail Federation is forecasting that total retail sales will increase by about 3.6 per cent over November and December, year on year.The group raised its forecast from 2.6 per cent after seeing that November sales were stronger than had been expected.Online sales of electronics increased 12.2 per cent, according to SpendingPulse, in spite of declining prices in important categories including televisions and personal computers that have depressed overall industry sales.Online sales at leading department stores, which include clothing and other merchandise, rose 11 per cent.Mr McNamara noted that the dramatic expansion of online clothing sales contrasted with those of jewellery, where total sales increased by 4.5 per cent, according to SpendingPulse data, a rate of growth unchanged from last year.He suggested that the slow growth reflected the more fragmented nature of the jewellery business, where small independent retailers retain a large share of sales.In contrast, the past year has seen increased investment in online sales by a range of “brick and mortar” retailers, as well as the emergence of a new breed of limited-term luxury fashion sales sites such as Gilt.com and Rue La La.Additionally, both Amazon and Ebay have focused on improving the way their sites present and market clothing.
277;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-20T18:59:04Z;US retailers upbeat on holiday sales;;US retailers are this week unleashing last-minute promotional sales offers ahead of the Christmas holiday as they head towards the climax of a shopping season that shows signs of meeting optimistic forecasts.Department stores such as Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s are offering discounts of up to 50 per cent on items such as winter coats and sweaters, as they push to attract last-minute shoppers. But Wall Street analysts say the sector has largely kept to its scheduled promotional plans, with a conservative approach to inventory planning reducing the need for more drastic price cuts.Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group, a retail research firm, said that “even if prices are marked down, [the stores] are managing it better”.“For holiday 2010, there are three words that sum it up: it feels better,” she said after touring stores in several US cities since the start of the season.The positive sentiment was underlined by the most recent survey of sales in major categories by MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse, which uses card swipe data from MasterCard and estimates of other payment methods. SpendingPulse said that the momentum seen in November continued into the first two weeks of December, with “moderate to strong” sales gains in several sectors.The survey estimated that the overall clothing category was up 9.8 per cent for the period from October 31 to December 11, compared to the same period last year, while e-commerce sales were up 13.5 per cent.The jewellery sector had 2.6 per cent growth over the same period, while luxury sales excluding jewellery rose 2.8 per cent.But consumer electronics sales, which dipped below last year’s levels in the weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, remain slow, increasing only 0.4 per cent against last year. The sector has been hit in particular by continuing steep falls in the price of televisions, which contributed to weaker-than-expected earnings last week from Best Buy, the largest consumer electronics retailer.The National Retail Federation last week raised its forecast for annual sales growth for November and December by 1 percentage point to 3.3 per cent.
278;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-19T12:48:51Z;BofA joins the fray against WikiLeaks;US financial industry thought to be WikiLeaks’ next target;Bank of America is blocking all payments intended for WikiLeaks, amid growing speculation that the whistle-blowing site will embarrass the finance industry next year as it has the US government by leaking thousands of private diplomatic cables.“Bank of America joins in the actions previously announced by MasterCard, PayPal, Visa Europe and others and will not process transactions of any type that we have reason to believe are intended for WikiLeaks,” BOFA said.“This decision is based upon our reasonable belief that WikiLeaks may be engaged in activities that are, among other things, inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments.”In response, WikiLeaks called on its supporters to boycott Bank of America, whose shares have suffered from speculation that it could be a target for the site.“We ask that all people who love freedom close out their accounts at Bank of America,” WikiLeaks said on its Twitter profile. “Does your business do business with Bank of America? Our advise is to place your funds somewhere safer.”The site’s founder, Julian Assange, said on Friday that WikiLeaks would continue to release information about the financial services sector in spite of facing “attacks” by banks.“Over the last four years we have published information from over 120 countries,” Mr Assange told reporters outside Ellingham Hall, the English country house where he must remain while released on bail over allegations of sexual offences in Sweden.“It is our normal business to publish information about banks. We have been attacked primarily not by government … but in fact by banks: banks from Dubai, banks from Switzerland, banks from the United States, banks from the UK. So yes of course we are continuing to release material about banks.”In an interview last year, Mr Assange reportedly said that WikiLeaks had many files about Bank of America that have not yet been released.At the same time as facing constraints on its funding sources, WikiLeaks’ budget has been tripled this year, amid ongoing cyber attacks and a greater volume of publications. The US Department of Justice is considering several avenues for potential prosecution of Mr Assange, in the hopes of deterring future leaks.“Over 85 per cent of our economic resources are spent dealing with attacks – dealing with technical attacks, dealing with political attacks, dealing with legal attacks, not doing journalism,” Mr Assange said.Bank of America’s move could prompt reprisals from Anonymous, the loose group of pro-WikiLeaks online activists. Anonymous disrupted websites belonging to MasterCard and PostFinance, the Swiss bank which has frozen Mr Assange’s account, in revenge attacks earlier this month.Lawyers for Mr Assange last week created a new defence fund for supporters to contribute to his legal expenses. Over the weekend, Mr Assange himself suffered the leak of a Swedish police file relating to allegations of rape and other sexual offences from two women, which the WikiLeaks founder has repeatedly denied.The Guardian and the New York Times, newspapers with which WikiLeaks has partnered to examine thousands of US diplomatic cables over recent weeks, both published details of the alleged events in Stockholm last August, based on police interviews.
279;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-17T09:02:23Z;Visa / MasterCard;Shares drop on proposed cuts in debit card interchange fees;A sign of things to come? The Dodd-Frank financial reforms left regulators to decide on the actual details of new rules, and one of the first instalments in that process surprised the market on Thursday afternoon. Shares in MasterCard and Visa both dropped more than a 10th after details of the Durbin report revealed proposals for larger than expected reductions in interchange fees for debit cards – charges associated with processing transactions.The market had anticipated that fees would fall by about 50 to 60 per cent. The Federal Reserve finally decided that the cost of processing a transaction is a mere 7 cents, and so capped the fee at 12 cents.Assuming that the average debit card transaction is about $45, the new rate is a typical charge of 27 basis points. Compared with the current average rate of roughly 120bp, calculates UBS, the new rules impose a 75 cent price cut. Full speed ahead to the cashless economy as swiping a card becomes cheaper than dealing with notes and coins: theft, handling and longer queuing times result in a cost of perhaps 50bp to 100bp.While large retailers will cheer, consumers should perhaps be indifferent. The Australian experience, where interchange rates were cut in 2005, produced little measurable gain for shoppers. Meanwhile banks may react to the hit to their earnings by pulling benefits attached to card schemes, increasing charges or, in extremis, giving up on the business together.Still, in typical regulatory fashion, one can was kicked down the road. The decision on whether to force card issuers to end exclusivity on systems using signature security (as opposed to pin numbers) was deferred until February. Doing so would genuinely open a market dominated by Visa and MasterCard to competition. There may still be some surprises.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
280;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-17T01:25:20Z;Card fee cut hits Visa and MasterCard;;Visa and MasterCard shares plunged after the Federal Reserve proposed rules to eliminate billions of dollars in debit card fees.The new rules, which could still change before they are finalised early next year, are a huge win for large retailers like Walmart and Target, but represent a significant setback for card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, as well as for Visa and MasterCard, which operate the debit card networks.The fees are fixed by Visa and MasterCard and paid by merchants to card-issuing banks to cover the cost of processing transactions.Under the first of two proposals, card issuers would be required to charge merchants no more than their actual costs, which the Fed estimates at 7 cents a transaction. The second proposal would cap the fees at 12 cents a transaction.That is far less than the 63 cents a transaction that issuers currently charge retailers and represents a reduction in debt-card fees of roughly $10bn, or more than 80 per cent, according to the Merchants Payment Coalition.“Today’s draft rule from the Federal Reserve makes it clear that big bank interchange rules overcharge businesses and consumers,” said Senator Dick Durbin, who authored an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act that required the Fed to write new rules capping the fees.“The changes we had to enforce by law in the US are being voluntarily implemented by mega-banks and card giants in Europe and other countries,” Mr Durbin added.The European Commission has reached deals with MasterCard and Visa Europe to reduce interchange fees to 0.2 per cent on cross-border debit card transactions in Europe.The Fed proposal may also loosen the grip of Visa and MasterCard on the debit market by requiring that all cards use at least two networks.Visa and MasterCard on Thursday fell 12.7 per cent and 10.3 per cent, respectively, “due to interchange being lowered more than expected”, Adam Frisch, of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients.Mr Frisch estimated that the fee restrictions will reduce 2012 earnings for Bank of America by 4 cents a share and JPMorgan by 6 cents a share.Banks said any attempt to set rates would lead to higher costs for consumers. Analysts expect banks to react to the new rules by eliminating other services such as reward programmes.“The rules proposed by the Federal Reserve today will have a dramatic impact on the cost of banking services for consumers nationwide,” said Edward Yingling, chief executive of the American Bankers Association.Visa said, “Visa also has concerns that the Federal Reserve’s proposal includes artificial caps on debit interchange that do not realistically reflect the value of card acceptance and do not reflect the actual costs of running a secure, reliable and efficient debit network.”
281;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-16T21:46:03Z;US stocks edge higher on manufacturing data;;"FedEx shares rose in spite of missing analyst expectations as the delivery company was upbeat about its fiscal year 2011, while the wider indices edged higher.FedEx missed expectations with its second-quarter profit, which was lower than in the same period a year ago. Earnings came in at $1.16 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.31 and revenue was also lighter than the consensus forecast.But the package delivery company raised its forecast for the fiscal year 2011 on the back of a stronger-than-expected holiday season, much of which was not included in the second quarter. It now predicts earnings per share of between $5.00 and $5.30 for the full year.Shares in FedEx gained 2 per cent to $94.22, helping the wider industrials sector add 1.1 per cent.The stock fell after its reported first-quarter results in September which had more than doubled year-on-year because the company issued a cautious outlook warning of the slowing of economic growth.Rival United Parcel Service also rose, up 2.1 per cent to $73.76.“I’ve always looked at FedEx as a bellwether of US economic activity because they transport goods across the country,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Smart Growth Funds. “They raised estimates on the back of the positive holiday season but is that going to extend
into 2011?”Stocks extended their gains after a report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region rose to 24.3 in December, maintaining and adding to gains after a jump to 22.5 the month before.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,242.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to close at 11,499.25 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,637.31.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, down 3,000 to 420,000. But last week’s figures on the number of people claiming unemployment benefit for the first time were revised slightly higher.“This is a modest decline but enough to keep both the four- and eight-week moving averages heading down; the former is now at just 422,750, the lowest since July 2008, before the Lehman bust,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.A separate report released before the opening bell showed construction began on more homes in November than in the month before, the first such rise for three months.The S&P 500 homebuilders index added 1.6 per cent to $248.16.Shares in Visa and Mastercard tumbled after the Federal Reserve proposed new rules which could cut the debit card fees paid by retailers who accept the cards by up to 90 per cent. Visa dropped 12.7 per cent to $67.19 and Mastercard lost 10.3 per cent to $223.49.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $12.52 after the bank said investors in some mortgage bonds had agreed to postpone a deadline
for resolving a dispute
over the assets.The biggest truckload carrier in North America, Swift Transportation, edged up 0.9 per cent to $11.10 in its first day of trading. The company had to cut the price of its initial public offering to $806m, or $11 per share, when it had originally offered shares at between $13 and $15 each.In other earnings news, General Mills profits rose 8.6 per cent and shares added 0.6 per cent to $36.59 after the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup missed analyst expectations. Sales volume rose but the company cut prices
to attract cash-conscious
shoppers.Starbucks added 2.3 per cent to $32.59 after analysts at Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of the coffee chain by placing it on their “conviction buy” list, saying it has not yet saturated the US market.They gave the stock a $44 price target, 38 per cent higher than the stock’s previous closing price.Meanwhile, Transocean, which fell on Wednesday after it was among the companies that the US government sued over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, dropped further and was down 3.6 per cent to $69.31 after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the oil rig owner from “overweight” to “equal weight”."
282;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-16T00:59:30Z;UK police investigate WikiLeaks supporters;;The London Metropolitan Police is investigating recent web attacks by Anonymous, the pro-WikiLeaks activists who have taken revenge against perceived opponents of the whistleblowing site.The Met has been examining alleged criminal offences by Anonymous - which has previously targeted the record industry and the Scientologists - for several months.This week, the London police service stepped up its investigation in the wake of recent “denial of service” attacks, whereby websites are swamped with traffic and rendered inaccessible.Several companies, including MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon, were targeted by the “hacktivists”, who believe the technology and payment firms have hindered WikiLeaks’ campaign for freedom of information by withdrawing services to the site.“Earlier this year the Metropolitan Police Service received a number of allegations of ‘denial-of-service’ cyber attacks against several companies by a group calling themselves Anonymous. We are investigating these criminal allegations and our investigation is ongoing,” the Met said in a statement.“The Metropolitan Police Service is monitoring the situation relating to recent and ongoing denial of service attacks and will investigate where appropriate.”An internet advisory group to the European Union also warned on Wednesday that the spate of leaks, attacks and counter-attacks raised “important implications for information security”.Prof Udo Helmbrecht, executive director of Enisa, called for global co-operation to tackle internet security threats such as the leakage of sensitive documents and DoS attacks.Anonymous, a loose association of anti-censorship campaigners and teenage hackers, brought down the Swedish prosecutor’s website for several hours on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, after its appeal against Julian Assange’s bail blocked the WikiLeaks founder’s release from jail.Mr Assange is accused of committing sexual offences against two Swedish women in Stockholm, allegations Mr Assange denies.Just two hours after being granted bail by a London magistrate, the WikiLeaks founder was again remanded in custody after the Swedish prosecution service launched an appeal. He will appear in court again on Thursday when the Swedish authorities make their case, which is likely to centre on his perceived flight risk.The Anonymous “hactivists” have given several WikiLeaks opponents what they called a digital “black eye” during the past week, perhaps encouraged by a statement by Mr Assange that his supporters should “protect my work”.Only two arrests have been made so far in relation to the DOS attacks. Two teenagers were arrested in the Netherlands last week, one of whom has already been released. The other, a 16-year-old described by other Anonymous operatives as a leading activist and co-ordinator, has confessed to the crimes, Dutch police said.One Anonymous operative told the Financial Times that the group has become nervous after rumours of a large, international swoop by the authorities.The activist said that that a sympathiser within one of the payment companies that Anonymous has targeted had tipped off one of its members that he had been identified, and that the Anonymous memebr was now “on the run”.Two other senior Anonymous operatives have resigned fearing a clampdown by the authorities, the person said, as rumours swirl on its chatrooms of co-ordinated, simultaneous arrests in several countries.Meanwhile, Mr Assange’s UK attorney Mark Stephens said at the weekend that the Swedes had informed his team that the US investigation of WikiLeaks for espionage or other wrongdoing had accelerated. “We have heard from the Swedish authorities that there has been a secretly empanelled grand jury in Alexandria”, Virginia, he told Al Jazeera interviewer David Frost.Because Sweden has indicated it would be likely to defer to the US if an indictment was forthcoming and try to extradite him to America, the sex allegations are “nothing more than a holding charge”, Mr Stephens said.A spying case in the US would nonetheless be difficult to prosecute. Some members of Congress have acknowledged as much in proposing new laws that would make publishing classified US documents an offence. At present, an Espionage Act case would conflict with First Amendment free-speech protection, said Kevin Bankston, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.“Based on the facts available so far, any attempt to prosecute Julian Assange for publishing the cables would be unprecedented as a matter of First Amendment law and would likely face insurmountable hurdles”, Mr Bankston said.But there are other laws the US could invoke. There is a conspiracy component to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which might apply to anyone who actively aided suspected leakers who had unauthorised access to the State Department material.That sort of coaching would be hard to prove, said E.J. Hilbert, a former FBI anti-hacker agent who is now president of Online Intelligence.Mr Hilbert said charges also could be sought for receving stolen goods.

285;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-10T19:21:18Z;Anonymous cyberwarriors stun experts;;"Internet subcultures rarely make front page news. But when the mysterious forces of Anonymous took it upon themselves to attack opponents of WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing website, their success took everyone – not least victims such as Visa, MasterCard and PayPal – by surprise.This year has seen military and security experts often warn about the prospects of “cyberwarfare”. Few expected the most prominent assaults against large companies to come from a scattered group of anarchists and idealists with no identifiable leader, membership or nationality.The loose internet grouping that calls itself Anonymous has been notorious in web circles for years, particularly for its apparently random attacks on the music industry, Kiss singer Gene Simmons, YouTube and the Scientologists. Its wilfully illiterate grammar and black humour has permeated the internet far beyond the 4chan messageboard, which originally spawned it.Even as the more serious matters of attacks on big companies were plotted this week, Anonymous followers in 4chan’s open chat rooms chimed in with insults and jokes. But with what it has dubbed “Operation Payback” the group has mounted its most ideological crusade yet.Attempts to scupper WikiLeaks last week, as payment and web hosting companies pulled their support for the site amid intense political pressure, have made Julian Assange, the whistle-blowing website’s imprisoned founder, the pin-up for Anonymous’s campaign against censorship.“WikiLeaks is a litmus test for freedom of speech and freedom of information,” one Operation Payback participant told the Financial Times.Anonymous operates with what to outsiders can look like chaotic abandon.Speaking to the FT, a group of “Anons” – as Anonymous members call themselves – said people of any political stripe were welcome in the group. “Good ideas are good ideas no matter who puts them up,” said one Anon, an American in his late 20s who admits to having limited technical know-how.When issues such as whom to attack are put on the floor of their 24-hour-a-day internet chat rooms, whoever is logged in at the time votes. Some administrators can kick people out of the discussion but chaos reigns.What some would see as infighting, Anons see as a decentralised approach that keeps them fleet of foot.“Having no command structure in Anonymous, we are not vulnerable to having that command structure taken down,” one said. “If someone starts trying to be a ringleader, everyone tells them to shut up. If you jump behind a leader and that leader is taken down, the entire movement is vulnerable.”Just as Anonymous welcomes all who subscribe to its extreme free-speech agenda, it is merciless to those who – like a 16-year-old Dutch member arrested this week – get left behind. “Everyone knows the risks when they step into this,” the Anon said, claiming that he would not be upset if his own bank account details ended up on WikiLeaks. “If my information gets out in the public, that’s my fault.”He said it would “suck” if leaked military secrets caused harm to US troops but that would not sway his beliefs.“The internet is something sacred – don’t screw with it, leave it alone,” he said. “If [authorities] are willing to gun down WikiLeaks in broad daylight, they will come down on you as well. If you join us, you have a voice …Nobody is going to stop Anonymous unless you pull the plug on the internet.”Operation Payback has hit targets far and wide. As well as Amazon, the trader, and payment companies, websites belonging to the Swedish government; the Dutch police; Senator Joe Lieberman, a critic of WikiLeaks; and Sarah Palin, the former US vice-presidential candidate, were targeted.WikiLeaks did not endorse the attacks.Still, Anonymous was able to gather enough support to launch a basic and yet effective strike on the websites of some of the world’s largest organisations.Anonymous encouraged “hacktivists” to download a simple tool – known as the “low orbit ion cannon” – that allows their computers to be used to inundate the targeted website with requests and bring it down.Anonymous said it was not trying to knock over services for the general public, merely the “online public face” of offending organisations.Additional reporting by Mary Watkins and Joseph Menn"
286;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-09T22:40:26Z;MasterCard buys Travelex’s pre-paid card business;Payment network provider pays £290m for division;MasterCard, the electronic payment network provider, has bought the pre-paid card management division from Travelex for £290m, boosting its presence in the fast-growing pre-paid card market.The division manages and supplies consumer and corporate pre-paid cards – an electronic alternative to travellers’ cheques – to various partners, including financial institutions, retailers and foreign exchange retailers.The foreign exchange specialist will continue to provide Travelex Cash Passport, its pre-paid card programme, as before. As part of the deal, under MasterCard’s ownership, the division will carry on providing management services to Travelex.Proceeds from the sale would be ploughed back into the business, the company said.“The sale of CPM will allow us to accelerate our investment plans, particularly in higher growth regions such as Asia and South America and in the growing e-commerce channel,” said Peter Jackson, chief executive at Travelex. A portion will also go towards paying down its senior debt facilities.The division includes a call centre in Peterborough. Mr Jackson said he did not expect the sale to result in redundancies.Travelex was advised on the deal by Smithsquare Partners, a recently-launched corporate finance boutique.Set up in 1976 in London by Lloyd Dorfman, Travelex is one of the UK’s larger private companies with a presence in more than 20 countries. Apax, a private equity group, owns 63 per cent, Mr Dorfman owns 28 per cent and Standard Chartered owns 6 per cent.Last year Travelex reported revenues of £625m with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of £119m. Mr Jackson, who took over the top job in March, said the company was on track to record its all-time second-strongest performance on an Ebitda-basis this year.He acknowledged but declined to comment on speculation that Apax may seek to sell its stake or take the company public.Fast-growing and emerging markets are an area of focus for Travelex as it seeks to expand its global footprint. As part of that strategy, the company said on Thursday that it has taken a “significant” shareholding in FX Africa, one of southern Africa’s largest consumer foreign exchange providers, but declined to disclose details of the deal.FX Africa has a total of 64 stores in South Africa, Botswana and Zambia. The company and Travelex have operated a franchise in the region for over four years.
287;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Teenager held over WikiLeaks assaults;;Dutch police have arrested a 16-year-old boy for online attacks on MasterCard and PayPal, as the digital guerilla warfare between WikiLeaks’ supporters and its opponents escalated.Anonymous, the loose group of internet campaigners that has been supporting WikiLeaks, claimed credit for disrupting the websites of MasterCard, Visa and PayPal on Wednesday and Thursday, but were frustrated in their attempts to take down Amazon’s site, in spite of threatening the online retailer with a so-called “denial of service attack”.However, WikiLeaks’ site is still being bombarded by cyber-assaults following its mass release of confidential US documents. And Facebook and Twitter removed social-networking profiles operated by Anonymous, who have made revenge attacks against services its supporters accuse of abandoning WikiLeaks in recent days.Anonymous has been using social networking sites to co-ordinate its computer assaults in what it calls “Operation Payback”.But its own website and some of its online chatrooms were rendered inaccessible for part of Thursday afternoon. Security experts said it was likely that a denial-of-service attack – whereby a website is flooded with traffic from a large number of computers – had brought down anonops.net, while some internet service providers may be blocking traffic to its chatrooms.In a statement, the Dutch public prosecutor said that its national high-tech crime team in the Hague had remanded a boy in custody, after it discovered that some of the attacks had originated in the Netherlands. The individual, who prosecutors said had confessed to denial-of-service attacks on the payment processors, will appear in court on Friday.The Dutch authorities said that it had confiscated computer equipment and that they were continuing investigating the larger group of hackers they suspected were behind the attacks.The moves against Anonymous, a loose collective of “hacktivists”, did not come soon enough to stop it from briefly disabling websites belonging to Visa, the Swedish government, Senator Joe Lieberman, a vocal critic of WikiLeaks and Sarah Palin, the former US vice-presidential candidate.“Hacktivists” continue to threaten Amazon and PayPal.Anonymous accused Amazon of hypocrisy for selling an e-book version of the WikiLeaks cables just days after stopping its hosting support for the site for breaching its service terms.WikiLeaks operatives have sought to distance themselves from Operation Payback, saying they “neither condemn nor applaud these attacks”.Additional reporting by Stanley Pignal in Brussels
288;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-09T14:37:36Z;Facebook and Twitter remove hackers;;Dutch police have arrested a 16-year-old boy for online attacks on MasterCard and PayPal, after a day of frustration for activists hoping to strike back against perceived opponents of WikiLeaks.Anonymous, the loose group of internet campaigners, claimed credit for disrupting internet the websites of MasterCard, Visa and PayPal on Wednesday and Thursday, but failed to take down Amazon, in spite of threatening the online retailer with a so-called “denial of service attack”.Facebook and Twitter earlier removed accounts operated by Anonymous, who have made revenge attacks against services perceived to have abandoned WikiLeaks in recent days following the release of thousands of confidential US documents.The online campaign, known as Operation Payback, has been using the social networking sites, as well as other chat rooms, to co-ordinate its computer assaults.In a statement, the Dutch public prosecutor said that its national high-tech crime team in the Hague had arrested a 16-year-old boy, after it discovered that some of the attacks had originated in the Netherlands. The individual, which prosecutors said had confessed to denial-of-service attacks on the payment processors, will appear in court on Friday.Twitter and Facebook both removed accounts that appear under the campaign’s name. Operation Payback’s Twitter account linked to a file appearing to contain consumer credit card information before the account was taken offline.MasterCard said that none of its customer data has been compromised and that the credit card numbers were fake.One website belonging to Anonymous also went offline on Thursday afternoon, which some security experts said was due to a deliberate attack on the site.But the moves against Anonymous, a loose collective of “hacktivists”, have not stopped them from disabling websites belonging to Visa and the Swedish government. New social networking accounts have already sprung up in place of those removed by Twitter and Facebook.Amazon and Paypal have emerged as the latest targets for Operation Payback. Amazon has come under renewed criticism from Anonymous for selling an e-book version of the WikiLeaks cables, after pulling hosting support for the site last week.But Operation Payback’s attempts to fell one of the world’s largest online retailers failed, prompting it to turn against parts of PayPal’s online payment service instead.Amazon, PayPal, Visa and MasterCard have all stopped working with WikiLeaks over the past week, each claiming that the site breached its terms of service, rather than acting in response to governmental intervention.Anonymous, working independently from WikiLeaks, has targeted some of these sites, saying it disapproved of anything akin to censorship on the internet. On Wednesday it caused disruption for MasterCard’s online payment processing service on one of the year’s busiest days for online shopping.Sites belonging to Senator Joe Lieberman, a vocal critic of WikiLeaks, Sarah Palin, the former US vice-presidential candidate, and the Swedish prosecutor, who is investigating allegations of sexual offences against Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder, have also been overwhelmed with hostile traffic.WikiLeaks itself has been using Twitter and Facebook as the main communication channels, in spite of pressure from US politicians to pull support for the whistleblower site.Facebook said it had pulled down the Operation Payback page because it breached its publishing code.“We take our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities seriously and react quickly to reports of inappropriate or illegal content and behaviour. In this case, we removed a page because it was promoting a DDOS attack,” said the website.Twitter declined to comment.In a “manifesto” published online on Thursday, Anonymous said it “most certainly is not a group of hackers”, describing itself as “decentralised” and “similar to a river”. It said Operation Payback was a campaign against those who seek to “misuse the internet” and was directed towards those who “employ unfair means to fight WikiLeaks”.The statement said it did not intend to attack the “critical infrastructure” of Visa and MasterCard, but instead disrupt their corporate websites.WikiLeaks said in a statement that they “neither condemn nor applaud these attacks” by Operation Payback.
289;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;‘Hacktivists’ take revenge for WikiLeaks;;Computer hackers disrupted MasterCard’s online payment processing system for several hours on one of the busiest shopping days of the year as part of revenge attacks on companies that blocked services to WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing website.A group of “hacktivists” known as Anonymous spearheaded the attacks and dubbed them “Operation Payback”.Automated barrages by WikiLeaks’ defenders also temporarily shut down web pages controlled by other companies that have cut connections with WikiLeaks, including credit card network Visa, whose public home page was down for less than an hour. In a statement, Visa said its regular payment processing was unaffected.As government criticism of WikiLeaks’ mass release of US confidential diplomatic cables has intensified, so too has online support for the site, particularly among internet freedom enthusiasts.MasterCard initially blamed problems with its website on heavy traffic but later said some SecureCode services had been disrupted. It reassured customers that core processing capabilities have not been compromised and cardholder account data has not been placed at risk”.But Jon Prideaux, deputy chief executive of SecureTrading, a UK internet payment service provider servicing several large retailers and charities, said SecureCode had been unavailable for up to six hours.“This is one of the biggest trading days in the internet shopping calendar. This is an extremely bad time for this to happen,” Mr Prideaux said.Some technology experts said the disruption of core commerical services by a few thousand individuals could prompt calls for internet service providers to take a more active role in policing their networks and blocking connections from computers identitifed as participating in what are known as denial-of-service attacks.“We need to drain the swamp of malicious activity”, said Andy Purdy, former acting director of the National Cyber Security Division at the US Department of Homeland Security.Twitter, which has not suspended WikiLeaks’ accounts, apparently did drop postings from Anonymous, though they could resume under a new name.The attack comes just a day after Julian Assange, WikiLeaks’ founder, was remanded in custody by a London court until December 14 after Stockholm issued an arrest warrant in connection with alleged sexual offences in Sweden. Mr Assange denies the charges.The hacking free-for-all knocked offline a website of Swedish prosecutors, in retribution for the sex charges that led to Mr Assange’s arrest.There were also attacks on PostFinance.ch, a bank that froze Mr Assange’s accounts, preventing other customers from making transactions for more than 11 hours, according to Panda Security.The official blog at PayPal, which the internet payments processor had used to explain its decision to stop handling donations to WikiLeaks, was shut by denial-of-service attacks for more than eight hours.WikiLeaks itself used a fresh dump of diplomatic cables to hit back at MasterCard and Visa, which has also suspended use of its network. It released a cable that appeared to show US diplomats had lobbied against proposed Russian legislation this year that could “disadvantage” US payment card companies.More traditional lobbying groups such as The Internet Society, an industry body which promotes internet standards and policy, have also leapt to WikiLeaks’ defence.However, WikiLeaks remains defiant, saying that Mr Assange’s arrest will not prevent it from continuing to publish cables.“We will not be gagged, either by judicial actions or corporate censorship,” WikiLeaks said in a statement. It also named Amazon and EveryDNS as companies that had cut links.All of the companies that have suspended their services denied they were subject to political pressure but said that WikiLeaks had violated customer agreements.WikiLeaks has seen its own site come under attack from hackers and has also been forced to shift its main website to a Swiss domain after Amazon threw it off its web host. Last week EveryDNS.net, the company administering its domain name system, terminated its services.Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence, an international group of whistleblowers that includes Daniel Ellsberg, the former US government analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971, also issued a statement in support of WikiLeaks.Mr Ellsberg added: “The truth is that every attack now made on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange was made against me and the release of the Pentagon Papers at the time.”Security experts said that cyber attacks were increasingly being used as a weapon to embarrass large organisations and further attacks were “highly likely”.
290;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Cyberattack targets Swedish prosecutors;;Sweden’s prosecution service has been targeted by computer hackers apparently enraged by its criminal investigation against Julian Assange, founder of the WikiLeaks website.The website of the Swedish prosecution authority was temporarily shut down after a co-ordinated cyberattack on Tuesday night.A further onslaught on Wednesday knocked out internet communications at the Stockholm law firm representing the Swedish women who have accused Mr Assange of sex crimes.The attacks were the latest in a barrage of cyberassaults against organisations embroiled in the broader controversy surrounding WikiLeaks and its release of 250,000 confidential US memos that have shed often embarrassing light on the inner workings of international diplomacy.The Anonymous group of so-called “hacktivists” on Wednesday claimed responsibility for disrupting the MasterCard website in protest over the card payment company’s decision to stop accepting donations to WikiLeaks..Sweden defended its prosecution service against claims of a political conspiracy against Mr Assange and denied speculation that the sex crimes case could lead to him being handed over to the US.Carl Bildt, Sweden’s foreign minister, said there had been no contact between Swedish and US authorities on the possible extradition of Mr Assange and insisted there was no political involvement in Sweden’s efforts to extradite him from the UK on suspicion of “rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion”.“We have an independent judiciary, quite independently acting in accordance to the law and [which] does not have any contacts with Swedish political authorities or with any other authorities,” Mr Bildt said.Mr Assange was held without bail in London on Tuesday after he was arrested by UK police acting on a Swedish warrant circulated by Interpol, the international police organisation. The 39-year-old Australian has denied any wrongdoing against the two women, who accused him of sexual misconduct while he was visiting Sweden last August, and claims the allegations could be part of US-inspired “dirty tricks campaign”.Claes Borgström, lawyer for the two women, accused Mr Assange of encouraging conspiracy theories to avoid responsibility for his actions. “My first thoughts are with my clients who are two women who have been drawn in to some sort of global political event, which they have nothing to do with whatsoever,” he said on Wednesday. “And now their attorney has been subject to a [cyber]attack. It’s totally insane and I’m deeply troubled by it.”Lawyers for Mr Assange have portrayed Mr Borgström as an activist lawyer using the case to push a feminist agenda and expand the definition of rape in a country known for its strong commitment to gender equality and its tough stance towards sexual abuse. Mr Borgström did not respond to requests for comment.Mr Assange’s sympathisers say the claims against him – some of which involve a dispute over the use of a condom – would not be defined as rape or even sexual assault in the UK or most other countries.Gudrun Schyman, leader of the Feminist Initiative, a Swedish political party, said she was “very pleased” that Sweden’s hardline approach to sex crimes had been exposed to international attention. The number of reported rapes in Sweden is the highest in the European Union, with 53 offences per 100,000 inhabitants. That compares with 24 per 100,000 in the UK, the second highest incidence.Mr Borgström rated the chances of Sweden pressing charges against Mr Assange at “more than 50/50”. “It has nothing to do with WikiLeaks or the CIA.”
291;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-12-05T22:00:11Z;Amex chief calls for jobs taskforce;;Ken Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, has called for an alliance of business leaders and politicians to find concrete ways to create millions of jobs in the US and kick-start the anaemic economic recovery.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Chenault, who has met frequently with President Barack Obama and his aides, proposed a special commission to set a target for new jobs and specific measures to reduce stubbornly high unemployment.“I’d like to see an industry taskforce between the public and private sectors to determine what businesses need to create jobs,” he said. He added that it would be essential for any public-private taskforce to set a specific target and a timeframe for the new jobs in order to force government and business to take tangible steps to reduce unemployment.Mr Chenault’s proposal was given added urgency by Friday’s official figures showing that employers added fewer-than-expected jobs in November, pushing the unemployment rate to 9.8 per cent of the workforce.The call for a truce between the White House, which has attacked companies’ reluctance to invest in the economy, and a business community that has been calling for more government help, was echoed in other parts of corporate America.The Business Roundtable, the trade organisation for some of the largest US companies including Amex, said Mr Chenault’s proposal was “very intriguing” and could be debated at a meeting of its members this week. The White House declined to comment.Mr Chenault, whose company collects data on millions of retail transactions, said that high unemployment was the biggest obstacle to a faster economic recovery.Amex, the world’s largest credit card company by purchases, fared better than many rivals during the financial crisis, partly because it aggressively restructured its operations, cutting thousands of jobs.Mr Chenault reiterated Amex’s determination to fight a Department of Justice lawsuit that accused the company of violating antitrust laws in October. The DoJ alleged that Amex prevented merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment such as cash, debit cards and credit cards with lower fees. Visa and Mastercard, Amex’s rivals that were also named in the suit, have settled with the authorities, but Mr Chenault has vowed to fight claims that its so-called swipe fees are excessive.
292;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;First Republic plans to raise $300m in IPO;;"First Republic, a California bank formerly controlled by Merrill Lynch, announced it was seeking to raise up to $300m in an initial public offering less than a year after it was sold to private equity groups.The bank, which focuses on wealthy individuals, is selling 4m shares at a targeted price range of $24 to $27 a share. Its private equity owners are also selling 7m shares, for a maximum amount of $297m.Bank of America inherited First Republic in its December 2008 acquisition of Merrill. However, the US lender chose not to integrate the business into its mortgage operations and First Republic was added to the list of non-core assets slated for disposal. The bank has also sold stakes in Itau Unibanco, MasterCard, BlackRock and Grupo Financiero Santander.A group of private equity firms including Colony Capital, run by Tom Barrack; General Atlantic; Pine Bridge and GI Partners owns 60 per cent of the bank’s shares.The group purchased the bank from BofA in June for a contribution of $1.86bn in common equity capital. Colony and General Atlantic, which led the deal, each own 21.8 per cent.The price would value the bank at as much as $3.4bn, based on 128m shares outstanding.An additional 600,000 shares could be sold to the underwriters.Merrill acquired First Republic in 2007 for $1.8bn. The deal had been a centrepiece in Merrill’s push to sell more banking services to its brokerage clients.It was the bank’s largest acquisition in a decade and Merrill paid a heavy premium for it – more than three times book value.Two months before Merrill announced the deal, BofA had snapped up US Trust, a wealth management unit that catered to the kind of well-heeled clients that First Republic served.The proceeds from the private equity group’s share sale will not go to the bank. The bank intends to use its proceeds, estimated at $97m, for general corporate purposes.The lead bookrunners on the deal are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase.The share offering market for financial groups has been mixed so far in 2010. Liberty Mutual Agency Corp, an insurer, withdrew its planned $1.3bn IPO in September, which would have been the largest US issue in 2010 at the time.However, Primerica, a retail financial products group spun-off from Citigroup, raised $320m in April and saw its shares jump 31 per cent on the first day of trading.Private equity groups TPG and Hellman & Friedman led an IPO of LPL Financial, a broker-dealer to independent financial advisers. It raised $470m at the beginning of November and its shares are up 4.4 per cent."
293;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-11-17T20:07:47Z;Getco wins DMM role for GM share sale;;Getco, one of the world’s largest proprietary trading firms, has been appointed sole “designated market maker” (DMM) for General Motors stock once the auto maker is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.A DMM has an obligation to maintain orderly markets, provide quotes on stocks at the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) and facilitate trading at potentially illiquid moments of the trading day such as the open and close.As a DMM, Chicago-based Getco will be responsible for maintaining bids and offers in GM stock in the opening minutes after trading starts.The process is an extended version of the normal daily “auction” that takes place in the minutes after the opening bell and, where initial public offerings are involved, is designed to ensure that trading is not too volatile at the outset.DMMs get to see all incoming orders for the stock, and ensure that “best bids meet best offers”, a NYSE Euronext spokesman said.The DMM system operated by NYSE Euronext is a hybrid of the role of the old “specialists” on the trading floor. DMMs do not get to see incoming orders before others, as specialists once did.But they are required under an “affirmative obligation” arrangement to buy shares in a falling market and sell in a rising market under certain circumstances, determined using a formula that is triggered under certain market conditions.DMMs also trade shares using their own funds - which is typical of proprietary traders such as Getco, which also engage in high-frequency trading strategies.Chicago-based Getco became the first proprietary trading firm of its kind to become a DMM in February, when it bought 350 “assignments” – that is, stock names or other types of securities linked to listed companies – from Barclays. The UK-based bank had itself just bought LaBranche, a long-standing DMM, but had to divest some of its assignments as part of that deal.Of Getco’s assignments, 234 are company stocks such as Nike, Bristol Myers Squibb, Mastercard, RBS, GlaxoSmithKline, Domino’s, Sotheby’s and Philip Morris International, for which Getco has market-making obligations.
294;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US bank earnings;Better-than-expected results point to QE conundrum;"Like it or not, financial groups have their fingers in every slice of the modern economic pie. Hence, you get a good idea about the state of a nation from their results. All banks in the S&P 500 have now reported for the third quarter. What do the numbers say? Contrary to the more alarmist arguments for the resumption of quantitative easing, large-cap financials’ earnings – which beat consensus estimates by 10 per cent – suggest the US is just about muddling along.Of course unemployment is too high. But the fortunes of companies and households are improving. Non-performing loans fell 5 per cent versus the second quarter, allowing large banks enough comfort to reduce provisions by 13 per cent, according to Morgan Stanley data. Companies and individuals are still deleveraging and reluctant to take on debt. The rate of decline in loans outstanding, however, is moderating. A year ago, loans were contracting by 3.5 per cent per quarter. This time round the fall was less than 1 per cent. Bog-standard deposits were actually up.Consumer defiance can also be seen beyond the big banks. MasterCard, which reported its results on Tuesday, showed flat gross dollar volumes on US credit cards while underlying debit card spending was up 15 per cent. Companies are doing their bit too, with signs that the employment picture is brightening. Initial jobless claims numbers, admittedly volatile, are trending lower. The Institute of Supply Management’s gauge of manufacturing employment, released on Monday for October, rose for the 11th straight month to a level of 57.7, indicating genuine expansion.The reality is that 22 months of “near-zero” policy rates in the US have allowed corporates and households to restructure balance sheets while maintaining reasonable levels of demand. QE will buy even more time. But improvement is one thing; normalisation is quite another.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"
295;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;US consumer spending rebounds to pre-crisis levels;;US consumers are beginning to open their wallets and spend at levels not seen since before the financial crisis, according to new data from large credit card processors and economists.Third-quarter results from MasterCard, Visa and American Express pointed to an upturn in domestic spending, with US consumers spending 13 per cent more on Amex credit cards. US spending on Visa credit and debit cards showed a similar increase during the period.Although MasterCard, which reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, showed a slight drop in US spending, much of that decline was due to the loss of big debit card accounts such as Washington Mutual, which shifted business to Visa after it was bought by JPMorgan Chase. Excluding those lost accounts, credit card spending was flat and debit card spending would have increased 15 per cent, said Martina Hund-Mejean, Mastercard’s chief financial officer.Some of those increases are the result of consumers switching from cash to other forms of electronic payments. But even factoring in that shift and the overall sluggishness of the US economic recovery, US consumers are spending at levels not seen since the third quarter of 2007, just before the country plunged into the worst recession in more than 70 years.Consumer spending adjusted for inflation grew 2.6 per cent in the third quarter, faster than economists had predicted. American consumers are now spending about $9,335bn, close to the $9,342bn they spent in the third quarter of 2007.In a sign that the recession has left its mark on consumer purchasing habits, the additional spending is coming from growth in disposable income, which is up 30 per cent from its lows in the fourth quarter of 2007, not from an increase in credit card debt.In fact, consumers continued to pare outstanding debt in the third quarter, which is down 4.3 per cent from its peak in December 2007. Consumers are also saving more, at a rate of 5.5 per cent in the third quarter, up from 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007.“You have a full recovery in income and that, along with the strong performance of the stock market, is helping to bring consumer spending back to levels that existed prior to the slump,” said John Lonski, chief economist for Moody’s Capital Markets.
296;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-11-02T22:12:00Z;US stocks higher on tech deal news;;MasterCard earnings and technology deals helped buoy US equities as investors awaited the results of the midterm elections and the Federal Reserve meeting.Investors were cautious as voters went to the polls in the midterms, expected to put Republicans back in control of the House of Representatives, and the Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting, in which it is widely forecast that quantitative easing will be extended.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,193.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.6 per cent to 11,188.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent higher at 2,533.52.MasterCard, the payment processing company, advanced 2.9 per cent to $245.98 after reporting that third-quarter profits had jumped 15 per cent as international shoppers spent more on their credit cards.The number of transactions declined in the US but soared in Asia and Latin America.“The key to long-term growth for the [payment] networks will be to make sure they position themselves for growth globally, and don’t fall back on their US comfort zone,” said Gwenn Bézard, Aite Group research director.The financial sector lagged behind the broader indices, rising just 0.3 per cent as regional banking stocks fell 0.2 per cent.Moody’s Investors Service cut the ratings on the stocks of nine regional lenders. Analysts at the credit rating agency said the government had “signalled its intent to limit support for individual banks” in a marked shift from policy in 2009.Zions Bancorporation declined by 1.3 per cent to $20.20, SunTrust Banks lost 1 per cent to $24.41 and Regions Financial Corp was lower by 1.8 per cent at $6.12.Regional banks have suffered since they reported third-quarter profits, falling 4 per cent in the earnings season compared with a rise of about 1 per cent rise in the broader indices, according to analysts at JPMorgan.“With loans declining again in the third quarter and yields on securities falling sharply, shareholders have less earnings in their pocket each quarter while they wait for loan growth to materialise, and the stocks have traded down accordingly,” said Steven Alexopoulos, an analyst at JPMorgan.But he added that while the lack of borrowing by consumers might be a fundamental issue, the hold-up for commercial borrowers seems to be more a lack of confidence, which might improve after the midterm elections.There was a spate of deal news in the technology sector, which rose by 0.9 per cent.Oracle announced it would buy Art Technology Group, an e-commerce software maker whose customers include Best Buy and Vodafone, for $1bn in cash.The $6 a share price is at a 46 per cent premium to ATG’s close on Monday. Shares in Oracle gained 1.4 per cent to $29.53 while ATG shares shot up 45.1 per cent to $5.95.But Dell nudged down 0.3 per cent to $14.37 after it bought Boomi, a cloud computing company, for an undisclosed price.The computer maker was locked in a bidding war in the summer with Hewlett-Packard for 3Par, another cloud computing group, a battle that HP won.Other cloud computing companies rose, with Rackspace Hosting adding 2.3 per cent to $25.95.In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer fell 1 per cent to $17.45 after reporting its quarterly results and raising its earnings forecast for the full year.The world’s largest drugmaker reported better than expected profits after it raised prices and cut jobs. Profits were also buoyed by adding products from its acquisition of Wyeth, helping compensate for declining sales of its cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.In the energy sector, shares in Anadarko Petroleum and BP rose after the companies reported their quarterly results, even though both raised their estimates for the cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Anadarko Petroleum, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the Macondo well, rose 1 per cent to $63.82, while the US-listed shares in BP advanced 1.6 per cent to $41.42.
297;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-11-02T16:56:04Z;Investors gauge election bounce;;Even though Republicans, touting business-friendly policies, appear set to take control of the US House of Representatives from Democrats, analysts are far from certain about the potential for a positive bounce for the US stock market.Historically, US markets have performed extremely well in the fourth quarter of a midterm year, following the typical loss of seats for the president’s party in the midterm election.The S&P 500 index has not made a total return of less than 10 per cent in such a quarter since 1950, according to figures from LPL Financial. UBS research shows that the year after a midterm, the S&P 500 sees a median price increase of nearly 20 per cent.Stock markets tend to prize political gridlock, believing fewer new regulations will emerge and less government deficit spending will keep borrowing rates low. A study by Fidelity Investments found that large-cap stocks saw average price gains of 23 per cent during the four periods of gridlock – a split in party control of the White House and both houses of Congress – since 1970.Some of those gains will already be priced in, however, in part because gridlock to some degree has been the rule in Washington since Democrats lost their 60th vote in the Senate. Only a surprise Republican seizure of the Senate could be a near-term catalyst for further gridlock-led gains.Other factors will also limit the effect. The largest looming change resulting from increased clout for the Republicans – an agreement to extend the Bush tax cuts, which would lower government revenues by $500bn, according to the Congressional Budget Office – will probably not be resolved to the market’s satisfaction by the election.“The changes may not be permanent,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. “A one-year extension of current tax rates may not be as welcome as a [permanent] resolution of the tax rate uncertainty.”A report on deficits by a bipartisan committee set for December could be a much more important event for clarity on tax cuts, analysts said, as a recommendation to extend would provide cover for Democrats who may face frustration from their own base if they agree to cuts.If such changes do come to pass, higher-yielding stocks could rally as investors look to take advantage of the extended tax break to pocket dividends.“High dividend-paying sectors such as telecoms and utilities may benefit. Cash-rich companies in other sectors may also benefit as they introduce or substantially increase their dividend payout as they look to attract a new class of investors seeking yield,” said Mr Kleintop.Many strategists have argued that the S&P 500 index has been discounted in 2010 due to uncertainty created by the tax expiration, heavier regulation and deficit spending. The S&P has risen just 6 per cent so far this year, even as earnings-per-share are projected to increase 35 per cent this year.Thomas Doerflinger, strategist at UBS, termed recent policies such as healthcare reform, financial regulation, a Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium and the tax rises likely to follow from deficit spending, “the Great Suppression”.“It should be positive for equities if the 2010 elections begin a policy shift toward lower taxes, less spending, and lighter regulation,” he said.He warned, however, that the Republican victory would not represent an immediate reversal of the “Great Suppression”. He said he was watching for a “tax holiday” on a repatriation of foreign earnings, which could signal a significant shift in the balance of power.Economists at RBS warned that a sizable victory may also raise expectations of Republican victory in the 2012 presidential election, and could hinder the economy over the next two years.“Hopes of a more business-friendly fiscal agenda, if the Republicans sweep both the presidency and Congress in 2012, could keep companies from aggressively hiring and capital spending near-term,” said Michelle Girard and Omair Sharif of RBS.The circumstances of this election are also historically unique, coming on the eve of what is expected to be a massive intervention by the US Federal Reserve in the form of “quantitative easing”.Bruce Bittles, equity strategist at Robert W. Baird, said the expected election result would not be a strong catalyst itself, instead only raising the relative importance of the Fed as an economic actor.“If we get political gridlock in Washington, as expected, the Federal Reserve will be the one left with any ability to provide stimulus to the economy,” he said.Economists at Société Générale suggested that changing course could unravel the gains seen as “QE2” has been priced in, and from a cheap dollar powering global revenues at multinational groups.“New fiscal stimulus, more likely [if the Democrats retain significant power], could prove potent, particularly when combined with further monetary easing,” they said. “The increased presence of conservatives could lead to premature fiscal tightening, which would be a negative for the economy, and risky assets.”The economy is also not in a typical position. In the 1980s and 1990s, gridlock was prized because it was not to going to upset already strong growth. The 1994 Republican sweep into power in Congress saw the S&P 500 index return 30 per cent in the fourth quarter of that year.The poorest showing for the market after a midterm election was in 1978, when inflation was rampant and investors were frustrated that the government was not cutting spending faster. The S&P rose 12 per cent.In an environment with high unemployment and deflation, gridlock may similarly not be as valuable to the market.Richard Soultanian of Nus Consulting, who advises companies on financial decisions, said: “Gridlock can be a positive when the country’s underlying economy and fiscal situation are in good order. Today this is not the case …The act of doing nothing will hamper the global economic recovery rather than accelerating it.”
298;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-11-02T14:11:15Z;MasterCard quarterly profits jump;;MasterCard, the electronic payment network provider, reported better-than-expected profits as consumers in the developing world shifted more of their purchases to plastic and spent more money in other countries.Net income was $518m, an increase of 15 per cent from the same period a year ago. Earnings per diluted share were $3.94, up from $3.45 last year, and topping the median analyst estimate of $3.54.Revenues, reported net of rebates paid to lenders who use MasterCard’s credit and debit networks, were $1.4bn in the third quarter, up 5 per cent from the same period in 2009.The gross dollar volume of card swipes was up 8.5 per cent to $685bn, which included a 15.4 per cent increase in spending across national borders. MasterCard charges an additional fee to users of its networks for cross-border transactions as it takes on currency conversion risks.Volume in the third quarter declined in the US, its largest market, by 1.7 per cent, which was offset by a 23.6 per cent increase in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Latin America grew by 20 per cent.“Consumers and businesses around the world continue to recognise the benefits of electronic payments and MasterCard remains at the heart of this evolution,” said Ajay Banga, chief executive.MasterCard generates revenues by collecting fees from lenders, such as JPMorganChase and Citigroup, that issue credit and debit cards to consumers that use the MasterCard network.Competition with Visa, Discover and American Express for bank customers has become tougher as a number of large financial institutions consolidated during the height of the financial crisis.MasterCard said that though it raised its prices by about 7 percentage points, that was offset by “a net increase in rebates and incentives due to new and renewed customer agreements”.MasterCard has recently said it wants to compete more directly with non-card payment networks like PayPal, and it acquired DataCash, a UK company, in August.Mr Banga said that in 2011 MasterCard would begin offering a trial of mobile phones-as-credit cards through a large US card issuer. He also said a memorandum of understanding had been signed with China Union Pay to explore mobile payment opportunities.The credit card networks have also been fighting a battle on Capitol Hill, as Democrats led by Senator Richard Durbin inserted an amendment into the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that would limit how much banks can charge to merchants to use their credit cards.Mr Banga said that he expected the US Federal Reserve, which is empowered by the bill to writing new rules on fees, to release its findings in December.That does not directly affect MasterCard and its rivals, but could lead banks to put pressure on them to lower their own fees.Shares in MasterCard were trading 4.6 per cent higher in the pre-market at $250.00. They are down 6.6 per cent year-to-date.
299;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Russian fashion week;;"Moscow, last week: 35,000 rich Russian women, journalists and buyers descended on a hotel on the edge of the city’s financial district to see, among other things, a model sporting Day-Glo plaits in a neon-hued jumpsuit suddenly flip onto her hands and start doing the splits.Was it the Moscow circus? No. A modernised Kirov? Uh-uh. Rather, it was the YanaStasia show, held during the 21st Russian Fashion Week, one of three competing ready-to-wear events currently taking place in what is perhaps the most mature of the major emerging luxury markets. (There is also a Moscow Fashion Week, which wrapped up earlier this week and and showcases established names such as Yudashkin and Denis Simachev, and a “Cycles and Seasons” Mastercard-sponsored fashion week that takes place in mid-November.)Indeed, the fact that there are three such events is indicative of the growing sophistication of the local consumer – and her growing desire to both design, and think, for herself. YanaStasia’s idiosyncratic styles aside, this isn’t the blingy Russian bimbo of yore.“Russian society has stopped trying to convince itself that it is ‘fashionable’; people are trying to be themselves,” says Igor Chapurin, a Russian designer who shows in Paris and has dressed celebrities from Cheryl Cole to Beyoncé. According to Chapurin, after the end of the drab Soviet years Russian consumers gravitated to colourful western designers such as Versace and Valentino, but since then local tastes have moved on, and Russians now favour monochrome, low-key looks by Belgian designers – and their own home-grown talent.Chapurin believes that there is a growing market for Russian designers that defies the sex’n’Swarovski stereotypes of the way Russian women dress. “When we show in Paris we raise the hemlines a few inches,” he says. “When we come back to Moscow, we drop them.” According to Chapurin, whose autumn/winter collection was inspired by Siberia, with leather jerkins, huge fur collars and skinny leggings, Russian women want modest clothes that will mask any imperfections in their figure.“Russians now really want to stress their individuality,” Chapurin says. “They live in the 21st century in a megalopolis.”…Alexander Shumsky, president of Russian Fashion Week, says that seven years ago Russian consumers were obsessed with being seen in the right brand, “but now they want their own style”. Hence Russian Fashion Week, which aims to discover up-and-coming talent from as far afield as the Urals and Belarus, and propel native designers such as YanaStasia into the spotlight.To be fair, however, YanaStasia’s athletic aesthetic is not exactly exemplary of this new Russian style (it was just very eye-catching). Rather, during Russian Fashion Week, the overriding colour scheme was matte, and the clothing tailored, and tight.New Belarusian name Olga Samoshenko, for example, showed a series of 1940s-inspired dresses with rosettes of fabric crowning the sleeves and necks. Tatiana Chekish, meanwhile, who was holding her first show after winning a national design competition, focused on tailored white dresses with high necks and sharp lines reminiscent of 1960s sci-fi styling (ditto sequinned and studded white Barbarella-type mini-dresses). And Egor Zaitsev, the son of Slava Zaitsev, Russia’s premier fashion designer in Soviet times, created fairy-tale tailoring in the form of red, aubergine and violet suits, and dresses sporting geometric explosions of fabric.Then there was Dasha Gauser from Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains, whose collection was inspired by paper, and featured a neutral palette of beige, black and white and pastels, not to mention wide-sleeved coats with origami-like folded collars, slim pants, pencil-dresses, and sexy one-piece mini-suits. Gauser has only been in business for three years, but has already acquired a cult following among the Russian elite.Still, developing a signature style is but one hurdle local designers have to overcome. Russian designers may understand their clients better than foreign designers, but giving retail outlets what they need is another issue. “Shops will come to a designer wanting to order something they’ve seen on the catwalk only to be told that they don’t have it in the original material because they have run out of fabric,” Shumsky says. “Designers will change other details in production, so it is often easier for a Moscow store to go straight to a showroom in Italy.”However, the Tsum department store, Moscow’s high-temple of fashion, which is like Harrods and Harvey Nichols rolled into one, has sent a buyer to Russian Fashion Week this year to choose a designer for a new Russian corner in the store that will showcase local collections – just as they do for up-and-coming names from the west. And according to Anna Nazarova, a buyer for Perfetta, a chain of stores across Moscow, “Fashion Week is a really important event for us; we have already started negotiating with new Russian designers to stock their clothes in our shops”. Today Moscow, tomorrow …Printemps?"
300;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Berkshire hires new investment manager;;Berkshire Hathaway took a significant step on Monday in its planning for the eventual departure of Warren Buffett as it appointed a new investment manager to oversee a large portion of the group’s portfolio.Todd Combs, 39, who has managed Castle Point Capital, a small hedge fund, for the past five years, is to start at Berkshire shortly, the company said. Castle Point Capital, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, invests in financial services companies such as US Bancorp, MasterCard and State Street.Mr Buffett said he had been “looking for someone of Todd’s calibre to handle a significant portion of Berkshire’s investment portfolio” for three years.Shareholders have speculated for years about who would replace the 80-year-old Mr Buffett in his dual role of chief executive and chief investment officer.Mr Buffett, who currently has no intention of retiring, has said he would split the top job between a chief executive to oversee Berkshire’s operating companies and a handful of managers to look after the $100bn investment portfolio.Pundits had identified David Sokol, chairman of Berkshire subsidiaries MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, as likely to take over the chief executive role, and Li Lu, a hedge fund manager, as a candidate for an investment officer slot.Chuck Davis, chief executive of Stone Point Capital, a private equity firm that helped provide start-up capital for Castle Point, said Mr Combs had the qualities Mr Buffett looked for.“He has a good background in securities analysis at Columbia Business School [Mr Buffett’s alma mater]. He is a deep-dive, granular, research-oriented person who really understands the inner workings of companies and is just a very free-cash-flow, hard-asset-based investor.”The news came as regulatory filings showed US regulators had quizzed Berkshire during the summer over its accounting treatment of certain reinsurance contracts, stock holdings and executive compensation.The SEC’s corporate finance division closed its review in September, but not before Berkshire had agreed to provide more detailed descriptions of its directors’ qualifications and change the way it accounted for certain compensation payments.In future, Berkshire said it would count items such as the $344,490 of personal and home security services spent on Mr Buffett in 2009 as compensation.

302;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-10-06T22:35:56Z;Fees key to Amex clash with DoJ;;Every time an American Express card is used to make a purchase, the company pockets 2.56 per cent of the transaction price. Those fees, collected from merchants at the point of sale, amounted to $13.4bn last year, by far the largest portion of Amex’s revenue.That revenue is now under attack by the Department of Justice, which on Monday filed a civil lawsuit against American Express. accusing the company of violating antitrust laws. The suit alleges that Amex prevents merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment such as cash, debit cards and credit cards with lower fees.Although Visa and MasterCard agreed to settle the same allegations, Amex has vowed to fight the charges. The DoJ says Amex’s fees are the highest among the big three big card issuers.Merchants have been fighting for years to cap card fees. In a key 2003 lawsuit, Visa and MasterCard agreed to pay large retailers, including Walmart and Sears, $3bn to settle claims that the companies pushed one type of debit card with higher fees over another, less costly, type of card.The issue gained even more steam this summer when a surprise amendment was added to new financial regulations aimed at further reducing debit card fees.The DoJ suit is the latest development in what analysts say is an inevitable march toward lower fees.In spite of the pressure on fees, Amex has increased its dependence on them in recent years. The 2005 spin-off of American Express Financial Advisors, the financial planner now owned by Ameriprise, made Amex even more reliant on the money it collects from merchants. Such fees now account for 55 per cent of Amex’s revenue, up from 34 per cent the year before the spin-off.Amex argues that its prices are justified because it provides merchants with insights into the spending habits of some of the wealthiest consumers. According to payment research group Nilson, the average Amex customer spends $12,000 a year on their card, more than four times what Visa and MasterCard customers spend.“We give merchants access to an affluent, high-spending card member base and there is a price for that,” Amex says.At the heart of Amex’s defence against the DoJ claims is a 2004 Supreme Court decision that forced Visa and MasterCard to allow member banks to issue cards on competing networks. The decision paved the way for Amex, which was seen at the time as an underdog being squeezed by its two larger rivals, to sue Visa and MasterCard and eventually collect billions of dollars in damages.“Back then, the Justice Department was Amex’s friend, but times change,” says Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. “When you are in the position of charging the highest price, you have to be concerned about that price eroding.”Amex has been expanding into other types of business, but so far with limited success. Last year the company created a standalone unit that provides consulting services to corporate clients based on data mined from Amex customers. For instance, it helped Darden Restaurants pinpoint locations for new Red Lobsters and Olive Gardens. Amex does not divulge any information on the business but says it is still a “very small part” of overall revenue. “We’re not abandoning our traditional fee model.”But that model almost certainly will come under increasing pressure regardless of the outcome of the DoJ suit. By settling the DoJ charges against them, Visa and MasterCard have freed merchants to offer customers discounts to encourage them to use cheaper forms of plastic, a move that could eat away at Amex’s market share. “If there is downward pressure on pricing across the board, Amex won’t be immune to that,” says Michael Taiano of Sandler O’Neill.Investors seem to agree. Since the lawsuit was announced on Monday, Amex shares have lost nearly 9 per cent of their value.Although they traded up slightly on Wednesday to about $38 a share, the stock remains well off its high of the past year, last seen in April.But analysts caution the outcome is far from certain. For instance, it is unclear whether Amex will suffer mass defections to cheaper cards or whether the extra incentives on offer, which are among the most generous in the industry, ensures customer loyalty.
303;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-10-04T23:56:57Z;DoJ sues Amex over ‘swipe fee’ allegations;;The justice department has sued American Express over allegations of anti-competitive policies, while reaching a settlement over the same issues with Visa and MasterCard.Shares in American Express fell 6.5 per cent to a four-month low after the company said it – unlike its rivals – would defend itself against DoJ claims that the “swipe fees” that card companies charge merchants violate antitrust laws.The card industry as a whole collects $35bn a year in swipe fees, which are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, the DoJ said. Of all three companies, Amex charges the highest fees.The settlement with Visa and MasterCard, which requires court approval, will allow merchants to offer consumers discounts or rebates for using less expensive forms of payment, including credit cards without reward programmes, debit cards and cash. Merchants may also disclose the cost they incur by accepting one card over another, and can promote a particular credit-card network. The settlement is similar to legislation passed this summer aimed at lowering debit-card swipe fees.Consumer advocates and Wall Street analysts were divided over the impact of the settlement – both on industry profits and the behaviour of shoppers.“Giving merchants more choices should lead to lower prices for all consumers,” said Ed Mierzwinski, an advocate with the National Association of State Public Interest Research Groups.But JPMorgan analyst Tien Tsin Huang, calling the agreement a victory for Visa and MasterCard, said that he did not anticipate a major change in consumer behaviour, mainly because MasterCard already permits such discounting and Visa will only have to modify its policies slightly to comply. The measure stops short of a tougher plan that would have allowed merchants to impose surcharges on customers who use their Visa or MasterCard.“We want to put more money in consumers’ pockets, and by eliminating credit card companies’ anticompetitive rules, we will accomplish that,” said US attorney general Eric Holder.The settlement potentially puts Amex, the third largest card company by spending behind Visa and MasterCard, at a disadvantage to its bigger rivals. “It can’t be good for competition to allow the largest players to pay merchants to discriminate,” said David Boies, the antitrust lawyer, who is defending Amex in the case.Analysts also warned that issuers may scale back offers of reward cards because merchants will have the ability to “steer” customers to cards that charge lower fees.“The most likely beneficiaries would be the cheapest networks, which are debit cards that use a four-digit pin,” said Robert Dodd of Morgan Keegan. Visa is the largest operator of such pin networks, followed by Star Network, which is owned by First Data.

Investors were cautious before a week that sees the first major earnings report, out on Thursday from miner Alcoa, and the key non-farm payrolls report, set to be released on Friday.Michael Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners, said that the stock market had recently been moving in the opposite direction to the dollar.“[A falling dollar means] US goods are cheaper overseas so there’s an opportunity for business to pick up and maybe even hire a few more people,” he said.But the dollar, which fell sharply last week, rose on Monday against a basket of other currencies.Investors were briefly cheered by a report on factory orders that showed they fell 0.5 per cent. But factory orders excluding the volatile transportation sector rose 0.9 per cent.A separate release showed pending home sales rose more than expected to a four-month high in August, the latest set of data to suggest that the housing market could be regaining some stability after the withdrawal of the homebuyer tax credit earlier in the year.The materials sector led the fallers, down 1.4 per cent, as metals prices, which have risen recently on hopes of strong demand in China, fell slightly.US Steel declined 2.8 per cent to $42.42, AK Steel lost 2.8 per cent to $13.58 and Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore producer, was down by 3.7 per cent to $64.12.The technology sector fell 1.1 per cent with Microsoft dropped 1.9 per cent to $23.91 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral” and cut its price target for the maker of Windows and Office software.Analysts were concerned that it is taking longer for customers to replace old PCs and that many are turning instead to tablet computers and smartphones, where Windows does not yet have a presence. The technology company raised its dividend in September but Goldman analysts said that it should have increased it more in order to appeal to a larger investor base.Elsewhere in technology, Intel was lower by 2.3 per cent to $18.87 and Apple dropped 1.4 per cent to $278.64.In financials, JPMorgan Chase managed to withstand the sector’s slide, edging up 0.5 per cent to $38.95 after having risen 1.6 per cent earlier in the session.It was reported that the bank could boost its dividend next year and that the share price may rise as much as 45 per cent during the next two years, because of a strong senior management team and acquisitions made during the financial crisis.AIG also rose, climbing 1.1 per cent to $39.28 in spite of lowering its valuation of its Asian business in order to secure a $1bn pledge from the Kuwait Investment Authority and other important investors, according to people familiar with the matter.However the S&P 500 financials index dropped 0.7 per cent. American Express sunk 6.5 per cent to $39.05 after an antitrust lawsuit was filed against the company. Rivals Visa and MasterCard settled with regulators over an investigation about restrictions on merchants. Shares in Visa edged lower by 0.1 per cent to $73.24 and MasterCard fell 1 per cent to $222.64.In deals news, Sanofi-Aventis launched a hostile bid for Genzyme Corp at $69 per share, the same offer it first made at the end of July.US-listed shares in the French drugs company fell 0.8 per cent to $32.87 while Genzyme shares added 0.2 per cent to $71.01.Sara Lee surged 7.2 per cent to $14.40 after it was reported that the consumer-goods company had rejected a $12bn buy-out offer from KKR, the private equity group. Shares in KKR fell 1 per cent to $10.73.
305;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Visa blocked in China after Unionpay dispute;;Visa has been blocked from starting any new business in China for almost one year, after a disagreement with China Unionpay, the country’s state-backed bank card monopoly, according to people familiar with the matter.The problems facing Visa and other global payment companies prompted the United States Trade Representative to file a case with the World Trade Organization against China on Wednesday.Visa first warned Unionpay almost a year ago to stop processing international transactions for co-branded cards through Unionpay’s own payment system rather than Visa’s, a demand Visa makes of all its partners around the world.But Unionpay, which was set up under the auspices of China’s central bank and is owned by 80 Chinese banks and other state entities, initially refused to comply and issued a scathing rebuttal in June this year when the dispute became public.While Unionpay has continued to gradually expand its co-operation with companies like MasterCard and American Express, it has refused to consider any new business lines with Visa since the payments group asked it to observe the terms of their agreement, according to people in the Chinese bank card industry.Unionpay declined to comment.A Visa spokesperson said: “We have been in China for more than a decade and we have a long history of working with China Unionpay. While we continue to grow our cross-border payments business, like all payment companies we look forward to eventually participating in the domestic payments market.”But Visa has said in the past that China is the only major market in the world where they are excluded from participating in the domestic payment business.In its WTO case, which comes amid rising Sino-US trade tensions, the US government alleges China is breaking commitments it made to trade partners to open its bank card market to international competition by 2006.“The Chinese government is giving China Unionpay a monopoly over most credit and debit card transactions by Chinese consumers,” US Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement. “China’s actions unfairly deprive US credit and debit card companies of access to a huge market.”The USTR has been periodically speaking with Visa, MasterCard and other international payment companies for the last four years to understand whether China is meeting its WTO commitments.The year-long virtual ban on new business in China for Visa, the world’s largest payments company, appears to be a major factor in the decision to file a case with the WTO now.But MasterCard, Visa’s arch-rival, seems to have adopted a less confrontational strategy in China.On Wednesday, the same day the USTR announced it had taken its case to the WTO, MasterCard said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Unionpay aimed at “mutually beneficial business development”.MasterCard declined to comment.
306;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-09-15T20:50:54Z;US stocks lifted by consumer sector;;"US stocks nudged up after gains for the healthcare and consumer staples sectors outweighed concerns about a slowdown in manufacturing growth in the New York region.By the close on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent at 1,125.07, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to 10,572.73 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at 2,301.32.The New York Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index showed slowing growth in the region, falling to 4.1 from 7.1 in August. This is the lowest reading since July 2009 and reflected a loss of confidence even though orders, sales and employment all improved. Economists had forecast an increase to 8.“The New York Fed came in today pretty neutral; the headline figure wasn’t great but when you look within the six-month outlook on general business conditions, employment, capital expenditure, we still look to be in expansion mode and that’s good,” said Linda Duessel, equity market strategist at Federated Investors.Investors shrugged off another release that showed US industrial output in August grew at a slower pace than in July. Manufacturing activity increased 0.2 per cent last month after rising 0.6 per cent in the previous month.A separate report showed import prices rose faster than expected in August on the back of higher petrol and food prices and export prices rebounded from a drop in July.The S&P 500 industrials index edged higher by 0.1 per cent.But healthcare stocks benefited from a ratings change after Lazard Capital Markets said that shares in drug distributor McKesson may have hit bottom. McKesson rose 5.4 per cent to $62.98 and AmerisourceBergen followed, up 4 per cent to $30.25. The S&P 500 healthcare index rose 0.8 per cent.In consumer staples, Kraft rose after it said it could make an additional $1bn revenue by 2013 from using new distribution networks and markets acquired when it bought Cadbury. The shares rose 1.7 per cent to $31.59.The wider consumer staples sector advanced 0.7 per cent, buoyed by rises for Whole Foods, up 1.2 per cent to $35.93, and Avon, which climbed 2.2 per cent to $31.28.AK Steel and Steel Dynamics became the latest steelmakers to cut their forecasts.AK Steel said higher raw material and operating costs, as well as the acceleration of maintenance work, would push the company into making an operating loss of about $20 a tonne in the third quarter. The steelmaker had originally expected an operating profit of $15 a tonne. The shares fell 5.7 per cent to $13.70.But Steel Dynamics edged higher by 0.8 per cent to $14.71 in spite of predicting a third-quarter profit of between 5 and 10 cents per share compared with the average analyst estimate of 21 cents a share. Margins were squeezed by lower selling prices for sheet and structural steel.In financials, MasterCard rose 5.2 per cent to $210.18 after it announced a share buy-back of up to $1bn. Shares in the credit card company have suffered this year, along with competitor Visa, after new regulations to cap fees.Morgan Stanley fell 1 per cent to $27.24 after it was made public that it was being sued by the China Development Industrial Bank over allegations of fraud to recover losses from an investment tied to mortgage-backed securities.Goldman Sachs closed a fraction higher at $152.56, after falling earlier in the session. The bank is being sued by three female former employees who claim they faced gender discrimination in pay and fewer opportunities for promotion.Also in financials, Moody’s was lower by 1 per cent at $24.83 after its largest shareholder Berkshire Hathaway sold 1.35m shares in the ratings company.Semiconductors suffered when Goldman Sachs cut its rating on computer memory company Micron Technology. Shares in Micron slid 4.5 per cent to $6.94 after it was reduced from “buy” to “neutral”.Maxim Integrated, a chipmaker that was also downgraded by Goldman, fell 0.5 per cent to $16.75."
307;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
308;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Master who plays his cards right;;Not many corporate chiefs would admit to having cleaned bathrooms as part of their training, but Ajay Banga, chief executive of MasterCard, is not your typical business leader. “Cleaning bathrooms,” which he did in the 1990s while opening Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants in India for PepsiCo, “made me very valuable to my wife”, he says. “I’m called the bathroom fairy at home.”That willingness to poke fun at himself extends to his appearance. As a Sikh, Mr Banga, 50, wears a turban and has a full beard, making for a striking contrast with Robert Selander, his predecessor and current vice-chairman. “Bob and I joke about it all the time,” Mr Banga says. “I know I look different from a lot of people around the world, but I don’t view that as something that defines me.”His affability is disarming, but it also masks a competitive streak that propelled Mr Banga from fast food to one of the top jobs at Citigroup, where he ran the global consumer bank, before joining MasterCard last year with a promise of quickly being promoted to chief executive.Since then, he has set about shaking up MasterCard’s sleepy culture. The company processes more than 22bn transactions a year, at the speed of 140 milliseconds each, faster than the blink of an eye. Its entire business depends on making sure each of those transactions clears without a hitch, a model that tends to reward reliability over risk-taking. “When somebody swipes a card in Guam and that card was issued in Bangalore, if it doesn’t go through, that’s the end of my so-called guarantee,” he says.To speed up decision-making, Mr Banga has given lower-level employees more authority to negotiate contracts and has created a new division to better compete with electronic payment systems such as PayPal. The urgency Mr Banga is trying to instil in employees also applies to him. Any request to which he does not respond within two weeks is automatically approved. “He operates on Ajay time, which is about 10 times faster than everyone else,” says Josh Peirez, the head of MasterCard’s business development unit.An extrovert, who encourages staffers to drop by his office to discuss everything from the quality of the coffee in the cafeteria to world affairs, Mr Banga can also be extremely blunt, a quality that has rubbed off on other executives. Mr Selander says that Mr Banga has taught him to be more direct in his feedback. “After two hours with Ajay, you know exactly what he thinks,” he says.At a leadership meeting in December, Mr Banga grew impatient when executives spouted too many platitudes. “I told them: ‘I’m not going to let this conversation end here. You’re not being as forthright as you need to be.’ ” So he had the executives anonymously write down on index cards the five things that bothered them most. Their answers led him to slash the company’s bureaucracy by improving the expenses policy, hiring process and procedures for signing on new clients. “A lot of what we did came from these touchy, feely meetings,” he says.Playing the role of corporate psychoanalyst is a world away from where Mr Banga started. As the son of a lieutenant-general in the Indian army, who was transferred from post to post every two years, Mr Banga had a nomadic childhood. “The moving around made me who I am,” he says. “I make friends easily. I adjust easily to new situations. I was always the new kid on the block, so I had to learn to break into established groups.”He believes it also made him more open to divergent points of view. “When you come to the US and hear people talking about diversity, well, I grew up with it,” he says.In spite of his globetrotting, he has not abandoned his Indian heritage. On the 30-minute drive from his Manhattan home to MasterCard’s I.M. Pei-designed headquarters in Purchase, New York, he tunes in to Sikh radio, which airs traditional hymns. Yet he is also thoroughly Americanised. He loves baseball (the Mets), listens to Quincy Jones and Lady Gaga and “owns practically every Elvis Presley album that you could think of”.After receiving a bachelor’s degree in economics from Delhi University and an MBA from the India Institute of Management, he joined Nestlé in 1981 as a management trainee. Thirteen years later, Mr Banga signed on as director of marketing for PepsiCo Restaurants in India. He was charged with doing everything from choosing the right-sized chickens – too big, and they do not fry properly – to working the register and, yes, cleaning those bathrooms.When he learnt that PepsiCo was planning to spin off its restaurant division, Mr Banga decided it was time for a career change. He wanted to work for a large global enterprise and, as a standalone business, PepsiCo’s restaurants would be a far smaller and less well-capitalised company. “I realised I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he says.He accepted a job with Citigroup, where he briefly served as a debt collector as part of his training before going on to become head of marketing for the consumer bank.Although banking was an entirely different industry, he saw similarities to the restaurant business. “One is share of throat, the other is share of wallet.” By the time he left in 2009, he had been promoted to chief executive of the Asia-Pacific division.With his 50th birthday looming, Mr Banga started to think seriously about what he wanted to do with the rest of his career. He considered teaching but couldn’t resist the urge to run a public company. So when a headhunter called him at his Hong Kong home late one night to talk about becoming the chief operating officer of MasterCard, he was intrigued. He flew to Connecticut in March 2009 and met Mr Selander at his home. The two talked for five hours. Mr Banga came away thinking that “this was a job that used all of my skills, yet wasn’t something I had done before”.The clincher: when the board offered Mr Banga the job, it promised to promote him to chief executive by June 30, when Mr Selander, who had run the company for 13 years, planned to retire from day-to-day management. Just to be sure, Mr Banga negotiated a $4.2m signing bonus that would have been his if MasterCard failed to make good on its promise.Mr Banga’s accomplishments have certainly been financially rewarding. At a time when compensation has come under scrutiny, his $13.5m pay package means he is earning more than the heads of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. And although success runs in the family – Mr Banga’s older brother Vindi was a former Unilever executive who now works for the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice – Mr Banga does not take it lightly. “To join Citi 14 years ago as a lower-level executive in India and end up as one of the top people at the company, that’s pretty good,” he says.
309;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-08-25T21:23:46Z;Healthcare and consumer sectors lead late Wall Street rebound;;US stocks ended a day of choppy trading in positive territory as gains in the healthcare and consumer sectors outweighed disappointing data on durable goods orders and new-home sales.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent to 1,055.33, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to close at 10,060.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent to close at 2,141.54.Healthcare stocks led the rebound, rising 1 per cent with Coventry Health adding 4.5 per cent to $20.27 and United Health advancing 3 per cent to $31.96.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index also advanced 1 per cent buoyed by homebuilders which have been touted by some analysts this week as a bargain buy. Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, beat expectations and swung into profit for the first time in three years. Its shares rose 5.8 per cent to $17.13.Credit card companies rose after VeriFone Systems, the provider of electronic payment technology, raised its full-year forecast. Verifone jumped 8.5 per cent to $24.32. MasterCard was up 1.8 per cent to $206.11. Visa climbed 0.3 per cent to $70.86.Also among the risers, Google pushed up 0.7 per cent to $454.62 after it said it was launching a voice call service, which could rival Skype.Apple fell 0.4 per cent to $17.12 after it was reported that it was close to agreeing deals to offer TV shows for 99 cents and a separate report suggested it may update the Ipod.But earlier in the day all sectors suffered after orders for durable goods fell short of economists’ estimates, increasing 0.3 per cent in July compared with the average forecast of a 3 per cent rise.Excluding transportation, orders fell 3.8 per cent, the biggest drop since January 2009. The indicator pointed to a slowdown in manufacturing and added to fears about the pace of the economic recovery, which sent the S&P 500 down to seven-week lows on Tuesday.New-home sales, meanwhile, unexpectedly fell 12.4 per cent to an annualised figure of 276,000 in July compared with economists’ estimates of 330,000.The figure for June was revised down to 315,000.But investors, who were disappointed by existing home-sales data on Tuesday, had already pencilled in a weak figure.Mounting signs of a slowdown in the economic recovery has prompted some analysts to expect further quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve.“Our expectation would be that the Fed will likely add chapters to QE2 [quantitative easing, round two],” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities. “I don’t think it’s a sole requirement but it’s part and parcel of what the market needs to see it regain its earlier confidence.”He added that he would like to see tax incentives and training programmes to encourage business leaders to start hiring.But the S&P 500 energy index suffered, falling 0.3 per cent, as coal miners fell on the back of concerns that the declining price of natural gas may prompt power stations to switch from coal to natural gas. Arch Coal lost 1.9 per cent to $21.99 and US-listed shares of MacArthur Coal dropped 7.5 per cent to $20.03.In deal news, both 3Par and PotashCorp, targets of recent bids, fell. 3Par said it would start talks with Hewlett-Packard, which bid $1.6bn for the data storage company. 3Par lost 1 per cent to $26.76, Hewlett-Packard was down 0.4 per cent to $38.24 and Dell, which had entered a lower bid for the company and was reported to be considering beating HP’s offer, nudged up 1.7 per cent to $11.79.US-listed shares in PotashCorp fell 2.4 per cent to $145.50 after Marius Kloppers, chief executive of bidder BHP Billiton, said there was only a “small universe” of interest in the fertiliser producer. US-listed shares in BHP Billiton, which also reported pre-tax profits that surged nearly 70 per cent, nudged up 0.1 per cent to $65.51.In contrast, Genzyme rose 0.3 per cent to $67.58 after French pharmaceuticals group Sanofi-Aventis, which has offered up to $70 a share for the maker of drugs for genetic conditions, said that it would not raise its bid beyond $70. US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis added 0.3 per cent to $28.38.
310;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-08-19T18:59:30Z;Poundland loses fancy labelling but not its allure;;Farewell tandpasta and goodbye el do kąpieli. Learning the Dutch for toothpaste and the Polish for shower gel has long been an educational side-effect of shopping at Poundland, which secured cheap goods wherever it could find them on global markets and brought them here.But as the Warburg Pincus-owned chain has grown, it no longer goes through the backdoor to strike deals with foreign outposts of large, fast-moving consumer goods companies.Instead, it can extract the same keen prices from the UK branches.Poundland’s constant scouring of the global marketplace for any arbitrage opportunities on name-brand shampoo or air freshener is a small part of the wider trend toward price deflation in developed markets that consumer goods groups have been complaining about.Unilever this month acknowledged it needed to trim prices to stay competitive, while Procter & Gamble made similar comments. PZ Cussons said last month that basic personal care products would remain at £1 – that magic figure for UK discounters – for ‘quite a time’.This trend of UK price deflation means consumer goods groups must accelerate their international expansion into emerging markets. It may also take some of the fun out of shopping at Poundland, but its expansion plans should not suffer.Tiger Tiger burning outIt is easy to become lost in the jungle, especially when hunting a well-camouflaged beast. RSA has been accused of losing sight of its prey this week after some confusion over the real profitability of Aviva’s general insurance businesses, which RSA bid £5bn for late last month.The company, codenamed “tiger” in the approach to Aviva’s “lion”, apparently underestimated the profit contribution of RAC, which RSA does not want to buy. Tiger is after only the main commercial, motor and home insurance businesses of the UK, Ireland and Canada.Aviva does not disclose much about its “leopard”, the code name for RAC. With one analyst putting the leopard’s profits as high as £150m on Tuesday, analysts have mostly now reached a number that is closer to £50m post-tax, for last year.There are some clues at Companies House. RAC plc, the holding company that has the chunky pension deficits and inter-company loans, and its subsidiary RAC Motoring Services, both still file accounts there. RAC plc made £6m post-tax last year after a loss of £101m the year before. Motor Services made £51m post-tax last year and £52m the year before.Some analysts are still unsure about how this income is booked by Aviva: whether it is all in the lion’s general insurance profits, or whether some of it is still split into the “other” line as it was historically. One may assume all the roadside profits are in GI, while another assumes a 50-50 split.The extent of the impact on RSA’s £5bn valuation of the businesses it wants to buy is ultimately a bit of a sideshow. Mostly, the mysterious leopard has given advisers to the two sides an excuse to point out failings at each other, while the big cats simply sit and glower.But the tiger sits in the Asian jungle and the lion on the African plains and it looks increasingly likely that they will remain on different continents. Forget the leopard, the real obstacle here is Aviva’s financing structure and pension deficit. This gearing makes it difficult to see the value to Aviva shareholders in selling the lion at a price it would make sense for the tiger to pay. The risk is that this episode will not reflect well on either company.Payments palsDataCash shareholders have struck gold with MasterCard’s £333m takeover. The 54 per cent premium being paid by the US giant to become the UK tech company’s best buddy seems so last century. The Aim-listed payments company has worked hard to stay abreast of the online game, but its investors seem to be benefiting mainly from MasterCard’s tardiness.Visa, the card company’s great rival, has already shelled out $2bn (£1.3bn) this year for its own e-commerce company. But it paid a lower premium for a business with four-and-a-half times the profits and more than 10 times the transaction volumes, according to US analysts.But both groups are lagging behind PayPal, the best-known name in online payments. Ebay thinks PayPal could overtake the online auctions unit to become its biggest single business by next year. On top of this it is trying to get PayPal into mobile telephone software – the next gold-mine. Expect more tech deals from the two traditional payments titans.paul.j.davies@ft.comPoundland: john.o’doherty@ft.comTo comment, visit www.ft.com/lombardAndrew Hill is away
311;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-08-19T18:17:17Z;MasterCard in software fightback;;MasterCard, the world’s second-largest payments network, on Thursday signalled its intent to fight back in the rapidly changing industry after agreeing to buy DataCash, a UK payment service provider.The US company will pay 360p per share in cash, representing a 53 per cent premium to DataCash’s closing price on Wednesday of 234p, valuing the company at £333m ($520m).MasterCard has admitted it needs to compete more effectively in the payment and transfer of consumer cash around the world against nimbler, more web-focused rivals such as PayPal, owned by Ebay.Traditional MasterCard competitors, including American Express and Visa, have committed to competing in the online payment market.Ajay Banga, MasterCard chief executive, recently set up a division dedicated to bringing products to market faster.DataCash, listed on London’s junior Aim market since 1996, sells a single software interface that allows organisations to process secure payments online and offline anywhere in the world. DataCash shares soared 52 per cent to 355p on Thursday.“The acquisition of DataCash will expand our already significant e-commerce merchant gateway presence in Asia and Australia to European countries and other high-growth, emerging markets worldwide,” said Mr Banga.The deal will be implemented by a scheme of arrangement.DataCash’s directors, who collectively owned a 44 per cent stake in the company, have backed the offer.The deal is likely to provide a windfall of more than £140m for Ashley Head, DataCash executive chairman, who has a 43.2 per cent stake.Gavin Breeze, one of the co-founders who stepped down from the DataCash board in March 2008, has also committed his 8.4 per cent stake.MasterCard said it expected the deal to dilute fourth-quarter earnings by about 5 cents per share because of amortisation and other one-off costs.For the year to December 31, DataCash has reported a rise in pre-tax profits from £5.5m to £8.1m, while turnover rose 32 per cent to £36.9m.DataCash was advised by UBS while Deutsche Bank advised MasterCard.
312;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Poor economic data drag on Wall St;;The rally in US stocks faltered yesterday after investors were shaken by worse-than-expected economic data combined with weak earnings reports from Mastercard and Procter & Gamble.The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,120.41, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to close at 10,636.38 and the Nasdaq was 0.5 per cent lower at 2,283.52. Data on consumer spending, personal incomes, pending home sales and factory orders all came in below expectations.Consumer spending was unexpectedly flat in June and personal incomes failed to increase for the first time since September. The savings rate climbed to its highest level in a year. Analysts had expected rises of 0.1 per cent in consumer spending and 0.2 per cent in personal incomes.The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary index fell 1.3 per cent. Pending home sales dropped 2.6 per cent, compared with a forecast rise of 0.6 per cent and factory orders, projected to fall 0.5 per cent, were down 1.2 per cent in June.The S&P 500 housebuilders fell 5.3 per cent and the materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.But Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said that the negative earnings should be more surprising than the economic data. He said investors already knew that the expiration of homebuyer’s tax credit would distort home sales and that last week’s gross domestic product figures had provided a clue to a sluggish consumer recovery.Mastercard’s results reflected that sluggish consumer spending, with the total number of transactions rising by only 0.1 per cent. The credit card company announced a 31 per cent jump in profit on the back of 10 per cent cost cuts as consumers gradually started spending again, especially outside the US. Shares fell 0.8 per cent to $200.91.Household goods company Procter & Gamble also suffered from the cautious consumer, reporting a lower-than-expected profit for its fourth quarter. Sales did rise but this was offset by the company increasing the amount it spends on marketing. Earnings fell to 71 cents a share from 80 cents for the same period the year before. Analysts had predicted average earnings of 73 cents a share. Shares fell 3.4 per cent to $59.94.Other fallers included Dow Chemical, the largest US chemical producer, which plummeted 10.1 per cent to $25.48 after it missed analysts’ expectations. Its second-quarter earnings came in at 54 cents, below the consensus forecast of 56 cents.Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes slumped 13.1 per cent to $43.66 after it warned that the moratorium on new deep-water drilling could cut profit by between 8 and 11 cents a share in the second half. Earnings per share in the second quarter were below expectations.Duke Energy was flat at $17.37 after a $660m writedown on the value of some power plants in the Midwest led to a second-quarter loss of 17 cents per share, compared with a profit of 21 cents per share in the same quarter last year. But the power company raised its adjusted full-year per share forecast to a range of $1.30 to $1.35 compared with a previous $1.25 to $1.30.One earnings bright spot was Pfizer, which rose 5.6 per cent to $16.34 after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter. The pharmaceuticals company said that full-year profit would be at the top end of its previous forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 per share, due to synergies from last year’s merger with Wyeth.Pfizer helped push up the S&P 500 Healthcare index by 0.8 per cent, the largest rise for a main S&P sector.Ford fell 1.9 per cent to $12.91 after it sold fewer cars than analysts had estimated last month.

314;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-07-23T21:12:39Z;US buy-out groups talk to RBS over GMS;;Royal Bank of Scotland has started exclusive talks with US private equity groups Advent International and Bain Capital to sell its Global Merchant Services payment processing business in a deal worth about £2.5bn.The move means Advent and Bain have seen off competition from two rival US private equity groups, TPG and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, in what would be the UK’s largest private equity deal for almost three years.The pair have been granted about a week of exclusive talks to seal a deal, with RBS hopeful it can announce a sale when it reports its first-half results on August 6.Advent and Bain made the highest bid in the auction of GMS, which handles more than half the UK’s face-to-face transactions using payment cards such as Visa and MasterCard.The bank, in which the UK government has a 70 per cent shareholding, must sell the unit under the terms of a European Commission ruling.It had previously been concerned about whether a pure private equity buyer would have the scale or expertise to manage the unit, which includes the WorldPay payments business and the UK’s Streamline cards operation.The US private equity bidders are rumoured to have lined up about £1.5bn of loans from a consortium of five banks, including Barclays, Goldman Sachs and RBS itself.Advent and Bain had an advantage in the auction, as the former has experience of the payment processing business, having acquired a 51 per cent stake in the card processing arm of the Fifth Third Bank in the US.RBS was told by the European Commission last year that it must sell a clutch of assets as a quid pro quo for its state bail-out funding.It has sold half of its Sempra Commodities trading business to JPMorgan and is set to sell a portfolio of 318 branches to Spain’s Santander.RBS is expected to keep a stake of about 20 per cent in the payment processing business, which handles around 150 card transactions every second.The sale would be the biggest UK private equity deal since the £5.1bn buy-out of Kelda Group, owner of Yorkshire Water, in November 2007, said Dealogic.
315;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-07-16T14:12:41Z;BofA profits hit by weak mortgage revenues;;Bank of America’s quarterly profits fell slightly from a year ago as weak investment-banking and mortgage revenues countered gains from asset sales and improving credit conditions.The biggest US lender’s results mirrored those of JPMorgan Chase, whose falling loan-loss provisions also helped insulate the bank from what was the slowest quarter on Wall Street in more than a year. And like its rival, BofA’s earnings exceeded analysts’ expectations yet failed to impress investors.The bank’s shares tumbled by more than 4 per cent in early trading. BofA’s net income fell to $3.1bn or $0.27 per diluted share from $3.2bn or $0.33 per diluted share in the same period a year earlier. Total revenue slipped 11 per cent to $29.4bn.Credit losses fell for a fourth straight quarter. The bank set aside $8.1bn for credit losses during the period, down from $13.4bn a year ago and $9.8bn in the first quarter.BofA also recorded pre-tax gains on the sale of stakes in Itau Unibanco Holding, MasterCard and Columbia Management’s long-term asset management business.“Our quarterly results show that we are making progress on our strategy to align around our three core customer groups – consumers, businesses and institutional investors – and create the financial institution that customers tell us they want, built on a broad relationship of clarity, transparency, and helping them manage through challenging times,” Brian Moynihan, BofA’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We improved our capital foundation through retained earnings, and credit quality improved even faster than expected.BofA’s tier one capital ratio ended the quarter at 10.7 per cent, up from 10.2 per cent in the first period. The lender added $6.2bn in cash and cash equivalents during the past three months.Net interest income or how the bank profited from its loans, rose to $13.2bn in the second quarter from $11.9bn a year earlier. Non-interest income slumped to $16.3bn from $21.1bn, on a drops in trading revenue and mortgage volumes. The bank also benefited from the sale of its China Construction Bank stake in the same period a year earlier.

317;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Retail banks feel pinch of tougher oversight;;Whether wrangling with a new consumer protection agency or being held to stricter underwriting standards for home loans, retail banks are preparing for broad changes because of the financial reform bill.“To the extent a bank is in the retail consumer business, it gets clobbered the most under this legislation,” said Wayne Abernathy, executive vice-president of financial institutions policies at the American Bankers Association.Mr Abernathy said banks would now be at the mercy of a consumer tsar, appointed by the president and Congress, to run the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Agency.Housed within the Federal Reserve, but independently funded, the agency will have broad powers to regulate all kinds of consumer financial products, from credit cards to home loans.Mr Abernathy called the creation of the agency, “the single most damaging provision in the legislation for retail banks”.Another change involves “ interchange” fees paid by merchants to card issuers. Under the new rules, such fees would be capped by the Federal Reserve at a “reasonable” level.In an important change to the provision, the Fed will be prevented from regulating network fees charged by Visa and MasterCard, leaving the card-issuing banks to bear the brunt of the new fee caps.Frustration over the legislation devolved last week into a rare bit of finger pointing, with David Nelms, the chief executive of Discover Financial Services, blaming price hikes by its rival Visa for setting the stage for more restrictive oversight.“Visa raised prices quite a bit and, I think, took the actions that have led to the legislation in the first place,” Mr Nelms told a reporter. Visa declined to comment.It is not known yet what the final cost to retail banks will be of these new rules, in part because some of them will not be issued for months.Some analysts say that community banks could be pushed into the arms of larger players, which are better equipped to handle the additional oversight.What does seem certain is that banks will look to offset these costs by raising prices elsewhere. Banks have already moved to eliminate free checking and other services in response to restrictions on credit card and overdraft fees enacted earlier this year.The question is whether that cat-and-mouse game will continue under the new regulatory framework.Consumer groups said the legislation was a broad win for Main Street. “Finally consumers have a shot at being part of the market place, instead of trying to stay one step ahead of the latest scam,” said Susan Weinstock, the Consumer Federation of America’s financial reform director.The new consumer watchdog will have help in policing retail banks under new rules that allow state attorneys-general to impose tougher restrictions.National banks will no longer be able to use federal standards to pre-empt local law. State attorneys-general have tended to be quicker than federal regulators to crack down on predatory lending practices.
318;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-06-25T20:43:24Z;US banks rally after reform agreement;;US stocks rallied on Friday as lawmakers completed negotiations on financial regulation legislation, removing some of the uncertainty around reform.But a report showing first-quarter economic growth had been slower than estimated damped risk appetite. The main indices were all lower on the week, after two weeks of positive returns.“Investors are starting to take down their growth rate expectations for the next two to four quarters,” said Doug Cliggott, US equity strategist at Credit Suisse.“However, there are two positives for the market: valuations are pretty good and the balance sheets of the large caps are in great shape.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent to 1,076.59 but 3.5 per cent lower on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.1 per cent to 10,143.81 and fell 2.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher to 2,223.48 but had erased 3.5 per cent since the start of the week.The measures agreed in Congress overnight on Thursday will regulate banks’ capacity to trade in derivatives but will not force them to sell their derivatives businesses, a measure some lawmakers had been pushing for.“While some of the measures may be stricter than some [observers] may have predicted, at least now the industry and markets can move from wondering what the reforms may be to learning how to live with them and move on,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.Financials, the session’s best performing sector, were higher across the board on Friday. JPMorgan rose 3.7 per cent to $39.44, Citigroup rallied 4.2 per cent to $3.94, Morgan Stanley added 3.1 per cent to $25.01, Bank of America advanced 2.7 per cent to $15.42 and Goldman Sachs jumped 3.5 per cent to $139.66.However, credit card companies underperformed the main indices as the financial reform bill limited the fee levels they can charge customers.MasterCard dropped 0.7 per cent to $213.30,Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent to $42.68 but Visa rose 0.2 per cent to $76.61.Oracle, the world’s second-largest software company, rallied 2 per cent to $22.66 on Friday.

Demand for its programmes has grown as the economy recovers from the recession and it has been able to renew support contracts.Research in Motion, which makes the BlackBerry smartphone, dropped 10.8 per cent on Friday to $52.23 after posting worse-than-expected first-quarter revenues after the market closed on Thursday. Revenues in the quarter were $4.24bn, against the $4.35bn average analyst estimate, as competition between the BlackBerry and Apple’s iPhone intensified.KB Home was down 9 per cent to $11.12 on Friday, as the homebuilder specialising in homes for first-time buyers reported a second-quarter loss of 40 cents per share. Analysts had on average estimated a loss of 31 cents per share.Homebuilders were among the week’s worst performers following data released on Wednesday showing new home sales had fallen to the lowest level since records began in 1963.Pulte Group was 4.6 per cent lower at $8.92 and Toll Brothers declined 4.1 per cent to $17.20 but Beazer Homes inched up 1.7 per cent to $4.12.Lennar Corp was up 0.8 per cent to $14.68 after reporting slightly better than expected second-quarter results on Thursday.US-listed shares in BP were 15 per cent lower to $27.02 on the week as oil continued to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. On Wednesday, New York’s state pension fund said it planned to sue the oil company to recover losses due to the fall in BP’s share price. The fund said it owned more than 19m shares in BP when the oil spill begun in April.Anadarko Petroleum, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the damaged oil well, fell 11.9 per cent to $37.68 over the week.
319;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-06-22T00:02:41Z;Financial reform deal to cut debit card fees;;"Debit card fees charged to retailers could be cut under a deal on financial reform hatched by congressional negotiators that hits banks but protects Visa and
MasterCard.A conference committee of lawmakers will on Tuesday resume its public negotiations over the final shape of the landmark legislation, which is due to be delivered to Barack Obama, US president, as soon as the end of the week to be signed into law.The “interchange” fees paid by merchants to card issuers would be capped by the Federal Reserve at a “reasonable” level under a provision put forward by Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois.Mr Durbin said on Monday that conferees from the House of Representatives had agreed to accept his measure, which has already been approved by the Senate, with “minor, clarifying changes”.But, in an important change to the provision, the Fed would be prevented from regulating network fees, which are charged by Visa and MasterCard; they totalled $19.7bn in 2009, or about a third of all interchange fees, according to the Nilson Report.Shares in Visa rose 5 per cent to $80.90 and MasterCard rose 4.2 per cent to $223.34. Both companies saw their shares fall sharply when the earlier version of legislation – that covered the network fees – was passed by the Senate.However, banks faced an almost complete defeat. Although they would be able to charge interchange fees to cover fraud-prevention costs, most other such surcharges would be capped. In deciding what fees would be reasonable, Congress instructed the Fed to consider cheques, which are cleared without any transaction fees.The smallest banks, with assets of less than $10bn, would be exempt from the new rules, as would local, state and federal government programmes that allow people to access benefits with debit cards.Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, which, according to Nilson issued a combined $550bn in debit cards last year, stand to suffer most from the new rules.Banks, with the support of a large number of members of Congress, lobbied hard against the legislation, arguing that a similar law passed in Australia in 2003 resulted in higher card fees and fewer benefits, rather than lower costs, to consumers.In spite of the deal being agreed in principle it will still need to be agreed at a public session of conferees. The final legislative package also faces votes in the House and Senate.Interchange is one of the last live battles over financial reform and one of several issues that emerged late in the process and are set to be included in the final legislation in spite of objections from banks.This week the conferees are set to toughen the “Volcker Rule”, which bans banks from proprietary trading and places restrictions on their ownership of hedge funds, and include a provision to force banks into an expensive restructuring of their swaps desks."
320;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-06-03T17:18:59Z;Visa in clash over China payments;;Visa has told banks they must stop using the payment system of Chinese state-backed China UnionPay to process international transactions for co-branded Visa and UnionPay credit cards.The move comes as credit card companies are becoming increasingly frustrated in China, where transactions must be conducted through the monopoly UnionPay, which is aggressively expanding beyond China’s borders.Visa has written to banks to remind them of operating regulations that require financial institutions to process international transactions outside China through Visa’s system.If banks did not comply with Visa’s request, the card company said it would start to charge penalties from August 1.Visa’s move to block UnionPay outside China comes after US trade officials held talks in late March with Visa, American Express and MasterCard over the possibility of taking action against China for shutting them out of its growing payment processing market.China does not allow foreign groups to issue their own credit cards, build networks to support such cards or process interbank point-of-sale transactions. Companies such as Visa are required to “co-brand” with Chinese partners to provide any of these services.China’s banks generally charge fewer and lower fees than international competitors, and Un-ionPay has been offering cardholders better exchange rates on certain currencies than Visa and its peers normally charge.Although Visa said its actions were not aimed at limiting UnionPay’s international expansion, the China group responded with a scathing statement.“Both companies have a responsibility and obligation to provide overseas transaction services to co-branded card holders,” UnionPay said. “Neither side has the right to unilaterally restrict cardholders’ options for overseas payment channels.”Some US lawyers, trade officials and finance executives say China is violating commitments it made on joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 to open the market to foreign companies for “all payment and money transmission services, including credit, charge and debit cards” by the end of 2006.UnionPay was established by China’s central bank in 2002 and is owned by more than 80 Chinese state-controlled banks.While US card groups complain they are blocked from doing business in China, UnionPay-branded cards can be used in more than 90 countries and regions and the company is strongly promoting its cards abroad.China issued around 50m credit cards in 2008, according to McKinsey. It forecasts that by 2013 the number of credit cards in China will surpass 300m.

Shares fell back 6.9 per cent to $28.28.“[Our] enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by the devaluation of the euro and the general instability of the European economy,” said Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive.VeriSign, an internet software provider, lost 1.5 per cent to $27.56 after agreeing to sell its security unit to Symantec for $1.3bn. Symantec fell back 5.6 per cent to $14.76.Advance Auto Parts shares were 6.9 per cent higher at $48.99 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to $55, citing an economic backdrop in which more drivers would be servicing their own cars, as well as the group’s ability to provide “customer service focus, direct sourcing and price optimisation”.Sears said its earnings fell 39 per cent in the first quarter year-on-year, which the retailer attributed to declining margins in appliances and other big-ticket items.

The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,298.37.Shares with significant European exposure were hit hard. Harman International, a maker of audio equipment, receives more than two-thirds of its revenues from Europe. Harman led S&P 500 decliners, falling 7.7 per cent to $31.73.Also weighing on sentiment was a weaker-than-expected consumer price index April report. Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was just 0.9 per cent higher than this time last year – the smallest annual rise since 1966 – indicating a very mild uptick in economic activity.Industrial companies broadly declined. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, led the Dow decliners, losing 2.8 per cent to $61.44. Aerospace group Boeing fell 2.2 per cent to $66.21 and 3M, the diversified industrial, lost 1.1 per cent to $82.54.“Fundamentally, things are not changing yet but, since the market went up prior to the fundamentals improving, the market can also begin to discount a slight pullback prior to actually getting the data,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet, an agency brokerage.Losses were pared later in the afternoon once the S&P 500 neared 1,100, its 200-day moving average, but bounced higher soon after hitting it. “When sentiment is deteriorating, technical levels have outsized significance,” said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at Jefferies.Support also came from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting notes, in which policy makers raised their 2010 growth forecast and reiterated their dovish stance.Quarterly net income at Deere & Co, manufacturer of agricultural equipment, jumped from $472m to $547m year on year.

They were the only S&P 500 economic sector to rise, adding 0.2 per cent.Opponents were fighting an effort to bring the bill to an up-or-down vote, and a push to include a provision authorising states to regulate credit-card interest rates looked to have failed.Visa added 4.1 per cent to $72.97, and MasterCard was flat at $202.45. Shares are still down 15 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, since an amendment to regulate debit card fees was added to the bill on Friday.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at UBS, reiterated his “buy” ratings on Visa and MasterCard, saying markets were pricing in “unrealistic bear case regulatory scenarios”.Capital One Financial, the consumer credit card lender, added 2 per cent to $42.38. American Express added 0.8 per cent to $40.17.Leading banks were stronger, in spite of pressure from Germany’s decision to limit naked short selling, which led to a drop in shares of European banks. Citigroup added 2.1 per cent to $3.81 and Bank of America led Dow risers, up 2.3 per cent to $16.31.Peabody, the biggest US coal producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $38.49, and rival Massey lost 4.2 per cent to $31.35 as natural gas prices rose closer to $4.30 per million British thermal units.Target, the big-box retailer, reported that net income rose 30 per cent from the first quarter a year ago thanks to stronger apparel sales. European sales worries, however, led shares down 0.4 per cent to $54.03. Walmart dipped 1.2 per cent to $53.04.Hewlett-Packard added 0.5 per cent to $47.00, after first-quarter income beat consensus estimates.Healthcare was also a source of some support.

324;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Amex joins Permira in push for RBS unit;;American Express, the credit card company, has teamed up with UK private equity house Permira to bid for Royal Bank of Scotland’s payment processing division, as buy-out groups bring in commercial partners for the £2.5bn ($3.6bn) auction.Atos Origin, the French IT services group, meanwhile, has joined the private equity consortium of CVC Capital Partners and Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe to bid for RBS’s Global Merchant Services division.Global Merchant Services is centred on the WorldPay payments business and incorporates the Streamline cards operation that dominates in the UK. RBS – 70 per cent owned by the UK taxpayer – must sell the unit under the terms of a European Commission state aid ruling.The bank has signalled that private equity buyers may need to link with strategic partners to prove they have the capability to run the complex payments business, according to people familiar with the sale.Global Merchant Services handles more than half the UK’s face-to-face transactions using payment cards such as Visa and MasterCard. RBS is understood to have some concerns that a pure private equity buyer may not have the scale or expertise to manage the business.All groups declined to comment, but two bidders said the technical and commercial challenges of carving out the Global Merchant Services business from RBS meant that private equity groups could benefit from having strategic partners.While the division processes 500 credit and debit card payments per second – one bidder said it had “five-nine” precision, meaning it was reliable 99.999 per cent of the time – the division’s IT system is old and may need updating soon.American Express processes payments for millions of customers in 130 countries and its experience could help the RBS division to expand in emerging markets.Atos Origin has been interested in the auction since the start, but the French IT services group failed to reach the second round, forcing it to join forces with a rival bidder.There are still a number of other bidders in the fray, including Moneris, the Canadian card payments company and pure private equity buyers TPG, Warburg Pincus and a consortium of Advent International and Bain Capital.The bidders have until May 31 to submit second-round bids.
325;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-05-14T23:45:29Z;Shares fall on US debit card fees plan;;A proposal to regulate fees paid by US retailers on debit card swipes in the Senate’s financial reform bill led to a sharp drop in the shares of Visa, MasterCard and leading banks on Friday.The amendment would enable the Federal Reserve to alter so-called interchange fees, or the fees paid by merchants to issuers of debit cards such as Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase.It was sponsored by Dick Durbin, senior Democratic senator from Illinois, and approved late on Wednesday night.Investors saw potential impact on revenue for Visa and MasterCard – which collect the interchange fees and pass them to the banks – from reduced payments by the banks to use their networks and additional regulatory scrutiny.Banks received $15.8bn in interchange fees on debit card transactions from US merchants last year, according to the Nilson Report.“If the Durbin amendment becomes law, the question is, will the Fed regulate not just the pure interchange fees, which are revenue only for the issuing banks, but also Visa and MasterCard’s debit fees?” said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at UBS.The credit card payment network companies – once industry utilities that were spun off and sold to the public in recent years – saw their shares dip sharply.Visa fell 9.9 per cent to $77.26, and MasterCard dropped 8.6 per cent to $212.45.However, both have seen their share price recover more than 45 per cent since 2009 as consumer spending has revived, along with the use of credit and debit cards.“Nothing in Durbin’s amendment directly impacts Visa or MasterCard’s revenues or earnings-per-share, in our view,” said Adam Frisch, analyst at Morgan Stanley. “The biggest harm, at least near term, to the stocks could be the perception that this bill hinders growth.”Mr Durbin is a long-term critic of the fees, which merchants have argued are too high because the payment system does not have enough competition.“Passage of this measure gives small businesses and their customers a real chance in the fight against the outrageously high ‘swipe fees’ charged by Visa and MasterCard,” Senator Durbin said.David Robertson, of the Nilson Report, a payment industry newsletter, said: “Merchants are willing to a large degree to pay for credit transactions, because they figure consumers might be spending money they don’t have. But with the debit card, it’s the consumer’s own money, and so merchants want to pay the lowest fee possible.”In a statement, Visa said: “We hope Congress sees today’s amendment for what it is – an attempt by retailers to increase their profits at the expense of consumers.”MasterCard issued a similar statement calling on lawmakers to reject the amendment.Analysts discounted the likelihood the rules would become law. “We still think interchange fails to make it into the final compromise bill, given that key influential lawmakers in the House remain against it,” said Christopher Mammone, analyst at Deutsche Bank.The largest bank issuers of debit cards were also hit. Citigroup was down 2.7 per cent to $3.98, JPMorgan slipped 2.3 per cent to $39.89 and Bank of America was off 3.1 per cent to $16.34.However, in spite of the broad regulatory uncertainty hanging over the industry, the S&P 500 financial sector is still up 6.6 per cent in 2010, compared with a gain of 1.9 per cent for the overall S&P 500 index.Over the past month, risk premiums – or spreads – on bank bonds have risen from 60bp to 130bp.But both Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were able this week to raise money by selling new bonds.

Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.John Stoltzfus, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, said: “Markets that had
rallied earlier this week have been paring those gains as consideration of the ramifications of austerity programmes tied to the bail-out on regional and even global growth are being weighed.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was 1.9 per cent lower at 1,135.68 but 2.2 per cent up on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.5 per cent to 10,620.16, leaving it 2.3 per cent higher on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite had dropped
2 per cent to 2,346.85 but was up 3.6 per cent over the five days.A spike in volatility was indicated by the Vix climbing 18 per cent on Friday to 31.48. Credit card companies declined after the Senate’s decision. Visa was down

ConocoPhillips was one of the worst performers on Friday, losing 1.9 per cent to $55.84.Chevron fell 1.4 per cent to $77.83 and ExxonMobil was down 1.8 per cent to $63.60.Sybase was up 0.7 per cent to $64.65 over the week after Germany’s SAP, the world’s largest enterprise software maker, said on Wednesday that it would acquire the company for $5.8bn.The price, $65 a share, represents a 44 per cent premium to Sybase’s three-month average stock price.Online film rental company Netflix fell 8.6 per cent to $100.56 as the stock was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” at Citigroup and cut from “buy” to “neutral” at Merriman Curhan Ford.Shares of aluminium refiner Noranda Aluminum rallied 6 per cent to $8.80 on their market debut on Friday but JinkoSolar, a China-based maker of solar cells, was flat at $11.01 on their first trading day.Wave2Wave Communications postponed its initial public offering due to poor market conditions."
327;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Deal of the week - Clydesdale’s new 0% credit card;;"What’s the deal?Zero per cent interest for 16 months on credit card balance transfers for those taking out a Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Gold Mastercard. This new card also offers three months of
0 per cent interest on all new purchases. After the offer ends, the interest rate on the card goes up to 16.9 per cent. The card carries no annual fee.Is this good?It’s the longest 0 per cent interest period of any UK credit card. Even cardholders who would normally pay off their bills in full each month can benefit from the interest-free deal: by making only the minimum repayment during the 0 per cent period, and depositing the money they would have used to clear their balances in a savings account, to earn interest. This can be more profitable than the cashback on spending offered by other cards. For those with expensive purchases coming up, the Clydesdale/Yorkshire bank deal also offers the ability to repay over a
longer term at no extra cost to the individual.What’s the catch?If you have been rejected for a card in the past six months, you might not qualify as card issuers are using tight credit scoring methods, warns Andrew Hagger of moneynet.co.uk. There is also a one-off 3 per cent handling fee for transferring debt balances from other cards – in line with the majority of the market.What are the alternatives?There are now 71 credit cards offering the chance to switch to a 0 per cent rate, with 39 offering the rate over periods of 12 months or more. But only the Clydesdale/Yorkshire bank card offers 16 months interest-free.The other alternative is cashback credit cards, which are a more conventional way of making money out of spending. American Express Platinum Moneyback gives spending rebates of 5 per cent for three months, followed by tiered rewards of 0.5 to 1.5 per cent.How do I find out more?www.ybonline.co.uk/cards or www.cbonline.co.uk/cards.

328;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-05-04T20:59:07Z;Wall St rocked on debt contagion fears;;"Rising fears of contagion to Spain and Portugal in the wake of Greece’s fiscal and debt problems sparked a sharp sell-off in US stocks on Tuesday, with sentiment further damped by uncertainty over the full impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.“Today’s sell-off is mostly about Greece,” said Andrew Neale, of Fogel Neale Partners, a New York-based wealth manager.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “Politics continues to get in the way of the economics. But ultimately Germany and the others won’t allow the situation to get out of control. It’s a short-term problem that will be extinguished. [The markets’ fall] is an over-reaction.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 2.4 per cent at 1,173.60; the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 per cent to 10,926.77 and the Nasdaq Composite was 3 per cent lower at 2,424.25.“There is also some concern around corporate earnings. The market has run up a lot on expectations,” Mr Neale said.“However, we’ve seen cost-cutting drive profits [in the last quarter] and many companies are still missing top-line growth. It’s not going to be enough to sustain valuations at the current levels,” he added.Pharmaceutical stocks were the day’s best performers, as investors flocked to safehavens and as two of the industry’s biggest names reported strong first-quarter results.Pfizer rallied 2.1 per cent to $17.26 as the company reported better-than- expected results for the first quarter, boosted by its recent acquisition of smaller rival Wyeth.Profit excluding some items was 60 cents per share, beating the 53 cents average analyst estimate.However, the company said the recent US healthcare bill had shaved about $56m from its revenues in the quarter.Rival Merck was also higher, rising 1.5 per cent to $35.81 as it reported first- quarter earnings that also beat estimates.However, the company’s profits dropped sharply compared with a year ago because of acquisition charges from its $41bn purchase of Schering-Plough last year, and its projected full-year earnings were below some analyst estimates. It also said that the healthcare bill will negatively impact its top line.Concerns over monetary tightening in China heavily dragged on the materials sector. Cliffs Natural Resources pulled back 7.5 per cent to $54.55, Vulcan Materials was 5.8 per cent lower at $55.50, while Titanium Metals Corpfell 6.5 per cent to $14.49.Mastercard rose 0.2 per cent to $251.25 as it said profit in the first quarter rose by 24 per cent compared with a year ago, beating analysts’ expectations as consumer spending picks up.It earned $3.46 per share, against $2.80 per share a year earlier and average analyst estimates of $3.14 per share.The Vix index, a measure of the market’s volatility, shot up 22.5 per cent to 24.73, its highest reading since early February.Pharmacy chain CVS Caremark dropped 1.6 per cent to $36.48 in spite of reporting stronger first- quarter results than analysts were expecting, helped by higher revenues and increased stocking of more profitable generic drugs.The company also raised the low end of its full-year earnings forecasts.Apple was 2.9 per cent lower to $258.68 on reports that US antitrust authorities are looking into whether the company’s licensing agreement with iPhone application developers restricts competition in the mobile device market.Blue chip technology stocks were some of the session’s greatest fallers. Microsoft declined 2.4 per cent to $30.13, Dell retreated 4.4 per cent to $15.66 and Google slipped 4.6 per cent to $506.37.Ann Taylor was up 9.3 per cent to $24.76 as the women’s clothing chain said it expects first-quarter earnings to “significantly exceed expectations” and be “substantially better” than a year earlier.However, other leading clothing retailers found themselves under pressure, with J Crew leading the pack lower, falling 4.7 per cent to $46.35. Gap was 3.9 per cent down to $24.71, Limited Brands fell 3.4 per cent to $26.87 and Abercrombie & Fitch lost 2.1 per cent to $43.74."
329;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-05-04T20:01:53Z;Rebound boosts MasterCard;;MasterCard has said it benefited from a rebound in consumer spending, particularly in Asia and Latin America but slowly fanning across the globe.The world’s second-largest payment network said on Tuesday that US purchase volumes turned positive in March for the first time in 18 months, and that growth continued in April.“We are seeing people feel a bit more comfortable, and they are starting to spend more on discretionary items,” said Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer.MasterCard’s first-quarter net profit was $455m, or $3.46 per share, compared with $367m, or $2.80 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 13 per cent to $1.3bn.Worldwide purchase volume climbed 8.7 per cent in the period, but much of that growth came from countries outside the US, including Latin America, Asia and Africa. US purchase volume grew 1 per cent, better than the nearly 7 per cent decline a year ago.“While credit growth in the US was still negative, we’ve moved beyond the double-digit declines of previous quarters,” said Robert Selander, who will be succeeded as chief executive on July 1 by Ajay Banga, currently MasterCard’s president and chief operating officer.Debit card volumes grew 13 per cent worldwide and 7 per cent in the US. MasterCard’s credit and charge programmes fared less well, growing just 7 per cent around the globe and declining 3 per cent in the US.On Monday, the Federal Reserve released its quarterly survey of senior loan officers, which showed that card issuers continued to tighten credit in the first quarter. Card issuers have been closing inactive accounts and eliminating credit for high-risk borrowers in the wake of the financial crisis and new restrictions on lending, which are expected to cost them an estimated $12bn in lost revenue.Most analysts, however, said the cycle of credit reduction was nearing an end. “Personal consumption is coming back and it’s starting to look more like a V-shaped recovery,” said Bruce Harting, an analyst with Barclays Capital.Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse said credit card issuers had started marketing again, albeit to a narrower audience.MasterCard’s results were not quite as strong as those reported last month by larger rival Visa, which saw worldwide payment volumes grow 13 per cent. The two companies have been battling to sign up customers. Aside from consumers’ willingness to spend, card issuers face another problem. Amendments to financial reform legislation making its way through Congress propose limiting interchange fees, which a merchant’s bank pays to a card issuing banks on each transaction.
330;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Financial institutions: Rebound is on the cards in banking;;"A year ago financial brands were still reeling from the after-effects of the global banking crisis of autumn 2008, so it was little surprise that the category was one of the worst performing in the April 2009 Top 100, beaten to the wooden spoon only by the lamentable performance of cars and insurers.But, after falling 11 per cent in last year’s ranking, the financial institutions category has bounced back, rising 12 per cent in the 2010 list – more than any of the other 16 categories.The bald figures are flattering, however. The recovery is due in large measure to a very strong performance by brands that have been relatively well insulated from the credit crisis because of their business model, conservative approach to lending or location. Four of the 20 are in this year’s list of top 20 risers by brand value.Pride of place goes to the two big card payment companies, MasterCard and Visa, whose brand values rose 57 and 52 per cent respectively. Cristiana Pearson, an MBO director, attributes this in part to the brands’ growing presence beyond credit cards, with the expanding use of debit cards for small payments, and pre-paid cards. “In emerging markets in particular, you are seeing a rise in the way that people pay for things like utility bills and other sorts of basic bills, which used to be by cheque or cash,” she says.Joanna Seddon, MBO’s chief executive, adds that in China, workers are receiving their pay on credit cards – “your pay is a card and you go and deal with it in a bank”. Elsewhere, she says an increasing number of US airlines have switched from cash to credit card for small purchases by passengers. Another strength, according to Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, is that paying by debit prevents a large monthly credit card bill from building up. “That’s a smart move in times of recession,” he says.This healthy scenario for the card payment brands is confirmed by Antonio Lucio, Visa’s global chief marketing officer. “I’d attribute the improvement in Visa’s brand position to two key factors,” he says. “First, Visa’s product mix includes debit, pre-paid and credit, and that diversity gives us tremendous resilience in challenging economic times.“Second, our marketing efforts are gaining real traction. The ‘More People Go with Visa’ campaign and its recent Olympic Games extension, ‘Go World’, were the first global campaigns in Visa’s history. Together they’re delivering excellent returns.”Compared with Visa and MasterCard, American Express has been more exposed to the broader financial crisis, says MBO, and less to some of the factors that have boosted its two rivals. So its brand value has fallen by 7 per cent.The other two big risers in this sector were Goldman Sachs – currently facing mounting threats to its reputation following US fraud charges – and HSBC. Goldman, up 25 per cent, was the bank that predicted the crisis, says MBO, and consequently did not suffer as the other banks did. As well as having a record financial year, its brand value is also up across most countries.HSBC’s 23 per cent rise in brand value is attributed partly to its strength in Asia, but also to the creation of a global brand from scratch via acquisitions over the past seven years. “They’re positioned around values, the idea of celebrating global diversity,” says Ms Seddon. “They’ve really been pushing their global brand marketing around something that is a bigger idea than banking.”Nick Cooper, MBO’s senior vice-president in the UK and Europe, adds that HSBC also emerged with clean hands from the credit crisis, and with no state aid. “They’ve obviously picked up a lot of business from other brands that have done less well,” he says.Other good performers in this sector include Barclays, which also did not take any public funding and has been investing heavily in its brand; Chase, buoyed by its acquisition of Washington Mutual but also by avoiding serious trouble in the credit crisis; and Royal Bank of Canada, helped by its home country’s conservative banking laws, and a beneficiary of the fall-out from the financial turmoil. Through acquisitions in the US over recent years it has been building a North American identity via its RBC branding – “it’s difficult to expand to the southern American states if you’re called the Royal Bank of Canada”, says Ms Seddon.Then there is Santander, with its strong position in Latin America offsetting the financial crisis in Spain, but also benefiting from overt brand promotion through its sponsorship of Formula One motor racing. Ms Seddon forecast a further big rise in brand value for the “monolithic” Santander in next year’s ranking as brands it has acquired, including Abbey in the UK, are renamed.Overall, the top 20 in this sector underlines how the world of banking has changed in the past five years. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Citi and Bank of America brands were jostling for top place, but now it is China’s ICBC, up 15 per cent this year, that heads the ranking (see table).“[ICBC] really does have a strong brand – you mightn’t think so from looking at its name but it does,” says Ms Seddon. Bank of China and China Construction Bank occupy fourth and fifth places, respectively, while India’s ICICI makes its debut in 10th slot. Meanwhile, Bank of America and Citi have fallen to 9th and 12th.Looking ahead, however, it is not all about the inexorable rise of the Asian bank brands. Four of the top 20 brands – Visa, Santander, RBC and Bank of America – are in the overall top 10 for “brand momentum”, a forward-looking measure of a brand’s potential. A strong presence in emerging markets is one reason for this.RankBrandBrand value $mBrand contributionBrand momentumBrand value changeTwo-year CAGR"
331;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Fastest risers and worst fallers;;Samsung takes the prize for fastest-rising brand in this year’s BrandZ Top 100 – an 80 per cent increase takes its brand value to $11.3bn, allowing the Korean electronics group to power its way back into the Top 100, in 68th place, after a one-year absence.The company’s television business has been performing “incredibly well”, says Cristiana Pearson, a director at Millward Brown Optimor. Joanna Seddon, MBO’s chief executive, adds: “The TV business is very strongly branded and Samsung has the strongest brand in LCD [liquid crystal display] TVs, that’s really a lot of what this is about.”Close behind is Baidu, the Chinese internet search engine, which makes its first appearance in the Top 100 after a 62 per cent rise in brand value to $9.4bn, putting it in 75th place. Baidu is also one of just two brands – Skol is the other, in the beer category – to achieve a maximum 10 for brand momentum, which indicates each brand’s short-term growth potential.Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, says Baidu is one of the most trusted brands in China. This is due partly to the fact that a majority of Chinese think they do a better job than Google at picking up the nuances of different Chinese dialects, according to MBO.Sandwiched between MasterCard and Visa (covered in the article on Financial Institutions) in the top 20 risers table is Next, the UK clothes retailer, with a 54 per cent rise in brand value to $2.6bn (well short of the Top 100). “Next is a recovery brand, it was down 40 per cent last year so has recovered its value,” says Ms Pearson. “It has tried to adopt the Zara/H&M model of quick turnround of trends and moving its products fast through the stores. It has also adopted a strategy of moving from the cities to larger spaces in retail parks, which has been quite successful.”Then comes Hewlett-Packard, the US technology hardware and IT services group, with a 48 per cent rise in brand value to $39.7bn. This reflects the rebranding of EDS to the HP brand and a brand repositioning, with a new logo and “Let’s do amazing” tagline.“This tagline is all about innovation, it’s things like networking in space, monitoring vibrations on the Golden Gate Bridge, running security systems in Vegas, printing documents off a mobile phone,” says Ms Pearson.“HP has historically not been run as one brand, every division was pretty independent,” says Ms Seddon. Under Mark Hurd [HP’s chief executive] that has changed, it’s one global brand, one idea which is this idea about unleashing new possibilities, of being a catalyst for creation, helping businesses and individuals all around the world.”The booby prize for biggest fall in brand value goes to Nokia, which dropped 30 places to 43rd place after a 58 per cent decline to $14.9bn. This is not a trust issue – in fact it is the most trusted brand in about ten of the 22 countries covered in the BrandZ ranking, says Mr Walshe. “The brand does very well, the issue is that Nokia has sort of missed the smartphone wave,” says Ms Pearson. Ms Seddon adds: “People haven’t been buying it. They’ve also been selling widgets rather than handsets. So, Apple is selling access to exciting applications and Nokia’s been selling phones.”Two more technology brands suffered the second- and fourth-biggest declines in brand value. Intel’s was down 38 per cent at $14.2bn, resulting in a fall of 25 places to 48th. The chipmaker’s brand declined because market capitalisation fell, and the brand contribution element slipped slightly.As for Siemens, the German industrial group, its brand value fell 31 per cent to $9.3bn. It is doing fine financially, says MBO. However, its brand contribution has declined and its brand multiple has declined a lot, too. Its earnings went up while market valuation went down. Therefore, market outlook is less positive than it was a year ago. Porsche, the German sports car group, also sustained a 31 per cent fall, to $12bn.Sandwiched between Intel and the two German brands on the list of biggest fallers is Disney, down 21 places to 41st after brand value fell 35 per cent to $15bn. None of their businesses have been doing particularly well, says MBO – and in a recession, it can be an expensive day out for a family. “It’s discretionary leisure, isn’t it?” says Mr Walshe.Samsung80%Baidu62%MasterCard57%Next54%Visa52%HP48%Verizon Wireless39%Apple32%IBM30%Sony30%Amazon29%Goldman Sachs25%HSBC23%O223%Skol22%Gatorade22%Corona21%Evian21%Budweiser20%T-Mobile20%
332;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
333;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa buys Cybersource in e-commerce push;;Visa on Wednesday accelerated its push into online payments and e-commerce, agreeing to buy Cybersource, an electronic payments company, for about $2bn in cash.The deal, which values Cybersource at about $26 a share, comes just a week after rival MasterCard launched a new division dedicated to bringing to market faster different forms of payment.The traditional payment processors are manoeuvring to ensure their position is not eclipsed by emerging technology and online rivals such as PayPal. American Express last year announced it was buying Revolution Money, an online processor, for $300m.Cybersource, which helps retailers protect themselves against fraudulent online payments using its software, processes about a quarter of all US ecommerce transactions, by dollar value.The company counts British Airways, Home Depot and Facebook among its clients and last year had revenues of $265m and net income of $11m.About 8 per cent of Cybersource’s revenues came from outside the US in the fourth quarter of last year.The deal with Visa should help to spur the company’s international growth, with Asia and Latin America expected to be early priorities.The price reflects about a 34 per cent premium to where Cybersource shares closed on Tuesday.That values Cybersource at about 19 to 20 times adjusted 2011 earnings, according a source close to the deal – roughly in line with where Visa itself trades.The acquisition of Cybersource would leave few sizable businesses for rivals looking to accelerate in electronic payments. PayPal, which is owned by Ebay, is rapidly growing its activity away from the online auction site and is becoming more important to the company as its auction model falls out of favour with consumers.Cybersource, which was founded in 1994, listed on Nasdaq in 1999 as the dotcom bubble approached its apex.The company greatly expanded its presence among small businesses with the acquisition of Authorize.net in 2007 and now works with more than 295,000 merchants using both brands.Visa and Cybersource have worked together since 1999 and Cybersource’s chief executive, Michael Walsh, will stay on to oversee its operations.Shares in Visa slipped 0.61 per cent to $93.48 in afternoon trade in New York. Cybersource stock jumped almost 32 per cent to trade at $25.65 a share.JPMorgan advised Visa on the deal while Goldman Sachs acted for Cybersource.
334;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Former prosecutor to preside over Goldman case;;"A no-nonsense former prosecutor will preside over the legal fight between Goldman Sachs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations the bank misled investors in one of its structured products.US District Judge Barbara Jones is no stranger to high profile confrontations.She ran the 2005 criminal trial of Bernie Ebbers, the former chief executive of bankrupt telecoms group WorldCom; oversaw the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against MasterCard and Visa: and refereed Hank Greenberg’s legal battle against American International Group, the global insurance company he led for 40 years.Ms Jones spent her entire pre-bench career representing the government in criminal cases, first for the US Attorney’s office in Manhattan and then for the Manhattan district attorney.She was one of the first prosecutors to use the relatively new federal racketeering laws to tackle the Mafia, and her case against the Bonanno crime family became the basis for the film Donnie Brasco.Appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton, Ms Jones was sworn in in 1995.Defence attorneys were concerned she would rule predominantly for the prosecution, but she won them over with her reasonable manner and fair rulings.Unfailingly good-natured, she works hard to get opposing sides to talk to each other and runs trials with a firm hand.Ms Jones’s rulings are hard to characterise ideologically – she handed down a mixed decision in the MasterCard Visa case and dished out a 25-year prison sentence to Mr Ebbers.But she wins praise for her grasp of complex financial issues and her ability to explain the law clearly to jurors who serve as the ultimate decision makers in US court trials. “She’s great. She lets each side try its case, understands the issues and is efficient, which is important in a case like this,” said a New York attorney who has tried cases before her."
335;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard raises technology focus;;MasterCard will on Thursday announce the launch of a newly created division dedicated to bringing products to market faster, the latest sign that the world’s second-largest payments network is trying to become more nimble as it competes against newer groups such as PayPal.MasterCard plans to invest tens of millions of dollars in the new division – called MasterCard Labs – which will be staffed globally by technology engineers and business development executives.“The secular trend of moving from cash and cheques to other forms of payments will accelerate, especially in countries other than the US,” said Ajay Banga, MasterCard’s new chief executive. “To stay ahead of that curve, we’ve got to create the right partnership and team work.”The new division will be headed by Gary Lyons, who had served as chief of Orbiscom, a payment technology company that MasterCard acquired in 2008.While at Orbiscom, Mr Lyons developed a system called inControl, which gives credit card users more of a say in how their payments are made. Accounts can be set up so that certain payments are made by debit and others on credit.Parents who give their children credit cards can also block their use in certain stores. The system also allows customers to set up limits that prevent them from spending more than a certain amount each month in a certain place.Mr Banga said the goal of the new lab was to churn out more products such as inControl, as well as others that MasterCard has recently introduced. These include MoneySend – which allows customers to transfer money from one MasterCard to another via ATM machines, the internet or mobile phones – and a partnership unveiled last week with Next Jump, an internet data tracking company, which will create an online shopping mall tailored to cardholders’ likely shopping habits. Visa, the largest payments network, and American Express, the number three, are also stepping up their product development pipelines.In November, American Express bought Revolution Money, an online payment processor, and Visa has told investors that it plans to increase spending on research and development.“There is a healthy paranoia that you don’t want to be eclipsed by some new method of payment,” said Barclays analyst Bruce Harting.Like Visa, MasterCard’s strength has historically been in processing large numbers of payments for commercial customers, rather than in making loans or developing niche markets. “In the past, we may have missed some opportunities, because we weren’t necessarily as good at taking an idea and building it into a prototype,” said Josh Peirez, who heads its business development unit.
336;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-04-13T00:58:50Z;MasterCard names Banga as new CEO;;MasterCard named a former Citigroup executive to succeed chief executive Robert Selander, who is retiring at the end of this year.Indian-born Ajay Banga joined MasterCard in August as chief operating officer with the expectation that he would be offered the opportunity to replace Mr Selander. He will assume his duties as chief executives July 1. Mr Banga is also joining the board, effective immediately.Mr Banga, who spent 13 years at Citigroup, where he oversaw the company’s international global consumer group, said he planned to focus on emerging markets such as Asia and Latin America, while also building on MasterCard’s internet and mobile commerce businesses.Mr Selander, who became chief executive in 1997 and spearheaded the company’s high-profile initial public offering in 2006, will remain executive vice-chairman and retain his board seat until he retires in December.The two executives spoke on Monday from Singapore, where MasterCard was holding its board meeting. Among the qualifications that singled out Mr Banga for MasterCard’s top job was his international experience, Mr Selander said, adding that such experience, combined with his financial background, “made him the perfect CEO to lead MasterCard into the next generation”.Because MasterCard only processes payments and does not make loans, the company – like Visa – has not been hurt as much as credit card issuers by rising delinquencies and defaults.
337;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-03-01T23:00:43Z;Aerospace: A longer range;;"There are all sorts of ways to think about a map of the world. Britons of a certain age grew up in classrooms with maps showing much of the globe satisfyingly covered in empire pink. Children of the cold war saw a world divided between red communist nations and the rest. To an executive of Airbus, the European aircraft maker, countries on the map have meanwhile come to look much the same – except for one that has long been disconcertingly different.It is Japan – which, alone among the world’s wealthiest nations, is a Boeing country. Airbus now has 54 per cent of the world’s aircraft orders. In Japan it has less than 5 per cent.Japan’s biggest airline, the recently bankrupted JAL, has never bought a new Airbus jet. The handful it has were inherited in a merger. JAL and All Nippon Airways, the next biggest carrier, have barely 50 Airbus jets between them and more than 340 Boeings. “It’s an unnatural situation,” says Tom Enders, Airbus chief executive. “Japan is one of the largest markets in the world and there is almost no Airbus.”But Mr Enders, a forthright former paratrooper, is trying to tackle that. He headed to Japan last week for the second time this year, as part of a concerted push into one of Boeing’s last bastions.If successful, it could open up a new chapter in the story of one of the world’s greatest commercial rivalries. Some in Airbus hope it could even help reconfigure the global commercial aircraft industry by putting the European group permanently on top.Japan is not merely the world’s second largest economy; it sits in the Asia-Pacific, which both Airbus and Boeing expect to become a bigger market than either the US or Europe over the next 20 years, accounting for about one-third of their deliveries.China has already become the world’s fastest-growing aviation market. Airbus has more than 500 of its jets flying there, about half the number it has in the US. Ending Boeing’s pre-eminence in Japan would give the European group an important boost in the great game to be played out in this dynamic region.As with anything to do with Airbus and Boeing, however, nothing will happen without an intense and gripping struggle. Few other corporate opponents compete as ferociously as the world’s two biggest makers of passenger aircraft. Unlike other global duopolists – Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Microsoft and Apple, Visa and MasterCard – it is not the case that the two are both American. With one of the rivals based in France, a frisson of geopolitics overlays the usual commercial tensions.Moreover, Boeing spent decades thinking of itself as the natural superior in the arrangement. It dominated much of the market from the dawn of the jet age and built the 747 jumbo that became one of the icons of the era. Airbus did not even exist when the jumbo had its first test flight, in February 1969. The European company dates its birth to May of that year, when French and German ministers signed an agreement jointly to build a passenger jet.The move was a conscious effort to end US rule. But few gave the awkwardly conceived European group much chance of beating Boeing, even when it started producing aircraft to rival the trusty output of Boeing’s Seattle assembly plant.One senior executive from a leading aircraft leasing firm remembers taking a flight across the US just after Northwest Airlines bought some Airbuses. “I got chatting to the guy next to me who turned out to be a pilot at Northwest and he said, ‘Those French guys should stick to making wines because they sure as hell can’t make airplanes’.”As it turned out, Airbus had more staying power than Northwest, which was taken over by Delta in 2008. By then, Airbus had been delivering more aircraft than Boeing for five years in a row, a feat it repeated last year. But Boeing has still beaten Airbus in terms of the value of deliveries for seven out of the last 10 years, according to the Virginia-based Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy. And the value of each company’s order backlog – an important indicator of future relative strength – remained almost identical in 2009 at just under $258bn (€191bn, £172bn).But Airbus’s ascent has stung its older rival and driven the contest between the0 two to fresh heights: in 2004 the US filed a case with the World Trade Organisation alleging the EU had illegally subsidised Airbus; the EU promptly filed a case making similar allegations against the US and Boeing. Neither dispute has yet been resolved.The political dimension to the competition has also been felt over the years by various customer airlines. A little more than 10 years ago, Airbus thought it had finally clinched a deal with Israel’s El Al, long a loyal Boeing customer. But when in 1999 it announced it was going to buy some of the European group’s jets, the move did not go down well in Washington. Officials in the administration of Bill Clinton made it clear that Americans and Congress would not understand why El Al was not buying Boeing planes. To this day, El Al only has Boeings.Airbus also benefited from political help over the years, says Doug McVitie, an aerospace analyst who was director of sales intelligence at Airbus in the 1990s. European airlines that resisted exhortations to buy its products, such as British Airways, a Boeing stalwart for many years, were resented at its Toulouse headquarters.“Airbus executives would have their expenses questioned if they flew on BA, they hated each other so much,” says Mr McVitie. “If they couldn’t find another way of flying, the expenses would be paid but it was seriously frowned on.”Airbus did crack BA, but not until 1998. And politics, says Mr McVitie, is a large part of the reason Airbus is “hardly likely” to break into Japan, where Boeing’s strength has been evident ever since the US occupation that followed the second world war.But nearly five decades of almost uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democratic party ended with last year’s general election, which brought a Democratic party-led government to power. Airbus is hoping this will create opportunities that previously did not exist. As Mr Enders diplomatically puts it: “I think the political environment is changing.”Boeing insists politics is largely irrelevant, at least compared with the commercial relationships it has carefully moulded in Japan. “We’ve been in Japan for more than 50 years and we have a very strong relationship with suppliers as well as customers and partners,” says Charlie Miller, a Boeing vice-president. “We estimate Boeing-related work in Japan supports nearly 13,000 jobs, which is more than 20 per cent of Japan’s total aerospace industry.”Boeing’s latest aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner, underlines the point: Japanese companies are making its wing boxes among other components. ANA is the aircraft’s launch customer.Airbus executives concede that Boeing’s deep web of relationships have made it a formidable presence in Japan. But it claims to have another weapon: its A380 superjumbo, the world’s largest passenger jet.The intense rivalry between Airbus and Boeing has seen each take big bets on aircraft they hope will pull them ahead. In Boeing’s case, it is the 787 Dreamliner, the first passenger jet to be built mostly of carbon fibre composites and the fastest selling jetliner ever built, with 876 orders from 57 customers around the world. For Airbus, it is the A380. Both were hit by delays, but the 787 has just had its first test flight and the A380 has been in service for more than two years.Airbus has long proclaimed the enormous A380 would put it on a whole new footing against Boeing. Finally, the company had a full range of aircraft to sell right across the market, from its 108-seat A318 to a superjumbo capable of carrying more than 800 people, more than Boeing’s 747.Japan, Airbus claims, is a country in need of the A380. Toulouse executives have drawn up charts showing how the A380 has helped Singapore Airlines, the first carrier to fly it, gain market share from JAL and ANA.On one chart, Airbus says SIA’s passenger volumes on the Singapore-Tokyo route rose 8 per cent between May and December 2008 compared with the same period the previous year, which was before the A380 entered service. Volumes on the same route sank 13 per cent for ANA, the chart says, and 19 per cent for JAL.John Leahy, Airbus’s top salesman, insists the “A380 effect” is even more pronounced when it comes to the premium traffic of business and first class passengers that are a significant source of international airlines’ revenue. “Singapore [Airlines] went from Singapore to Narita with the A380 and JAL lost almost all of their premium traffic going down to Singapore, because given a choice, people would take the 380,” he says. “And it takes an A380 to compete with an A380.”Not everyone agrees. Richard Aboulafia at Teal Group thinks Airbus will have a difficult time persuading the Japanese, or many other carriers, to sign up. “The A380 is not a plane people want to buy,” he says, noting more than half the 202 orders Airbus has had for the superjumbo came in the first three years since it started marketing it in 2001. The market clearly prefers the smaller and lighter A350 XWB jet that Airbus is now developing, he says, an aircraft that has attracted more than twice as many orders as the A380.“There’s something completely tone deaf about pitching the A380 in a market such as Japan, where the national flag carrier just went bankrupt because it was unable to cut capacity fast enough,” he adds.As for whether Airbus can permanently replace Boeing as the world’s leading aircraft maker, Mr Aboulafia says it comes down to the 787. “If the 787 works out as planned, or close to it, then Airbus will be lucky to regain 50 per cent of the market – and that would only happen if the A350XWB works out too,” he says. “But if something goes wrong with the 787 in terms of its operating economics and performance, then Airbus would certainly overtake Boeing.”So far, therefore, the jury is out. Mr Enders did not leave Tokyo last week with a bunch of orders for the A380, or for any other aircraft. A lot of people have underestimated his company over the years. But only the brave would count Boeing out just yet."

Yet the case for separating Accor’s hotels and services businesses is convincing, and chief executive Gilles Pélisson a convincing convert. The chief argument against was that services’ ample cash flow helped finance the capital-hungry hotels business. Yet while going less far than asset-light rival InterContinental Hotels – which owns only 17 of its 4,400 hotels, franchising or managing the rest – Accor is shifting to an “asset right” model involving many more franchised hotels. That makes it less capital intensive.A split will help accelerate development of both hotels and services – which issues, say, lunch or childcare vouchers to corporate clients that get tax breaks on using them as employee perks. It will also uncover hidden value in the higher-return services arm, capable of increasing earnings by 20 per cent-plus a year and paying generous dividends. The surprise in Accor’s demerger plans on Wednesday was the debt split – with only a quarter of the group’s €1.6bn net debt going to cash-generative services. The explanation that services need to secure a strong investment-grade credit rating, in line with peers such as MasterCard, seems reasonable.Meanwhile, though its €1.2bn debt share looks hefty, the hotels side expects to pay it off by next year. That should come from selling a 49 per cent stake in the Lucien Barrière casino business, and hotel disposals targeted to produce €1.6bn in cash by 2013, including €450m this year. Put the two divisions on sector-average multiples of earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and Accor would be worth about €41 a share, 12 per cent above the current price. Post-demerger, prospects for further multiple expansion look good.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyFrench hotels and services group Accor said on Wednesday its hotels business would take on the bulk of group debt in a company split while it aims to sell non-strategic assets such as a casino stake, says Reuters.Accor made the announcement as sluggish demand for its midmarket and upmarket hotels slashed the group’s 2009 operating profit and dividend. The profit was ahead of consensus.Accor wants to separate the hotel business, which operates brands from luxury Sofitels to budget Ibis and Motel 6 hotels, from its prepaid services business, which provides luncheon and childcare vouchers.The split, agreed in December, is aimed at unlocking value for the two units, helping the operationally geared hotels business shed real estate and assets to boost cash and giving the cash-rich, defensive prepaid services business more freedom to invest and grow.

The company, which trades as the Utility Warehouse, does not advertise and instead relies on ‘word of mouth’ recommendations for expansion.Charles Wigoder, chief executive said: “I am delighted we have already started to see the first signs of the positive impact that the changes we made last summer are having on the quality of our customer base.”The Cashback card, a pre-paid MasterCard which offers customers a saving of 5 per cent on purchases from UK retailers including J Sainsbury and Topshop, and is credited to their monthly utility bill, has proved particularly popular with consumers. Funded by the participating retailers, approximately 30 per cent of new customers have taken up the offer.Telecom Plus also credited the performance of Oxford Power Holdings, the energy supplier in which it has a 20 per cent share, in contributing to growth and said it expected the investment to make a “material contribution” to the group’s profitability.The group said it had automated some processes but had successfully redeployed employees.Telecom Plus said it expected to pay a total dividend of 22p for the year, a rise of 25 per cent. The shares rose 19p to 301p.
340;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-02-13T03:18:30Z;Discover agrees $775m M Stanley settlement;;Discover Financial Services has agreed to pay its former parent, Morgan Stanley, $775m to settle a dispute over how the companies would split the proceeds from another legal tussle.Morgan Stanley had sued Discover in October 2008 to collect its slice of the $2.75bn settlement the US credit card operator had reached in antitrust litigation against rivals Visa and MasterCard.Last month, a New York judge ruled that Morgan Stanley was entitled to the $775m. Discover declined to appeal against the decision. Their agreement also ends counterclaims the company had made against Morgan Stanley, Discover said in a US regulatory filing. “We are delighted with the outcome,” a Morgan Stanley official said.Morgan Stanley spun off Discover in 2007 to sharpen its focus on investment banking, trading, asset management and retail brokerage businesses. As part of its spin-off deal, the bank had maintained a claim on as much as $1.5bn in pre-tax proceeds that the credit card business might collect from its then-unresolved antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard.Morgan Stanley had sued the card operators for preventing banks from issuing Discover cards after officials at the US Department of Justice had alleged their actions had violated antitrust regulations. Both Visa and MasterCard settled with Illinois-based Discover in 2008. Discover then refused to pay Morgan Stanley, arguing that its former parent had interfered with the antitrust settlement discussions.A former finance arm of the US retailing group Sears Roebuck, Discover had been hatched by Phil Purcell, who later ran Morgan Stanley. Sears folded the business into Dean Witter, a brokerage, and spun off the combined company to shareholders in 1993.Mr Purcell, then chief executive of Dean Witter Discover, merged his company with Morgan Stanley in 1997. Shortly before being ousted as Morgan CEO, Mr Purcell had unveiled plans to spin off Discover. His successor, John Mack, reversed them, then reconsidered.Morgan Stanley’s shares fell 0.04 per cent to close at $27.16 on Friday. Discover fell 0.01 per cent to $13.03.
341;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-02-05T02:01:39Z;Banks shut low-use credit cards;;Banks closed unprofitable or inactive credit card accounts at a record pace in the fourth quarter as the industry prepares for the introduction of new rules limiting the fees they can charge customers, a study has found.Eleven per cent of customers who took part in a survey commissioned by Credit.com, a financial advisory service, said their accounts had been closed as of January, up from 6 per cent in June. Credit.com also found that interest rates and fees continued their upward march through the end of the year.The moves have helped banks rein in ballooning losses. As of the third quarter, the most recent for which data is available, slightly more than one-third of the largest 24 credit card issuers tracked by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp were unprofitable, compared with more than half at the end of June.“Issuers are doing whatever they have to do to become profitable,” said Adam Levin, Credit.com’s founder. Banks have pushed through many of the fee and interest rate hikes ahead of changes to credit card rules that take effect this month. As of February 22, issuers will no longer be able to raise rates on existing balances unless the account is 60 days past due. Rules that went into effect in August require issuers to provide 45 days’ notice before they raise rates on future purchases.Despite the new rules, issuers continue to push through rate increases. A Capital One spokeswoman confirmed that the company recently notified customers of rate increases to future balances, but said all such changes were in compliance with the new rules.Card issuers are likely to continue to constrict credit as long as charge-offs remain at record levels. By the third quarter, charge-offs, a measure of uncollectible accounts, stood at 10.24 per cent, nearly double the rate a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve.In its earnings report on Thursday, MasterCard said that its bank customers had issued 966m cards as of year-end, a drop of 1.3 per cent over the same period in the previous year. Most of that decline was the result of US issuers purging accounts, the company said.“The worst in terms of credit reduction is behind us,” Robert Selander, chief executive, said, “but since we still have very high loss rates, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the US credit card industry show no growth this year.”

The labour department reported initial jobless claims had climbed to 480,000, raising concerns over the closely watched monthly employment report due out on Friday.Wall Street was already jittery after concerns over sovereign debt in Greece, Portugal and Spain had prompted heavy selling across Europe.The Vix index, which tracks market volatility through option prices and is known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped 19 per cent to 25.81.“Equities are really telling you what the expectations are here,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global. “With the S&P 500 down sharply, that is the strongest message that Friday’s expected jobs number is a little bit too optimistic.”According to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, analysts are expecting the labour department to report that the economy added jobs in January.The unemployment rate is forecast to have held steady at 10 per cent.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said Wall Street was more concerned with problems in Europe. “I can’t believe it’s the economic data: it’s all about this crisis in Europe and the strengthening of the US dollar, which is causing selling in risk assets.”Encouraging sales figures from the retail sector went largely unnoticed.The 29 retailers that posted their January results on Thursday recorded an average sales rise of 3.3 per cent after analysts had been expecting a 2.5 per cent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data.Discount stores provided the market with the biggest pleasant surprise while clothing stores catering to children and teenagers missed estimates by the widest margin.Macy’s jumped 2.7 per cent to $16.67 after the department store reported higher than expected revenue for the period, driven by strong online demand.Sales at Gap rose 5 per cent over the month after analysts had been expecting a 4.4 per cent increase, helping to boost its shares 2.4 per cent to $19.48.Abercrombie gave the market the biggest surprise, posting a sales rise of 8 per cent in January. Wall Street had been expecting sales to decline 8.4 per cent during the month. Shares in the youth fashion chain gained 3.9 per cent to $33.21.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Burger King Holdings climbed 2.9 per cent to $18.01 after the fast-food chain posted a higher quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting.Revenue growth was mainly driven by new restaurant openings.On a like-for-like basis, worldwide sales dropped 2 per cent and 3.3 per cent in the US and Canada, where the company has had to offer heavy discounts to offset high unemployment.Kraft Foods fell 0.3 per cent to $28.39, paring early declines. According to reports Kraft is planning a four-part $9.5bn debt issuance to fund its takeover of Cadbury.MasterCard added to losses in the financial sector, dropping 10.3 per cent to $222.11. The country’s second-largest credit card company failed to meet quarterly estimates due to severance charges and higher marketing expenses.Visa, the industry’s largest company, beat quarterly estimates after the close on Wednesday. But after early strength, its shares were down 0.6 per cent to $83.05.
343;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-02-02T22:53:37Z;BNY Mellon to buy back-office arm of PNC;;Bank of New York Mellon on Tuesday announced it would pay $2.31bn to acquire the back-office operations of PNC Financial Services Group, a deal that comes amid expectations that more financial firms will shed businesses to shore up their capital bases and pay off federal aid.The deal will allow PNC to exit a non-core business, while helping it raise money to repay $7.6bn in government troubled asset relief programme (Tarp) funds. PNC also said it would sell $3bn of common stock and as much as $2bn of senior notes to pay back federal aid.Jim Palermo, the co-chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon Asset Servicing, said he expects to see other banks make similar deals in the months ahead.“We think there is a fairly high likelihood that this type of consolidation will continue,” Mr Palermo said.Tom McKelvey, the chief operating officer of Capco, a financial consulting firm, said that banks, unlike companies in other industries that outsourced or slimmed down years ago, continued to own too much of the supply chain.“We are talking to a number of our clients about selling large components of their businesses,” he said.Mr McKelvey said that back-office functions such as reconciliation, syndication and settlement activities will increasingly reside with third parties who specialise in those areas, much the way Visa and Mastercard process credit card transactions but do not make loans.He said that only the nation’s six largest banks have scale in syndicated lending, making that an area ripe for divestiture by smaller players.State Street Corporation recently spent $1.87bn to acquire the securities services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, the large Italian banking group.And Citigroup this month sold its technology services division to India’s Wipro for $127m. Other banks that have sold back-office operations in recent years include Fifth Third Bank, Marshall & Ilsley and Synovus.Standard & Poor’s analyst Erik Oja said that in a better economy banks would prefer to keep their back-office operations, because they lessen their dependence on earning money through lending activities. “But in this economy, you are going to see more banks look to sell,” he said.A PNC spokesman pointed out that its sale of the back-office division, which handles processing for financial advisers, fund managers and brokers, was a strategic decision that was not simply motivated by financial concerns.He added that increasing its capital base and repaying Tarp were among the bank’s priorities this year.S&P’s Oja estimates that PNC will be able to repay the bulk of its Tarp funds by the end of this year, saving it $388m beginning in 2011.As a result, he raised his 2011 earnings estimate to $5.24 per share from $5.03 per share.PNC shares were down 1.83 per cent at $54.84 in afternoon trading.
344;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Fewer clothes for cautious consumers;;US shoppers spent even less on clothing in December than they did a year ago, according to new sales estimates that underline the cautious consumer mood that prevailed during the 2009 holiday season.The monthly SpendingPulse report from Mastercard Advisors estimated that sales of specialty clothing in December fell 1.8 per cent, on top of the 8.9 per cent decline seen a year ago in the aftermath of the 2009 Wall Street crash.The projections are based on aggregated data on Mastercard credit, debit and gift card spending, combined with projections of other card spending, cash and checks.SpendingPulse said shoppers stepped up spending on consumer electronics, with sales rising by 7.3 per cent, the fourth consecutive monthly increase. During the pre-Christmas surge, consumer electronics retailers reported strong demand for smartphones, flat screen televisions, and laptop and netbook computers.Luxury sales excluding jewellery were also estimated to have increased by 5.5 per cent, despite falling by 7.3 per cent in November.Jewellery posted its fourth consecutive monthly sales gain, increasing 6.9 per cent over December 2008, although Michael McNamara, head of research and analysis at SpendingPulse, said mid-tier mall-based retailers struggled, despite strength at the high and low price points.The pressures on mall-based jewellers have been manifest at Zale’s, the jewellers, which said over Christmas that plans to review its business after its 1,900 stores in the US and Canada reported an 18 per cent fall in November sales compared with November last year.Zale has lost $247.1m in its last five quarters, and has seen rival jewellers including the 122-year old Finlay chain, Fortunoff and Whitehall go bankrupt over the past two years.SpendingPulse also estimated that online sales rose by17.7 per cent over December of 2008, returning closer to the growth levels seen before last year’s slump.Michael McNamara of Spending Pulse said that Spending Pulse had also seen increases in the average ticket size during the holiday season, as they managed to avoid the drastic emergency discounting on excess stock they had seen in 2008.“Retailers achieved this by keeping tight control over their inventory this year,” he said, adding that the December sales results were “another indication that the retail environment is stabilising”.Leading US chain retailers will report their monthly sales figures for December on Thursday.Macy’s, the largest US traditional department store group, said earlier this week that it planned to close five underperforming stores in a move it described as part of the normal course of assessing its business. It also said it was proceeding with plans to open its first overseas Bloomingdale’s store in Dubai in February, in a joint venture with the UAE’s Al Tayer Group.
345;MA;Mastercard Inc;2010-01-04T22:13:19Z;Ryanair rebuffs fee criticism;;A £5 ($8) fee imposed by Ryanair on many internet flight bookings has sparked a dispute with Britain’s consumer protection chief, in a sign of wider concern about the extra charges levied by companies by means of “drip pricing”.Europe’s leading low-cost airline delivered a typically quixotic riposte to criticisms of the charge by John Fingleton, Office of Fair Trading chief executive, offering customers 1m £4 “Fingleton fares” for mid-week travel.The spat – triggered by Mr Fingleton’s attack on the Ryanair booking fee as “puerile” – comes as the OFT investigates whether companies are unfairly adding costs during the booking process to services they offer, particularly online.Ryanair announced the ticket offer – which comes with several restrictions – after Mr Fingleton was quoted in The Independent newspaper criticising the company for charging £5 for bookings made with cards other than the MasterCard pre-paid service. The airline described Mr Fingleton’s remarks – he accused it of playing “silly games” – as “disappointing and wrong”.The company – a longstanding antagonist of the OFT – said: “Ryanair fails to understand why it was singled out for these inaccurate criticisms by Mr Fingleton, when its charges policies are copied by high fare UK airlines.”“Fingleton fare” tickets not bought through MasterCard pre-pay will be subject to the booking fee, increasing their cost by 125 per cent – offering support to the OFT’s argument that “drip pricing” can lead to large differences between advertised costs and the amount consumers pay.The OFT defended Mr Fingleton’s remarks about Ryanair, but said it could add nothing to his statement that the agency “might or might not” take action against the airline.The OFT said no investigation was under way into the company, which in 2007 was one of 13 airlines ordered by the agency to change websites to stop advertising flights for pennies when the true cost was many pounds.The agency began a probe in October into price advertising, focusing on online retail. Areas it will examine include price-comparison sites, “baiting sales” – where only some products are available at discount – and time-limited offers.The OFT has previously said travel companies’ credit and debit card charges are likely to be covered by the investigation.
346;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;US retail;;Thrift, thought John D. Rockefeller, was “essential to well ordered living”. The message from the world’s richest robber baron long ago leached out of American society, but the recession has done what moralising could not – consumers have begun to embrace frugality. Penny pinching does not bode well for US retailers, or investors banking on a recovery in corporate earnings. And snow storms during the last pre-Christmas shopping weekend were one more blow for shopkeepers.Across the Atlantic, hopes for a better UK Christmas were dented by official figures showing UK retail sales volumes fell in November from October, though were still up 3 per cent year-on-year. But the mood remains more upbeat than in the US, where most forecasts suggest retail sales for the holiday period (November and December) will be flat to slightly down on last year’s total depressed by financial panic. Mastercard Advisors’ Spending Pulse report estimates clothing and footwear sales – accounting for more than a third of holiday spending – dropped 3.2 per cent between November 1 and December 12.Underlying that is a shift in consumer behaviour. Over the past decade, holiday spending as a proportion of annual spending has been declining – from 21 per cent in 1999, to less 19 per cent now, notes CreditSights – indicating falling discretionary purchases. At the same time, the proportion of holiday sales made over the Thanksgiving weekend when discounts are prevalent has been rising, suggesting greater price sensitivity.The latter point should be of greatest concern. Retailers have so far avoided the panic sales of last year by trimming inventory. Planned sales offer 30-40 per cent off, rather than 70 per cent, and retailers are making greater use of offers that stimulate additional spending. But consumers are becoming conditioned to lower prices just as smartphones will make online price comparisons ever easier. Margins will become harder to protect without sales growth, which requires a better-than-lacklustre economic recovery.So equity investors should consider that earnings for consumer discretionary stocks typically rebound the strongest for any sector – by an average two-thirds for the last five recessions, calculates Barclays Capital. If Americans are becoming more frugal, expectations for recovery may be rather too optimistic.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
347;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;US retailers hope for last-minute gift buying;;With only a few shopping days left before Christmas, the US holiday shopping season is shaping up to be in line with most retailers’ conservative forecasts. Stores are avoiding last year’s desperate discounting, but seeing at best only small improvements in sales.Underlining the continuing caution, Mastercard Advisors’ Spending Pulse report estimates that clothing and footwear sales – which account for more than a third of holiday spending – fell 3.2 per cent between November 1 and December 12.After last year’s Wall Street crash, most leading retailers reported double-digit sales drops as consumer demand collapsed, leaving them awash with additional inventory. This year, retailers entered the season with sharply reduced inventory, allowing them to avoid the 70 to 80 per cent discounts that hit last year.The weakness in clothing and in footwear continue to contrast with the more robust performance of consumer electronics sales – accounting for about 10 per cent of retail spending – which rose 4.4 per cent over the same November 1 to December 12 period.Online sales, which account for only about 7 per cent of total US retail sales, have also returned to double-digit growth levels, increasing by 13.3 per cent, with the rate of sales rising in the first part of December.Kamalesh Rao of Spending Pulse said that the spending data suggested the overall picture remained “mixed”.“I would say that the overall growth rates are improving, but modestly,” he said. “The consumer is still not strongly enthusiastic.”“Most people were expecting a modest improvement from last year, and for the most part that’s what we are seeing,” he said.Spending Pulse bases its projections on actual spending on Mastercard credit, debit and gift cards, combined with projections of spending on other card brands, cash and cheques.Its report also highlighted continued weakness in spending on luxury jewellery, which it estimates as being down by 4.2 per cent since the start of the season. In contrast, total jewellery sales have risen 0.7 per cent.The challenges facing retailers were exacerbated by snow and poor weather that hit Washington DC, Baltimore and other areas on the US east coast on Saturday, threatening hopes for a last-minute surge in gift buying.Several stores have extended their hours to target last-minute shoppers, while most have unleashed a further round of sale promotions. JC Penney kept stores open until midnight on Friday and Saturday, while Macy’s is keeping 12 stores open 24 hours a day until Christmas Eve.
348;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-12-09T22:46:14Z;Vevo could be saviour of music video;;Video may have killed the radio star but some of the music industry’s most senior executives lined up on Tuesday night to declare that online video could be the salvation for stars and labels after a decade of digital mis-steps.The chief executives of Universal Music, Sony Music and EMI Music joined forces with Eric Schmidt, chairman and chief executive of Google, to hail the launch of Vevo, their online music video joint venture, as the best thing for the business since MTV began in 1981.“Vevo is a chance, perhaps the chance to please stop playing defence,” Doug Morris, chairman and chief executive of Universal Music told attendees of the lavish launch party, who included the singers 50 Cent and Lady Gaga. “Vevo is a huge platform, and you know what’s best of all? It’s our platform,” Mr Morris added.Vevo, developed by Google’s YouTube online video sharing site, launched on Tuesday night with content from Universal and Sony. EMI, which signed up at the last minute, will make its videos available in the new year, while Warner Music has yet to agree whether to join.Despite some limitations, including a number of initial technical bugs and no high definition video until next year, executives and artists lavished praise on what they see as a promising venture.Mr Morris said it had already secured “millions of advertising dollars” from brands including AT&T, MasterCard and McDonald’s, which are keen to reach “the most sought-after demographic” of young music fans. Vevo is reportedly pushing for high CPMs – the cost per thousand advertising impressions – of $25 to $40.He hinted that the partners could charge for content in time, saying it would experiment with subscription, e-commerce and other models and – without mentioning Apple’s highly-controlled iTunes store – “we don’t have to ask anyone’s permission”.Rio Caraeff, the Universal executive in charge of the venture, announced new partners including AOL and CBS, which plan to embed Vevo’s technology in their own sites to expand its distribution.Vevo, which has financial backing from the Abu Dhabi Media Company, should benefit from heavy traffic from the start, as Google is effectively moving all full-length professional music videos from YouTube to the new site.It would start with “tens and tens of millions of users”, said Mr Morris, who this week used a Bloomberg interview to confirm that Lucian Grainge, head of Universal’s international operations, would succeed him at the helm of the Vivendi division after 2010.Performers including Mariah Carey and John Mayer underlined Vevo’s potential for reinventing the music video, an art form that has lost its commercial rationale since MTV’s heyday.

For example, Clear2Pay said it helped Wells Fargo cut time taken on its cash transfers out of the US from three days to a few minutes.The deal with Aquiline will give the US private equity group joint control of Clear2Pay with its management, as the two will together own more than 50 per cent.The €50m of new capital is designed to fund the company’s growth and strategic acquisitions until a planned initial public offering in a few years’ time.“We wanted to find a US investor, as that is an important market for us in the future,” said Jurgen Ingels, co-founder and chief financial officer of Clear2Pay.He said the company aimed to generate half its revenues in the US, up from 15 per cent currently.Clear2Pay, which is based in Brussels, employs 450 staff, has grown at 25 per cent annually and is expected to earn €55m of revenues and €4m of profits next year.Aquiline was founded in 2005 by Jeff Greenberg soon after he quit as chief executive and chairman of Marsh & McLennan, the world’s biggest insurance broker.It raised a $1.1bn fund in 2006 and its investments include Ark, the Lloyd’s insurer and BinckBank, the Dutch internet bank.
350;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;US shoppers opt for electronic goods;;US shoppers spent more on consumer electronics and jewellery during November, but less on clothing and luxury goods, according to spending estimates based on credit and debit card receipts from MasterCard Advisors.The overall picture for demand was “mixed”, according to the monthly SpendingPulse report from the professional services arm of MasterCard Worldwide.The data underlined the continued strong demand for must-have new devices, such as smartphones and netbooks, with estimated consumer electronics sales up 6.6 per cent compared with falls last year of about 20 per cent. The sector saw growth of 2.8 per cent in October and 5.8 per cent in September. November’s growth was supported by video game releases and included an 8 per cent increase in sales on the Friday after Thanksgiving compared with last year.The report uses aggregate sales data from MasterCard’s payment system and projections of other cards, cash and cheques, which has led to it being an historically more reliable estimate of general spending than other early spending estimates based on shopper surveys.Sales at speciality clothing retailers fell by 5.7 per cent during the month, on top of the double-digit percentage declines seen last year. The fall came in spite of a 3.4 per cent increase in year-on-year sales in October.Luxury sales were also down, falling an estimated 7.3 per cent during the month on top of double-digit falls last year, in spite of the sector having experienced year-on-year increases in sales in the preceding two months.The SpendingPulse report also highlighted the stronger performance of the jewellery retailers, which showed a 4.6 per cent increase that marked the sector’s third consecutive month of growth. As a result, the sector’s three-month average sales growth turned positive for the first time since July 2008.
351;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-11-30T09:28:52Z;Interchange fees;;The way retailers pay banks when customers spend on plastic is peculiar. Fees are split: the processing bank takes some, with the bulk going to the bank that issued the card. The large networks – Visa and MasterCard, which handle almost three-quarters of US card purchases – do not make revenues from so-called interchange directly. They instead charge banks individually negotiated licence and processing fees. But it is the networks that set the interchange fee, typically between 1.5 and 2 per cent of a transaction’s value.Enter the Government Accountability Office which, at the urging of politicians, has cast an eye over the US market. Overall fees have risen – which the networks attribute to increased card usage. Retailers, meanwhile, argue that the rise reflects the networks’ pricing power and the growth of higher-fee payment methods, such as reward cards. The GAO, at least, has found signs of rising credit card fee levels and more complex pricing structures, although this may overlook the growth of lower-fee debit payments.This is a market with something for everyone, though. Consumers enjoy convenience and lower-cost cards, while retailers gain from increased customer spending and lower processing costs. However, the networks are setting a price that they neither pay nor keep as revenues. And the GAO acknowledges that more competition between networks may actually have increased prices as networks fought over affluent cardholders. Interchange, after all, forms part of networks’ marketing when persuading banks to issue their cards. Higher fees for card issuers means more money to win cardholders and develop products.There seems little basis for intervention here, even with Congress in a mood to meddle. Moreover, international evidence suggests that shoppers do not necessarily benefit from caps on fees. Indeed, they may suffer as banks’ interest rates rise to compensate. Interchange should be a long way down regulatory to-do lists.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
352;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-11-24T01:23:38Z;US shoppers wait for sales;;US shopping patterns for early November suggest budget-conscious consumers are holding back their Christmas spending, while waiting to be enticed by special events such as this weekend’s post-Thanksgiving sales.Sales data for the first two weeks of November compiled by MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse report showed a weakening of clothing and luxury goods sales that had shown signs of year-on-year improvement in October.Speciality clothing store sales, for instance, fell 5 per cent against the same period last year, when they saw a double-digit percentage drop. Last month, clothing sales rose 3.4 per cent, against similarly poor numbers from last year.Luxury goods sales fell 9.2 per cent during the first two weeks of the month, in spite of tracking the collapse in luxury selling of a year ago. In October, luxury sales were up 6.6 per cent against the previous year.SpendingPulse estimates are based on aggregate spending data from MasterCard credit and debit cards, and projections of other forms of spending, including other cards, cash and cheques.Kamelesh Rao, director of economic research at SpendingPulse, said the overall data suggested that “the consumer is still somewhat cautious about spending”.“The consumer spending environment has essentially been on a plateau since the summer,” he said.But the data also lent support to the theory that shoppers are this year playing a waiting game with retailers, holding out in expectation of the kind of extreme promotional price cutting that characterised last year’s post-crash Christmas.Robert Drbul, retail analyst at Barclay’s Capital, said in a note to clients on Monday that stores had seen a slow early November, which he attributed to “event shopping” - with consumers holding out for promotional offers ahead of events such as the annual post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales.Mr Drbul predicted “very heavy traffic and discounting” during the Thanksgiving sales, followed by another lull as shoppers wait again for pre-Christmas price cuts.“Consumers will again likely wait for additional aggressive discounting and promotional activity during the last 7-10 days leading up to Christmas, as a search for deals and values continues,” he said.A survey of 3,400 consumers for retail consultants at AlixPartners, conducted in the first week of November, also found that 55 per cent of those surveyed intended “to wait for sales and specials” before buying.The National Retail Federation said on Monday that a survey of more than 8,000 shoppers indicated that the number of customers planning to visit stores for Friday’s post-Thanksgiving sales would climb 4.6 per cent from last year to 134m. One in 10 respondents said they planned to visit stores between midnight and 3am in search of early bargains.In an indication of the intensely competitive mood, Target, the mass discounter, announced on Monday that it would offer customes $10 store gift cards for every $100 they spend this Friday morning – an unprecedented move for the retailer.
353;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard profits boosted by cost cuts;;MasterCard, the world’s second-largest payments network, on Tuesday reported a third-quarter profit as the company raised its prices and cut costs.Net income was $452.2m, or $3.45 a diluted share, compared with a loss of $193.6m, or $1.48 a share a year before, that stemmed from the settlement of an antitrust suit, the company said on Tuesday in a statement.MasterCard saw some benefits from consumers’ continuing shift from cash and cheques to debit and credit cards, with price increases for its payment processing services helping to boost revenue growth by 2 per cent to $1.4bn. Processed transactions grew 7.6 per cent in the quarter to 5.8bn boosted by a greater use of credit and debit cards in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Latin America.The bulk of the payment processor’s income boost came from cost-cutting, however, as MasterCard reduced general and administrative expenses by 7.9 per cent, and advertising and marketing expenses by 29.4 per cent year on year. The company’s operating margin, excluding special items, was 49.4 per cent for the third quarter of 2009. This was up 8.8 percentage points over the same quarter last year.Bob Selander, chief executive of MasterCard, acknowledged in an interview that such income growth would be difficult to sustain.“Our net income growth of almost 40 per cent year-on-year was driven through margin expansion. There was some modest growth in revenue but the biggest contribution came through expense reduction,” he said.“It’s hard to deliver and sustain that kind of income growth in an environment of slow revenue growth, but we do see some improvements beginning to show through in US spending patterns.”Excluding sales of cars and petrol, which have been volatile due to the end of the US cash-for-clunkers programme and oil price fluctuations, US retail sales have started to increase in recent months, signalling growing consumer confidence in the state of the US economy.“I believe the worst is behind us and there are certainly some encouraging signs in the recent economic data,” said Mr Selander.Red Gillen, senior analyst at Celent, a consultancy, said: “MasterCard’s earnings announcement shows that old-fashioned cost-cutting will likely help pull it through the recession. Cutting costs is not as sexy as the launch of a flashy new payments technology, but it certainly contributes more directly to the bottom line.”Shares in MasterCard fell 3.97 per cent on Tuesday to $213.81.
354;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Regulation: Reasons to be cheerful about cross-border payments;;The euro gave much of Europe a single currency. So the idea that payments across borders should be as easy as those made domestically would seem a natural corollary. Unfortunately, life is rarely straightforward. As most travellers in Europe know, debit cards issued in one country are not always welcomed in another.Trying to arrange to pay regular bills from an account in a different country can be anything from difficult to impossible. The question is, will this situation improve?There are some reasons to be optimistic. The European Union’s Payment Service Directive, passed in 2007 after some controversy, needs to be implemented in all member states by next month.This piece of legislation seeks to do two things. First, it aims to create a harmonised legal framework to support an integrated payments market so that cross-border credit and debit transfers become smoother and cheaper.Second, it creates a “payment institution” licence for non-bank payment service providers, with passporting rights allowing them to operate across the EU. To gain such authorisation, institutions must meet capital and governance requirements – and anyone who does not hold a PI is barred from providing payment services unless they are either a “PI agent” or a “waived PI”.PI agents – which can range from petrol stations to pharmacies – are independent third parties that can be used by PIs, but for which PIs are fully responsible. Countries can waive authorisation and capital requirements for “small” PIs, but there will be strict limits on how much business these “waived PIs” can do.As so often with EU directives, not all member states will be ready by the implementation deadline: half-a-dozen countries are thought likely to miss the November date. Some of the detailed measures in the directive are also only due to be phased in over the following months and years.But even if progress is rather uneven, some service providers are already claiming that the new PSD framework could offer consumers big benefits, particularly in terms of access to convenient payment facilities. “There will be huge consequences for consumers,” says AJ Hanna, senior vice-president at Western Union Financial Services, for example, which plans to add 15,000 new payment outlets in about eight EU countries and Switzerland over the coming years through agreements with Lagardere Services, Ortel Finance and PayUp. “Retail networks can now offer simple payment services.”The harmonised legal framework established by the Payment Services Directive is also laying the foundation for another European payments project: the so-called Single Euro Payment Area, or Sepa.Sepa is a private-sector initiative, developed by Europe’s banks but heavily backed by both the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Its core concept is that electronic payments made across the euro area – whether by bank transfer, direct debit, credit or debit card – should become as straightforward as domestic payments, thanks to the adoption of common processing standards and systems.Sepa was formally launched in respect of credit transfers almost two years ago – in January 2008 – and direct debit changes, after some slippage, were scheduled to come on stream next month.But from the start, the devil has been in the detail. From the outset, Sepa was never entirely comprehensive. Back in early-2008, about 4,000 banks had signed up – or about 50 per cent of the banks in the region, although they did speak for a larger proportion of transactions, estimated at about 80 per cent.More seriously, perhaps, by July 2009, only 4.4 per cent of all credit transfers were using Sepa standards, prompting EU officials to acknowledge that, while the banking industry had drawn up the appropriate rulebooks, migration to the new standards was “lagging”.Explanations for that slow progress are various. Some say that the entire project has suffered from being driven more by political objectives than market demand. Others put the blame on uncertainties stemming from EU competition policy.Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, warned at the beginning that Sepa should not be used by banks as an excuse to raise prices. One of her main concerns was that banks operating national card schemes could be sucked into more expensive international networks, because of a desire to provide consumers with pan-European functionality.There are two services that can cover all 32 Sepa countries (the EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Monaco and Switzerland) – Visa and Mastercard. But they have been in dispute with Ms Kroes over whether their charging structures for cross-border transactions were anti-competitive because they unjustifiably inflated the cost of card acceptance by retailers.The Mastercard situation has been largely resolved (although the card company is still appealing to the European courts over principles at stake). Matters at Visa are less clear.This uncertainty has been seized on by some banks. The French National Sepa committee, for example, announced a one-year delay in implementing Sepa direct debits last May, saying these would come in only by November 2010, not 2009.It gave two reasons: a delay in passing the national law to meet the Payment Service Directive, and “the need for further investigation and clarification of the economics of the new interchange fee levies”.One big question now is whether EU officials will set deadlines for moving credit transfers and direct debits to the Sepa systems. Charlie McCreevy, EU internal market commissioner, has acknowledged that this would provide certainty, and incentivise migration. A public consultation launched by the commission also showed that a large majority was broadly in support. The commission has said it will discuss the matter with member states before taking a decision.
355;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:21:43+0000;Mobile payments: phones as wallets gain critical mass;;"The idea of using a mobile phone to pay for goods and services is gaining a critical mass as people move to smarter handsets and use them in increasingly sophisticated ways.Extra momentum is supplied by companies from Microsoft to MasterCard who are piling in with mobile money initiatives.Several mobile financial services are already available – banking, app store transactions, topping up phone credits, and paying for parking among them – but the big prize is the retail market. Visa, for example, says that face-to-face transactions form 90 per cent of its business in Europe, making mobile point-of-sale services an obvious and potentially lucrative extension of its model.“The mobile phone will eventually replace plastic,” says Dan Salmons, director of payment innovations at Barclaycard, the UK-based payment business of Barclays Group. “By 2012 it will be normal to pay with the phone, and in five to 10 years, it is completely reasonable to think plastic will be relegated to a secondary function.”Cash could be replaced, too, by services aimed at using mobile devices for small purchases.Parts of the world are forging ahead or carrying out trials: in Japan, 30m mobile subscribers already use a payment system called Mobile FeliCa, based on Sony technology and developed by NTT DoCoMo. In Europe, O2 worked with Visa and Barclaycard on a trial in 2007 and 2008 in which 500 people used their phones instead of Oyster cards on transport systems and in place of credit cards in participating retailers.In Austria, Mobilkom operates the second-largest non-cash payment service in the country, after the Maestro card. And Orange has committed itself to rolling out widescale mobile payment services in several markets, including a pan-operator service in France and an exclusive deal with Barclaycard in the UK.All of these projects are for point-of-sale transactions and rely, at least in part, on near-field communications technology: a chip provides a radio signal that acts as a secure bridge between a phone and a payment terminal at a retailer. The handset is waved in front of a machine to make the system work.Typically, transactions should take no more than half a second, says Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile for Visa Europe.But some experts are wondering which way the market will go. NFC chips can also be embedded in traditional cards, and a recent survey from Gartner revealed that consumers ranked mobile payments as one of the least interesting functions that they would want on a phone. They preferred things such as location-based services.“It’s a niche that doesn’t really seem to interest consumers,” says Nick Jones, a vice president at Gartner Research.There is also technical and organisational complexity to be faced. Alastair Lukies, chief executive of mobile banking provider Monitise, says: “You need interoperability across the whole supply chain, but frankly the mobile chain is one of the most complex I’ve ever seen.”On top of a sizable investment in software, the NFC route also requires investment in chips in handsets and special readers at the point of sale. To date, only one large manufacturer, Nokia, has been rolling out NFC-enabled phones; others have scaled back plans.Meanwhile, companies such as Accells and Neomedia claim to offer “NFC-like” services, with Accells using radio technology present in most handsets and Neomedia taking a barcode-reading approach.“In the last 15 years there have been many new instruments and technologies developed for electronic payments, but just a handful of them have actually been deployed,” notes Jan Manten, chief executive of payments provider GlobalCollect.In some smaller markets, successful mobile money initiatives have been implemented already. Mobilkom has made €50m in mobile payment revenues so far in 2009, a growth of more than 30 per cent on the year before. Hannes Ametsreiter, group chief executive of Telekom Austria, says the services have been “very profitable”.The operator offers various payment options from the use of codes, through NFC in handsets where available, to a credit card launched with Visa, called the A1, which allows customers to earn points which can be redeemed against the purchase of new devices and other mobile items. When a transaction is made, users also automatically receive texts of the details to ensure the card number is not getting used without their knowledge.Operators in bigger markets admit they cannot manage m-payments schemes on their own. “Mobile operators are not banks,” says Mung Ki Woo, VP overseeing mobile payments at Orange.Instead, they are seeking gradual approaches into financial services. O2 Money, launched with Visa, is a pre-paid card service: cash is transferred on to the card, which is then used like a credit or debit card. Again, users receive texts detailing transactions.MasterCard, the credit card company, has been rolling out MoneySend, currently available in 19 markets, to enable mobile money transfers; and PayPal and Western Union are active in the mobile money transfer area.The numbers for mobile banking remain small, however: 25.6m people worldwide have used some form of mobile banking at least once, according to ABI Research.Similarly, NFC services are being held back by the retail side. A number of businesses have only just made investments in chip-and-pin terminals, and some analysts say that in the current climate another upgrade could prove to be a hard sell.Payment providers claim there is steady progress in this area, led by larger retailers that focus on heavy footfall in peak times, such as sandwich and coffee shops. “Key brands are rolling out contactless in their networks, and we are in advanced conversations with other well known brands,” says Mr Salmons of Barclaycard.One selling point has been the promise of more innovative reward and loyalty schemes for customers using the mobile channel rather than the highly encrypted financial network.At the same time, retailers are experimenting with alternative methods. In September Starbucks launched an iPhone application that lets customers purchase their lattes and muffins with the click of a button. Using technology from a start-up called Billing Revolution, credit card details are entered once and can then be used for all purchases, including those with other merchants: Billing Revolution claims that a partnership with Authorize.net has now plugged 200,000 retailers into its network."

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq slipped a faraction lower to 2,139.14. The Dow closed 0.2 per cent higher at 9,885.80 and touched a new intra-day high for the year.Among stocks in the spotlight, Black & Decker jumped 7.6 per cent to $50.82 after the company raised its third-quarter outlook, thanks to better sales and a weaker dollar. Barclays began coverage of the company with an Overweight rating and a price target of $55.In deal activity, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, agreed to buy Proteolix, a private company, for up to $810m. Shares in Onyx rose 5.1 per cent to $28.26.The third quarter earnings season starts in earnest this week and leading companies due with results include Intel and Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday; JPMorgan on Wednesday; while on Thursday, Goldman Sachs, Google, Merck, IBM, Citi, and Advanced Micro Devices report. The week is rounded off with earnings from Bank of America, General Electric, Halliburton and Mattel.ThomsonReuters estimates the earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies for the third quarter at minus 24.6 per cent. The estimated rate has been revised lower from 2.6 per cent at the start of the year, then minus 17.2 per cent at the beginning of April, and minus 20.9 per cent at the start of July.“The Financials sector (+58 per cent) is anticipating the highest earnings growth rate for the quarter, while the materials (-65 per cent), energy (-65 per cent), and industrials (-45 per cent) sectors are expecting the lowest,” say analysts at ThomsonReuters.While a negative quarter would extend Corporate America’s current run to nine consecutive quarterly profit declines, much attention will focus on an expected rebound in earnings next year.As a result, guidance from companies looms as being the key driver of sentiment for equities.“The most critical news is likely to be centred on initial guidance to next year’s business activity and its impact on the bottom line,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“With Street consensus bottom-up earnings growth projected to climb 26 per cent to 27 per cent year over year in 2010, there is not that much room for conservative outlook statements which may be deemed disappointing,” said Mr Levkovich.ThomsonReuters estimates earnings growth rates for the S&P 500 of 192 per cent for the fourth quarter, which benefits from an easy comparison with the fourth quarter of 2008. That is followed by a 34 per cent rise in earnings for the first quarter of 2010.The positive start for equities on Monday was also a function of various brokerage upgrades.Shares in MasterCard rose 0.7 per cent to $216, and Visa gained 1 per cent to $73.70, after they were upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” by Credit Suisse. The bank’s price target for MasterCard was raised from $210 to $255, while Visa was increased from $70 to $84.“An improvement in spending volumes should translate into improving revenue growth in the coming quarters which will increase investor confidence in a higher long term earnings growth rate,” said the bank. “Moreover, the secular shift from cash to plastic continues.”Over at UBS, shares in Advanced Micro Deviceswere raised from “neutral” to “buy” and th chipmaker closed up 0.4 per cent at $29.85.UBS also upgraded Amgen to a “buy” from a “neutral” rating. The stock rose 0.2 per cent to $59.51. Shares in Infosys dropped 0.8 per cent to $47.37 and pared an early rise after Wells Fargo upgraded the company. Abercrombie & Fitch rallied 2.3 per cent to $35.63 after the retailer was upgraded to a “buy”, while Occidental Petroleum rose 1 per cent to $80.31, in spite of being reduced from “buy” to “hold” by Citigroup. The bank lowered the target price for Oxy from $82 to $74.Meanwhile, KB Homes dropped 7.8 per cent to $15.17, after the home builder said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating possible accounting and disclosure issues.Shares in Google were up 1.7 per cent at $525.02.

The stock rose 2.6 per cent to $69.47, pushing it up 1.5 per cent this week.Constellation Energy beat estimates and raised its earnings forecast for the full year. The power company’s shares dropped 1.1 per cent to $28.70.Also exceeding its forecasts, Dominion Resources recorded a 52 per cent rise in net income but cut its outlook. The stock fell 2.1 per cent to $33.80.After the closing bell on Thursday, Walt Disney reported a 26 per cent slide in third quarter earnings. The stock slid 4.2 per cent to $25.12 and analysts at JP Morgan downgraded Disney on Friday.The S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to close at 987.48, having risen 0.7 per cent to a high of 993.18 earlier. That left the benchmark up 0.8 per cent for the week, and 7.4 per cent higher for July.The Nasdaq Composite slipped in late trade on Friday, closing down 0.3 per cent at 1,978.50, for a weekly climb of 0.6 per cent and a monthly rise of 7.8 per cent.Both the S&P and Nasdaq have rallied for each of the past five months and this week the main benchmarks set highs for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2 per cent higher at 9,171.61 on Friday, a gain of 0.9 per cent this week. For July, blue chips jumped 8.6 per cent, the best month since a rise of 10.6 per cent in October 2002.The rise in shares on Friday came after the advance read on US gross domestic product for the second quarter showed a contraction of 1 per cent. That was better than the forecast decline of 1.5 per cent.Economists said this indicated that the recession was abating, clearing the way for a modest expansion during the third quarter.That outlook has powered the equity market’s rally in recent weeks, but some worry that the market is due for a pullback. “There is a lot of money moving off the sidelines into the market, chasing performance,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos. “The stock market is getting ahead of itself.”Caution over the economic outlook was provided by the GDP report which showed that consumer spending slipped 1.2 per cent during the second quarter, more than a forecast drop of 0.5 per cent.“With consumers still flat on their backs, it will be a long time before the recovery gains any real momentum,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.Meanwhile, downward revisions to past quarters also weighed on sentiment.GDP for the first quarter is now seen to have fallen 6.4 per cent, more than an earlier decline of 5.5 per cent, while fourth quarter GDP is now pegged at a 1.9 per cent decline, versus a prior drop of 0.8 per cent. But investors are banking that companies, which have focused on drastic cost cutting this year, will benefit quickly from a pick-up in the economy.“The reversal of the safe haven trade we have seen on Wall Street for the past three months is set to start playing out on Main Street,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “It’s not just the lean and mean companies, but also those consumers who have saved and delayed buying products. There is a lot of pent-up demand.”From a trading perspective, the S&P 500 has room to rally beyond resistance just above 1,000 and possibly approach 1,100, according to some analysts“The 1,100 area on the S&P marks fair value for the market’s move between 1994 and the top in 2007,” said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “These high-value trading areas are like magnets for the market.”Among stocks in the news this week, shares in Yahoo dropped 18.1 per cent to $14.32 after investors knocked the company’s search engine tie-up with Microsoft.General Electric rose 11.4 per cent to $13.40 this week after it indicated that its finance unit did not need additional capital and Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock.Colgate-Palmolive’s profits beat estimates amid cost cutting, and the group maintained guidance for the rest of the year. The stock fell 3.5 per cent to $72.44 this week.MasterCard rose 4.6 per cent to $194.03 after a 26.4 per cent rise in net income for the second quarter. Visa also beat estimates, but dipped 2.7 per cent to $65.46 this week. Dow Chemical recorded a loss of $486m for the quarter, due to charges stemming from its $16.5bn buy-out of Rohm & Haas and weak sales, but beat estimates and rose 4.9 per cent to $21.17 this week.In deals, IBM said it would buy SPSS, a provider of predictive analytics software for $1.2bn or $50 a share. SPSS rose 41 per cent to $49.48 this week, while Big Blue gained 0.2 per cent to $117.93.
358;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-07-30T20:48:52Z;S&P 500 flirts with 1,000 level;;US equity benchmarks closed at new highs for the year on Thursday, with investors optimistic that aggressive cost cutting by companies places them in a very profitable position once the economy recovers.In late trade, the S&P 500 had pulled back from testing the 1,000 level, for the first time since last November as traders awaited Friday’s report on gross domestic product for the second quarter.The Nasdaq Composite briefly breached 2,000 for the first time since last October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly rose 9,200, having been below 9,000 just a week ago.A number of earnings results, although mixed, sustained the rally as many companies continue to beat lowered estimates.“With about half of the S&P 500 having already reported, the number of upside surprises is running at a rate not seen since 1994,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “Companies have exceeded bottom-up expectations by about 14.8 per cent with all major sectors beating analyst’s projections.”Concerns that companies are only beating heavily reduced estimates is being downplayed by some analysts, who are focusing on the potential benefits of tough cost cutting.“Aggressive cost cutting in this recession is positioning US companies in an extremely competitive way and a stronger economy later this year will boost revenues and directly into bottom line profits,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan’s Private Bank.The S&P closed 1.2 per cent higher at 986.75, an eight-month peak. All of the 10 main S&P industry sectors rose, led by a 3 per cent gain for materials and a 2.7 per cent rally in financials.After propelling the Nasdaq above 2,000 for the first time since last October, technology stocks pared gains towards the close. The Nasdaq closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,984.30, taking its gain this year to nearly 26 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to close at 9,154.46.After the closing bell Walt Disney reported a 26 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings and in after-hours trade the stock was off 1.5 per cent at $25.5.Shares in General Electric, a Dow component, rallied 6.9 per cent higher to $13.11 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the conglomerate. Blue chips were led higher by Dupont, up 4.3 per cent at $30.81, 3M, firmer by 1.7 per cent at 69.90 and Caterpillar, higher by 3.8 per cent at $43.41.Stronger metal prices helped miners and Alcoa gained 4.1 per cent to finish at $11.46.Dragging on the Dow was Exxon Mobil, whose second-quarter earnings fell 66 per cent to $3.95bn and quarterly revenue dropped 46 per cent to $74.46bn. The stock slipped 1 per cent to $70.72, up from an earlier low of $69.91.Another Dow member reporting yesterday was Travelers, which posted a 21 per cent drop in earnings, below analysts’ forecasts. While the insurer, boosted its 2009 operating earnings outlook, the stock fell 1.6 per cent to $41.94.Elsewhere, Colgate-Palmolive saw its profits beat estimates for the second quarter amid cost cutting. The consumer staples company maintained guidance for the rest of the year. Sales fell 5.5 per cent to $3.75bn for the quarter and the stock lost 5.3 per cent to $71.83.MasterCard recorded a 26.4 per cent rise in net income for the second quarter, and net revenue rose 2.7 per cent to $1.3bn. Its shares rallied 3 per cent to $194.11 and the results came after Visa beat earnings estimates late Wednesday. Shares in Visa were 0.6 per cent higher at $67.21.Meanwhile, Dow Chemical recorded a loss of $486m for the quarter, due to charges stemming from its $16.5bn buy-out of Rohm & Haas and weak sales. Revenue fell 31 per cent to $11.32bn, down from $16.35bn for the same period a year earlier.The results were better than estimates and the stock rose 6.2 per cent to $21.53.Motorola reported a small profit, which surprised analysts, who were expecting a quarterly loss. Sales fell to $5.5bn from $8bn and its shares gained 9.4 per cent to $7.19.NYSE Euronext, swung to a loss in the second quarter as the exchange took a charge related to NYSE Life Clearing. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $27.21.For the third quarter running, Kodak reported a loss, with earnings falling $189m, while sales dropped 29 per cent to $1.77bn. Kodak declined 10.4 per cent to $2.94.Shares in Symantec dropped 14.3 per cent to $14.78, after the security software maker posted weaker than forecast fiscal first quarter earnings as sales dropped 13 per cent to $1.43bn, also below estimates.Akamai dropped 19 per cent to $16.51 after the company’s revenues missed estimates.
359;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Higher fees help MasterCard;;MasterCard, the world’s second largest payments network, on Thursday reported higher second-quarter earnings as the company raised the fees it charges banks and cut expenses.Together with rival Visa, which on Wednesday reported strong results for its fiscal third quarter, MasterCard also benefited from a worldwide secular shift away from cash and cheques as consumers turn toward the convenience of electronic payments. This shift has helped both companies weather the effects of a global recession that has reduced overall consumer spending.MasterCard’s second-quarter profits jumped 26.4 per cent year on year to $349m, or $2.67 per diluted share, as the company raised the fees it charges to process transactions.It also cut jobs, and advertising and marketing costs. The cuts contributed to about 30 per cent of the profit increase.Visa on Wednesday reported that net income growth had risen by 72 per cent year on year to $729m, or 97 cents a share.MasterCard and rival Visa have been insulated from the rising credit card losses that have affected banks’ card businesses because the companies process transactions but do not lend to consumers.However, they have had to tackle lower spending as consumers and businesses tighten their belts in the global recession. Spending volumes also contracted as a result of the appreciating US dollar, lower gas prices and slowing cross-border travel.Bob Selander, chief executive of MasterCard, said: “We continue to see the economic downturn affect consumer and business spending.”Both companies reported that overall dollar spending volumes were down, by 9.3 per cent at MasterCard and by 7 per cent at Visa. The contraction was most pronounced in the US, where consumers and businesses spent almost 10 per cent less on their MasterCard-branded credit, debit and charge cards. The number of processed transactions rose in the US and across the globe, however, as consumers increasingly used their cards – instead of cash or cheques – for smaller-ticket purchases.The total number of transactions processed by Visa was 10.3bn in the quarter, an 8 per cent increase year-on-year.At MasterCard, the number of processed transactions grew by 7.9 per cent to 5.6bn.“Spending on big-ticket luxury items is down by up to 20 per cent in some regions. Consumers are spending on things they have to have and not on things they would like to have,” said Mr Selander.He added that the decline in big-ticket purchases had disproportionately affected the use of credit cards.
360;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa boosted by increased reliance on cards;;Visa, the world’s largest electronic payments network, on Wednesday reported higher third-quarter profit as consumers increasingly turned to credit, debit and charge cards to pay for goods and services.Net income grew 73 per cent to $729m, or 97 cents a share, in the three months ending June 30, from $422m, or 51 cents a share a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Excluding the impact from the sale of the company’s stake in VisaNet do Brasil, adjusted quarterly net income was $507m, or 67 cents per share.Visa said consumers spent less during the quarter as the global recession inspired greater thriftiness, resulting in a 7 per cent decline in year-on-year cash volumes to $969bn.However, the number of processed transactions grew as consumers increasingly used their cards in preference to cash or cheques. The total number of processed transactions was 10.3bn in the quarter, an 8 per cent increase year-on-year.Visa and rival Mastercard have been insulated from the rising credit card losses that have affected banks’ card businesses because the companies process transactions but do not lend to consumers. They have also weathered the effects of a global recession that has reduced overall consumer spending because they have benefited from a worldwide shift away from cash and cheques towards the convenience of electronic payments.Total cards carrying the Visa brand rose 6 per cent worldwide over the prior year to 1.7bn.Joe Saunders, chief executive of Visa, said: “With little real improvement in the economic backdrop, Visa still posted solid operational and financial performance results during the fiscal third quarter.”The network said it expected net annual revenue growth of high single digits in 2009 and at the lower end of the 11 per cent to 15 per cent range in 2010, along with annual free cash flow of more than $1bn.Visa’s shares fell 1.74 per cent to $66.78 in after-hours trading. The stock is up 27 per cent for the year to date.Visa announced its results two days after Mr Saunders shook up the company’s management structure, with John Morris stepping down as president to take a different role until he leaves at the end of this year. Visa said the reorganisation was intended to “heighten organisational effectiveness”.In the new structure, the company’s global sales, client service, marketing, product development and innovation functions are consolidated under the leadership of John Partridge, chief operating officer.
361;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-07-26T22:36:14Z;PayPal plots offline expansion;;Ebay’s PayPal is laying the groundwork for what it hopes will be a massive expansion that could bring its service out of cyberspace and into bricks-and-mortar retail locations around the globe.With the introduction of its Adaptive Payments platform, which will allow software developers to create payment-processing applications for mobile phones and social networking sites, the company hopes for a wave of innovation that could transform offline commerce.Through wider deployment of touch-screen interfaces, biometric technologies and mobile phone payment “wallets”, the group envisions a world where consumers use PayPal to buy everything from cinema tickets to after-work drinks.Initially, the platform will embed PayPal into a range of applications on services such as Facebook and Twitter, and on mobile devices, such as the iPhone.This alone could reap immediate benefits. PayPal has said it expects revenues to double in the next two years, from $2.4bn to $5bn, though much of that growth will come from expansion of current services.In the long term, PayPal’s goal is to capture a larger slice of the global payments market, which is dominated by major credit card companies.“The real holy grail for PayPal is being able to move to the physical world, and being an accepted mark at a physical retail location,” said Bruce Cundiff, director of payments research at Javelin Strategy & Research.This will be no easy task. Credit card companies overshadow PayPal in the offline world. PayPal’s $60bn in total payment volume is just 1 per cent of the total volume processed by Visa and MasterCard combined. And a new payments infrastructure will be needed to complement, or possibly replace, the credit card terminal.But by making its service more widely available, PayPal is seeking to create a ecosystem comparable to those maintained by the credit card companies. “What they’re doing now is a real attempt to replicate the Visa and MasterCard model,” said Mr Cundiff. “They want to make that growth exponential.”
362;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-07-06T09:10:31Z;Citigroup unveils Asia chiefs;;Citigroup on Monday named Stephen Bird and Shirish Apte as chief executives of its Asia-Pacific operations, replacing Ajay Banga, who last month announced he was stepping down to join MasterCard.The US bank has also appointed Shengman Zhang, a former World Bank managing director, as chairman for Asia Pacific. Mr Zhang will be charged with forging and expanding relationships with clients, regulators, government officials and employees in the region.All three bankers will report to Vikram Pandit, Citigroup’s chief executive.Mr Bird and Mr Apte will be jointly responsible for the bank’s performance, strategy and execution in Asia. Mr Bird will be in charge of northern Asia including Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea while Mr Apte will head the southern Asian businesses, which include Australia, Singapore and India. Both bankers have extensive experience in emerging markets.The US bank operates in 18 countries in Asia and nearly 30 per cent of Citigroup’s total revenues in 2008 came from Asia.Mr Bird, 42, served as head of operations and technology in Latin America before moving to Asia, where he was most recently chief executive of north Asia and head of consumer banking and global cards for Asia Pacific.Mr Apte, 56, was most recently chief executive of the bank’s central and eastern European operations.Citigroup on Monday also named Bill Mills and Alberto Verme as chief executives for Europe, Middle East and Africa. Mr Mills, 53, will be responsible for the bank’s operation in western Europe and Africa while Mr Verme, 51, for central and eastern Europe and the Middle East.
363;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-06-26T17:48:24Z;Citi faces retail sales ban in Japan;;Citigroup suffered a fresh setback when Japan’s financial regulator banned it from selling retail financial products for a month after finding the US group had failed to take sufficient measures to prevent suspicious transactions, including money laundering.The Financial Services Agency told Citi to revamp its governance, internal controls and management structure, and has barred it from advertising retail banking products or soliciting retail business in Japan during the ban, which begins on July 15.The penalty is a major embarrassment for the group, which was forced to shut its Japanese private banking business in 2004 after it was accused of breaking rules and having lax controls.The FSA’s action comes just days after Ajay Banga, the head of Citi’s Asia-Pacific arm, announced he was moving to MasterCard, leaving Citi without a leader in the region.Citi is shrinking its presence in Japan, which it once regarded as a major market, by selling businesses to bolster its battered balance sheet and repay billions of dollars in US government aid.The FSA said Citi had failed to implement an improvement plan it had submitted to the FSA five years ago, when it was instructed to adopt stronger internal controls. The FSA said the lack of compliance showed Citi executives “…lack an understanding of the rules applied in Japan, such as laws and regulations, and an awareness of improvement”.The breach of Japanese rules came to light after Citi reported a suspicious bank account, which it believed might be connected to laundering. The group investigated with the regulator and uncovered more accounts – said to be fewer than 500 – that were suspected of being linked to criminal entities.The FSA said Citi had failed to develop adequate control systems for the detection, monitoring and follow-up of suspicious deals. Citi’s system relied on a database of extremely limited input that had not been updated since 2004, the FSA said.Citi said it took the FSA action “very seriously”. It said it was “committed to focus all necessary resource to implement every necessary measure to prevent further occurrence”.
364;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-06-21T20:34:10Z;Citi faces uncertainty after departure;;Citigroup’s business in Asia-Pacific, the bank’s fastest-growing region, faces a period of uncertainty following the resignation of its top executive after just 15 months in the post.Ajay Banga shocked colleagues by announcing on Friday evening in New York he is to join MasterCard as president and chief operating officer. He is in line to become chief executive of the credit card company next year.Mr Banga is a close confidant of Vikram Pandit, Citi chief executive, and was head of the bank’s Asia-Pacific operations – which contributed 30 per cent of group revenues in 2008.The 49-year-old, who joined Citi in 1996, was credited with making decisions that helped to unite and drive the bank’s sprawling collection of businesses. A successor has not been named.His sudden departure leaves Citi exposed in Asia while its rivals try to capitalise on perceptions that it could have to give up market share in the wake of its rescue last year by the US government.In an interview with the Financial Times last month, Mr Banga insisted that the bank was committed to Asia and planned to expand lending across the region.However, he cautioned that Citi’s revenues in the region would be under strain this year, given the “challenging” economic backdrop and uncertainty over the sustainability of the stock market recovery.Mr Banga could not be reached for comment. However, in an e-mail sent to staff over the weekend, seen by the Financial Times, he confessed to “agonising” over his decision to leave.He urged staff to give “unstinted support” to Mr Pandit and his senior colleagues because they were “very deeply committed” to taking Citi forward.Citi insiders said Mr Banga was attracted to the possibility of becoming a chief executive of a leading multinational company.However, they added that his sudden move was also because he did not feel part of the inner circle of executives around Mr Pandit.Mr Pandit’s closest lieutenants have all come from Morgan Stanley, his own former employer, or other outside companies.Mr Banga’s resignation is also a blow to Citi at a time when it is striving to retain and motivate its top bankers. After 10 banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, repaid government bail-out funds last week, Citi is one of the few large institutions still tied to government aid.That makes it subject to strict federal controls on compensation – a situation that is worrying some of its senior bankers.As a senior Citi executive, a large chunk of Mr Banga’s compensation was deferred last year.MasterCard is paying Mr Banga a $4.2m signing-on fee and stock and options worth about $7m.
365;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-06-19T22:59:17Z;Banga leaves Citi for MasterCard;;Ajay Banga, the head of Citigroup’s Asia-Pacific operations, is leaving the beleaguered global bank to take the number-two job at MasterCard, the companies announced on Friday.Mr Banga, 49, will be president and chief operation officer at the credit card company, reporting to Robert Selander, MasterCard’s chief executive.MasterCard said Mr Banga would manage customer relationships in international and US markets, as well as the company’s marketing, technology and operations.According to MasterCard Mr Selander identified Mr Banga as part of a search for the next generation of leadership. Mr Selander, 58, has been chief executive since 1997, and has a contract that extends through 2010.Mr Banga joined Citi in 1996, and headed up CitiFinancial and the US Consumer Assets Division from 2000 to 2002. From 2005 to 2008 he was chief executive of Citi’s International Global Consumer Group, which included all credit card and consumer banking operations outside of North America.He had earlier served as president of retail banking in North America. In 2008, he was named chief executive of Citi Asia Pacific.Vikram Pandit, Citi’s chief executive, issued a statement thanking Mr Banga “for his leadership and for the significant contributions he has made to building the great global franchise that Citi is today”.In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Mr Banga said that Citi had no intention of selling its stakes in several Chinese and Indian banks. Citi’s Asia-Pacific operations accounted for 30 per cent of the bank’s revenues last year.Mr Selander said on Friday: “I am very pleased to have Ajay join our senior executive team and partner with me to grow MasterCard’s value to our customers, merchants, consumers and investors.“Ajay’s experience in diverse industries and diverse geographies will reinforce and strengthen our global competencies as electronic payments continue to accelerate worldwide. With his expertise and leadership, we hope to capture even more of the significant global payments opportunity.”
366;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-06-14T23:51:20Z;Retail feels the pinch as consumers rein in spending;;For the world’s luxury market, the first tremors of the trouble to come were felt in the first quarter of last year in the US. In March, Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury US department stores, started to report slowing sales.By the end of the year, caution in the US luxury market had turned into full scale panic. Saks and then Neiman started slashing luxury prices by up to 70 per cent in the run up to the holidays, putting pressure on smaller luxury retailers and brands.After the rapid decline, MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse survey of US retail spending, which is based upon MasterCard’s own data and estimated use of cash, cheque and other payments, estimated that US luxury spending was down 24.6 per cent in April, compared to a year ago. The estimate is in line with the same store sales declines seen at Neiman and Saks in the same month, down 22.5 per cent and 32 per cent respectively.The US economic crisis has turned into a global economic recession, with a knock on impact on luxury sales. But it has not hit all areas of the world as hard, at least not yet, says George Greer, head of European consumer credit and charge products with MasterCard, the global payments company.“The impact worldwide has a regional flow,” he says. “It’s a story of three divergent continents. It started in the US and went over to Europe. But the Asia Pacific region seems at the present time seems to be be faring bettter.”MasterCard’s own data on overall spending on its cards shows payment card use, which is historically increasing, rather than consumer spending. But it still showed the impact of the downturn.In 2008 in the US, for instance, spending showed a 3.5 per cent increase in 2008, compared to the 10.5 per cent seen in 2007. European growth was static at 16 per cent, while in Asia, overall spending growth was up 3 percentage points at 20 per cent. Overall wordwide spending slowed to 10.8 per cent, compared to 14.4 per cent in 2007.Asia also splits between Japan – where the economy remains moribund – and the rest of Asia including China, where overall economic growth has continued to support luxury spending at comparatively higher levels than the rest of the world. The spending patterns are reinforced by consumer confidence assessments. A recent Roper report on global confidence placed China, India and Brazil in the first three positions for confidence, with China registering 80 and Japan 18 on a 100 point scale.Mr Greer notes that there is also evidence of comparative spending strength in some of the fast growth markets of Eastern Europe – similar to the strength seen in China.“Looking at the mainstream spending in Poland and Hungary, they’re not feeling the squeeze. They are remaining buoyant and are a still in a growth mode, as the recession wave seems to be hitting them less strongly, although it might still catch up with them.“MasterCard has also conducted attitudinal research on the changing attitudes of high net worth individuals, looking at attitudes in both the UK and in Russia. Its subjects have accounts with retail private banks, and own more than one home, with half owning homes outside their home country. They travel on business trips nine times a year, and personally six times a year.Overall, Mr Greer says the findings underline the notion that “people are turning their backs on absolute ostentatious wealth. Products that show just wealth and don’t show anything else are not in vogue. They don’t want things that just tell you what’s in the bank balance.”Forty per cent of those responding to the survey said they had been “somewhat affected by the recession,” although Mr Greer says the findings suggests that the group is “a lot more resilient and a lot more confident than everyone else …they are not belt tightening to the same extent as everyone else”.But a higher percentage, he says, are cutting back on their spending on luxury goods. “We are seeing that that 70 per cent of UK’s wealthiest, and 75 per cent of Russia’s wealthiest have said they are spending less on luxury goods, and that they are compromising on their shopping trends.“The response to the crisis, he says, included “staying in, which is the new going out even for the wealthiest consumers”. While transactions in restaurants and bars show a downward trend, “they are spending up to 30 per cent more on better quality food and entertaining at home …it’s become just as important to the affluent as to everyone else.”Back at the US luxury department stores, the impact of this reduced spending on luxury items is continuing. Just last week, Neiman Marcus reported a 25 per cent fall in its comparable revenue during its third quarter. Its chief executive, Burt Tansky, a luxury industry veteran declared that “the greatest obstacle to recover may be the psychology of the times”.He noted that the retailer was working hart to re-accustom its clients to paying the full price for items that had been so heavily discounted in the run up to Christmas. In addition, he argued, there had been a fundamental shift in attitudes after several years in which customers had responded “robustly” to steadily increasing prices in the luxury space.“We believe our customers will be more vigilant about the relationship between price and value. It is no longer the case that price will be separated from absolute value.”
367;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-05-01T20:44:43Z;Oil rise overcomes Wall St bank uncertainty;;"US stocks edged higher on Friday as the rising oil price overcame uncertainty over banks’ balance sheets and Wall Street completed its seventh week of gains in eight.Chevron gained 1.2 per cent to $66.87 even after re­porting a 64 per cent decline in quarterly profit to its lowest level in five years, missing Wall Street’s expectations in the process.Its larger rival Exxon Mobil also saw gains, a day after it reported worse results than expected. Its shares picked up 2 per cent to $68.01.Meanwhile, Conoco Phillips, which last week beat analysts’ expectations with its first-quarter earnings, rose 3.7 per cent to $42.50.During the week, the market managed to shrug off fears over swine flu, a worse contraction in the US economy than expected and a delay in the results of the government’s stress tests on banks to finish higher.The benchmark S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.5 per cent. This was the Nasdaq’s eighth straight week of gains.But banking stocks finished on a low note after reports said the results of the government’s stress tests would be delayed from Monday until Thursday May 7 as banks debated the results and the government considered the best way to release the information.But Bill Webb, deputy chief investment officer of Gluskin Sheff, said: “I think investors are taking some comfort from the fact that the government has come up with a pragmatic process for the stress tests.”The general uncertainty weighed on confidence, which was also hit
by JPMorgan lowering its earnings forecasts for several institutions. Analysts warned: “We expect credit deterioration to persist, led by rising unemployment and continued sharp declines in home prices.”Bank of America closed down 2.6 per cent at $8.70 while Wells Fargo fell 2 per cent to $19.61.Morgan Stanley jumped, however, after John Mack, the chief executive, denied reports the company was looking to buy a regional bank. Its shares rose 9.2 per cent to $25.82.The markets took extra confidence from figures showing that the decline in manufacturing had slowed during April.The S&P 500 and the Dow both rose 0.5 per cent to 877.52 and 8,212.41, respectively. The Nasdaq gained 0.1 per cent to 1,719.20.Equities were also feeling the fall-out from several disappointing earnings announcements, especially in the financial sector.Mastercard became the second leading credit card company in two days to beat analysts’ estimates with its results. It saw some gains on Thursday after better-than- expected results at Visa lifted the sector as a whole but fell back on Friday as investors worried about falling revenues. Its shares lost 5.8 per cent to $172.90.MetLife, the biggest US life insurer, felt the effect of the recent market falls as performance in its investments dragged it to its first quarterly loss since 2001.Even excluding the investment performance, the company made a smaller profit than Wall Street had expected and its shares fell 7.7 per cent to $27.45.Hartford the insurer and financial services company, also suffered from the stock market crash as it was forced to pay out more on policies protecting customers from losses on investment accounts. This took the company to its third straight quarterly loss and its shares fell 7.9 per cent to $10.56.Aon, the insurance broker, was the third company in the sector to report falling revenues from investments. The company increased profits but fell short of analysts’ predictions and the shares lost 13.8 per cent to $36.38.Mr Webb said: “We have seen a lot of volatility this week but stocks have not moved outside of their recent range. It wouldn’t surprise me if the next few years are like this.”"
368;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MasterCard;There are some things money can’t buy;"A rebound in consumer spending would be “priceless”, as MasterCard might put it. The world’s second largest electronic payments network on Friday reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profits. The fall was largely due to the strength of the US dollar but also reflected changing consumer behaviour. In these leaner times, shoppers are holstering their credit cards in favour of spending via debit cards money they actually have – particularly in the US where credit card volumes dropped 14 per cent year on year. As three-quarters of US debit cards carry the logo of Visa, its larger competitor, MasterCard must sit this recession out.It might be in for a long wait. Splashing out on credit requires confidence to return but consumers are unlikely to feel that before bringing current debts under control.

369;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-05-01T18:16:49Z;Deal of the Week: Halifax Cashback credit card;;What’s the deal?A Halifax credit card that pays 1 per cent cashback on supermarket and petrol spending – £1 for every £100 – and 0.5 per cent on other purchases. The Mastercard has no annual fee and an interest rate of 15.9 to 21.9 per cent, depending on how applicants are credit-rated.The higher cashback rate is given on spending at most major supermarkets, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, and Morrisons, and petrol stations such as BP, Shell and Esso.Is this good?Cashback credit cards make sense for anyone who pays off their bill each month. The rebates are tax-free and can be spent on anything – unlike with other reward-style cards.Many cards have cut their cashback amounts recently, typically to 0.5 per cent or less, so Halifax’s 1 per cent deal on everyday purchases of food and fuel makes it one of the best offers available to new customers. The 1 per cent should also be payable on non-food items at supermarkets such as Tesco, says Halifax, although at Marks and Spencer only food tills give the higher rebate.The card can also be used in conjunction with loyalty cards such as Tesco’s Clubcard to earn extra rewards – giving a total of 2 per cent in this case (1 per cent cashback and 1 per cent in shopping vouchers).What’s the catch?Cashback is limited to £150 a year. However, this would still equate to £1,250 of qualifying food and fuel spend a month.Cardholders have to telephone Halifax to claim their rebates, which can only be redeemed in multiples of £15.For users who don’t pay off their bills in full each month, interest costs offset the benefit of the cashback – so these users would be better off with a card with a 0 per cent rate.What’s the alternative?American Express’s Platinum card offers a 5 per cent cashback for the first three months – £5 for every £100 spent. But this high rebate is limited to £2,000 of spending. After the introductory period, it pays between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent, depending on annual spend. However, some retailers won’t accept Amex.Lovemoney.com, a financial website, calculates that someone spending £2,500 on food and fuel and £2,500 on other purchases in a year would earn £37.50 cashback from Halifax, against £32.50 from Amex (after the 5 per cent introductory deal period).Some credit cards offer higher rewards for purchases from individual retailers.

370;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-04-27T20:34:27Z;Wall Street fluctuates on swine flu concerns;;US equities fell on Monday as investors worried about the effects of a potential swine flu pandemic.Many companies fluctuated during the session as Wall Street moved to reflect which sectors could lose and which could benefit from an outbreak after the virus reached New York.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, slumped 13.3 per cent to $4.70, while Delta Air Lines fell 14.3 per cent to $6.75. Investors were worried that travel would be the first industry to suffer if the flu continued to spread, and the Bloomberg US Airlines index suffered its heaviest intra-day fall since the session after the September 11 attacks.Tourism companies also suffered. Marriott, the hotel chain, dropped 5.1 per cent to $21.17 and Expedia, the online travel agency, fell 6.3 per cent to $10.53. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 13.5 per cent to $24.59.Du Pont, which manufactures chemicals for the agricultural industry, led the materials sector lower amid worries about how the outbreak could affect farming. Its shares dropped 4.5 per cent to $27.50.Even credit card companies suffered because of the flu scare, as JPMorgan warned “cross-border fees may suffer from reduced cross-border travel related to the virus”. Visa lost 2.5 per cent to $58.87 and Mastercard retreated 4.4 per cent to $165.55.But Gilead Sciences, the drug company that developed the flu drug Tamiflu, and continues to receive royalties for its sales from Roche, the European company to whom it sold the licence, gained 3.8 per cent to $47.53.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent down at 857.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent lower at 8,025 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,679.41 points.The market briefly rallied during the morning, but later fell back, despite some analysts saying the selling was overdone. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Investors overreacted during the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, and we saw that again this morning, as traders shot first and asked questions later.”Lawrence Summers, the chief White House economics adviser, also dented confidence when he told Fox News on Sunday that the US economy would experience “sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year”.Fears that global demand could still be some way from returning hit metals prices, and industrial companies suffered as a result. Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, lost 3.1 per cent to $39.68, while Alcoa, which produces aluminium, gave up 3.8 per cent to $8.79.The macro-economic news overshadowed earnings announcements from several leading companies, including Verizon the second-largest US telecoms company by market value, which beat analysts’ expectations, as it attracted more new customers than expected. But with revenues from business customers continuing to fall, the company’s shares lost 1.5 per cent to $30.54.Elsewhere in the sector, Qualcomm, which makes microchips for mobile phones, disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, but the company gained ground after raising its full-year revenue targets on signs that the market could be improving. Its shares picked up 4.4 per cent to $43.17.Humana, the health insurer, jumped 6.9 per cent to $29.25 after reporting a surge in first-quarter profits, easily exceeding Wall Street’s expectations and allowing it to raise its outlook for full-year profits.Corning, which makes glass for televisions, also beat analysts’ predictions, as the company said demand for its products was improving. Its shares gained 3.3 per cent to $15.84.General Motors was the strongest performer of the morning after it said it would make deep cuts to its plants and workforce and eliminate the Pontiac brand. The company also asked its bondholders to swap $27bn of debt for equity. Its shares surged 20.7 per cent to $2.04.“We didn’t see the sell-off that the pre-market session indicated,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “We’ve lived through 18 months of intense pressure after the financial collapse and we realised this flue outbreak does feel like the next wave.”
371;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;French take a lead in mobile payments;;"The mobile phone is at last poised to replace the purse – and thanks to a classic piece of pan-industry collaboration, the French may be among the first to achieve the critical mass needed for contactless mobile phone payments to replace coins in daily life.Consumer trials of contactless mobile payments lasting almost two years have demonstrated the success of interoperability standards in Caen and Strasbourg.Big French retail chains will soon begin equipping check-outs nationwide to process contactless payments using Near Field Communication technology.With mobile manufacturers set to begin bulk shipments of NFC-enabled phones this autumn, French consumers may soon be able to settle transactions of less than €20 by simply waving a phone or card in front of an electronic reader.For banks and card companies, low-value payments are the last frontier. Leo Van Hove, associate professor of economics at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, argues that cash is “too cheap” for users, but, for example, costs Netherlands taxpayers €300 per family per year.Central banks agree, putting the cost of printing, issuing and recalling old-fashioned folding notes and coins at between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent of gross domestic product.Electronic payments, especially by cards, are now a standard tool for consumer purchases across Europe. But few retailers will accept credit or debit card payments for purchases below €15, complaining that “merchant” fees charged by card issuers and banks are too high. Efforts to overcome this by adding an “electronic purse”, branded Moneo, to many cards issued in France have been largely ignored by consumers.Card issuers have responded by adopting contactless technology on cards. Visa Europe has been trialling its payWave cards in London and MasterCard is already issuing PayPass “tap-and-go” cards. But outlets with readers remain few and far between.Yet if cash is free to the user, why switch to contactless payments for small ticket items? Howard Wilcox, an analyst at Juniper Research in Basingstoke, has a quick answer: “It is for queue-busting,” he says.The ability to process small-value transactions electronically in less than a second could have big repercussions for transport operators and retailers, says Mr Wilcox. He predicted last July that the total value of NFC transactions worldwide using mobile phones could reach $75bn by 2013. Cash-only retailers face a flight by consumers.Nicolas Houéry, director of the European Association for Mobile Payment (AEPM), and supervisor of the Payez Mobile experiment in Caen and Strasbourg, says the mobile phone has huge advantages over cards as a payment tool.A phone’s SIM card, he says, can carry multiple payment accounts – one for company expenses, another for personal purchases, and so on, and consumers can track payments on its screen.Users carry phones everywhere, and if the phone is lost or stolen, it can be remotely shut down and the data ported in minutes to a new device.Reactions among 1,000 technophile consumers who signed up for the Payez Mobile trial were encouraging. Contactless mobile payments proved popular with both sexes, and all ages.With 500 retailers taking part, the system was widely used in bakeries, stationers, tobacconists, supermarkets and fast-food restaurants.More than a third of payments were valued at less than €5, and 72 per cent at less than €20, although bigger payments could be made with Pin code validation.Nine out of 10 users said they would recommend mobile payments, and 70 per cent of retailers said they would want a terminal if they were commercially available.The trial confirms the success of similar technology in Japan deployed by operator NTT Docomo, which offers a contactless payment service to subscribers via its own bank.A significant feature of the French trial is that it was a collaboration between operators, including Orange and SFR; banks; card issuers, including Visa Europe and MasterCard; payment terminal makers and the French state-sponsored technology cluster for Secure Electronic Transactions, TES.Payments are debited from customer’s existing card accounts, so it opens the way for mobile phones to become payment tools comparable to cards, with banks and operators free to develop and agree varied business models.The payments are not tied to the mobile operator. Indeed, France’s contactless cards and mobiles will be read by a common scanner on the merchant’s terminal.Mary Carol Harris, head of mobile at Visa Europe, predicts that cards and phones will compete for consumer favour for decades, though it will be Visa and its peers handling the transactions on both.However, after previous experience directing contactless phone payment trials at UK mobile operator 02, she has few doubts that phones will ultimately win.Ms Harris says consumers are keen and technology standards are in place. What is lacking is the business model – that is, how the participants, from merchants to banks, carve up the commissions.In highly competitive and innovative markets such as the UK, Ms Harris thinks deals will be struck between banks and operators, but it may take a while to get the critical mass of merchant terminals and owners of NFC phones to achieve widespread use.In France, collaboration looks ready for a widescale roll-out of both in 2010.Mr Houéry reckons arranging deals with public transport operators is a key stepping stone. As Juniper’s Mr Wilcox says: “Transit ticketing is probably the killer application for NFC.”At a time when consumers worldwide are spending less and saving more, contactless card technology has a strong lure for retailers and phone companies who can collaborate, offering the chance of extra business or fees.Ultimately, the biggest benefit will fall to taxpayers, thanks to the falling cost of supplying free cash to the world’s small-spenders."
372;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-04-16T03:13:10Z;Wall Street set to open lower;;US stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning as lower than expected inflation figures and good news from Procter & Gamble balanced fears about demand in the technology sector.Procter & Gamble gave consumer companies a much needed boost amid falling retail sales numbers and and negative words on the economy from Mike Duke, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, after the company raised its dividend for the 52nd straight year. It lifted its quarterly shareholder payout 10 per cent to $0.44, and its shares picked up 2.5 per cent to $48.44.This helped the consumer staples sector perform better than any other on the benchmark S&P 500 index, despite Mr Duke saying there would be no quick end to the recession.But Intel fuelled concerns about consumer demand in the technology sector after it refused to give formal guidance for its second quarter earnings despite reporting better results than expected.The company said it had made $0.11 of net profit per share, compared to expectations of just $0.03. But visibility remained low, and the company would only say that for internal purposes, it expected revenues for the second quarter to be roughly in line with those seen during the first three months of the year.The shares fell on the lack of clarity, losing 4.7 per cent to $15.26. Rival chip maker National Semiconductor also fell, dropping ?3 per cent to $11.88, while Microsoft gave up 2.8 per cent to $18.81.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned the market could have priced in better earnings than analyst had predicted, which could mean equity falls even after strong results. “Intel provided good results compared to printed expectations, but the market reacted poorly to margin guidance. The aftermarket selling may hint that the trade is too long into earnings,” he wrote.CPI numbers showed inflation was lower than expected, with prices for March falling 0.1 per cent, and gaining 0.2 per cent excluding food and energy. But this failed to spark a rally in equities, with investors more concerned about the lack of demand for US goods and services.Concern over future revenues for technology companies led the Nasdaq lower, falling 0.6 per cent to 1,615.51 points. But the S&P rose 0.1 per cent to 842.52 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 7,942.56 points.Mortgage applications fell for the week ending April 10 for the first time in over a month, putting some pressure on financial stocks, which have fallen recently as data have shaken confidence that the country will soon see the beginnings of an economic recovery.Citigroup, which was one of the few banks to find gains on Tuesday, fell back 4.5 per cent to $3.83 in early trade, while Bank of America lost 5.5 per cent to $9.53.Credit card companies added to the gloom in financial stocks after Capital One said that customer defaults rose in March along with the unemployment rate. Capital One lost 4.2 per cent to $16.36, while Discover gave up 2.8 per cent to $8.45 and Mastercard retreated 2.9 per cent to $161.30.As earnings season began to hit full speed, there was negative news from the bigger companies reporting their first quarter results.Peabody Energy disappointed the market despite reporting increased sales and revenue by making only $0.50 per share in earnings compared to consensus estimates of $0.95. The company also deferred providing full-year targets, with future demand still unclear. Its shares fell 11.7 per cent to $25.92.Abbott Laboratories also fell despite reporting increased profits. The company made $0.73 per share in earnings compared to estimates of $0.70, but this was fuelled by one-off gains, and with global sales declining, including those of its top-selling drug Humira, its shares lost 3.7 per cent to $43.04.General Motors continued to pick up ground, however, after Bloomberg reported encouraging signs of agreement between bondholders and the United Auto Workers union over retiree healthcare plans as the company seeks to restructure. Its shares gained 5.6 per cent to $1.88.Allegheny Energy was the biggest riser on the S&P, after Barclays raised the utility company to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying the company may benefit from an auction for Pennsylvania power prices. The company’s shares picked up 6.6 per cent to $25.97.European stocks were down early on Wall Street, driven lower by poor results from Swiss bank UBS. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.4 per cent lower at 786.71 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly down, with the FTSE Asia-Pacific index giving up 0.4 per cent to 168.08 points.Bond yields were little changed, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note gaining 2 basis point to 0.867 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note unchanged at 2.783 per cent.The dollar was higher against major currencies early in New York, rising 0.1 per cent against the euro to $1.3250, and 0.2 per cent on the yen to Y99.03.Gold was trading $0.42 higher at $891.09 per troy ounce.Oil prices were also up, and back abovfe the $50 mark. US crude prices were $0.65 higher at $50.06 a barrel.
373;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-04-09T04:05:54Z;Dethroning cash;;"As ever, the gadget-mad Japanese have been doing it for years. But on Thursday Visa announces its first commercial launch of a scheme that enables consumers to make payments by waving their phones at readers next to cash registers. Malaysians can now buy a Nokia phone equipped with a Near Field Communication chip, link it up to their Maybank account, and start spending in 1,800 retailers across the country. The world has inched closer to the cashless economy.Admittedly, the 3,000 NFC-equipped phones initially available represent innovation rather than revolution. But the launch follows years (if not decades) of discussion and pilot schemes. Malaysia goes first thanks to a youthful population, high mobile phone penetration and a public transport system that uses a “tap-and-go” card-reader technology familiar to London commuters. If it is popular, Visa will roll out the system in other countries within 12 months.The attraction for the company is twofold. Visa’s electronic payment network, which serves the credit and debit cards issued by banks bearing its brand, serves 1.7bn accounts worldwide. It is eyeing the 4bn people connected to mobile phone networks round the globe, particularly in emerging nations where banking systems are less well developed.Second, Visa – for which debit card transactions now represent more than two-thirds of total volume – increasingly competes with cash. Tap-and-go payment is intended to replace notes and coins for low-value purchases, such as skinny lattes, and so push electronic payments’ share of consumer spending up from the current 24 per cent. Growing this way also avoids the need to compete aggressively with MasterCard for market share. Mobile phones, meanwhile, continue their transformation into personalised electronic valets. They absorbed the alarm clock, camera, music player and diary – the wallet is next.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

374;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Mastercard agrees to cut fees in Europe;;"Mastercard is to reduce sharply fees on cross-border credit card transactions in a deal with Europe’s antitrust authorities. In return, Brussels will stop pursuing the company over allegations its fee structure breached European competition rules.But the deal was met with lukewarm support from retailers, with some calling it a “weak compromise” by Neelie Kroes, Europe’s competition commissioner, and others saying it should be a “first step” only.Mastercard, too, insisted the deal was an “interim arrangement”, and said it still intended to pursue its court challenge over the European Commission’s 2007 decision, which found the interchange fees (MIFs) that Mastercard charged on cross-border transactions were illegal.Interchange fees are those paid between banks servicing shops that accept credit and debit cards and those servicing cardholders.Under Wednesday’s deal, Mastercard’s average interchange fee charged on consumer credit card transactions will fall to 0.3 per cent, and on consumer debit cards to 0.2 per cent.According to Ms Kroes, that is less than half the level ahead of her 2007 decision; fees then were between 0.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent for credit cards, for example.Mastercard has also agreed to repeal other fees and increases that were introduced in October to “plug the gap” when it temporarily withdrew interchange fees altogether on cross-border transactions, to avoid heavy daily fines.Finally, the card company will introduce more “flexibility and transparency” into its rules. A trustee will also monitor adherence to the agreement.“The aim of the new MIFs …is that a merchant’s costs in accepting card payments should be no higher than the benefits from avoiding receiving cash,” said Ms Kroes. “I want to make crystal clear today that, under certain circumstances, reasonable MIFs can be compatible with competition rules”.But Mastercard insisted the new fee level was too low to sustain strong competition in the payments industry or encourage investment: “This is why these rates are only interim, and why we are pursuing our appeal to the European Court of First Instance.”Because national competition authorities have also been looking at the legitimacy of interchange fees on domestic card payments, the battle between Brussels and Mastercard has significant potential implications. Yet by refusing to concede any legal principles, Mastercard has in effect limited the impact.“There’s no connection between what we’ve agreed with the commission and cases within domestic markets,” it said Wednesday.Brussels has also been in talks with Visa Europe over its fees. Brussels is likely to want a level playing-field between the two groups, and the Mastercard deal may set the benchmark.But Visa said only that it strongly believed a negotiated settlement would be best, and pointed out that Ms Kroes herself had made clear that each case should be judged on its merits."
375;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-03-29T16:23:57Z;China risks misallocating airport funds;;China risks misallocating investment by overspending on airport projects in poorer western provinces and skimping on allocations to some fast-growing coastal provinces in its $70bn plan to expand capacity until 2013, according to a study by McKinsey, the consultancy.Of the 97 greenfield airport projects planned by Beijing until 2020, McKinsey categorises only 20 to 30 as offering “attractive” investment opportunities by addressing expected capacity shortfalls.Other projects support political aims to spread development inland ahead of actual demand.Evan Auyang, one of the consultants who wrote the McKinsey study, said: “As experienced as China is at central planning, there is a challenge for China now to allocate such huge investments in the most efficient manner, especially given the urgency of infrastructure development and the need to keep economic growth on track.”McKinsey would not detail its airport-by-airport analysis but cited Shandong, a rapidly developing north-eastern province close to South Korea, as an area where planned capacity appeared to fall short of expected demand.“China is really trying to speed up construction to create jobs, so additional airport supply will almost certainly outpace demand,” said Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, who tracks Asian economic developments for MasterCard. He draws a parallel with Shanghai’s Pudong airport, which stood “almost empty for four or five years” before establishing itself as an international hub.“In other countries, such projects would die if they failed to produce a quick return but, in the case of China, they can sustain them,” he said.Beijing has reasserted authority over airport planning after a spate of construction projects by ambitious local authorities in the early 1990s that were under-utilised and duplicative.But as part of the new development plan, Beijing has devolved most of the responsibility for financing projects to regional authorities.Out of $70bn (€53bn, £49bn) of planned investment, McKinsey estimates that less than 5 per cent will come directly from the central government.Peter Morris, London-based chief economist at Ascend, an aviation consultancy, expressed cautious support. “A big shiny airport can be seen by regional authorities almost as a totem pole of economic success,” he said.Aside from the new airports, Beijing is embarking on 46 big airport expansions.Mr Morris said that western input into Chinese airports would be most required in the operational phase, for example in terms of developing secondary revenue sources such as shopping facilities and car parking services.“I’m sure that they can build as cheaply and effectively as anyone on the planet but, in terms of optimising the financials, that is something where they would be well advised to draw on western expertise,” he said.
376;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-03-02T19:01:54Z;Reflections of our desire and reality;;"So in Washington DC, Gordon Brown, UK prime minister, has arrived to discuss a “global new deal” with President Barack Obama; in Milan Roberto Cavalli has launched the Cavalli card, a branded MasterCard, in order to “declare war on the crisis”. We all do what we can where we can.“You have to attack in order to win,” Mr Cavalli said before his show, which featured an army of models attacking the runway in a bling-beatnik uniform of black miniskirts or dresses punctuated by grommets or flashing metal studs and diagonally slashed by silver zippers; skintight studded leggings; sheer gowns and ferocious furs. “Today romanticism doesn’t feel like the right choice.”He wasn’t the only one to think so, although he was the only one to leverage his thoughts into a financing vehicle, presumably hoping the associated Cavalli benefits would get people spending again. At the very least, they might like the idea of flashing a piece of plastic printed like an iridescent snakeskin, and who knows where that might lead?Miuccia Prada started the season staring at “a piece of red sweater and some fishing boots”, and ended with a collection that was an elaborate play on leather, fur, adornment, waders and professional basics. You never know where your mind, or the economy, will take you.“I was thinking about the country, being outside, that that was what we need now,” she explained post-show, obliquely referencing the fact that The City has been vilified as the source of all our problems. “But then I thought we need some glamour, and some eccentricity, and I was very fed up with dresses.” Instead, she said, what felt new was “suits” – full skirted, with oversize belted jackets on top. “I love the suits!” she crowed.Also, apparently, thick-felted coats that she showed belted at the waist and gathered in folds at the back, and a naive A-line shift with a V at the neck so plunging it often hit the navel. (There was also an occasional diaper and knit romper, but that’s more a sartorial expression of a thought process than an actual fashion proposition. Hopefully.)On to these basic shapes Prada grafted patches of fur and sequined flowers, until it all culminated in a series of dresses made of gem-encrusted leather strips and layered over equally encrusted slim underskirts. They were as beautiful as the early pieces were consciously awkward, with the peculiar allure of the frump that Prada is so good at creating.Still, there is something true in this balance of the utilitarian and the ultra-luxe: it is where we are now, stuck between desire and reality.You could see it at Versus, where Christopher Kane, in his first accessory collection for the line, married headlight-sized Swarovski crystals to carabiner hardware in bags and gladiator boots, and at Tod’s, where the most alluring bag of the season is the New Girelli, a hobo-like leather number with a chunky gold chain.And you could perhaps see it most clearly at Marni, where spring/summer’s explosion of colour and polka-dot-happy print gave way for autumn/winter to notably tougher grey wool and felt jackets, leggings, and skirts that hovered over the knee, which in turn grew progressively more elaborate via a green and gold 1970s-style check, giant necklaces-cum-breastplates of real and paste floral jewels, fur jackets and mittens, and painterly pastel frocks.The materials and adjectives were layered one atop the other – chic and practicality, hard and soft, country and city – but designer Consuelo Castiglioni’s great talent is to be able to take all these elements and structure them so they don’t feel confused, they feel current. In their dualism they are simply reflecting what an academic might call the psycho-social environment. In fashion-land this is also known as the zeitgeist.On the other hand, it was hard to know what, exactly, was being reflected at Pringle, between the grace of a flecked grey knit dress and the aggression of an odd jacket bristling with stiff feathers, or at Ferragamo where cropped, pleated trousers were topped by cocoon-like jackets, often with armholes sewn so close to the body the challenge was figuring out how the woman inside would actually function. Hail a cab or try to get a can from a high shelf and you’d rip your clothing.Maybe designer Cristina Ortiz was making a play on the idea of traps, or trapping (she did have some wicked fur sleeves on her sheath dresses). Or maybe she was just making a runway statement, and once the clothes hit stores they’ll be fully functional. Either way, it was unclear, as is the relationship between these clothes and the house that shoes built.At Etro, by contrast, heritage was palpably on display as designer Veronica Etro delved into her family’s past for old prints to reimagine in new ways, so that a geometric pattern reminiscent of an eastern mosaic might make an appearance as a “cage” of gold beading on a simply asymmetric dress or a floor-sweeping scarf gown or even a bristling melange of fringe, sequins and skins masquerading as a skirt.Once upon a time this was also known (if one was being charitable) as mining the archives, or (if uncharitable) running out of new ideas, but this time there was a whole new terminology for the exercise: “recycling and re-use”. Apparently, if you’re not lining up your sartorial ducks to fight the recession, you might as well go green."
377;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-02-10T23:39:51Z;Accor boosts services operation;;Accor, Europe’s largest hotels group, extended its fast-growing services business on Tuesday through a joint venture with US-based MasterCard to expand in prepaid card services.The two companies aim to cash in on growing demand by businesses and governments in Europe to move from cheque and cash-based payments to plastic cards for prepaid services.These include electronic gift cards, corporate prepaid cards to control employee expenses, and government schemes to issue contract workers and welfare claimants with cards on which their benefits are loaded.The prepaid market in Europe is expected to double from €14bn in 2008 to €26bn in 2009 and to grow to €130bn in 2015. Accor and MasterCard said they aimed to have 5 per cent of the 2015 market.“This is a great opportunity for us because there aren’t many players in this territory,” Robert Selander, chief executive of MasterCard, said.The joint venture, called PrePay Solutions, will be developed around Accor’s PrePay Technologies, the prepaid card unit acquired by Accor in 2007.Accor will take a 67 per cent stake and MasterCard, 33 per cent. Financial terms were not disclosed but analysts estimated that MasterCard paid about €17m for its stake. Accor said overall investment in the joint venture with MasterCard was ”several millions of euros, not more.”The tie-up stoked speculation that Accor was beefing up its services division as a prelude to a possible partial flotation or spin-off. Accor has come under pressure from Colony Capital, the US private equity group, to separate its two core businesses and become a pure hotel company. Its services division accounted for 40 per cent of operating profits in 2007.However, Gilles Pélisson, Accor chief executive, said on Tuesday: “We walk better on two legs, especially now as the economy is in a downturn,” He added: “The services business is less cyclical than the hotel business and it necessitates low investments.”Colony and Eurazeo, its French joint venture partner, have steadily raised their stake in Accor over the past six months to 30 per cent but have said they do not seek control of the group.Guillaume Rascoussier, analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris, said: “The partnership with MasterCard is good news in the long term since it increases the likelihood of MasterCard acquiring a stake in Accor Services if this division was put up for sale in the future.”Accor said the partnership would help the group achieve its target of raising organic growth in services to 10-18 per cent a year from 8-16 per cent currently.
378;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-02-05T21:54:31Z;US financials rally on accounting talk;;Financial stocks were among the biggest winners on Wall Street on Thursday as hopes mounted that the Obama administration would unveil decisive plans to shore up embattled banks.The financial sector, down as much as 4.7 per cent soon after the open, rallied as much as 4.1 per cent after speculation swept through trading floors that Washington could suspend mark-to-market accounting requirements for illiquid assets.Bank of America, once again hurt by persistent fears of outright nationalisation, at one point tumbled 19.8 per cent to its lowest level since 1984 but later rallied to stand 3 per cent higher at $4.84 in high volume.“It is amazing just how quickly speculation intensifies on behemoth financial names,” said Andrew Wilkinson, market analyst at Interactive Brokers.State Street leapt 14.1 per cent to $27.54 even though the custodian bank lowered its forecast for the year. Investors appeared to welcome the group’s aggressive attempts to increase its capital by slashing its dividend and bonus payments.Moody’s rallied 4.8 per cent to $23.19 on better- than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, although the group forecast full-year profit below existing estimates.Credit card groups received a boost after Visa and Mastercard also unveiled better-than-expected earnings. They rallied 9.4 per cent to $53.74 and 14.1 per cent to $159.84, respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.6 per cent at 845.85 to remain within a 65-point intraday trading range that it has not left in the last week. Traders said the market has struggled to find momentum in part because of the uncertainty over the new administration’s plans to deal with the stricken banking sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 8,063.07 and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.1 per cent to 1,546.24.Retail stocks held up relatively well in spite of largely downbeat January sales figures. Overall, same-store sales declined by an average of 1.8 per cent last month, according to Thomson Reuters data, which although glum was nevertheless better than the 2.3 per cent drop that had been expected.Consumer staples – which had led the market lower in the previous session, when the latest batch of glum corporate earnings took in erstwhile defensive food companies – took comfort from Wal-Mart’s sales figures.Shares in the world’s largest retailer rallied 4.6 per cent to $48.56 after the group disclosed that same-store sales rose 2.1 per cent in January, better than expected.However, the gains were limited as the group said it would only issue quarterly rather than monthly sales guidance because of the volatile trading environment.Elsewhere in retail, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brands enjoyed particularly positive market reaction to their figures, up 10 per cent to $19.98 and 6.9 per cent to $8.40, respectively.The leading indices opened lower after US Department of Labor data showed unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped last week to a fresh 26-year high. Initial jobless claims increased to 626,000 from an upwardly revised figure of 591,000 the previous week.Investors will keep a close eye on the much-anticipated non-farm payroll report due for release on Friday.Elsewhere, homebuilders did well, up 5.4 per cent overall, helped by Senate approval of expanded tax credit plans for home buyers.Better-than-expected fourth-quarter results from Cigna, up 18.7 per cent to $21.39, gave the health insurance sector a boost.Meanwhile, technology came under early pressure following results from network equipment maker Cisco. Although headline earnings for the latest quarter were better than expected, investors focused on a forecast that was well below expectations.Dell lost 3.7 per cent to $9.43 after JPMorgan downgraded its recommendation on the stock to “underweight”.However, the sector rallied with the wider market and finished 2.2 per cent higher. Cisco closed up 3.2 per cent to $16.35 in volatile trade.The material and energy sectors were the best performing of the day, helped by strength in commodity markets. They rose 2.6 and 2.7 per cent, respectively.
379;MA;Mastercard Inc;2009-02-05T19:07:35Z;Slow economy curtails credit card use;;US consumers dramatically cut back their credit card spending in the fourth quarter, according to results from credit card lenders and payment processors, as rising unemployment and a slowing economy inspired increasingly cautious spending habits.MasterCard, the second- largest payment processor after Visa, said yesterday that spending volumes from US holders of their branded credit cards fell by 11.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008 year on year.Consumers were increasingly switching to debit cards, the processor said, and not buying expensive items.Bob Selander, chief executive of MasterCard, said: “Consumers feel they have a level of control with debit. It is their own money, not the bank’s, but they can still keep track of their spending and manage it electronically.”Visa said yesterday that growth in credit card use was slowing, offset by greater debit card use as consumers spent more conservatively.Byron Pollitt, chief financial officer, said consumers were also spending less per transaction, but the number of transactions continued to grow.He said the economy would “continue to have an effect on dollar payment volumes in the US and internationally for at least the next two to three quarters”.Fourth-quarter earnings reports from credit card lenders JPMorgan, Citi and Bank of America showed a steeper than expected drop in card volumes: down 8 per cent, 15 per cent and 13 per cent year on year, respectively.As cautious consumers rein in their spending, credit card lenders such as JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America face reduced revenues at a time when the slowing economy has resulted in higher credit losses.Lenders are suffering from record late payments and soaring defaults as unemployment rises.Credit card write-offs could reach 9 per cent by the end of 2009, according to analysts at Fitch.Credit card lending has historically accounted for between 15 and 25 per cent of pre-tax income at these banks.Payment processors Visa and MasterCard, which do not lend directly to consumers but take a fee for processing card transactions, have been able to maintain their profitability as consumers worldwide have sustained a secular shift from using cash toward making electronic payments.In the US, consumers have cut their spending to cope with the recession and are spending substantially less on their credit cards, but use of debit cards has grown.Both processors have also seen dramatic growth in the number of cards issued under their brands, particularly in emerging markets such as India and the Middle East.At Visa, this trend contributed to a 35 per cent increase in fiscal first-quarter profit – net income was $574m, or 74 cents per share, for the three months to December 31.Total cards carrying the Visa brand rose 10 per cent globally to 1.7bn and total payment transactions jumped 13 per cent to 14.5bn.MasterCard reported that fourth-quarter net income fell 21 per cent year on year.

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

However, HG Capital, which bought a big minority stake in Orbiscom in 2001, has notched up a number of profitable recent disposals.MasterCard, which already had a partnership with Orbiscom, was attracted by its technology for issuing unique transaction numbers to credit card users. These frustrate fraudsters by masking a credit card number when buying goods on the internet.The US-based company was also keen to secure exclusive control of Orbiscom’s systems that allow companies to place limits on individual corporate credit card users by either transaction size or type.Several of the world’s biggest banks pay to use Orbiscom’s technology, including Citigroup, Bank of America, Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale.The sale of Orbiscom, producing a return of 1.8 times its initial investment, means that HG has generated £1.2bn ($1.75bn) from asset realisations since the credit crunch started in June 2007, at an average multiple of 2.7 times original cost.The group, formed in 2000 through the buy-out of Mercury Capital from Merrill Lynch, spent about £13m to acquire a 44 per cent stake in Orbiscom. Its initial investment was made shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.Ian Armitage, HG’s chairman, admitted it overpaid for the company at the time, as it went on to suffer several years of losses.However, three years ago, it returned to the black and was this year forecast to make a profit of about £1m.Last year HG Capital sold Addison Software, an accounting software provider, for €225m ($305m); Boosey & Hawkes, the classical music publishing group, for £126m; and Sanctuary Spa, the maker of bodycare products, for £75m."

The latest MasterCard data have indicated an improvement in consumption in recent weeks but the government figures released on Wednesday showed demand averaging 9.84m barrels a day over the past four weeks, down 3.2 per cent compared with the same period a year ago.Nymex RBOB unleaded gasoline rose 6 cents to $1.0940 a gallon.Distillate stocks (including heating oil) increased 5.6m barrels, also well above the consensus forecast for a rise of 900,000 barrels. Nymex January heating oil rose
3.4 cents to $1.5014 a gallon.Attention will turn on Thursday to the latest update from the International Energy Agency with the energy watchdog of the developed world widely expected to reduce its demand projections again for this year and next.The IEA is not thought likely to match forecasts released on Tuesday by the US government which predicted, for the first time in three decades, a decline in global demand for crude oil in two consecutive years, 2008 and 2009.The IEA’s report has assumed a greater degree of political sensitivity than normal in view of the Opec meeting scheduled next week. The cartel is widely expected to agree a production cut of at least 1m-1.5m barrels a day, but traders said the IEA might want to avoid giving a “green light” to Opec to reduce supplies.In Chicago, agricultural commodities rose in early trade ahead of the latest supply and demand update from the US Department of Agriculture, due on Thursday. The UDA is not thought likely to announce significant revisions to its projections for output and instead will focus on the extent of any deterioration in demand, which will show up in the stock figures for the end of year.CBOT December corn gained 10¾ cents at $3.23 a bushel while CBOT December wheat added 16½ cents at $4.88¾ a bushel and CBOT January soyabeans jumped 24 cents to $8.37 a bushel.Wheat prices found further support from reports that Argentina’s wheat output could drop by 31 per cent in 2008-09 compared with the previous year, while Chinese data showed a strong increase in soyabean imports in NovemberGold regained the $800 level for the first time since December 1, up 4.9 per cent to a high of $813.10 a troy ounce, helped by renewed dollar weakness.In Indonesia, the Jakarta Futures Exchange plans to launch physical gold trading next year."
383;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-11-12T21:23:17Z;‘Seismic’ drop in sales to hit Best Buy profits;Electronics retailer cuts earnings outlook;Best Buy, the largest US electronics retail chain, on Wednesday warned that a “seismic” drop in sales would hit its earnings, just three days after rival Circuit City filed for bankruptcy protection.The retailer, which is planning to open stores in the UK next year through a joint venture with Carphone Warehouse, said comparable sales at its almost 1,000 US stores fell 7.8 per cent in October.Best Buy said overall comparable store sales could fall by 5-15 per cent over the remaining four months of its fiscal year – contrasting with the 5.3 per cent increase in the second quarter before the financial crisis hit in mid-September.Brad Anderson, chief executive, said that then there had been “rapid, seismic changes in consumer behaviour [that] have created the most difficult climate we’ve ever seen”. Brian Dunn, chief operating officer, said: “In 42 years of retailing, we’ve never seen such difficult times for the consumer.”The company lowered its revenue forecast to $43.7bn-$45.5bn and earnings-per-share forecast to $2.30-$2.90, down from $3.25-$3.40. Analysts had been expecting revenues of about $46.2bn and earnings-per-share of $3.02. Mr Dunn argued that Best Buy was still in a position to gain sales and market share as Circuit City shuts stores and seeks to restructure under bankruptcy protection.Adding to the retail gloom, a report on Thursday on October sales from MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse estimates that electronics sales were down by an annualised 19.9 per cent during the month, after a 13.8 per cent fall in September.The SpendingPulse report, based on usage of MasterCard credit cards and estimates of other spending, said that overall retail spending excluding autos and gasoline sales rose just 0.3 per cent during the month against the same period last year.On a month-to-month basis, sales excluding autos and gasoline were down 1.5 per cent, after a sharp 2.4 per cent fall in September.The report estimates that speciality clothing sales fell an annualised 12.2 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent in September, while furniture sales were down 17.9 per cent, after a 13.3 per cent drop in September.Kamalesh Rao, director of economic research at the research firm, said that “even in the November numbers we just are not seeing anything like a turnround” in consumer spending.
384;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-11-07T22:06:08Z;Wall St shrugs off unemployment data;;Wall Street stocks on Friday brushed aside data that showed the US unemployment rate hit a 14-year high and fresh fears over the future of the country’s automakers to recover some of their election week losses.Observers concurred that the 240,000 job cuts last month – coupled with a substantial downward revision to the September figures – were abysmal. Yet some analysts expected losses of up to 300,000 and strategists said traders had come to expect the worst.Alan Ruskin of RBS Global Banking & Markets said the market’s reaction confirmed that “short-term weakness is largely priced in”. Speculation that the grim figures would prompt the Federal Reserve to follow other central banks and once again cut interest rates, as well as President-elect Barack Obama’s comments that he hoped a second stimulus package would be passed “sooner rather than later”, also helped sentiment.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.9 per cent higher at 930.99 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.9 per cent to 8,943.81 while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.4 per cent to 1,647.4. That pared the benchmark S&P’s weekly losses to 3.9 per cent, the Dow’s to 4.1 per cent and the Nasdaq’s to 4.3 per cent.The future of carmakers General Motors and Ford topped a long list of traders’ concerns that came to a head on Friday, when they disclosed the vast scale of their quarterly losses and the former said its liquidity was nearing the minimum required to operate its business, which led S&P to cut its debt rating. They closed down 9.2 per cent at $4.36 and up 2 per cent at $2.02, respectively after Mr Obama said government assistance for the ailing industry would be a top priority for his new administration.Friday’s sell-off took their losses for the week to 24.7 per cent and 7.8 per cent, respectively. Financials were the only economic sector in the red for much of the morning, although by the close they had eked out a 2 per cent gain.Wells Fargo rose 2.5 per cent to $29.50 after the bank sold $11bn of stock at a discount to fund its acquisition of Wachovia.Goldman Sachs lost 3.6 per cent to $77.78 after JPMorgan warned of its exposure to the world equity markets. JPMorgan analysts, who previously forecast a profit in the fourth quarter, now forecast a loss.They also expected that Morgan Stanley would “navigate the quarter somewhat better” than Goldman Sachs due to lesser exposure to private equity, and its shares rose 3.8 per cent to $15.98.Elsewhere in financials, Citigroup gained 2.6 per cent to $11.82 after Reuters reported that the bank was set to lay off workers in several departments. It cited investment banking, sales and trading.The week began in muted fashion but quickly returned to the kind of volatility of recent weeks. A strong rally on Tuesday, polling day, gave way to the biggest two-day sell-off since 1987, as signs of a weakening economy returned to haunt the market. Volumes remained thin as buyers sat on the sidelines.A glut of downbeat data on mortgages, jobs and the service sector throughout the week preceded Friday’s grim payroll report.Helping to stem the losses, some companies – such as MasterCard – reported better-than-expected quarterly figures. Still, shares in the credit card group were down 0.1 per cent over the week at $147.73.Cisco sparked fears for corporate IT spending when the technology bellwether issued a downbeat assessment of prospects. The shares fell 1.1 per cent over the week to $17.58.A weakening advertising market hit News Corp and Walt Disney, which shed 20.2 per cent to $8.48 and 9.8 per cent to $23.36, respectively. In technology, Yahoo advanced after Jerry Yang, chief executive, rekindled the prospect of a deal with Microsoft. It finished the week down 4.8 per cent to $12.20.

The gains were comfortably the greatest of all presidential election days since 1984. In the years before then, markets had been closed on the day of the ballot.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, shed 11.2 per cent to 47.69 points.Upbeat corporate earnings, further easing of strain in money markets, and the prospect of more policy measures to help prevent a global recession also gave a boost.A diverse range of companies, such as MasterCard, Emerson Electric and Viacom reported better-than-expected quarterly figures. Shares in the three companies roose 18.3 per cent to $170.24, 10.1 per cent to $35.86 and 7.5 per cent to $22.65, respectively.Energy led the gains, up 6.4 per cent as oil settled above $70 a barrel. Materials, industrials and financials followed closely behind.Archer Daniels Midland leapt 15.3 per cent to $24.33 after the food processor comfortably beat forecasts that had been lowered after rival Bunge’s failure to meet expectations. The later rose 8.6 per cent to $45.31.Elsewhere, CIT Group and General Electric jumped 36.1 per cent to $6.15 and 7.6 per cent to $20.77 respectively, on reports the Treasury might buy stakes in a wide range of financial companies, not only banks and insurers, under its $700bn rescue package.In technology, Google and Yahoo edged up 5.9 per cent to $366.94 and 4.7 per cent to $13.35, respectively, on reports the companies scaled back their proposed web advertising deal to win over antitrust officials.VMware shed 3.9 per cent to $30.56 on news that Intel was in the process of halving its stake in business software maker. The chipmaker gained 4 per cent to $16.26.Dell rallied 5.6 per cent but fell back to stand 2.5 per cent higher at $12.93 after reports emerged that the computer group had instituted a hiring freeze and asked employees to consider taking up to five days of unpaid leave.On the downside, Dean Foods dropped 17.6 per cent to $18.25 after the food group’s results fell short of expectations. The figures failed to drag down either peer Kraft Foods or the wider consumer staples sector, which were higher by 4.1 per cent at $30.51 and
2.3 per cent, respectively.An interest rate cut in Australia sparked hopes of further policy measures around the world. Tueday’s rally, coupled with the muted trading of the previous session, comes after the wild volatility that characterised October.“You may be asking yourself what exactly has changed in the last few days to stage this dramatic turn of events. Good question,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.Analysts remained divided on whether the market would extend its rally.Quincy Krosby, strategist at The Hartford, wrote in a note: “Given the oversold condition in the market, it is quite clear that we can build on this rally toward the year-end.”"
386;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-10-31T23:33:21Z;MasterCard to issue diamond-studded cards;;Markets are plunging, banks are collapsing and talk of recession is all about, but the global gloom is not stopping the launch of a MasterCard credit card inlaid with a diamond and laced with gold.Known as the “Diamond”, the card has a 0.02-carat gem ­embedded in its centre and a picture of a peacock for female cardholders and a winged horse for men.The card, which has a $1,000 (£620) annual fee, is to be issued in two weeks’ time by MasterCard and Kazkommertsbank, the second largest bank in commodities-rich Kazakhstan, where the oil and minerals boom of recent years has created a fresh crop of billionaires.Asked about the timing of the launch, the bank’s head of international payment systems, Alla Voyakina, said: “The [financial] crisis is also affecting us but we are talking about rich people, they can afford to have such cards. It’s a question of prestige to have such cards in your ­wallet.”The diamond was “only a design element”, Ms Voyakina said. “It’s showing your status.”MasterCard had done “all the testing” to make sure such a card would fit into automated teller machines and point of sale slots, she added.The card comes as even the super-rich are feeling the pain of the credit crunch. Spending on items such as $1,000 mobile phones is expected to end a boom that more than doubled the size of the global luxury goods market in the past decade.However, Ms Voyakina said the bank had a target audience of “the best of VIP customers” and only planned to issue 1,000 cards, at a rate of about 30 a month, starting on November 13.Each would have a credit limit of $50,000, about $20,000 higher than the highest limit on some MasterCard platinum cards.MasterCard, which launched a similar card in Dubai last year, said such cards were “leading examples of MasterCard’s ability to support our customers in meeting the lifestyle needs of these premium customers”.The invitation-only “Royale” card issued by Dubai First, a consumer finance group owned by the emirate’s ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, offers a “lifestyle manager” and has no pre-set spending limits.The Kazakh card comes with a personal card “manager”, available around the clock.Additional reporting by Isabel Gorst in Astana
387;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Plastic is forever;;It looks about as sensitive as marketing sunglasses on Noah’s ark. While economies round the world feel the waters of recession rising and consumers rein in spending, MasterCard is issuing a diamond-encrusted credit card laced with gold leaf. When so many are feeling the pinch, do we really need an extra opportunity for the very rich to display conspicuous consumption?There is no doubt that the “Royale” card is about status and prestige. At $50,000, it has a credit limit $20,000 higher than MasterCard’s existing platinum cards. A limited edition of 1,000 will be issued in Kazakhstan, where it launches later this month, though that arrangement is slightly less exclusive than the invitation-only approach in Dubai, where a similarly sparkling card was introduced in March.For the $1,000 annual fee, cardholders will be provided with a personal manager at their beck and call, 24 hours of every day. This 24/7 focus will presumably be needed in part to advise on avoiding the inflated prices that might be charged as alert retailers and restaurateurs spot a customer who one can only assume will be too embarrassed to quibble about the cost.In an ideal world, the rich would be different from you and me not only in having more money but in giving vast sums to good causes. Some of them do. But it might be unrealistic to expect those in Kazakhstan who can afford lavish lifestyles to behave as though they do not know where their next tenge is coming from. Indeed, on one analysis, if people who can still spend with abandon decide not to do so, then the economy suffers even more than if they hoard their cash.When it comes to unappealing extravagance every culture has its own mores. These include factors such as the number of people living in poverty, the scale of the gulf between income extremes and the ostentation of spending by the plutocracy. Royale customers who want the card as a way of parading their wealth should make sure they reinforce that message by adding a generous gratuity to the bill.
388;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa warns of tough three years ahead;;Visa reported better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter on Wednesday on higher transaction volumes, but said it expected revenue for the next three years to be at the low end of previous guidance amid the global economic slowdown.The credit card processor reported a net loss of $356m, or 45 cents a share, for the three months ended September 30, its third quarter as a public company. That compared with a $1.66bn loss a year earlier.However, excluding litigation reserves and restructuring charges, earnings were 58 cents a share for the quarter, and $2.25 a share for the full year 2008.Visa and MasterCard are sidestepping the rising customer defaults at other card companies such as American Express and Capital One because they collect fees to process payments between financial institutions but do not take the risk of making loans to consumers.“In the face of a tough economic environment in the US and internationally, the relative resiliency of the Visa business model was in evidence,” said Joe Saunders, chief executive of Visa.Lenders have reported declining profits as they put aside more money for future losses amid rising US unemployment and a battered housing market.Payment processers such as Visa and MasterCard are exposed to the potential for lower overall spending volumes as consumers tighten their belts but, even as the US economy slows, the growing adoption of card-based payments in the US and overseas has helped contribute to growth.Revenues rose 17 per cent to $1.71bn as spending on Visa cards climbed 15 per cent to $699bn and transaction volume rose 19 per cent. The number of Visa-branded cards rose 12 per cent worldwide to 1.6bn. Mastercard is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings next week.While the rate of growth in credit card transactions slowed in the quarter, Visa said the rate of growth in debit payments continued to accelerate. Debit payment processing represented more than half of Visa’s payment transactions worldwide.“Debit is particularly important to our results in the current environment, as that product is rooted in everyday spend behaviour which has proven to be less susceptible to economic fluctuations and continues to grow,” said Mr Saunders.Shares in Visa fell 0.37 per cent to $50.50 in after hours trading yesterday. The stock has fallen more than 40 per cent from its peak in May.Visa and MasterCard this week reached a $2.75bn settlement of a lawsuit brought by Discover Financial that alleged anti-competitive practices. That followed an earlier $4bn settlement the two companies reached with American Express over similar allegations. Neither MasterCard nor Visa admitted any liability as part of the settlements.

That suggested widespread selling of yen positions had left traders with cash to invest in US stocks.After a wave of buying into the New York close, the S&P 500 finished up 10.8 per cent to 940.50. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 9.5 per cent to 1,649.47 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.9 per cent to 9,065.12.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 16.3 per cent, although at 66.99 continued to indicate heightened levels of distress.The market’s late afternoon surge came even after figures showed consumer confidence slumped to a record low in October, which Ian Shepherdson, of High Frequency Economics, described as “extraordinarily awful.” Separate data showed prices of single-family homes plunged by a record percentage in August.Energy and telecoms were two of the biggest sectoral winners. Exxon Mobil and AT&T were among the biggest blue-chip winners, up 13.3 per cent to $74.86 and 13.2 per cent to $27.61 respectively after analysts at Morgan Stanley highlighted their “defensive” qualities.Relatively well-received results from refiner Valero helped the energy sector. Its shares jumped 11.3 per cent to $16.81.Materials overall gained 12.7 per cent. US Steel’s third-quarter results were also positive and the shares jumped 14.2 per cent to $35.20 even after a downbeat assessment of prospects for the fourth quarter.The financial sector remained volatile, with large swings, particularly in the value of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Despite early losses, Morgan Stanley closed up 10.7 per cent at $15.20 and Goldman shares ended up 0.7 per cent at $93.57.Phil Orlando, strategist at Federated Investors, said sentiment was also helped by the continuing efforts by the US government to implement measures to help the financial sector. “There’s a recognition that these programmes will be successful [in the long term],” he said.Traders also took comfort from further signs of easing in money markets and the market is pricing in a 50 basis point interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.Wal-Mart jumped 11.1 per cent to $55.17 after the world’s largest retailer told analysts it was “well-positioned” to deal with a global slump.In industrials, Boeing climbed 15.5 per cent to $48.91 on the prospect of a tentative deal to end a strike.General Motors advanced 14.7 per cent to $6.25 on reports that the hard-hit auto group was pushing for government aid to help a possible merger with
Chrysler.Meanwhile, internet stocks were in focus after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on several in the sector. “We are cautious on US display advertising,” the analysts wrote. “Investors should position their portfolios toward what we see as more sustainable growth in search and fixed-price e-commerce.”Google was up 11.9 per cent to $368.75 after Credit Suisse placed an “outperform” rating on the stock and a price target of $400.Airlines were a key winner, up 4.3 per cent overall. The sector was helped after Calyon upgraded a slew of stocks due to “dramatically falling oil prices and the deep capacity cuts implemented to support ticket prices and revenue, which sharply reduced variable and fixed costs”.Bucking the market’s upward momentum, Whirlpool lost 8.3 per cent to $45.87 after the group slashed its full-year outlook and said it would cut 5,000 jobs by the end of next year.Britannia Bulk Holdings plunged 85.8 per cent to 27 cents after the group said there was a “very high risk” that it would default on a $170m loan.Visa and MasterCard rose 7.3 per cent to $49.97 and 7.7 per cent to $136.01, respectively, after the duo agreed to pay $2.75bn to settle an antitrust lawsuit with
Discover Financial."
390;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-10-14T19:24:58Z;Credit cards;;For a while it seemed that neither record commodity prices nor falling wealth could put a dent in American consumers’ propensity to pay with plastic, but the moment of frugal reckoning is now finally here. August had the biggest drop in revolving debt on record and the last several weeks were probably even worse.The fall in spending and rising late credit card payments have naturally weighed on the financial sector. Lately though, companies such as Visa and MasterCard that depend on transaction volumes rather than creditworthiness have been hit nearly as hard as those facing delinquencies. The largest issuers of credit cards are big banks, but they have many other businesses and have gyrated recently on separate concerns. Three that come close to being pure plays on cards while still having credit exposure are Capital One, American Express and Discover Financial Services and they are off by an average of 51 per cent from their 52 week highs. Visa and Mastercard’s drops of 35 and 46 per cent, respectively, are better but still an overreaction.The future of the two big processors lies in developing markets. These have wobbled recently, but if future penetration rates climb anywhere near their expected pace, processor shares still look attractive. In the not-too-distant future, developed market revenue will merely grow in line with nominal output. In the US, for example, cheques and cash already have dropped from three fourths of spending in the early 1990s to a little over a third today. Worldwide though, these represent an $80,000bn untapped market for cards.At around 27 and 20 times prospective earnings, respectively, Visa and Mastercard might seem expensive in a bombed-out financial sector, but they can still grow earnings respectably if revenue rises in the low teens, several percentage points lower than consensus forecasts. Even if global recession looms, plastic cards are one American export with a bright future.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
391;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-08-31T22:35:33Z;Atticus principals to be hit where it hurts most;;"For most of the past decade, Atticus Capital has been a force to reckon with in global markets. From its base in New York, the hedge fund, which had more than $20bn of assets under management at its peak last year, helped dictate the course of mega-mergers and corporate strategy at some of the world’s biggest companies – and made a fortune in the process.Founded by Tim Barakett, a Canadian, in 1995, the young manager soon hired Nathaniel Rothschild, son of Lord Jacob Rothschild, to act as co-chairman and draw on his connections to raise money. He subsequently poached David Slager, a British-educated Dutch trader, from Goldman Sachs, who launched a European fund that grew rapidly to pass the original Global fund Mr Barakett runs.All three of them went on to make personal fortunes in the bull market, which ended in summer last year. Mr Barakett and Mr Slager were estimated by Trader Monthly magazine to have made $250m-$300m each last year, with Mr Rothschild adding to his family’s wealth with a similar income. The three of them, together with other staff, have more than $1.4bn invested in the $14bn fund, with Mr Barakett and Mr Slager having the vast bulk of their personal wealth tied up in Atticus.When the credit crunch hit in August last year, Atticus was caught out. The firm had a $1bn position in Britain’s Barclays Bank, where it was publicly opposing efforts by John Varley, chief executive, to buy Dutch rival ABN Amro – a deal that Barclays lost to Royal Bank of Scotland – as well as major unhedged holdings across many large companies. Mr Slager’s fund plunged more than 10 per cent in the month, its worst result yet, as banking shares, and Barclays, tumbled. Still, investors were unconcerned. The funds made back all their losses over the next two months, and the European fund ended 2007 up 28 per cent after fees – not a patch on the 44 per cent and 63 per cent gains of the previous two years, but still a phenomenal result for such a large fund.This year, investors have been more worried. The fund’s low levels of short-selling, which can hedge against falling markets, and its enormous position in Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the stock exchanges, has hammered its results. Mr Slager has recorded his seven worst months since the credit crisis hit, and at the end of August was down 32.9 per cent this year. Mr Barakett has fared slightly better, but was still down 25 per cent.Now the fund and its top executives are braced for at least a year without bonuses, as Atticus will receive no performance fees – the bulk of its income – until the funds have made back their losses – requiring gains of 50 per cent for Mr Slager and 33 per cent for Mr Barakett.“Perhaps one concludes that the time is over for them,” said one investor. However, other investors said the dire results over the past 12 months were just a “natural” give-back of some earlier profits. Clients who put money with Mr Slager when his fund launched in 2001, for example, have still made more than three and a half times their money, turning $10m at launch into almost $37m.Nicola Horlick, in the latest report to shareholders in Bramdean, the London-listed investment fund she runs, said its holding in Atticus European was expected to be volatile, and was kept small as a result. “Given that the manager maintains concentrated positions, the heavy losses in declining markets are not surprising,” she wrote.Still, this year’s losses have been galling for Atticus, which believes it has picked strong companies in sectors which are fundamentally sound.“We continue to be disappointed by what we believe is an over-reaction in specific themes to concerns about growth,” it said in a report to Atticus European investors last month.“These valuations indicate persistent fear, and reflect the willingness of many investors to de-risk their portfolios uneconomically,” it wrote. “Historically, these conditions have indicated the wrong time to sell equities, and we believe that remains true today.”The latest regulatory filings show Atticus running with three big investment themes at the end of June: mining and oil/energy, including a $1bn holding in ConocoPhillips; financials and stock exchanges, including more than €1bn ($1.47bn) of Deutsche Börse, and a combined $1bn in Visa and Mastercard; and US rail, with $1bn of Union Pacific and another $1bn in Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern. The hedge fund focuses on large companies, unlike many rivals, taking very large, concentrated positions. It originally started out following the “event-driven” strategy: buying cheap stocks where a corporate event could provide a catalyst for a jump in the price.As it grew bigger and more powerful it began to provide the catalyst itself, pushing management to take action it believed would boost the stock. In the case of Phelps Dodge, the miner, it even hired its own investment bankers to find a buyer, ahead of its sale last year to Freeport-McMoRan. It halved its $1.1bn equity stake in the second quarter, although it also bought $200m worth of options.Atticus has come under scrutiny for its links to The Children’s Investment Fund, an aggressive London activist hedge fund run by Chris Hohn, a Harvard friend of Mr Barakett.The two have frequently bought the same stocks or taken the same general views – including their focus on US rail – and are the two largest shareholders in Deutsche Börse.They worked together to prevent the exchange’s purchase of the London Stock Exchange, although subsequently they have diverged in views, particularly with regard to ABN, where Mr Hohn was pushing the Dutch bank to sell, while Atticus was trying to stop Barclays from buying.Concerns that they could be seen as acting together, highlighted by an inconclusive investigation by the German regulator, were behind Mr Hohn’s resignation last year as a director of RIT Capital, the listed Rothschild investment trust, where Mr Rothschild is also a director. RIT is an investor in Atticus, and the hedge fund rents its London office from RIT."
392;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US shoppers turn away from credit;;Middle-class US consumers are increasingly leaving their credit cards at home when they go shopping, extending a trend first shown by Wal-Mart’s low-income shoppers last year, and adding to the pressures on US retailers’ sluggish sales.Mainstream retailers are reporting that shoppers are opting for debit cards or cash instead of credit cards as they face tighter credit limits, illustrating how the wider credit crunch is being transferred to main street spending.Target, the discounter with over 1,500 stores across the US, said last week that it had seen the share of total payments made using credit cards fall for the first time ever in its second quarter, while the use of debit cards continued to rise.The retailer said the resulting slowing of credit use has in turn hurt its sales performance – which saw a slight decline in sales at stores open for at least a year during the quarter.“Clearly the aggregate access that our guests have to credit cards…is one of the issues that is determining our same-store sales performance in the current environment,” Doug Scovanner, Target’s chief operating officer, told investors.Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer whose sales fell 5.3 per cent year-on-year in the six months to August 1, also reported an increase in the mix of cash and debit card use during the latest quarter.Kohl’™s, the budget department store chain, reported an increase in the use of its Kohl’s credit card, which rewards loyal shoppers with monthly savings.But it said the share of payments made by regular bank credit cards and cash had both declined, while it also saw a rise in debit card use. The retailers’ experiences on the shop floor reflect the broader slowdown in the growth of credit.MasterCard, the payments network, said US credit card use was virtually unchanged in the second quarter, with a slight 0.7 per cent increase in total payments, against a 16 per cent increase in debit card use.Visa’s US credit card payments increased 8 per cent, while debit card use increased by 16 per cent.In addition to accepting bank credit cards, most US retailers also issue their own charge cards and co-branded credit cards in partnership with issuing banks.Retailers use these own-brand cards to promote customer loyalty through offering discounts to card holders, and to gather data on their customers’ shopping habits.However, both banks and retailers have been tightening the terms both on their existing cards and on new applicants, in part to reflect declining credit scores that are the result of the increasing economic pressures on their customers.Lowe’s said the share of payments using its own-brand credit card fell 100 basis points in the second quarter to 22 per cent.Target, which co-issues store-branded credit cards with JPMorgan Chase, has followed other card issuers by increasing interest charges on existing accounts and what it describes as “aggressive reduction of credit lines and significant tightening of all aspects of our underwriting”.Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, says it has seen “significant erosion” of credit scores which led it to reduce some credit limits on existing card holders whose cards accounted for almost 30 per cent of its sales last year.Wesley McDonald, Kohl’s chief financial officer, noted that while its charge card performed strongly in the second quarter, accounting for 44 per cent of sales, the rate at which it is issuing new cards is slowing.“Part of that is just obviously with people having more economic difficulties, their credit scores are falling across the country,” he told investors this month.
393;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-07-31T20:30:38Z;Wall Street falls as GDP figures disappoint;;Wall Street stocks fell for the first time in three sessions on Thursday as investors digested disappointing macro-economic data that showed improved but weaker-than-expected growth and rising unemployment.According to the Department of Commerce, the US economy grew at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the second quarter – faster than earlier in the year but slower than economists were expecting.Heavy goods manufacturers Deere, Caterpillar and General Electric fell 4.5 per cent to $70.16, 3.5 per cent to $69.52, and 2.4 per cent to $28.29, respectively. The industrials sector as a whole dropped 2.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that initial claims for unemployment benefit last week jumped by the most in five years. That bodes ill for the key payrolls report due on Friday.A $2 drop in the oil price helped contain losses for much of the session but stocks slid to their lowest levels of the day at the close.Nine of the ten leading industry groups lost ground, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.3 per cent to 1,267.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8 per cent to 11,378.02, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2 per cent to 2,325.39.Over a volatile month, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, paring early losses as government measures to backstop the mortgage groups, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped to restore confidence to the financial sector.“After coming in like a Lion, July went out like a lamb,” said Alec Young, equity strategist at S&P, pointing to rock-bottom sentiment, a drop in oil prices and second-quarter earnings that were not as bad as expected as additional reasons for the market recovery.The financials were the biggest monthly gainers, adding 6.8 per cent after a roller-coaster ride that saw them down as much as 15 per cent and up as much as 10 per cent.Consumer staples, healthcare and industrials also made solid gains of 3.3 per cent, 4.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, as investors moved into defensive sectors and dropped from early-year winners. Energy stocks, for example, dropped 14 per cent.Nonetheless, Mr Young is cautious. “While these positives have helped the market find a short-term floor at 1,200 on the S&P 500, we think its ability to . . . build upward momentum will be driven by the second-half macro-economic outlook and its implications for corporate profit,” he said. “With so many wildcards still in play, we expect equity markets to remain choppy.”The macro-economic data overshadowed another handful of mixed earnings reports.In the technology sector, Symantec and Motorola made ground after posting a better-than-anticipated forecast and a surprise profit, respectively.Symantec added 7 per cent to $21.07 while Motorola jumped 12.5 per cent to $8.64.That news helped offset decent results from Visa and Mastercard, which nevertheless left investors underwhelmed. Visa shares, which have jumped about 65 per cent since the company went public in March, fell 6.9 per cent to $73.06. Mastercard shares slid 9.8 per cent to $244.15.In the consumer discretionary sector, Starbucks posted its first loss in 16 years though the shares advanced 0.1 per cent to $14.69 after it reaffirmed its 2009 full-year forecasts.Energy was the worst performer, dropping 3.4 per cent after some disappointing results from ExxonMobil and Consol Energy. Exxon fell 4.7 per cent to $80.43 while Consol Energy slid 15.9 per cent to $74.39.Financials were another weak spot, falling 1.3 per cent. Wells Fargo lost 3 per cent to $30.27, JPMorgan slipped 2.3 per cent to $40.63 and Bank of America dipped 2.1 per cent to $32.90.Healthcare was the only sector to make consistent progress throughout the day, climbing 0.3 per cent.Aetna, the health insurer, led the way after it said profit had risen 6.5 per cent to $480.5m as the company added members. Aetna stood by its full-year profit forecast and the shares rose 1.7 per cent to $41.01.ImClone Systems surged 37.7 per cent to $63.93 after Bristol-Myers Squibb offered to buy the part of the company that it does not yet own for $4.3bn. Bristol slipped 1.8 per cent to $21.12.
394;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-07-31T18:19:37Z;MasterCard and Visa avoid slowdown;;MasterCard and Visa, the world’s two largest credit card networks, are so far resisting the effects of the US economic slowdown by focusing on overseas business and a growing preference for credit and debit cards over cash and cheques.Visa this week reported a 41 per cent rise in fiscal third-quarter profit to $422m as payment volumes, transactions and the number of cards in Visa’s network grew in every region the card issuer is active in.MasterCard on Thursday reported a $276m profit – excluding a charge related to a litigation settlement – as a result of a 25 per cent increase in second-quarter revenues based on similar factors.Visa and MasterCard are sidestepping the rising customer defaults at other card companies such as American Express and Capital One because they collect fees to process payments between financial institutions but do not take the risk of making loans to consumers.They are exposed to the potential for lower overall spending volumes as consumers tighten their belts but, even as the US economy slows, the growing adoption of card-based payments in the US and overseas has helped contribute to growth for the two companies.Joe Saunders, chief executive of Visa, said that, while the challenging US economic environment had contributed to a softening in traditional credit card spending, US consumers were continuing to spend on their debit cards, for example.Robert Selander, president and chief executive officer of MasterCard, said: “Businesses, consumers and governments around the world are demonstrating a growing preference for electronic payments, and our cross-border volumes remain healthy as cardholders come to rely on electronic payments and the ease, security and convenience they provide.”Meanwhile, more than 50 per cent of MasterCard revenue is generated outside of the US, which has also helped to counteract the impact of the US economic downturn.Visa is more reliant on the US market but still generates around a third of its revenue from overseas transactions.Shares in both MasterCard and Visa fell on Thursday, however, as MasterCard’s second-quarter profit was transformed into a $747m loss by a $1bn litigation charge. MasterCard was off 8 per cent by midday in New York while Visa lost 4.19 per cent.MasterCard reached a $1.8bn settlement with American Express in June over a lawsuit that claimed MasterCard, Visa and some of their member banks had blocked financial companies from issuing credit cards through American Express.The settlement followed an earlier agreement with Visa for $2.25bn, making the combined antitrust settlement the largest in the US. Neither MasterCard nor Visa admitted any liability as part of the settlements.
395;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-07-25T17:11:28Z;Merryn Somerset Webb: The recession has just turned global;;"The most interesting bits of corporate news out this week came from Vodafone and De Beers. These are two very different companies – mobile phone businesses drive their growth at the bottom end of the market and diamond companies at the top end. But they both said similar things; that the growth they were seeing in emerging markets was not quite compensating them for slowing sales in the West. Vodafone announced flat revenues in the UK and falling revenues in Spain. There was still growth in emerging markets but it slowed – from 12.6 per cent in the previous quarter to 9.2 per cent, while revenues per customer fell in India. De Beers repeated the theme, saying that until now the fall-off in US demand has been offset by fast growth in the likes of China and India but that it expected things to be more “challenging” from now on. So much for the idea, much loved by the City’s bulls, that there is no need to worry about global growth because Asia is growing fast enough to cover any fall-off in demand from the West. It turns out there is plenty of reason to worry: Asian demand can’t keep total global demand growing indefinitely – not for phones, not for diamonds and, as we seem to be learning this week, not for oil either.The oil price is now 12 per cent off its highs. It is nice to see a hint of rationality return to at least one market. The oil bulls remain convinced that rising demand and tight supply mean the price can go up for ever – and in a straight line too. However, not only does it mean no such thing (markets are prone to sudden changes of direction) but the bulls have failed to take into account the changing balance in the equation. This bull market started just as it should have – with rising demand in a growing global economy slamming against infrastructure-related supply constraints. But today the global economy is in hideous shape and all over the west demand for fuel is falling. Sales of oversized pick-ups and SUVs have fallen 18 per cent in the US in the last year. Mastercard reports that petrol demand has been falling in the US for 13 weeks.Overall, the International Energy Agency has cut its forecast of global demand growth for 2008 by almost 50 per cent to under 1 per cent (over the last few years it has tended to run at around 1.8 per cent). The supply situation has shifted too. New production is kicking in and, says Niels Jensen of Absolute Return Partners, another 3m barrels a day are forecast to be added to supply by late 2009.So what next for oil? Long term it is reasonable to think an uptrend will resume – the US will eventually recover and Asian growth isn’t going away forever. But it is reasonable to think that this pullback will last some time. Why? Because like all commodities, the oil price is sensitive to the ups and downs of the global economy. And over the next few years there will be many more downs than ups. US consumers appear to be finally capitulating (not, I suspect, out of choice but, given their levels of debt, out of desperation). They are even cutting back on gambling. Gaming revenues in Las Vegas are down more than 4 per cent this year. Consumer confidence surveys also consistently come in near historical lows. It seems that the US – just like the UK where retail sales fell nearly 4 per cent in June – has reached a saturation point. It’s hard to see how matters can improve. With no saving cushions; asset prices falling; and no more scope for mortgage equity withdrawal, consumers have little choice. They can either sell assets (tricky) or they can cut back on spending. They’re also likely to start bumping up their savings soon – after all, if your house isn’t your pension you’re going to have to get a real pension somehow.And that means that there is trouble ahead for emerging market growth. Chinese export growth is already slowing fast. In June it was just over 17 per cent year on year, down from 28 per cent in May and I’ll bet it falls a lot further – let’s not forget China’s chief export market is imploding (the US consumer still accounts for one-fifth of global demand). I suspect the global recession has only just begun. Lehman Brothers is forecasting oil prices to be $90 next year. I’d put my bets on seeing that long before we see $200.●In my last column, I wrote about the great rates you can get on cash at the moment and suggested looking at the Northern Rock fixed-rate bonds (7 per cent on the five-year bond!). Some of you are concerned that the government might remove its guarantee and it is true that it can. However three months’ notice has to be given so you’ll get plenty of time to move your money if needs be. Also reassuring is the fact that the Northern Rock website claims that “all term deposits including Fixed Rate Bonds” are covered “for the duration of their term”.Merryn Somerset Webb is editor of Money Week and previously worked as a stockbroker.

396;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-07-11T20:41:38Z;Wall St down as Fannie and Freddie sell off;;US stocks slumped as investors rushed to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on speculation that a government bail-out could wipe out shareholders while oil prices spiked above $147, pummelling consumer-facing stocks.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “The mood is pretty close to panic and unfortunately with good reason . . . There is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the financial system and the market hates uncertainty, so were are getting a very reasonable reaction.”Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, said the government would support the two mortgage giants in their “current form” which helped stabilise the government-sponsored entities’ share prices somewhat but the comments accelerated losses on the broader market.Fannie and Freddie have come under massive selling pressure this week on fears that they are not adequately capitalised to meet the demands of the current housing crisis. Analysts said falling share prices and widening credit spreads meant that raising the necessary funds would be extremely difficult.Freddie and Fannie shares plummeted as much as 50 per cent before recovering to $7.75 and $10.25, respectively, down 3.1 per cent and 22.4 per cent. JPMorgan slid 3.9 per cent to $33.16 and Bank of America fell 3.1 per cent to $21.67.Companies with exposure to the mortgage market were particularly hard hit. Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group, said: “People were counting on Freddie and Fannie to step in and bail out the housing market. If their funding costs go higher that is not a good thing.”Lehman Brothers slumped 16.6 per cent to $14.43 while the S&P 500 homebuilders index dropped 3.4 per cent to its lowest level in seven years. The financials sector as a whole fell 2.6 per cent and has now lost over half its value since the peak in February 2007.In the background, oil prices surged, before easing back, putting immediate pressure on consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks.Wal-Mart fell 1.6 per cent to $56.29 while Dillard’s dropped 7.4 per cent to $8.66. The consumer discretionary and staples sectors slid 1.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively.Markets pared losses at the close but by the end of the day all 10 leading industry groups were in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.1 per cent to 1,239.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped below 11,000 for the first time in two years before recovering to 11,100.54, down 1.8 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite was 10.8 per cent lower at 2,239.08.The S&P 500, down 1.9 per cent over the week, posted its sixth straight weekly decline – the longest such run for four years.Financials lost 6.3 per cent over the week, led by massive declines for Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Lehman Brothers. The three fell 46.6 per cent, 45.4 per cent and 36.8 per cent, respectively, over the week.Consumer discretionary stocks have also fared poorly, giving up 4.1 per cent as oil prices jumped higher.Those problems have heightened the uncertainties surrounding the second- quarter earnings season that kicked off this week. But the few significant reports released so far have been moderately encouraging.On Tuesday, results from Alcoa came in better than expected, helping it advance 5.7 per cent to $34.64 over the week. On Friday, industrial bellwether General Electric also posted decent second-quarter results. GE rose 2.8 per cent to $27.66 over the week.There were some bright spots on Friday, however. MasterCard rose 1.6 per cent to $257.35 on news that the company will be added to the S&P 500. Anheuser-Busch gained 8.6 per cent to $66.50 after reports that Belgian rival InBev had raised its offer for the maker of Budweiser to $70 a share.
397;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-06-25T20:52:17Z;MasterCard settles American Express lawsuit;;American Express has reached a $1.8bn settlement with MasterCard over a lawsuit that claimed MasterCard, Visa and some of their member banks had blocked financial companies from issuing credit cards through American Express.The settlement follows an earlier agreement with Visa for $2.25bn, making the combined antitrust settlement the largest ever in the US. It is likely to put pressure on both Visa and MasterCard to strike a deal with Discover Financial, which is seeking billions of dollars in damages for similar claims.Neither MasterCard nor Visa admitted to liability as part of the settlements.American Express’s suit against the two payment processors and eight of their member banks was launched in 2004. It came after the US Supreme Court let stand a ruling that forced Visa and MasterCard to allow member banks to issue credit cards on rival networks.Ken Chenault, American Express chairman and chief executive, said the proceeds from the MasterCard settlement, which will amount to quarterly payments of $150m over the next three years, would help curb the effects of a slowing economy.“Business conditions continue to weaken in the US,” he said, adding that “the antitrust settlement …provides us with a multi-year source of funds that should, among other things, help to lessen the impact of this weakening economic cycle”.American Express shares closed 2.8 per cent lower at $40.94 in New York.Together with the payments from Visa, American Express expects to receive $880m a year for three years. However, the size of the payments is contingent upon the performance of American Express’s US global network services business. MasterCard said it would take a $1bn charge in the second quarter related to the settlement.Robert Selander, MasterCard chief executive, said: “Eliminating the uncertainty, time commitment, and expense of a prolonged court case is in the best interest of our shareholders, our customers and our management team.”MasterCard, which went public two years ago, had been under pressure to resolve the suit because uncertainty surrounding the litigation was one of the few clouds looming over its stock. Shares in MasterCard rose by 3.4 per cent to $291.51 close at $289.79 on Wednesday.Visa settled with American Express in November 2007 and made an initial payment of $945m. It used proceeds from its initial public offering to make an additional payment in March and will pay $70m each quarter until the full settlement is reached.

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.4 per cent to 2,401.26.The day began on a strong note. Darden Restaurants, the operator behind the Olive Garden restaurant chain, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and also increased its dividend 11 per cent.Those results and a $2 drop in oil prices helped consumer discretionary stocks advance 1.5 per cent. Darden rose 7.1 per cent to $33.83 while Macy’s and Family Dollar Storesadded 3.4 per cent to $20.06 and 3.9 per cent to $19.90 respectively.Meanwhile, Dean Foods, the dairy processor, said second-quarter earnings would be higher than forecast thanks to the strength in its milk business. Dean Foods rose 9.4 per cent to $20.12, helping the consumer staples sector to a 1.2 per cent gain.Still, analysts warned that shares in consumer-facing companies were likely to struggle as the second-quarter earnings season gets under way.Deborah Weinswig, an analyst at Citigroup, said: “We believe there could be another round of downward earnings per share revisions in the near-term, as Street consensus does not appear to fully reflect an appropriate outlook on consumer spending amid current macro headwinds.”Equity markets held onto their gains after the Fed kept a key interest rate on hold at 2 per cent and noted increasing risks of inflation.Matt King, chief investment strategist for Bell Investment Advisors, said: “The market didn’t have much of a reaction as it was all pretty much as expected…The Fed has been preparing the market for interest rate hikes but I will believe it when I see it.”On Tuesday, stocks fell after a report showed slumping consumer confidence and a profit warning from industrial bellwether UPS. Financials had rallied despite that data and they continued to gain on Wednesday, rising as much as 3.4 per cent as investors bought back into heavily sold regional banking stocks before falling back to close up 0.4 per cent.Zions Bancorp was among the biggest gainers, adding 5.3 per cent to $32.64 after the Salt Lake City-based lender said it would not cut its dividend or raise dilutive capital. The bank added that credit quality for loans in California had “begun to stabilise”.Mastercard also made ground after it agreed to pay up to $1.8bn to settle claims that it blocked banks from issuing American Express cards. Mastercard added 3.4 per cent to $289.79 but American Express fell 2.8 per cent to $40.94 after commenting that credit indicators were deteriorating faster than expected.The technology sector received a boost from analyst upgrades and the pull-back in oil. Overnight, forecasts from Jabil Circuit topped estimates and the outlook prompted analysts at Merrill Lynch to advise buying shares in the mobile phone maker.Jabil Circuit led the gainers, jumping 15.6 per cent to $16.57 and it was followed higher by Advanced Micro Devices and Symantec which added 3 per cent to $6.43 and 2.6 per cent to $19.98 respectively.In other earnings news, Monsanto beat estimates as farmers spent more on fertiliser to take advantage of record prices for agricultural commodities. Monsanto also raised its full-year earnings guidance, but the shares, which have doubled in the past year, fell 3 per cent to $131.52.In the background, housing data showing that sales of new homes fell 2.5 per cent in May were largely offset by news that Congress was on the verge of approving legislation to overhaul mortgage financing and potentially rescue hundreds of thousands of homeowners from foreclosure. Homebuilders rose 0.2 per cent.By the close, eight of the 10 major industry groups on the S&P 500 were in the black. Only energy and industrial stocks were down, falling 0.5 per cent each after oil lost ground and Goldman Sachs recommended selling shares in Boeing arguing that a slowing economy would dent orders.Boeing slumped 6.9 per cent to $69.64 dragging aerospace stocks down 3.1 per cent.
399;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-06-25T18:06:08Z;Profit motive master-class;;Like thousands of other Mastercard employees, Linda Kirkpatrick remembers where she was on the morning of May 25 2006.Ms Kirkpatrick, who had joined the credit card group as an intern in 1997, was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, watching chief executive Robert Selander ringing the opening bell to mark the company’s $2.4bn listing.For Ms Kirkpatrick, the initial public offering was a watershed in Mastercard’s transformation from a loose association of thousands of member banks into a listed company charged with producing returns for shareholders.“It was the most momentous day in my 11 years at Mastercard,” recalls Ms Kirkpatrick, now a vice-president in the global accounts division. “From that moment on, the mindset of the entire company changed – we were no longer about pleasing our members, but about delivering shareholder value.”Shareholders have certainly received plenty of value from Mastercard since that day, thanks to a six-fold rise in the stock and steep growth in earnings.The financial performance is the most obvious by-product of a corporate metamorphosis that saw Mastercard swap the cosy inter-bank relationships of the previous three decades for the tough-love discipline of the stock market. Its story holds lessons for any company wishing to make the leap from private or government ownership into the capital markets arena.From Chinese state-owned enterprises and entrepreneurial technology companies to Visa, Mastercard’s arch rival, which has staged its own IPO, the central conundrum faced by management is the same: how to instil a profit-driven mentality into organisations that have focused on other priorities.In Mastercard’s case, the question was answered from the bottom up. As Chris McWilton, chief financial officer at the time of the listing, says, the company’s central challenge was to “make sure our employees knew how we made money”.The task involved a complete re-programming of Mastercard’s corporate culture. For years, the company’s 5,000-plus staff had been trained to boost the number of cards bearing its red and yellow logo by aggressively signing up banks and other credit card issuers without worrying too much about the bottom line.“We were not focused on profitable share,” says Mr Selander, who has led the company since 1997. “A lot of our employees worried about doing another deal, not another deal that actually made money.”The difference is crucial. Unlike financial groups that issue cards, Mastercard does not lend funds to customers, but collects a fee every time someone swipes one of its cards, as well as retaining a small percentage of the total value of the transaction. To boost profits, the company must strike agreements with those banks and financial groups whose customers are likely to use their Mastercards for frequent and expensive purchases.To instil the new mentality in its workforce, Mastercard adopted a carpet-bombing approach to the task.Rebecca Ray, a financial services trainer put in charge of the project, says the company wanted to hammer home the message to Mastercard’s entire global staff within three weeks of the IPO.On listing day alone, Ms Ray and her lieutenants scheduled four-hour meetings with employees in 36 cities around the world. Each gathering was chaired by a local senior leader who had been briefed on the new Mastercard.Employees were given three laminated slides outlining the company’s business model in brightly coloured drawings (see left) and encouraged to log in to an online tutorial explaining just how Mastercard was going to maximise profits and reduce costs.Judging by the company’s results, employees embraced the new credo with enthusiasm.Mastercard’s earnings rose from $266m in the year before the IPO to more than $1bn last year, helped by a near-doubling in revenues.Processes and governance at Mastercard’s headquarters in the aptly-named town of Purchase in New York state also had to be overhauled. Mr Selander says the two projects went hand-in-hand as the need to get employees on-message focused managers’ minds. “It put an obligation on us to define our business model more crisply than we had in the past,” he says.But shareholders and regulators needed more than some colourful slides. “Being public imposed new standards of transparency and disclosure and forced us to step up our financial and commercial rigour,” he says.The company put particular emphasis on improving its finance and audit functions. This radical upgrade in internal workings began years before the IPO and focused on nitty-gritty but crucial items such as more accurate forecasting of future business trends and a speedier closure of the books at the end of the quarter.“A lot of newly listed companies come up short because they underestimate the changes in processes and practices that are needed,” says Mr McWilton, who now heads the global accounts division.But the internal overhaul would have been futile without a similar change in the company’s relationship with its card-issuing customers. On this issue, Mastercard found itself in a tricky situation because, until the IPO, its main clients had also been its owners.This confluence of interests has attracted repeated scrutiny from US and European anti-trust watchdogs, suspicious of potential collusion between Mastercard and the banks at the expense of merchants and consumers. Some of the issues still linger. Yesterday, for example, Mastercard agreed to pay American Express up to $1.8bn to settle an antitrust lawsuit in the US.Mr Selander admits that the IPO, which left the banks with a non-voting stake, was partly driven by the desire to dispel the perception of Mastercard as “a bunch of banks sitting around fixing the game to the detriment of retailers and card-holders”. The flip side of the new profit-driven model, however, was that card issuers that had long regarded Mastercard as their property were now being asked to pay market prices for its services.Mr Selander says banks had always been concerned with Mastercard’s use of its capital – which they provided – but they had never been too focused on profits, knowing that such profits would have been generated at their expense. That fostered a close relationship between Mastercard and the issuers in which commercial considerations were diluted by the belief that they were in the same boat.For the company to succeed as a listed entity, it had to erase that mutual backscratching mentality and persuade customers that paying to take advantage of its scale and technology was worth it.Mr Selander admits this did not go down well with some customers but says his resolve was bolstered by the inescapable realisation it was no longer a bankers’ club. “We had to change our mindset,” he says. “We had to respond to [shareholders] and their endless appetite for profit improvements.”

Among the world’s most populous and fastest-growing cities, Shanghai’s position in the index was bolstered by its economic stability, its legal and political framework, an increased quality of life and China’s booming economy.Michael Goldberg, director of the study, said Shanghai was just one of several fast-developing cities. “The city whose score increased the most compared with London since last year is Moscow, followed by Singapore, Tel Aviv, Bogotá and Mumbai – all cities in new or emerging markets – while no North American city advanced in the index this year.”Los Angeles was displaced from the top 10 in this year’s ranking, making New York and Chicago the only two North American cities in this group.In the Middle East, six cities ranked in the index. Dubai’s flexible business climate made it the region’s top-ranking city at number 44, followed by Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Riyadh, Cairo and Beirut. The index’s top five Latin American cities were Santiago, Mexico City, São Paulo, Bogotá and Buenos Aires.The index combines seven measures of commercial power including flows of finance, economic stability and the creation and dissemination of knowledge. It was developed by a team of academics specialising in economics, business, urban studies and finance.
401;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-06-08T21:16:41Z;Singapore steals a march on Hong Kong;;"Hong Kong has been overtaken by Singapore in a new ranking of global commerce, the latest sign that its arch-rival is stealing a march in the battle to be Asia ’s leading international financial centre.The report on the top 75 worldwide centres of commerce, commissioned by MasterCard, shows Hong Kong slipping from 5th last year to 6th, while Singapore jumped two places to 4th. The city-state narrowly failed to take 3rd position from Tokyo, which owes its lofty position to its enormous domestic financial market. London and New York took first and second place.The survey findings are likely to generate further angst among policy-makers in Hong Kong, who have to balance the twin demands of deepening financial links with mainland China and maintaining its traditional position as a gateway for international trade.The index combines seven measures of commercial power. While Hong Kong retained its ranking as the world’s No.1 business centre, it trailed Singapore as a financial hub and in other areas including economic stability, legal and political framework and liveability.The figures show that Singapore pulled away from Hong Kong last year when it came to the ease of doing business, a measure which encompasses how difficult it is to open and close a business, hire staff and cope with the corporate tax burden.One of the authors of the report, Dr Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, economic adviser, Asia-Pacific, MasterCard Worldwide, said that even Hong Kong ’s position as the world’s leading business centre faced a serious challenge.He said: “Most multinationals keep their Asia headquarters in Hong Kong but there are signs that many could switch more functions to Shanghai. Hong Kong is top on this measure but it is vulnerable.”Dr Hedrick-Wong said that Hong Kong needed to become better attuned to the needs of international commerce if it was to rise up the rankings.He said: “The rise of China and Shanghai is beyond Hong Kong ’s control. Nevertheless policymakers [in Hong Kong ] need to take action at other levels such as improving fluency in the English language, liberalising immigration rules and reducing pollution.”In recent years Singapore has wooed international corporations with aggressive tax breaks, and established itself as a major centre for private banking and hedge fund activity with a regulatory framework perceived by many as more competitive than that offered in Hong Kong.China has five cities represented in the MasterCard index. Shanghai climbed eight places to 24th, with Beijing 57th, Shenzhen 60th, Chengdu 72nd and Chongqing 73rd. India boasts three cities in the rankings; Mumbai 48th, New Delhi 61st and Bangalore 66th."
402;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-06-06T02:49:59Z;Uefa awaits sponsorship bonanza;;As European football fans prepare to descend on Austria and Switzerland for the start of Euro 2008 on Saturday, tournament sponsors will have one eye elsewhere – on the worldwide television audience.Uefa, European football’s governing body, can look forward to the tournament already content that it will be a financial success.Sponsors and broadcasters, mesmerised by the global fixation with the “beautiful game”, are providing revenues to Uefa of an expected €1.3bn ($2bn, £1bn) – nearly 35 per cent more than the €853m Uefa raised from the 2004 tournament in Portugal.The value of television and new media rights has risen more than 40 per cent and the amount sponsors such as Adidas, Canon, Carlsberg, Castrol, Mastercard, McDonald’s and JVC are forking out for the right to have their products linked to the 31-game tournament has risen by more than 50 per cent since Portugal 2004.James Leipnik of Canon said Euro 2008 represented “an excellent opportunity to reach a worldwide audience and associate Canon with the positive emotions of world class football”.Buoyed by the increasing commercial value of its annual Champions League tournament, Uefa adopted a more aggressive approach to television rights sales and conducted direct sales to broadcasters outside Europe. Seeking domestic broadcast competition, it awarded selling rights to SportFive, a marketing agency based in Hamburg, having previously sold television rights through the European Broadcasting Union.Its global television rights deals have been made with broadcasters such as PCCW in Asia, ESPN in North America and al-Jazeera in the Middle East and North Africa. With a wider audience bringing in more revenue, sponsors have been prepared to pay more.Broadcasters are obliged to provide simultaneous coverage on the internet, and highlights will be made available on mobile phones.Given that the championships will for the first time be screened in China and India, Phillippe le Floc’h, Uefa’s marketing and media rights director, is wary of estimating just how broad that TV audience will be.He recognises that interest in China may be tempered by the failure of England to qualify for the finals – English clubs attract many fans in China – and by 3am broadcasts for live matches.“We will have more countries watching it this time, over 200, in much more depth and with more ways for people to watch,” he said.After struggling to spur interest in the tournament even in Europe during the 1980s and early 1990s, Uefa has got its act together, says Mr Le Floc’h. “We are really where we should be.”Though cumulatively the 19 days of the Beijing Olympics will attract by far the biggest television audience of the year, Uefa can safely assume that as in 2004 the final of the European Championships will pull in the biggest single viewership in the world. Four years ago the final in Lisbon was watched by 279m people.Uefa will consider widening the format for future championships beyond the 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. The growth of football in eastern Europe opens up the prospect of a tournament comprising 20 or 24 teams, rather than the 16 taking part this time.But Drew Barrand of the Sport Industry Group, a consultancy, says Uefa has got this wrong before, changing the Champions League to include more teams and finding it did not work.“They would like to be able to expand the Euros, provided it doesn’t detract from the proposition for sponsors and fans,” he said.Mr le Floc’h hinted that an expanded format was likely. “There is so much audience fragmentation and the media is fighting for audience share,” he said. “But sport is one of the few things that can integrate communities together, and properties like us deliver certainties to broadcasters as far as audiences are concerned.”
403;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-05-29T20:40:38Z;US stocks rise as oil prices edge down;;Wall Street stocks rose for a third straight session on Thursday as oil prices dropped, financials rallied on a bullish analyst report and data showed the US economy grew faster than previously thought in the first quarter.Crude prices dipped well below $130 a barrel on Thursday, giving companies dependent on discretionary consumer spending a boost.Some macroeconomic data also buoyed sentiment. In spite of inflation and the credit crisis, first-quarter gross domestic product came in at a revised 0.9 per cent, suggesting the US economy may yet skirt a full-blown recession.A rally in financials kicked markets into decidedly positive territory after a report from JPMorgan predicted the sector was due for a bounce based on tightening spreads on bank credit default swaps.Still, a rise in the number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week, after an unexpected fall in the prior week, held gains in check.The benchmark S&P 500 trimmed gains at the close but remained 0.5 per cent higher at 1,398.23 for the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.4 per cent at 12,646.22. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent to 2,508.32.In the past few days, equities have recovered about half the ground they lost last week as softening energy prices have offered some respite to US consumers.Rising prices are having a mixed impact on corporations and households. On Thursday, Sears Holdings, the department store chain, reported an unexpected first-quarter net loss, knocking its share price 3.6 per cent to $86.14.Analysts said that the store’s middle-of-the-range goods were particularly susceptible to the current economic slowdown as consumers were trading down to cheaper brands in order to save money. Conversely, Big Lots, which sells excess inventory, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits and raised its full-year earnings forecast.HJ Heinz was another consumer-facing company to report positive results and forecasts. The food group said fourth-quarter profit rose thanks to gains from currency effects and higher prices and raised its predictions for full-year earnings.Big Lots shares climbed 7.5 per cent to $30.66, Heinz climbed 3.6 per cent to $49.25, while the consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent.Whether corporations will be able to maintain that earnings growth going forward remains a moot point.Alongside the other data released on Thursday, the Department of Commerce noted that corporate profit growth during the first quarter rose 3.8 per cent after falling 3.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year.The headline numbers may go some way to easing fears that corporate profits will be swamped by rising costs and falling demand. But the details were less salutary as domestic profits and profits from financial firms both declined.Many are sceptical about the broader earnings outlook. Strategists at UBS said: “Estimates for this year may still be a bit high given our forecast for slowing growth and peaking margins . . . Moreover, estimates for 2009 appear far too rosy, driven by a forecast record expansion of profit margins.”Some of the weakest performers earlier in the week were amongst the strongest gainers on Thursday. Healthcare advanced 1.5 per cent in part due to a Goldman Sachs recommendation that investors should by call options in the sector.Merck was a notable gainer, adding 0.7 per cent to $38.92 after a series of court decisions overturned claims against the pharmaceutical giant resulting from its withdrawn painkiller, Vioxx.Consumer staples and financials added 1.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively.In financials, Bank of America, which rose 2.2 per cent to $34.60 and Citigroup, which added 2 per cent to $22.04, led the way.MasterCard was another stand-out, rising 7.7 per cent to $309, after it raised its targets for profit growth. Rivals Visa and American Express advanced 4.1 per cent to $85.25 and 1.3 per cent to $46.75 respectively.But material and energy stocks followed commodity prices lower, losing 0.9 per cent each. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and ConocoPhillips dropped 5.4 per cent to $113.18 and 1.7 per cent to $90.96.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
405;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-04-29T21:28:55Z;Rising defaults hit Countrywide;;Results from Countrywide Financial and MasterCard on Tuesday underscored the declining state of the US economy as mortgage defaults soared and more consumers turned to credit cards for basic purchases.Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, said it lost a larger-than-expected $893m in the first quarter as provisions for credit losses jumped ten-fold to $1.5bn and charge-offs on bad loans rose to $606m from $39m.Countrywide, a leading issuer of home loans to high-risk borrowers, teetered on the edge of bankruptcy last year before agreeing to a $4bn takeover offer from Bank of America.BofA expects to close the acquisition in the third quarter and has pledged to aid Countrywide borrowers in danger of losing their homes as their interest rates reset to higher levels.MasterCard on Tuesday said first-quarter profits more than doubled to $447m, or $3.38 per share, as US consumers put more expenses such as food and petrol on their cards.“We recognise that our customers are experiencing extraordinary challenging conditions,” said Robert Selander, MasterCard’s chief executive.Taken together, the results demonstrate the heavy pressure weighing on US consumers as the value of their home falls and the price of petrol, goods and other items soars.Credit card purchases in the US grew 8.9 per cent from last year to $259bn, although some of that growth represents the use of debit cards, which are equivalent to cash, rather than purchases on credit.MasterCard, which earns fees processing card payments, also experienced strong growth in Europe and Asia and benefited from a growing trend in which travellers from countries with strong currencies flock to the US and use their credit cards to fund purchases of everything from expensive dinners to luxury apartments.While MasterCard posted strong results, Countrywide suffered. Overall, the California-based lender said it lost $893m, or $1.60 a share in the first quarter compared with a profit of $434m, or 72 cents, in the same period last year.Provision for credit losses on Countrywide’s investment in residential loans soared to $1.5bn from $158m last year.Countrywide also increased its reserves for credit losses by about $1bn, to $3.4bn at the end of the quarter.The latest loss was Countrywide’s third in a row and could raise further questions about BofA’s ability to successfully integrate the troubled mortgage lender.
406;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-04-29T21:04:48Z;Wall St lower ahead of Fed decision;;Wall Street stocks hung in the doldrums on Tuesday as investors digested data showing that two pillars of the US economy – house prices and consumer confidence – continue to crumble, and a sell-off in commodities hit related stocks.The day began in downbeat fashion as markets reacted poorly to the S&P/Case Shiller 20-city house price index, which plunged for a 10th consecutive month and at an accelerating rate. The three-month annualised rate of decline in US house prices is now nearly 25 per cent.That prospect continues to damp consumer confidence. The latest survey showed consumer confidence hit the lowest level since just before the US-led invasion of Iraq.Julian Jessop at Capital Economics, said: “The financial markets may have decided that the glass is half full but consumers remain stubbornly miserable . . . All things considered, the downbeat views of consumers appear much closer to reality.”The biggest drag, however, was the materials sector which dipped 3.1 per cent, its biggest fall in over a month, following commodities prices lower.A mini-rally in technology, which climbed for the first time in three sessions, and some steady performances from consumer discretionary stocks helped markets retain a measure of composure.After a light session of trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,390.96, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 12,831.94. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,426.10.Investors remain listless ahead of a likely 25 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a host of potentially market-moving economic data to be released later in the week.With volumes on the low side, equity markets have treaded water for much of the week so far, piqued only by news that Mars, the confectioner, could purchase chewing-gum heavyweight Wrigley for $23bn, aided by Warren Buffett.Healthcare stocks lagged as poor earnings, analyst downgrades and news of drug approval setbacks hit the sector. Merck led the fallers, dropping 10.4 per cent to $37.14 after its cholesterol pill failed to win approval. It was followed by Medco Health, down 4.3 per cent to $49.12, and Tenet Healthcare, down 2.2 per cent to $6.55.Financials were in focus after Countrywide, the mortgage lender that Bank of America has agreed to buy, reported its third quarterly loss in a row. Analysts said the results may lead Bank of America to reduce or even cancel its offer to buy the company for $4bn in stock.Countrywide shares rose 0.3 per cent to $5.85, while Bank of America lost 0.8 per cent to $37.86 and the wider sector was mixed. The S&P 500 index of financial shares ended the day down 0.6 per cent.According to KBW, of the 119 banks it covers, just over half have missed consensus earnings estimates, because of rapidly deteriorating assets. More worryingly, the growth of non-performing assets has outpaced that of reserves suggesting more problems lie ahead.Despite the negative data, homebuilder stocks, which have been unpredictable in the face of the ever-deepening housing slump, were mixed on Tuesday. DR Horton dropped 2.7 per cent to $16.69 and Pulte Homes slid 2.8 per cent to $13.80 but Lennar and Centex added 3.8 per cent to $20.28 and 4 per cent to $22.27 respectively.In materials, the mood was broadly pessimistic. Titanium Metals lost 6.1 per cent to $15.95, Monsanto fell 9.1 per cent to $110.93 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 4.4 per cent to $110.72.But there were bright spots. Office Depot said first-quarter profits fell less than expected and its shares advanced 8.7 per cent to $13.Credit card companies outperformed. Visa said profit jumped 28 per cent thanks in part to strong international growth. Visa shares, which have risen more than 70 per cent since its $17.9bn initial public offering last month, added 6.9 per cent to $80.85.Meanwhile, MasterCard, Visa’s main rival, popped 12.7 per cent to $273.34 after it said first-quarter profit soared 85 per cent to $398m thanks to strong revenues, beating estimates.Technology was among the strongest sectors in the S&P 500 on the day. Corning added 3.3 per cent to $26.53 after it said first-quarter profit more than tripled, and Yahoo and Motorola climbed 3.6 per cent to $27.37 and 5.7 per cent to $10 respectively.
407;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;US retailers go after tax rebate billions;;US retailers are waging a promotional battle to win a share of the billions of dollars in tax rebates destined for US households as part of the $170bn (£86bn) federal economic stimulus package.Kroger and Supervalu, the two largest traditional supermarket chains, will give customers who convert their tax cheques into gift cards an extra 10 per cent of the sum transferred, offering, for instance, a $330 gift card for each $300 in rebate or refund money.Sears Holdings, which operates Sears department stores and Kmart discount stores, is offering a 10 per cent bonus on gift card purchases, provided customers convert their entire cheque.RadioShack, the consumer electronics chain, will cut 10 per cent off the price of purchases above $50, with the balance of the cheque put on to a pre-paid MasterCard.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said on Tuesday it would waive cheque-cashing fees at more than 3,500 stores – a tactic that contributed to its stores taking about 25 per cent of the last rebate programme in 2001.Some 130m households are expected to receive rebates of up to $600 an adult, which economists predict will be worth about $105bn, up from the $38bn distributed in 2001. Economists believe about 40 per cent of the rebate money will be spent rather than saved.Frank Badillo, chief economist at TNS Retail Forward, estimated that the extra $42bn would boost retail sales by about 1.5 percentage points in the current second quarter.He predicted this would increase to a 3 percentage point boost in the third quarter as the flow of rebate cheques peaks. “From the past, the discount stores should benefit more than other retailers, just because the rebates are skewed towards low- to middle-income households, and they are the ones most likely to spend, rather than to save of put the money to other non-retail uses.”But he said: “A lot of that is going to depend on the promotions that retailers put out there.”Most retailers expect the extra money spent to be divided between everyday essentials and discretionary items, with the balance depending on income levels.Steve Burd, chief executive officer of the Safeway supermarket group, said last week he did not expect the rebates to have a noticeable impact on food sales.“[People] might pay down some debt, they will spend some of that on food and we think we have a programme to capture some of that, but I don’t think that this money just automatically flows into foods.”Wal-Mart said it had launched a range of aggressive “roll-back” price cuts to coincide with the rebates. It is also using the rebates to promote use of new prepaid Visa cards aimed at customers without bank accounts.
408;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-04-20T20:51:51Z;Ten-year trends: Rise of machines and mobile technology;;"The level of loyalty or “bonding” (the key metric that helps determine the brand contribution) of the current top 100 most powerful brands is more than twice that of the average brand. This is the same as we saw 10 years ago, showing that the relationship consumers have with brands is as important as ever.The brand with the highest bonding this year is also the most valuable – Google with 45 per cent. In 1998, this honour went to Gillette (48 per cent) which still has one of the highest bonding scores, showing the power and endurance of a strong, well-managed relationship with consumers. But it also illustrates the shift from grocery and personal care brands to technology.Looking at the top 20 bonded brands across 20 countries and comparing the findings of 10 years ago we can see this distinct shift in consumer priorities.The number of technology brands has more than doubled, including the shift of telecommunications brands to wireless. In 1998, mobile phone penetration rates in many western countries were less than 50 per cent and computers were still a significant investment for a family.Today in most western markets mobile phone penetration is in excess of 100 per cent and a new laptop can be purchased for little more than a couple of days’ average pay – if it is not actually given away as an incentive for some other purchase. In emerging markets there are millions of potential consumers with the desire, the need and the income for technology.Ten years ago most consumers had not even heard of Google, today’s number one, or BlackBerry, this year’s fastest riser and top new entrant. Now it is common to see BlackBerry users accessing the internet and searching with Google on the move in many parts of the world. It is therefore not a surprise to see technology brands are worth 52 per cent more on average than other brands in the top 100.We seem to be more health conscious – the bottled water segment of the soft drinks market has boomed over the last decade. However it will be interesting to see how much the growing concern about the environmental impact of bottled water affects the category.Health takes second place to convenience for some – we have seen an increase for fast food brands – but legislative pressure on advertising and labelling and self-regulation on health issues is likely to spread, affecting much of what we might like to eat and drink. This may eventually change our attitude to and relationship with key brands.There are fewer financial services brands represented among the top bonded brands than 10 years ago and even those financial brands in the top 100 have lost a quarter of their bonding. The negative press on the sub-prime lending crisis and on financial probity may exacerbate this. A look across the Brandz data shows that consumers are nearly half as likely to tell others about financial services than almost any other type of brand, but that they are more likely to listen out for information about them. The implication is that consumers are primed to watch for negative finance stories.Our analysis shows that one of the main barriers to bonding with financial services brands is a lack of trust, in both developed and emerging markets.We have learnt that the top brands’ success comes from four key areas:•Strong business basics•Clarity of brand associations•Projected leadership•A great product experienceMost of the brands in the rankings have strong business basics, usually backed by a strong corporate culture. GE, IBM and McDonald’s (with its latest initiative to provide recognised academic qualifications for its staff) are all good examples.The second crucial element is that the brand stands for something. The most successful brands are very clear about what they offer the consumer.Gillette is “the best a man can get”; L’ Oreal is “because you’re worth it” and “for everything else there’s Mastercard”.These are the convenient handles consumers need to choose between brands.The third criterion is whether a brand acts like a leader in its category. A brand needs to demonstrate leadership in a relevant way. Perhaps there is something in the innovation or product style or how the brand interfaces with the customer that sets it apart and drives perceptions. Nokia, Porsche and, of course, Google have these qualities in spades.Finally, a strong brand needs to deliver on its promise through a consistently good experience – preferably a great one. BMW’s driving experience, BlackBerry’s ubiquitous convenience for mobile professionals and Zara’s delivery of tailored fashion at affordable prices all get users talking.As Hayes Roth, chief marketing officer at leading branding and design business Landor Associates, observes: “In the end, all the fine promises and business and marketing acumen come down to one simple question: does my actual experience with the brand meet or exceed my expectations?”“It is no coincidence that virtually all of the Brandz top 20 most valuable brands invest heavily in providing consistently superior product, service and retail brand design as the most tangible and compelling expression of a positive brand experience.”Innovation and revitalisation allied to a clear brand promise, delivering a great experience backed up by a sound and ethical corporation – that is the route to continued financial success."
409;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-04-16T03:24:11Z;European banks to decide on Visa rival;;Leading French and German banks hope to decide within months on whether to set up a European debit card payment network that would be a rival to schemes operated by MasterCard and Visa.The banks – which include Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and BNP Paribas – are in talks with the European Commission over the plan but want more regulatory clarity before they decide to go ahead.Interest in a home-grown payment scheme comes as MasterCard and Visa have come under scrutiny by Brussels for the level of interchange fees charged when processing card payments. It also follows stock exchange listings by Visa and MasterCard that banks fear will reduce their negotiating power with the US companies.However, a person familiar with the plan – dubbed “Monnet” – said the Commission would need to accept an appropriate level of interchange fees before the banks would invest in a pan-European system. Banks might prefer to continue to use Visa and MasterCard without “a clear solution” from the Commission, the person said.The EU and institutions such as the European Central Bank have been keen to encourage new consortia to process debit and credit card transactions, believing customers could benefit from lower costs. This year a single European payments area has been introduced in 31 countries and by next year it is intended that direct debit transactions should cost the same across Sepa.Banks in Germany and France would give any scheme a critical mass, according to those familiar with the plans, since the two countries account for almost one-third of debit payments within Sepa.Officials in the Commission’s competition department confirmed there had been contacts with the Franco-German consortium, along with several other parties. They stressed that no decisions on the merits of any scheme had been made.A spokesman for Charlie McCreevy, the internal market commissioner, said that it was essentially for market participants to decide what action they wanted to take but that it had always been envisaged that Sepa would encourage new players into cross-border payments.
410;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-04-07T06:39:49Z;The times of my life;;"I write this column on my birthday – a big birthday – so you will allow me some self-indulgence. Let’s not talk figures. Let us evoke some images from the year of my birth instead: Elvis drafted into the US Army, the burning up of Sputnik One, the 17-year-old Pelé weeping into his shirt, overwhelmed by his own genius, perhaps fearful of where it would take him. (Answer: a global ambassadorship for Mastercard.)It was a great year for crazed egos – Madonna and Michael Jackson share my year of birth – and for communism. The day after I was born, Fidel Castro began his attack on Havana. Earlier in the year, Bertrand Russell had launched the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the Pope declared a patron saint of television, St Clare. Nuclear bombs are still with us and so, just about, is Castro. Television is more unholy than ever.I loved my childhood because it took place in the 1960s. Cliché has it that one should resent the advancement of years, but how can I? I feel privileged that I can remember, with reasonable clarity, the Beatles, Muhammad Ali and the lunar landings. There has been nothing like them in the intervening years. It wasn’t all shuffles and moonsteps. I lived in the US as a child and I remember that the first long word I learned to spell was “assassination”.I was in Washington when Martin Luther King told us what his dream was, although I was playing cowboys and Indians that day. About three-quarters of my birthday and Christmas presents took the form of guns, grenades, flak jackets, helmets, axes, bayonets, warships, fighter planes, armoured troop carriers, and troops. I didn’t need Martin Luther King to tell me it was a violent time, only that it needed to be reformed. I bombed Japanese bases and banished the Sioux from our (their) land on a daily basis.My first engagement with culture was to be given a copy of the Beatles’ new single, “I Want to Hold Your Hand”, as a present from my parents. It felt ecstatic to me, and not just because I was five years old. The technical accomplishment achieved in that three minutes was impressive enough (for a forensic analysis, read the late Ian MacDonald’s wonderful Revolution in the Head); the tone of the song, blissful and cheeky, at once transcendent and rooted in the everyday, was unique. The song’s joy was palpable, even to a five-year-old. I grew a fringe and stopped torturing the Sioux.In the 1970s, everyone grew their fringes out and wanted to look like the Sioux. I loved the 1970s too. It is a much-maligned decade today, riddled as it was with strikes and blackouts, and bad clothes and food, weirdly ironised by today’s retro-loving sophisticates. But it was full of cultural treasures too. A string of cinematic masterpieces in the early part of the decade made me very scared of grown-up life: The Exorcist, The Devils, Clockwork Orange. I remember an Antonioni season at the National Film Theatre in London that taught me about alienation but I also remember thinking that being rich, Italian and beautiful was nothing to get alienated about, so that shows how much I knew.I didn’t enjoy the 1980s too much, but if I sit here making jokes about puffy shirts and men’s mascara I begin to sound grumpy, which is not the way to be on a big birthday. It seems self-evident to me that many vibrant art forms lost their way in the 1980s, possibly because its practitioners were busy buying shares in British Telecom. Cinema became infantile (nothing was more alienating than the stratospheric success of the post-Star Wars generation of filmmakers). I shall skate over the 1990s altogether, because Nietzsche’s theory of eternal recurrence had well and truly kicked in: everyone bought Beatles compilations, wore flares, and reinstated the word “shag” in place of the curiously unarousing “bonk”. We were back where we started.The 20th century dribbled, culturally, to a dreary close. But, amazingly, the 21st century has got off to a remarkable start. I still believe that the content of popular culture became fatally compromised as the monetary stakes involved in its production became absurdly high. But its essentially democratic message got through. I see temples of “high” culture all around that concern themselves more than ever with speaking to as wide an audience as possible. They rightly rally against elitism, while remaining committed to excellence. They use fiendishly clever marketing strategies, and attract millions of people to see strange, allusive works of art.There is a new-found belief in culture, that it can really achieve things. China exports its culture, to help persuade the world that there really is a new superpower on the world stage. Dubai and Abu Dhabi, cash-rich and boastful, import culture to give their nascent city-states the lustre of true nationhood. British and Iranian scholars co-operate on exhibition loans, so that they may whisper mutually held truths that remain unspoken in the Sturm und Drang of their countries’ political conversations.Inside Britain itself, those great aspirations of postwar cultural idealism, as expressed by the Edinburgh festival and the Festival of Britain, are largely abandoned. Those great works of poetry, classical music and avant-garde theatre will never speak to a mass audience. They are simply too difficult and too abstract.During my largely happy three decades of adulthood, I have been moved, inspired and challenged by evenings at the opera, the ballet, and the concert hall. But they remain curiously stubborn art forms. What some see as reassuring constancy, I see as maddening inertia: the same bow-ties, the same shouts of bravo, the same bouquets. Why? They must act as the start, not the end point, of our cultural conversations.It is new work that we must encourage, attend, applaud. Culture has taken its time in responding to the technological revolutions of the past couple of decades but it is getting there. Expect some great things in the future. As for me, I have resolved to give myself the ultimate cultural birthday present on this solemn day: I am giving up on Wagner. It will make the next 50 years fly by.peter.aspden@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/aspden"
411;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Brussels probe into Visa Europe’s cross-border fees;;Visa Europe, a franchise of the world’s biggest credit card network, is under investigation by European Union competition authorities over the cross-border fees it sets for transactions.Wednesday’s move by the European Commission follows its ruling that similar charges set by MasterCard breach EU rules. The crackdown may hit revenues at banks that issue cards.The probe into Visa Europe will look into interchange fees paid between the banks servicing shops that accept credit and debit cards, and those that service cardholders.Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, has said such fees act as a tax on consumption for all shoppers and has ordered MasterCard to change its method for setting the charges. Yet, the Commission said the start of proceedings into Visa Europe did not imply it had proof of an infringement.Retailers, who pay interchange fees on card transactions, welcomed the move. The British Retail Consortium said the fees were much higher than the costs card companies incurred in processing transactions and that there was no transparency over how they were calculated.The European Retail Round Table said that Ikea paid €90m ($142m) annually and Tesco paid about €128m in fees to the banks for processing credit and debit cards.Derek Chambers, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, told Bloomberg: “The interchange fee is probably set at well over what it actually costs the process, and the gap has been a substantial source of revenue for the banks’.“If it is lowered or removed, it would free up competition and that could mean lower fees for banks.’’In 2002, Visa International reached a settlement with the Commission to resolve a dispute over interchange fees, agreeing to reduce the charges progressively.However, that deal expired last year and Visa Europe said on Wednesday it sought a new agreement with the regulator. “We see no evidence that Visa Europe’s interchange has acted as a tax on consumption. The net result of a substantial reduction in interchange would see a disproportionate shift in the costs of the card payments system from retailers to consumers.”Visa Europe is owned by its 4,600 European member banks and last year became independent of Visa, which floated on the New York Stock Exchange this month.MasterCard this month launched a legal challenge to the Commission’s ruling in December.The company was told either to revise its method for setting the charge within six months or face fines.If Visa Europe were found guilty of using restrictive business practices, it could face similar potential penalties to Mastercard.
412;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-03-18T23:46:08Z;Visa stages largest ever US IPO;;Visa Inc, the world’s largest credit card network, on Tuesday set a record for US initial public offerings by raising $17.9bn, providing a welcome windfall to several prominent US banks.Visa had decided to go ahead with the offering in spite of recent nervousness in equity markets and the continuing threat of a global economic slowdown. Tuesday’s pricing came after financial shares rallied strongly on hopes that the worst of the recent credit market turmoil might be over.The company’s shares priced at $44 per share, which was above the pre-IPO range of $37 to $42. They will begin trading under the ticker “V” on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.If the company decides to float its share overallotment – an additional 40.6m shares – the IPO would raise as much as $19.65bn, almost double the $10.6bn record for a US listing set by AT&T in 2000. The proceeds from the IPO will help leading banks boost their profits at a time when credit market problems have reduced revenues from many of their traditional activities.JPMorgan Chase, which this week agreed to buy Bear Stearns for just $2 per share in a fire sale engineered by US regulators, stands to make a gain of about $1.2bn as Visa’s largest selling shareholder. Bank of America will make about $600m and Citigroup $300m. The banks will cash in about half their stakes.Analysts said Visa and rival MasterCard are insulated from rising defaults and late payments because, unlike American Express and Discover Financial Services, neither of them actually extends credit to cardholders. The banks that issue the cards take the credit risk.Some analysts had said the company’s US bank shareholders may have put pressure on the company to proceed after the banks suffered heavy writedowns as a result of the US credit crisis.About $3bn of the proceeds will go into a fund to protect investors from legal claims. Visa faces legal actions alleging anti-competitive practices.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters of the issue. Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Wachovia also worked on the flotation.
413;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-03-03T22:53:42Z;MasterCard to fight EU payment ruling;;MasterCard has launched a legal challenge to the decision by Europe’s competition authorities that the card company’s fees on cross-border payments are illegal.The European Commission ruled in December that the credit card company’s so-called interchange fees for cross-border card transactions breached European competition rules because they unjustifiably inflated costs for retailers and consumers.Interchange fees are those paid between banks servicing shops that accept credit and debit cards and those servicing cardholders.With a large number of national competition authorities also looking at the legitimacy of interchange fees on domestic card payments, the Commission’s decision has wide potential implications.But on Monday, MasterCard confirmed that it had launched a formal appeal at the European Court of First Instance.It highlighted several areas where it believed the Commission had erred, claiming that interchange fees generally were necessary and efficient, and that its own fees were “fair”.MasterCard also said the Commission had been wrong to conclude that, in spite of an initial public offering two years ago, the card company and its bank customers remained an “association of undertakings”, and that the fees were the decisions of an association that restricted competition under European law.“If left unchallenged, and especially if followed by national regulators, the Commission’s decision would not only be bad news for consumers but a blow to the European payments industry,” said Javier Perez, president of MasterCard Europe.The Commission, by contrast, has stressed that, while interchange fees are not inherently illegal, they are only compatible with European Union competition rules if they contribute to technical and economic progress and benefit consumers. It claims that MasterCard’s fees do not meet those criteria. Separately, the Commission is holding discussions with Visa over that company’s fees.However, MasterCard did add that it intends to comply with the Commission’s order while the appeal, which could take a couple of years, proceeds.In December, the Commission told the card company to withdraw the fees by June 21 or face daily penalty payments of up to $316,000. The card company said on Monday it was due to meet the Commission shortly to discuss compliance.
414;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:26:46+0000;Indian cities ranked last for air quality;;India’s two leading cities are at the bottom of an environmental ranking due out on Thursday that suggests water and air quality will increasingly become a challenge for the development of Mumbai and New Delhi.The report – undertaken by MasterCard but based on a compilation of scientific data – puts China’s leading cities above their Indian counterparts, even though Hong Kong and Beijing in particular have come under intense criticism over air quality in the run-up to this year’s Olympic Games.“The fact that China is now under a constant magnifying glass does not mean we should ignore other places and some objective facts,” said Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, economic adviser to MasterCard and author of the report. “India really has to move fast to prevent slipping down any further.”Over the past five years, China has invested about 15 times more than India in transport, sewage and other infrastructure that contribute to improving living standards in urban centres, according to Mr Yuwa.Additionally, India’s democratic system and policy-making process make it harder to implement reform, while “China can clearly mobilise”.The study ranked 21 leading cities in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. ­Melbourne led the ranking ahead of Johannesburg and Singapore. Among Chinese cities, the worst performer was Shenzhen, the industrial hub next to Hong Kong, which itself was the best-ranked Chinese city.Mr Yuwa said the weighting given by MasterCard to different environmental problems was subjective and debatable.But MasterCard used data from the World Health Organisation, other United Nations agencies and nat­ional agencies such as the US geological survey and Mercer, the consultancy. The study gave three water-related issues – potability, availability and the sewage system – a combined weighting slightly above that of air quality.However, on air quality alone, Mumbai and New Delhi also came equal bottom, below Jakarta, Cairo, Hong Kong and Shenzhen.The study also takes into account natural phenomena and Johannesburg’s high ranking in part reflects its favourable location in terms of limited vulnerability to natural disasters.In contrast, Tokyo was ranked lower because of the risk of earthquakes, typhoons and volcanic eruptions. Sydney also ranked down the list because of the risk of rising sea levels, water scarcity and fires.Although the MasterCard report looked at the environmental dimension of urbanisation in terms of health risks, it also reflected on whether such cities can develop as business centres. “If the quality of life deteriorates in a city, then it could in the end destroy the basis of the commercial value,” Mr Yuwa said.
415;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-02-25T22:11:30Z;Visa record;;"Here is a rare sight: a US financial company actually raising new capital from a position of strength. Visa, the credit card payment network, is set to pull in as much as $18.8bn from selling about half of its shares later this year. That would make it the biggest initial public offering in US history.At first sight, the timing looks challenging. The US financial system continues to take hits from all sides. The banks that control the Visa network have taken heavy losses on asset writedowns and are starting to take higher provisions on credit card portfolios as US consumers suffer.But that should not take a heavy toll on Visa’s transaction-based business. Not only is it geographically diverse, with growth particularly strong outside the US, but the group is in the middle of a secular expansion story as spenders round the world move from cash and cheques towards plastic. The share price of rival MasterCard tells the story. As other financial sector companies have seen their stock prices pummelled, its value has risen fivefold since its 2006 IPO.Visa will piggy-back off that performance. Not only has MasterCard provided a glimpse of the revenue growth potential but it has also given a taste of the potential for improved margins once the business is run as a true for-profit operation rather than as more of a utility for the banks.For capital-hungry banks it should provide a tasty windfall – even though JPMorgan, among the least needy, has a stake worth about $4bn while struggling Citigroup has one quarter of that.Of the cash being raised, $3bn will go into a fund to pay for ongoing litigation against Visa. But
a whopping $10bn will be used immediately to buy a chunk of the shares owned by big banks.So those same banks leading the deal have plenty of incentive to ensure a healthy offer price rather than leaving lots of value on the table as MasterCard, in retrospect, appears to have done. Do not expect Visa to enjoy a rerun of its smaller rival’s share price bonanza.Post and read comments on this Lex"
416;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-02-25T20:22:21Z;Visa plans record $19bn listing;;Visa Inc, the world’s largest credit card network, said on Monday it was hoping to raise up to $18.8bn in its long-awaited flotation, which will bring a badly needed financial boost to some of the US’s biggest banks.Visa has decided to press ahead with what will be the largest ever initial public offering in the US in spite of nervous equity markets and the threat of a global economic slowdown.Michael Lafferty, head of Lafferty Group, a card consultancy, said the decision to go ahead may reflect pressure from its US bank shareholders which include Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.“All of these banks suffered heavy writedowns in the wake of subprime mortgage difficulties, and the proceeds from Visa’s IPO would go some way to alleviating pressure on their 2008 results.”Ironically, the biggest shareholder, JPMorgan Chase, is one of the strongest of the top US banks. It stands to make a gain of about $4bn, Bank of America will make about $2bn and Citigroup $1bn. The banks will cash in about half their stakes.JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters of the issue.Visa’s IPO, which is expected in March or April, comes two years after the flotation of MasterCard, its smaller rival which was also owned by its bank members. The shares have soared by more than 400 per cent. The Visa IPO will overshadow the $10.6bn record for a US listing set by AT&T in 2000.Both networks, which process transactions for the banks that issue their cards, have been helped by strong global economic growth and rising international travel, which has boosted lucrative cross-border transactions. They are also enjoying the rapid switch from cash to card usage in fast-growing emerging markets.The company to be floated combines all Visa’s operations outside Europe. Visa Europe is to remain separately owned by its European member banks, which its board says will leave it better positioned to deliver a borderless payment market.According to Lafferty Group, the markets in which Visa Inc operates showed annual growth of billed volumes of 24.6 per cent over the past two years compared with 9 per cent in Europe.Some $3bn of the proceeds will go into a fund to protect investors from legal claims. Visa is facing legal actions alleging anti-competitive practices.
417;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-02-23T04:02:04Z;Mark Sellers: Take advantage when good companies come to market;;"When Google completed its initial public offering in August 2004, the stock seemed overpriced. Even after reducing its IPO price from $108 to $85, the company’s trailing price/earnings ratio was well over 200. Journalists, analysts and market pundits exclaimed that Google was the most overpriced IPO in years, and warned investors to avoid it.Shortly after the IPO, analysts were confused about how to model the company’s earnings. The average analyst estimate for Google’s first quarter as a public company was 56 cents a share, but the range of estimates was all over the map. Clearly, there was no “consensus” earnings number. Most analysts were cautious.When Google then reported earnings in October 2004, its earnings per share were 70 cents a share, and the stock jumped 15 per cent in one day. Analysts then rushed to increase their estimates for the following quarter, but were again too cautious. The next quarter, Google beat the average analyst estimate by 15 cents, earning 92 cents a share compared with estimates of 77. The quarter after that, Google earned $1.29 compared with the average estimate of 92 cents.As it turned out, Google’s stock was incredibly cheap at its IPO price of $85. Over the following year, the company’s actual (not estimated) earnings turned out to be $4.27 per share. This meant that it was priced at just 19.9 times its forward earnings on the date of its IPO, though no one knew that at the time.We can learn something valuable from this historical analysis: great companies are often treated by the market as if they are merely average companies when they first become public. Over the first four to six quarters as a public company, expectations rise as analysts come to appreciate the company’s competitive position. At the same time, analyst estimates become more clustered around a consensus, which gives investors more certainty about the company’s earnings outlook.The interaction of these two factors causes a “double-whammy” effect: not only do earnings expectations rise, lowering the forward p/e ratio, but the risk premium priced into the stock falls. In other words, both the earnings outlook and the p/e ratio go up. These two factors work like a slingshot, causing the stock price to rise dramatically. Google, for instance, saw its stock rise from $85 to $280 in its first year of trading as earnings estimates rose and the p/e ratio expanded.There are other examples of this phenomenon. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange went public in December 2002 at a price of $42 a share, which was about 18 times trailing earnings per share. That seemed a fair price to many pundits, who said the stock was fully valued at that amount. But the company continually beat estimates because of its operating leverage and ability to fend off would-be competitors. The stock price responded by rising more than 700 per cent over the next three years as earnings expectations continually rose and the p/e ratio expanded dramatically.Another good example of this “increasing expectations” phenomenon is Morningstar, which went public in May 2005 at $18. Today the stock is $66, a 270 per cent increase.There are two fundamental factors all these companies share. First, they have an “economic moat”, or natural defence against competitors, allowing them to generate high returns on capital. Second, they have lots of operating leverage (as opposed to financial leverage); in other words, a 10 per cent increase in revenue translates into far more than a 10 per cent increase in bottom-line profits. Operating leverage is almost always underestimated by analysts when they are not very familiar with a company.When a company with these two traits begins to trade publicly, analysts are too cautious at first. They do not know the company that well, so their estimates are all over the place. Investors can play this to their advantage by buying and holding great companies when they go public, ignoring what pundits or analysts say and betting that analyst estimates will rise and become more clustered, causing the p/e ratio to rise at the same time as earnings expectations.Excess investment returns come from buying an asset when the market’s expectations are too low, and selling when expectations are too high. Nowhere are expectations off so much as when a great company first trades publicly. In August 2006, I highlighted two stocks here that I felt were at the beginning of this “increasing expectations” cycle: Mastercard and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since then, Mastercard is up 314 per cent and Chipotle is up 92 per cent.A future IPO that I’m excited about is Visa, which plans to go public this year and is certainly a wide-moat company (even more so than Mastercard) and has oodles of operating leverage.

418;MA;Mastercard Inc;2008-01-31T22:22:48Z;US stocks rebound on bond insurer hopes;;US stocks rebounded strongly on Thursday after MBIA helped alleviate some of the concerns about troubled bond insurers at the end of the worst January for equities since 1990.Sentiment improved considerably after MBIA it had been the target of “fear-mongering” and was confident of retaining its triple-A rating.However, after the closing bell Standard & Poors served a reminder that bond insurers’ problems were not completely solved as it placed MBIA on watch for possible downgrade.Volatile equities had slumped at the open after a spike in jobless claims added to worries about the US labour market market as consumer spending slowed.Investors later rushed to buy into weakness after the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut raised the prospect of cheaper borrowing costs, a potential boon for financial companies and the prostrate real estate market. Energy companies rem­ained a weak spot, however, as corporate earnings disappointed.The S&P 500 closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,378.47 having initially fallen 1.6 per cent. The index fell 6.1 per cent in January, its worst start in 18 years.The S&P homebuilder index enjoyed a particularly strong bounce on Thursday, rising 11.6 per cent as investors cheered Pulte Homes‘ improved liquidity position. Its shares jumped more than 20 per cent to $16.32.The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than more than 450 points from its session low to close up 1.7 per cent at 12,650.36. The Nasdaq Composite also gained 1.7 per cent to 2,389.86.“[The rebound] is primarily due to MBIA. There’s a lot of short covering, especially in the homebuilders,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.Stocks hit the skids in early trading after a sharp spike in weekly claims for un­employment benefit, which jumped 69,000 to 375,000, the highest level since October 2005, unsettled investor. Economists had expected about 320,000.Although these numbers are often volatile and may have been affected by the timing of a public holiday, the uptick will renew concerns that Friday’s employment report may not be as strong as hoped. Morgan Stanley cut its payrolls forecast to 90,000 from 110,000, still significantly more than than December’s 18,000.The bond insurance sector once again dominated market chatter as MBIA reported a $2.3bn fourth-quarter loss after writing down $3.5bn of credit derivatives. But the shares rallied 11 per cent to $15.50 after its chief executive said the company was best positioned to avoid a rating downgrade. Ambac Financial, a rival, climbed 6.8 per cent to $11.59.If bond insurance losses can be contained and earnings visibility increases, many analysts think the beaten-down S&P financial sector, up 2.7 per cent on Thursday, could become an attractive investment.Mastercard, rose 11.2 per cent to $210.09 on Thursday after fourth quarter earnings jumped nearly seven-fold. Meanwhile Bank of America rose 4.7 per cent to $44.18 after a hedge fund said it was seeking to block its takeover of Countrywide Financial, the mortgage lender.Investors also bought battered consumer stocks, spurring a 4.4 per cent jump on the S&P retail index. A Deutsche Bank analyst upgraded the broadline retail sector to “neutral” from “cautious” and said said “the worst will soon be behind us”. Bear Stearns upgraded Nordstrom’s sharesprompting a gain of 5.4 per cent to $38.85.But mixed earnings and the slowdown in consumer spending underscored the riskiness of calling a bottom in the retail stocks. Personal spending rose 0.2 per cent in December, its slowest pace in six months/Procter & Gamble, up 0.7 per cent at $65.56, increased fiscal second-quarter earnings 14 per cent and the company raised its full-year outlook.Burger King, up 2.9 per cent at $46.51, also beat estimates as second-quarter profit jumped 29 per cent. Mattel rose 10.9 per cent to $21.01 after beating quarterly profit forecasts.In contrast, Starbucks’ cautious outlook for 2008 unnerved investors. The shares fell 1.6 per cent to $18.91.After the close Google‘s fourth quarter profit missed expectations causing the shares, which closed up 2.9 per cent at $564.30, to slump 8.1 per cent.Adobe Systems fell 2.8 per cent to $34.93 yesterday after Jefferies & Co. downgraded it from “buy” to “underperform”.In energy, Cameron International dropped 6.9 per cent to $40.10 after the oil services company gavea weaker-than-expected earnings guidance. Marathon Oil’s fourth-quarter earnings fell 38 per cent as refining margins weakened and its shares shed 7.3 per cent to $47.21.
419;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Brussels tells MasterCard to cut fees;;MasterCard was told on Wednesday it faces daily fines of up to $316,000 unless it slashes the cross-border fees it charges for credit and debit card payments.The credit card company was told by the European Commission it was in breach of competition rules by charging excessively high interchange fees which inflated costs to both retailers and consumers. Interchange fees are paid between banks servicing vendors and the banks servicing the cardholder.MasterCard said it would launch a legal challenge to the ruling which is expected to have wide ramifications. Brussels gave the company six months to withdraw its current fee structure or face heavy daily penalties if it failed to comply.The Commission said that these would be calculated at 3.5 per cent of the company’s global daily turnover in the previous year. MasterCard reported full-year revenues of $3.3bn for 2006. The Commission accused MasterCard of charging excessively high fees on cross-border transactions four years ago but the dispute dates back to complaints first received in the 1990s.MasterCard had said interchange fees were vital to facilitating transactions. In particular, it said its system balanced the costs and benefits between cardholders and retailers.Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, said the decision did not mean that all multilateral interchange fees were illegal.The decision was welcomed by retailers. The British Retail Consortium described it as a “major victory” while the European Retail Round Table, comprising leading multinational retailers such as Carrefour and Ikea said it should “open the way for national competition authorities to take similar action”.Up to 12 EU member states are believed to be looking at the legality of interchange fees although investigations are at differing stages. An Office of Fair Trading probe in the UK is the most public.Ms Kroes said the decision would provide more legal certainty. She said the Commission did not intend to prohibit all interchange fees. “Each and every scheme” would be examined on its merits.The Commission moved against MasterCard a year after Visa, its rival, struck a 2002 deal to exempt interchange fees for cross-border payments from competition rules in return for modifications, including a cut in fees.Visa’s exemption expired on December 31 and any fresh deal will have to be in line with the MasterCard findings.
420;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-12-18T17:36:21Z;Mastercard expected to appeal ruling;;Mastercard is widely expected to launch an appeal if, as expected, the European Commission finds that its interchange fees on cross-border payments breach competition rules in a decision due to be announced on Wednesday.Interchange fees are paid between banks servicing shops that accept credit cards and the banks servicing the cardholder. The European Commission accused the international payments company of charging excessively high fees on cross-border transactions in a statement of objections four years ago.Mastercard, however, claims that interchange fees play a vital role in facilitating transactions. Although the company declined to comment formally, sources close to Mastercard suggested on Tuesday that any adverse finding was likely to be appealed.The Commission also declined to confirm that it would make its findings public this morning, and it is possible that timing could slip. But Neelie Kroes, EU competitor commissioner, has acknowledged publicly that her department has been working hard on the case, and the matter is believed to have been discussed with representatives from national competition authorities - some of whom are also looking at the legality of interchange fees - last week.Several sources in Brussels said they believed a decision was imminent, and there is considerable pressure on the commissioner to release findings before the New Year.For example, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), designed to make cross-border banking and payments easier in the euro-zone, is due to come into force in January. The extent to which interchange fees are permissible could be highly relevant to this initiative.The Commission also moved against Mastercard a year after Visa, Mastercard’s rival, struck a deal with Brussels authorities. This exempted Visa interchange fees for cross-border payments from competition rules, in return for certain modifications by the payments company. However, the so-called ”Visa exemption” runs out on December 31, and any fresh deal might be affected by findings in the Mastercard case.Finally, national competition authorities in a number of EU member states - including the UK’s Office of Fair Trading - are looking at the legality of interchange fees, with investigations at differing stages. Commission findings could be highly relevant to their eventual decisions.
421;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-12-14T18:11:53Z;Payment cards leap to 2.2m;;The number of commercial payment cards used by small businesses in the UK almost doubled to 2.2m between 2002 and 2006, according to research commissioned by MasterCard Global Commercial Products.The aggregate value of transactions involving small business cards increased even faster from £6.2m in 2002 to £12.8m last year.The most popular uses of commercial payment cards by small businesses is to pay for fuel and car servicing, building supplies and retail or wholesale purchases.
422;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-11-28T07:02:34Z;Chris McWilton: Heavy lifting in a cultural transformation;;Things have gone really rather well for Chris McWilton since he left KPMG in January 2003. He had been born and bred in the firm’s auditing business and after 21 years he “bled KPMG blue”. But then he jumped ship and joined Mastercard as controller, moving up to chief financial officer after a few months.The card network went public three years later and, in a spectacular run of almost Google-like proportions, the shares have since risen nearly fivefold. “Its been a great ride,” he says at Mastercard’s headquarters, north of New York City.Analysts credit Mr McWilton with helping to bring financial discipline to what had been an association owned by the banks that issue its cards. Earlier this month, Mr McWilton, 48, got his reward. In a reshuffle designed to give broader experience to several senior executives, Bob Selander, chief executive, named him president of global accounts.When Mr McWilton arrived at Mastercard, an initial public offering was in the medium-term plan, and it already had many of the trappings of a public company. Since it had more than 300 shareholders, it was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and made all the usual filings. But culturally, it was far from an ordinary listed company. “One thing we had to do was to continue the transformation of the company from a membership association, not for profit type organisation, to a commercially rigorous enterprise.“When I first came here there wasn’t a lot of emphasis on profitability, there wasn’t a lot of emphasis on margin improvement. It was all very much about the market share game, very much a culture of pleasing the members.” It has taken “a lot of heavy lifting” to change the culture, including an education programme for more than 1,800 employees about how Mastercard makes its money.Despite all of this hard work, Mr McWilton says that there was a lingering doubt among investors in Mastercard’s IPO about its ability to deliver the sort of performance it had been presenting in its roadshows. This included three to five year goals of 8 to 10 per cent revenue growth and 1 to 2 per cent improvements in operating margins.Investors were also concerned about Mastercard’s litigation risk, including cases brought by rivals American Express and Discover, and suits being pursued by big retailers.“When we were on the roadshow there were huge numbers being thrown around …there were a fair number of folks out there trying to disrupt the IPO.”Mastercard’s timing was unfortunate too. Its issue was priced the day Vonage, the internet telephone company, made its disastrous debut, which knocked sentiment. As a result the shares were priced at $39, below the company’s previously forecast range of $40 to $43, to raise $2.4bn.Less than two years later, they are trading at more than $180.Mr McWilton says it was important for the company to get off to a good start. “The first quarter off the blocks we delivered far in excess of what The Street expected. That is a must. If you miss the first quarter – forget it.”It continued to deliver better than expected results, thanks to strong global economic growth, buoyant cross-border travel (which is very lucrative) and a high fixed cost business model where small changes in revenue result in very large increases in profits. Helped partly by these results the investor view of card companies improved and their shares began to be seen as “growth” stocks with much higher ratings.Meanwhile investors became more confident that it had built up sufficient capital to handle the litigation. (Earlier this month Mastercard’s shares slipped 4 per cent on the news that Visa, its larger rival, had agreed to settle the American Express suit for $2.25bn).Mr McWilton says little has changed in the way the company is run, now that it is public. In particular, management do not do anything differently in terms of seeking to provide stable earnings, a characteristic usually seen as highly prized by public investors.Because of its high fixed costs, Mastercard’s earnings are inherently “choppy” he says, and analysts and investors appear to be comfortable with that. He denies suggestions by some analysts, that a listed Mastercard would be less likely to engage in a price war than it might have been before. Nor has its approach to hedging currency risk changed. “We are going to do what is best for the business in the long term,” he says.One big difference from when it was an association is that now it cannot call on its members if it gets a big bill, such as a legal settlement. So it runs a very strong balance sheet with $2.5bn of net cash.“That is not to say we might not do something different in the long run,” says Mr Wilton. “We are always thinking about capital, whether we have enough or too much. We review it at every board meeting.”Mr McWilton stresses that it has a conservative policy towards managing its $3bn of cash. “Our overriding goal is preserving the capital. We didn’t load up on subprime and we were not into the commercial paper market.”“We are a bit boring. I joke that all our treasurer does is count the cash at the end of the day.”In common with most chief financial officers of US public companies, he has plenty of war stories about implementing Sarbanes-Oxley, the controversial US corporate governance legislation. “I remember walking out of this office one night and there were literally 20 auditors down the hall, poring through books and records. That was all we were doing – dealing with auditors. We couldn’t get anything else done.” But things have settled down. “It is now much more of a process than an event. It was an event for a couple of years.”The process is now in the hands of Martina Hund-Mejean, formerly treasurer of Tyco, who has just taken over as CFO.Mr McWilton’s new position is his first foray outside finance. But in the first few days he has found it has many similarities with his old job back at KPMG.“I oversee the teams that interface with the customers. The idea is to make sure they are growing their payments business as profitably as they can while at the same time making sure we make money. At KPMG you had clients who wanted to push the envelope in terms of financial reporting and you wanted to make sure they were happy, but at the same time you had to preserve the economics for the company. I had to say ‘no’ but make sure they still liked me.”……………………………….A day in the lifeThere was one big thing that Chris McWilton did not miss when he left KPMG to join Mastercard – the hour and fifteen minute commute into New York City. He and his family live just a ten minutes drive from Mastercard’s headquarters in an IM Peidesigned building in Purchase, New York. He gets irritated if he has to stop at one set of traffic lights on the way, he jokes.This means his 8am to 6.30pm typical workday as chief financial officer has given him an enviable amount of time with his family. “I also get to watch the Red Sox,” he says.He likes to spend the first hour of the working day reading his communication update, which covers everything that has come out about Mastercard or the payments industry. He then picks up the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.He tries to keep meetings to a minimum. “My management style is to encourage people to make decisions on their own. You can meet or work but you can’t do both.”He talks to people in the hallway and “walks around a lot”.“I want people to have confidence in themselves …they are smart people and if they take ten decisions in the day, nine of them will be right and the one they get wrong is probably not fatal. The job is to figure out what could be fatal and then come to me.”People’s search for affirmation of what they do can “bog down” an organisation, he says.Mr McWilton estimates that as CFO he spent about a quarter of his time on investor relations and another large chunk preparing for meetings of the board and its committees.Mastercard has a fairly centralised finance function and he travels to overseas operations only a couple of times a year.All that has changed dramatically, now he has been appointed head of global accounts, overseeing its top financial institution customers around the world.Up to 40 per cent of his time will be spent travelling, which almost certainly means fewer Red Sox games.
423;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-11-06T21:49:24Z;Wall St rebounds amid record oil and gold;;Wall Street shares rebounded on Tuesday as commodity prices hit new highs, providing a boon to energy and materials stocks.Financial stocks recovered some of their recent heavy losses amid lingering concerns about banks’ exposure to credit and mortgage market losses. However some mixed corporate earnings continued to weigh on sentiment.Writedowns from financial companies and disappointing results from energy groups have caused estimates of earnings growth on an annual basis for S&P 500 companies to slip to 6.9 per cent in the fourth quarter from 11.9 per cent, according to Thomson Financial.Blended earnings, including actual and estimated results, for the S&P 500 are down 1.7 per cent for the third quarter, the first drop since 2002.A late rally helped the S&P 500 close 1.2 per cent higher at 1,520.27 points,. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1 per cent at 2,825.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 13,660.94.Energy stocks had the best of the gains after crude oil futures hit $97 a barrel for the first time. The S&P energy index rose 2.7 per cent at 589.04. ExxonMobil gained 3.1 per cent at $90.38 and Chevron rose 2.4 per cent at $90.64. Hess rose 7 per cent at $73.98.Valero Energy, the US’s biggest oil refiner, rose 4.8 per cent to $72.73 in spite of posting a 21 per cent decline in third-quarter profits after gasoline margins fell sharply.Materials stocks rose as precious metals, including gold, silver and platinum, reached fresh heights. The S&P materials index gained 2.5 per cent at 268.17. Alcoa rose 1.8 per cent at $38.57 while Newmont Mining rose 4.1 per cent at $54.50.Financial stocks hit back as investors tentatively put aside worries about potential credit market losses. Citigroup’s disclosure this week that it would make up to $11bn in further mortgage-related writedowns sparked concern that other banks and financial institutions will follow suit.Rumours that banks will have to writedown “level 3 assets” – assets that are so illiquid they are difficult to value – continued to unsettle the market. Goldman Sachs rose 2.2 per cent at $223.16 after it said persistent rumours that it would make mortgage-related writedowns were “still untrue”.Bear Stearns gained 2.1 per cent at $102 and Merrill Lynch rose 0.9 per cent at $56.37. But Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent at $35.08 while Morgan Stanley shed 1.9 per cent at $54.51.The S&P financial index gained 1.7 per cent at 425.46, helped by MasterCard, which soared 7.2 per cent at $199.40 after Deutsche Bank raised its rating to “buy” and set a $250 target.Christopher Flanagan, JPMorgan analyst, said total losses stemming from mortgage linked securities could reach $200bn, against only $30bn-$40bn in losses reported so far.“Banks, brokers, mortgage and monoline insurers will bear the brunt of this loss recognition,” he said. But credit insurers, which have suffered some of the worst share price falls, rallied.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, gained 13.8 per cent at $27.99 after it disputed a Morgan Stanley report that the industry’s losses would worsen.Ambac said Morgan’s estimates “do not accurately reflect the composition of our underlying mortgage portfolio and the structure of our deals”. MBIA, another bond insurer, gained 7.3 per cent at $35.65.Among homebuilders Hovnanian Enterprises fell 0.7 per cent at $10.04 after home deliveries fell 19 per cent in the fourth quarter, while cancellations reached 40 per cent. Beazer Homes suspended its dividend, cut 25 per cent of its staff and took $230m in pre-tax charges. Shares rose 10 per cent at $10.47 after an adviser to union pension funds called for the board to oust Ian McCarthy, chief executive.In technology, Sun Microsystems fell 9.6 per cent to $5.16 after revenues missed analysts’ expectations. Google gained 2.2 per cent at $741.79 after Sanford C Bernstein raised its price target to $850. Microsoft fell 0.9 per cent at $36.41 after it was dropped from a Goldman Sachs buy list.Alibaba.com, the Chinese e-commerce portal, almost tripled in price on its Hong Kong debut.But Yahoo, a 39 per cent stakeholder in Alibaba’s parent, fell 4.6 per cent to $29.93.
424;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-08-31T16:24:27Z;Credit cards;;Calculating the true cost of credit-card borrowing is no longer as simple as using the APR as a yardstick. Banks are finding new ways to recoup revenue lost following a crackdown on penalty fees.Which?, the consumer campaign group, has found that while many banks may have cut penalty charges from £25 to about £12 over the past year, credit-card companies are catching out customers with new fees, often hidden in the small print.Some of these include charges for failing to notify a change of address – such as the £12 levied by Royal Bank of Scotland, which includes NatWest and Mint, if a statements is sent out and returned twice.Several banks have also changed the way they allocate repayments to debts, such as balance transfers and purchases. For example, HSBC and its subsidiary, First Direct, now allocate repayments to balance transfers first – and not to purchases, which often attract a higher interest rate.Balance transfer fees have crept up, too – from a typical 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Some cards, such as Marks & Spencer’s &More and Sainsbury’s Bank, have also lowered their minimum monthly repayments, meaning borrowers could take longer to pay off their debt.Even not using your plastic can now prove costly, with more banks penalising customers for “inactive” accounts. Lloyds TSB customers who haven’t used their cards for “some time” face £35 fees, while MBNA customers not using their plastic for one year will be charged £10.Annual fees, typically around £24, are also making a comeback. Of the 251 credit cards available in the UK, only 20 are rated as “Best Buys” by Which?. These include Egg Money’s MasterCard, which has no annual fee and Nationwide’s credit card stable, which allocates repayments to the most expensive debt first. For more best buys, see www.which.co.uk
425;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-07-28T00:15:19Z;All change;;"Why haven’t we joined the euro?I know there must be lots of good economic reasons for holding on to our own currency but as I have said before, it is really irritating to have to change in and out of euros the whole time. The Lovely Lucinda dreads my trips across the channel as I complain yet again about the inconvenience of it all. She usually smiles sweetly, gives me a limited amount of cash and tells me just to use my credit card.But that irritates me even more as my bank (which provides my personal credit card and also those of the company, so I am caught either way) charges each time I make a transaction and the exchange rate varies from hour to hour. I am never really sure what I have paid for a hotel or a handbag until I return.So I was one of the first applicants for the Caxton FX Eurocard, a pre-paid euro MasterCard that doesn’t charge you for shop transactions in Europe. Yes, I know I have to pre-load it (and so they get the use of the money all the time I’m on the Eurostar and before I get to the shops) but I can reload free online and I know what the exchange rate was when I deposited the money. Why did no one think of it before?Innovation in financial markets is the reason London stays ahead of the game, I was told by Sir Brian Pitman last week. Yes, personally. I was introduced to him at a debate at St Bride’s on the future of the City of London and was reminded of the time I first met Sir William Purves. Like Purves, Pitman was a banker of such stature and repute that I was almost (but not quite) rendered speechless on meeting him. Was this the Sir Brian Pitman? The real one? The man who took Lloyds from a market capitalisation of £985m in 1983 when he became chief executive to one of more than £31bn when he left the job in 1997, without a rights issue? And for a salary that most people wouldn’t get out of bed for? (He earned £467,000 as chairman in 1997.)It would not be an exaggeration to say that Pitman himself was an innovator – he made banks an attractive investment opportunity again. For years they had been run partly for their customers and mostly for their employees, and shareholders never seemed to get a look in, other than when it came to yet another rights issue to pay for yet another international acquisition. He sold everything off, got back to basics and then engineered the merger with TSB, all the while staying out of the mayhem of Big Bang. Forty-nine years in one company isn’t that fashionable these days either.So I was fascinated to meet him and asked him lots of questions; it was like having a case study from my MBA days suddenly appear in the flesh and I made the most of it. I even got to kiss him goodbye when he left.Sir Brian Pitman is 75. He remains on the boards of Singapore Airlines and ITV and is far from past it. But for how much longer is he going to go to debates in Fleet Street and meet star-struck columnists? You have to grab these opportunities while you can. I am constantly telling my children to make the most of the generation ahead of mine, because they won’t be here forever and we have so much to learn from them. Older people are pieces of living history, and hearing about things first-hand rather than through the pages of a case study or a history book is so much more interesting.At a wedding anniversary party recently (who has parties to celebrate their wedding anniversaries? Really. I regard this as a hostage to fortune, like giving an interview to Hello! magazine), I sat next to General Sir Robert Ford.He graduated from Sandhurst in 1943 and then spent a year preparing for the Normandy landings.As soon as I heard that I hung on to his every word, and they were all fascinating, especially to someone who only discovered second world war history in recent years and has read about 20 books on the subject since.It did put my complaints about the euro into perspective, though. Arriving in Europe on D-Day, Ford had a little more to worry about than whether he had secured a decent exchange rate.mrsmoneypenny@ft.com"
426;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-07-27T17:19:57Z;Coca-Cola names marketing chief;;Coca-Cola has appointed Joe Tripodi, one of the US marketing industry’s highest-profile executives, as its new chief marketing officer, with responsibilities for relations with major customers such as Wal-Mart and McDonald’s.Mr Tripodi is leaving Allstate Insurance, a leading US retail insurer, where he realigned the company’s marketing strategy around “customer experience”, and sought to develop what he described as a more interactive relationship with the company’s customers.He has worked internationally with Seagram Spirits, and built his reputation during nine years with MasterCard International, where he was involved in the creation of their customer experience-focused “Priceless” global marketing campaign.Mr Tripodi takes over a position that has been vacant since the departure of Mary Minnick in January this year, after she was passed over for the position of chief operating officer, the company’s second most powerful job, in favour of Muhtar Kent.Ms Minnick developed the Coca-Cola brand’s current global maketing around the slogan “The Coke Side of Life”, and also spearheaded the development of several new products.The decision to give Mr Tripodi overall responsiblity for Coca-Cola’s customer and commercial group - currently headed by Robert Leechman - as well as for marketing reflects a broader drive by the company to enhance the presentation and handling of its products at the point of sale.Leading consumer goods companies have become increasingly focused on in-store marketing efforts as traditional advertising channels become increasingly fragmented.Mr Kent said Mr Tripodi’s new role “will help us integrate two important functions …that once aligned, can help move the business the quickest and furthest”.Coke has made improving the way it works with leading retailers one of the priorities of its revitalisation plan drawn up under Neville Isdell, its chief executive since 2004.A Coca-Cola spokesman said the strategy and innovation responsibilities that were previously also held by Ms Minnick would remain apart from the marketing and commercial role.Mr Isdell said much of the innovation and marketing initiatives generated under her leadership would prove ”transformational” and continue to drive long-term growth after her departure.
427;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-06-21T19:18:47Z;Pay By Touch puts its finger on loyalty;;In Citigroup’s most recent annual report, the world’s largest financial company began its list of achievements in 2006 with its launch of a biometric credit card in Singapore.Citi card customers can now buy film tickets, Japanese food, or drinks at the Zouk night club by pressing their finger on a scanner, typing in a personal number, and automatically debiting their card.Meanwhile, shoppers at several Shop’nSave supermarkets in Pittsburgh are signing up for SmartShop, a card-based loyalty system that directs special offers to each customer based on their previous shopping history.Both Shop’nSave and Citi are using technology developed by Pay By Touch, a rapidly expanding privately held company that wants to shake up a global payments industry dominated by Visa, MasterCard and American Express.Over the past three years, Pay By Touch’s biometric network has expanded from a pilot scheme at Piggly Wiggly supermarkets in South Carolina to more than 3,000 locations, including the Jewel-Osco chain in Chicago, part of Supervalu.Supervalu, the second largest traditional US grocer, remains the system’s largest client, although a senior executive from the UK’s Tesco last year highlighted Pay By Touch’s system in a review of new payments technology – noting in particular the potential for integrating biometrics into its current ClubCard loyalty scheme.Several factors lie behind the surge in interest. The biometric system still allows a customer to choose from an “electronic wallet” of payment methods, such as direct debits, credit card accounts, or state food benefits.But for retailers such as Shop’nSave the system offers the possibility of reducing cheque processing costs by making it easier for customers to pay from their bank accounts.But it also offers the ability to ensure that the mountains of data on customer habits accumulated using retailers’ loyalty cards is accurate – since purchases can be tied to the biometric identity of the customer, rather than to a transferable card with questionable or out of date information on the customer.Beyond simple payments, Pay By Touch has sought to move further into customer loyalty with its SmartShop technology – which uses proprietary software to offer weekly incentives and special price cuts to an individual customer based on their shopping habits and preferences.For retailers, the system offers a way to direct offers effectively to their most loyal customers, rather than supporting “cherry picking” of bargains by customers who only buy the offers.John Morris, president and chief operating officer of Pay By Touch, says that pilots of the technology in Pittsburgh and New York have seen the card-based technology adopted by about 20 per cent of the participating store’s customers – against the estimated 1 per cent of customers who respond to traditional mailings of coupons.“Our data suggests they’re doing more of their shopping at the store where they’re getting their offers,” says Mr Morris, a veteran of IBM.Pay By Touch now has about 800 employees and is largely unchallenged by biometric competitors, since it acquired its main rival in 2005.It has also won $167m in financial backing, including support from Ron Burkle, the billionaire investor who made his reputation in retail.
428;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;London named top financial centre;;A stable legal and economic framework and transparent business regulation make London the most important city in the world economy, according to new research.A report on the top 50 worldwide centres of commerce, commissioned by Mastercard, shows London beating New York into second place, with Tokyo third and Chicago fourth. It confirms what several other reports have shown: that a falling share of financial business and complaints about heavy-handed regulation have challenged New York’s position as the world’s pre-eminent financial capital.The index combines six measures of commercial power including flows of finance, volumes of business and the creation and dissemination of knowledge. It was developed by a team of academics specialising in economics, business, urban studies and finance.The index is not intended as a simple competitive ranking of the ease of doing business in cities, but mixes together measures of output, such as the volume of financial market transactions in equities and bonds, with indicators of business inputs such as the ease of employing workers and opening and closing businesses.Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, economic adviser to Mastercard, said: “There are multiple layers of connectivity between the indicators, with causality running in both directions.”John Ross, director of economic and business policy for Ken Livingstone, mayor of London, said that the predictability and clarity of regulation were obvious advantages for London over New York. “We do not have the onerous and increasingly erratic regulation of the US,” he said. “I don’t think Sarbanes-Oxley is even the worst aspect of it, and nor do the companies I have talked to. It is the litigious and apparently arbitrary culture of regulation and policy.”Mr Ross cited episodes such as the fierce political opposition to the takeover of P&O Ports by Dubai Ports World, a state-owned company from the United Arab Emirates, as evidence of the uncertainty in the US.London scored highly on financial flows, economic stability and the ease of doing business, although it was a relatively poor performer on information creation and flow, which measures the number of universities, researchers and MBAs, patent applications and scientific journal articles.Mr Ross said the high cost of operating and living in London was one of its drawbacks, although he added that as long as the city was permitted to continue putting up high buildings in the centre, rental costs could be contained.The difficulty for some business visitors of obtaining visas was another cause for concern, he said.Africa’s only city in the top 50 was Johannesburg, ranked 47th, while Mumbai was India’s sole representative at 45.
429;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Transactions turn technical;;In 2006 the UK made 23.1bn cash transactions, which works out at nine per adult a week.Two-thirds of the 23bn cash transactions are for less than £5. Use of cash has fallen by 14 per cent in the past five years and even in the past year consumers have started to use debit cards for low value transactions.Six in 10 of all cash payments are in the retail sector. Cash remains the main payment method on public transport, in pubs, clubs, restaurants and cinemas. By 2014 fewer than half of all payments will be made by cash.Mobile phone banking is taking off. Mobile operators are supporting an initiative to enable people who work abroad to use their phones to send money home. The GSM Association, the global trade body for mobile operators, and MasterCard Worldwide, the US payment processing company, have announced a pilot programme whereby migrant workers will use mobile phones for international remittances. The initiative is led by Sunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, the largest mobile operator in India, which is the biggest recipient of overseas remittances. It is backed by Vodafone, Cingular and Telecom Italia.This year HSBC began a mobile phone pilot project with MasterCard and ViVOtech. The six-month trial will test the use of mobile phones to make contactless, secure credit card purchases for low-value transactions.
430;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
431;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;European lenders may form debit card network;;The European banking industry is looking at establishing a new pan-European debit card scheme which could rival Visa or Mastercard.Banks are looking at the feasibility of using the Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes, a European payment federation, as a basis for greater cross-border co-operation.This would allow the European banks to have an alternative to Visa or Mastercard’s Maestro which are the dominant providers of debit card network services in Europe.Zentraler Kreditausschuss (ZKA), the German bank trade association whose members include Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, is amongst those keen to set up a system.Other domestic debit card schemes such as Link, which is owned by the UK banks, are looking at whether to get involved.Advocates of the scheme say that closer co-operation could provide a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Mastercard or Visa which will benefit both consumers and banks.Currently consumers can only use their debit cards overseas if their domestic card schemes are co-branded with Mastercard or Visa.On Friday analysts at Lafferty Group said this was a significant move.Visa and Mastercard said last night they were not concerned about an increase in competition.
432;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Deal activity maintains confident mood on Wall Street;;"Wall Street posted a fifth consecutive week of gains, buoyed by robust earnings, deal activity and further evidence of a moderating economy that should tame inflation.Analysts said the combination was bullish for stocks, and until one of the ingredients in the mix turned negative, fears of the stock market staging a correction were premature.“Recent data suggests the economy is entering a soft landing,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment advisor at Deutsche Bank.He said low long-term interest rates and cheap corporate borrowing rates would continue to nurture private equity buy-out activity in equities.Even a weaker dollar has been a bullish factor for many large company stocks, as multinational companies enjoy a boost from foreign earnings.This week, Mastercard and Wrigleys reported stronger-than-forecast earnings that were boosted in part by the weak dollar versus the euro. Shares in Mastercard rose 18 per cent to $134.66, and Wrigleys gained 6.7 per cent to close the week at $58.72.Large caps have assumed leadership in stocks recently and this week the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed further into record territory.The blue-chip barometer has risen in 22 of the past 25 trading days and set its 19th record close of the year on Friday.The Dow gained 0.2 per cent to close at 13,264.62, for a gain of 1.1 per cent this week. It is up 6.4 per cent for the year.Approaching a record of its own, the broader S&P 500 index rose above the 1,500 threshold this week for the first time since 2000, and was closing in upon its record peak of 1,527.46 set in March of that year.The S&P rose 0.2 per cent to finish the day at 1,505.62, a rise of 0.8 per cent over the week.Notably, technology stocks remain well adrift of their bubble highs set seven years ago.While the Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.3 per cent to 2,572.15 on Friday, a gain of 0.6 per cent this week, the benchmark is still well below its March 2000 peak of 5,048.62.Two leading tech groups, Microsoft and Yahoo, were on Friday the subject of possible merger talk. Microsoft shares slipped 1.3 per cent to $30.56, while Yahoo closed up 10 per cent at $30.98, after reaching a high of $34 earlier on Friday.The prospect of a union was discounted by some analysts. Scott Kessler, internet software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, said they “already have
significant global reach and expansive online offerings”.He said their respective “internet businesses have struggled, we think, due largely to monetisation shortcomings, which such a merger would not address”.Meanwhile, the media and publishing sector remained a source of deal activity as Reuters said it had received a preliminary takeover offer from an unnamed suitor on Friday.Earlier in the week, News Corp, controlled by Rupert Murdoch launched a $5bn bid for Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal.The $60-a-share offer was rejected by the Bancroft family, who wield control of the company through special voting shares.Shares in Dow Jones rose 54 per cent to $55.80 for the week, while News Corp lost 3.2 per cent to $23.58.Shares in the New York Times, another media concern controlled by a family that faces growing activism among shareholders, jumped 10.4 per cent to $25.91 this week.In other deals, the Dolan family made a $22bn bid for the shares in Cablevision in their latest effort to take the cable operator private. The company’s board approved the $36.26-a-share offer and the stock rose 8.7 per cent to $35.49.Talk of a potential buy-out sparked a weekly gain of 11 per cent to $47.38 in shares of Monster, the parent of the internet jobs site.The telecom sector was one of the best performing sectors this week and Verizon led gains, rising 7.3 per cent to $40.66 on robust results.Meanwhile, Interactive Brokers shares rose to a high of $34.25 and closed at $31.30, on Friday, up 4.3 per cent, after listing at $31.01 a share.In notable earnings results this week, Watson Pharmaceuticals rose 13.7 per cent to $31.20 after the drug developer raised earnings guidance this year.Unum Group rose 10.5 per cent to $27.57 after the disability insurer’s first quarter profit nearly doubled from a year ago.JDS Uniphase plunged 16.1 per cent to $14 after the networking equipment maker posted a fiscal third-quarter loss and reduced sales guidance for the fourth quarter.Liz Claiborne lost 22.2 per cent to $34.82 this week after a 65 per cent plunge in first-quarter net profit for the clothing retailer.Dean Foods’ fell 8 per cent to $33.28 as a first-quarter net income rise of 21 per cent was punctured by the prospect that higher milk costs would pull yearly earnings lower than forecast.The worst stock in the Dow this week was General Motors. The carmaker said first-quarter earnings fell 90 per cent from a year ago and blamed losses on problems in the residential mortgage business of GMAC Financial Services. GM shares fell 2.2 per cent to $30.88."
433;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-05-03T19:38:38Z;Faltering US dollar poses dilemma for equity investors;;Investors in US stocks have viewed the recent decline in the dollar as a green light to buy into large companies with international exposure.MasterCard, for example, is a company with large overseas operations that has boosted its recent earnings amid a weaker dollar. Its first-quarter profit soared 70 per cent compared with a year ago, partly because of the stronger euro against the dollar. Its shares have risen 16.7 per cent since the earnings news on Wednesday.But analysts warn that a faltering currency looms as a double-edged sword for equity investors.“At some point, foreign investors will either hedge their US assets or repatriate,” says Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse.So far, the dollar is seen to have made an orderly decline to compensate for a divergence between US and global growth rates.Pressure on the dollar is coming from a divergence between US and global growth rates. In the wake of last week’s news that the US economy grew just 1.3 per cent during the first quarter, the dollar fell to a record low against the euro and multi-year lows against sterling and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars.This, analysts say, has encouraged local and some foreign investors to buy US stocks – which now look relatively cheap in their domestic currencies.“The lower dollar has helped equities as the currency has adjusted for the slower economy and lower US investment returns,” said Mr Konstam. “If the dollar doesn’t fall, stock prices would come under pressure.”While the dollar has fallen by about 2.75 per cent against the euro for the year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 6.1 per cent and the S&P 500 is up 5.9 per cent.But if the dollar continues to weaken substantially, there will soon come a tipping point when foreign investors will no longer be satisfied with the returns from US assets.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said he was “a little worried about a replay of 1987 where the stock market kept going higher while the dollar quietly fell, adding: “Eventually, investors stood up and noticed.”The prospect of higher inflation beckons from a lower dollar, an outcome that, if accompanied by a slowly growing economy, represents the worst environment for stocks later this year, analysts say.Investors are likely to watch the April jobs report, due on Friday, for any evidence that the labour market is weakening.Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, points out that the slow rate of growth weighing on the dollar also undermines corporate earnings in general. “The same factor that is weighing on the US dollar - slow growth - undermines earnings growth in general.”For some foreign investors who purchased US stocks at the start of this year, the recent market gains are not as impressive when viewed in their own currencies. In terms of the euro, the Dow’s gain for the year is 3.2 per cent while the S&P has returned 2.9 per cent.The one factor keeping back the risk of a massive net selling of US stocks by foreigners is the weak yen, according to Mr Konstam.“So long as the dollar is stable against the yen, the threat of such an outcome will stay contained. Dollar-Asia is a very important gauge of repatriation risk,” he says.
434;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-05-02T20:33:32Z;Wall St rises amid earnings, M&A;;Wall Street rose on Wednesday with earnings reports, better-than-expected factory orders and buy-out activity extending the market’s spring bullish streak.Leading the charge were big companies with international operations, seen by investors as being in a sweet spot as a growing global economy compensates for a slower pace in the US through the conduit of a weaker dollar.One example was MasterCard, whose first-quarter profit soared 70 per cent compared with the same period last year to a record $214.9m. The world’s No.2 credit card provider attributed 2.5 per cent of its rise in revenue to the stronger euro versus the dollar. MasterCard jumped 10 per cent to $127.35, eclipsing its previous 52-week high of $118.07.“Enthusiasm for stocks continues and multinationals are riding the global economy,” said Peter Cardillo, strategist at Avalon Partners. He said stocks were overextended but he was not looking for a hefty correction at this juncture.The bullish mood pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average further into record territory and 25 of the blue chip barometer’s 30 stocks closed higher on Wednesday.The Dow rose 0.6 per cent to 13,211.88, its seventeenth record close this year and set an intraday record high of 13,256.33. The Dow’s gain of 6 per cent since the start of January has outpaced broader US benchmarks.A boost for the Dow was Verizon, up 3.4 at $39.81. The telecom set a new 52-week high of $39.72 as investors cheered evidence of its growing market share at the expense of rivals.The S&P 500 index rose 0.65 per cent to close at 1,495.93 with stocks in the telecommunications, materials and consumer discretionary sectors setting the pace. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 1 per cent to finish at 2,557.84.Investor sentiment faces a test when the April employment report is released on Friday.Analysts say a weak re-port could fan fears that the slowing housing market is weighing on the economy, while evidence of steady labour gains would probably underpin the recent ad-vance in stocks.A stronger-than-forecast factory orders report for March also buoyed stocks, which had already opened higher amid deal activity.The Dolan family made a $22bn bid for the shares in Cablevision that they do not already own, in their latest effort to take the cable operator private. The company said its board had approved the Dolans’ offer of $36.26 a share and the stock rose 8.6 per cent to $35.48.Shares in USG jumped 5.8 per cent to $48.66 as speculation of a buy-out for the maker of building materials mounted.In other deals, Citigroup said it would buy Bisys Group for $1.47bn. The financial services outsourcer rose 2.1 per cent to $11.71.Beckman Coulter raised its offer for Biosite by $5 a share to $90 and stocks in the healthcare company rose 1.6 per cent to $93.75.Investors were also waiting for the next stage of the battle for Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, to unfold.Late on Tuesday, the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones via a dual share structure, rejected a $5bn unsolicited bid from News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch.After soaring 54.7 per cent to $56.20 on Tuesday, shares in Dow Jones fell 0.4 per cent to $56 on Wednesday. Shares in the company rose to their highest level in four years after News Corp launched its hostile $60 a share bid.Shares in News Corp rebounded 2 per cent to $23.46 after falling 4.2 per cent on Tuesday.Although many other newspaper and media shares rose sharply on Tuesday and continued to rise on Wednesday, CreditSights cautioned that prospects for the sector were not linked to the News Corp move.Jake Newman, an analyst at CreditSights, said: “If the value of Dow Jones is based on potential synergies with other News Corp properties, the high valuation cannot be applied to general-interest newspaper properties.”In other earnings news, Time Warner said first-quarter earnings had fallen 18 per cent from the same period last year but the result exceeded analysts’ forecasts.The company raised full-year earnings guidance. Its shares gained 3 per cent at $21.20.Sprint Nextel swung to a first-quarter loss, as the third-largest wireless network in the US said operational investments cancelled out gains from sales.Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $20.59.Shares in CB Richard Ellis jumped 14.1 per cent to $38.39, after the real estate broker’s earnings beat estimates.Ahead of quarterly results on Thursday, Nortel said it expects to sales of $2.48bn, above the consensus call of $2.37bn. Shares in the telecom equipment maker rose 8.9 per cent to $25.12.Yum! Brands reported a 14 percent increase in first-quarter earnings as its international fast-food chains KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut performed well. Shares rose 6.1 per cent, to $66.96.
435;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-03-12T17:19:57Z;Sponsorship branding takes on new name;;Talk of London’s Millennium Dome usually includes the phrase “white elephant”. Given the controversy surrounding the landmark building, the decision of O2, the UK mobile phone network, to sponsor it seems something of a gamble.After all, sponsorship usually makes sense when it aligns a company’s brand with something consumers already find attractive.But for O2, its £6m-a-year deal with the Dome’s new operators to rename the venue “The O2” arguably makes marketing sense. Like other recent complex sponsorship arrangements, it involves far more than just badging another entity with its brand.O2 will also use its deal with Anschutz Entertainment Group to improve visitors’ experience of events staged at the Dome by integrating the latest mobile phone technology throughout the building, thereby showcasing its latest broadband and wi-fi services. It is hoped the arrangements will generate new sources of revenue, both by encouraging existing O2 customers to take up the extra services and by attracting new customers.For example, O2 customers will be able to take advantage of digital ticketing. Rather than purchase a paper ticket, they will receive a barcode on their mobile phones that will give them access to an event as well as extras such as members-only facilities including fast track entry, reserved parking and discounted drinks or food.“You have to go way beyond ‘badging’ to be credible as a sponsor nowadays,” says Ben Robinson, managing partner of Stream, the brand entertainment agency with clients such as Nissan. “Our starting point is to add value to the consumer, then use that to add value to the brand.”Mr Robinson argues that sponsorship should no longer be seen as simply a media investment. “By pushing sponsorship further – such as by creating new events and content associated with them – brand owners can create tangible assets able to grow in value over time rather than simply being just another media cost.”Matthew Key, O2’s UK chief executive, agrees: “When we launched [the company], our shirt sponsorship deal with Arsenal was important to raise awareness of the brand, but to make the most of sponsorship nowadays – and to really stand out from the crowd – sponsorship deals must be a real partnership between parties, adding value to our customers by deepening their customer experience.”The company follows the same thinking with its sponsorship of the England rugby union team by offering exclusive perks to its customers at certain matches – including a special bar manned by former England international team players.Other brands taking bold steps to make sponsorship work harder include Audi, the carmaker. Not content to simply sponsor a television programme, Audi last year launched its own digital TV channel in the UK – an investment both to drive brand awareness and create a tangible asset with long-term value, the company claims.MasterCard, the financial services group, has already held three “Priceless Evenings”, featuring live acts such as The Corrs and Texas performing in a special event for MasterCard customers. Customers unable to attend still benefited from retail discounts on featured artists.One of the first brands to push the idea of sponsorship further was Sony Computer Entertainment. In the 1990s, the company struck a deal with the Ministry of Sound nightclub to install PlayStation products and branding at the London venue.“At the time it was seen as cutting edge,” says Carl Christopher, sponsorship and events manager for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. “Now it would just be wallpaper.”Indeed, Mr Christopher now says that if a sponsorship could just as easily be done by a different brand, Sony will question whether it should do it at all.“Our latest sponsorship, The PlayStation Season, involves us partnering a number of different arts institutions including the English National Opera and Sadler’s Wells to collaborate on the creation of new content,” he says.“And it’s not just about generating conventional media coverage. Built into this is a digital strategy to generate interest and dialogue through websites and blogs.”
436;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-02-12T00:43:31Z;Mobile phone companies eye money transfers;;Leading mobile operators are supporting an initiative aimed at enabling people working outside their home countries to use mobile phones to send money back to their families.The GSM Association, the global trade body for mobile operators, and MasterCard Worldwide, the US payment processing company, will on Monday announce a pilot programme to allow migrant workers to use cellphones for international remittances, regardless of where they are in the world.The initiative is led by Sunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, India’s largest mobile operator, partly because the country is the biggest recipient of overseas remittances. But it is backed by operators including Vodafone, Cingular, Telecom Italia, as well as groups focused on emerging markets, such as MTN, Orascom Telecom and Turkcell.Only a handful of mobile operators currently allow customers to make domestic or international remittances via cellphones. However, the potential size of this business is now leaving many companies seeking new ways to expand the sector.The World Bank estimates that 175m migrant workers made remittances worth $230bn in 2005. Meanwhile, MasterCard estimates more than two thirds of the world’s 6.5bn people do not have access to banking services near home, and the GSMA claims that its initiative could help increase the size of the international remittances market to more than $1,000bn by 2012.The technology and practical arrangements currently used to remit cash vary. Some operators issue debit cards to enable customers to redeem their cash Others, such as Vodafone, rely on text messages that include personal identification numbers as a means for customers to get their cash.For its pilot programme, Bharti Airtel will partner with the State Bank of India. Bharti is in the process of finalising arrangements with a mobile operator and bank in another country to test a system of international remittances via cellphones.Mastercard will act as the clearance and settlement facility between Bharti and the mobile operator located outside India. The GSMA said one of the biggest barriers to use of mobiles for international remittances was the need for a global clearing and settlement hub that can deal with the requirements of multiple mobile operators and banks.In a separate but related development, Vodafone will on Monday announce a pilot project to enable Kenyan workers living in the UK to use their mobiles for international remittances. Vodafone manages Safaricom, a Kenyan mobile operator, that already allows people living there to use their mobiles to transfer money to each other via text messages.
437;MA;Mastercard Inc;2007-02-09T17:01:46Z;European stocks recover poise;;German technology group Infineon led European equity markets higher this week after notching up two important supply contracts for its microchip division.The company announced on Friday that it had won a contract to supply Mastercard with chips for its new contact-free payment cards. It was the second contract win of week for the company, which on Wednesday revealed details of a deal to supply Nokia with chips for its low-cost handsets.No financial details were available on either deal, although Dresdner Kleinwort estimated the Nokia contract to be worth around €138m next year.Scott Geels at Sanford C Bernstein said that although the financial impact was quite small, it was a positive step in helping it get leverage in the mainstream market.Didier Scemama at ABN Amro agreed: “After winning orders from LG, Samsung and Panasonic, Infineon continues to expand its wireless business.”Over the week, Infineon gained 8.3 per cent to €12, helping to lift also Franco-Italian rival STMicroelectronics 3.8 per cent to €14.73.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.3 per cent on the week, ending at 1,542.21, just shy of a six-year high hit on Tuesday.In a volatile banking sector, Julius Baer outperformed after reporting a forecast-beating 35 per cent rise in full-year net profit, prompting the pledge of a SFr612m shareholder payout. Its shares gained 7.9 per cent over the week to SFr162.There were some good performances from utilities as merger fever swept through the sector after the board of Endesa, the Spanish power generator, recommended to shareholders the €41bn offer from German rival Eon. Endesa shares fell 2.6 per cent over the week to €38.01, and Eon gained 0.7 per cent to €110.05. But Gas Natural, which last week withdrew its offer for Endesa, rose 7.6 per cent to €33.20.Acciona, the construction group that owns 21 per cent of Endesa, gained 4.6 per cent to €162.15 after it said it would sell its shares if Eon won control of the company.Expectations of further imminent bids ran high – no sooner were rumours that Electricite de France was eyeing Spain’s Iberdrolaquashed, than fresh talk emerged that construction group ACS was trying to foster a merger between Union Fenosa and Iberdrola.ACS, which holds stakes in both companies, made a weekly gain of 2 per cent to €43.30, while Iberdrola added 6.2 per cent to €35.04 and Union Fenosa climbed 6.5 per cent to €41.50.Orkla, the Norwegian conglomerate, gained 7 per cent over the week to NKr415 after it bought 12.5 per cent of Renewable Energy Corp (REC) from unlisted Good Energies Investments at a large discount. The deal, which cost REC shares a weekly fall of 8.2 per cent to NKr146, raised Orkla’s holding to 39.99 per cent.Q-Cells, the German maker of solar energy panels, gained 13.9 per cent to €47.50 after it announced an 80 per cent rise in full-year sales. The company purchased 17.9 per cent in REC and signed a long-term supply contract with the maker of silicon components.

Retail banks that make the sale of one product dependent on another or that impose fees for closing an account are singled out for criticism.The inquiry, which was launched in June 2005 by Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, warns credit companies such as Visa and MasterCard – which have already faced Brussels antitrust probes – that the Commission intends to “resolutely apply” competition law in their sector.It warns in particular that “interchange fees” – the charges paid between banks servicing retailers and the banks servicing cardholders – raise competition concerns in several member states.However, the report does not call for the abolition or even a further specified reduction in fees, even though Ms Kroes has in the past hinted at drastic action in this area.The apparent softening in the Commission’s position on credit card fees is likely to please Visa and MasterCard, which have warned repeatedly that the abolition of interchange fees would throw Europe’s payment card system into chaos. At the same time, the two groups and other payment card operators could be frustrated at the lack of clear direction from Brussels, which suggests the legal uncertainty hanging over the sector may continue.The sector inquiry forms part of a broader attempt by the Commission to get a grip on crucial sectors of the economy in which it believes that competition and cross-border trade is not working.The retail banking probe and similar investigations are not directed at individual companies, and therefore cannot directly trigger antitrust fines.However, officials hope the intelligence gathered during its inquiries will allow the Commission better to pursue individual infringements.

440;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-12-27T20:41:49Z;Little seasonal sales cheer for US stores;;US retailers were hit with another set of disappointing data for the 2006 holiday season on Wednesday.The figures came amid growing evidence that economic worries had combined with weather issues to weaken US consumers’ willingness to spend.The weekly index from the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS, which tracks sales at 75 leading chain stores, said its sales index in the pre-Christmas week increased by just 1.7 per cent against the same period last year, the slowest year-on-year weekly growth since February 2005.The figures follow numbers from MasterCard Advisor’s SpendingPulse, which estimated that seasonal retail sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas rose at an adjusted rate of just 3 per cent, compared with growth of 5.3 per cent last year.The data are adjusted to take account of there being just 30 shopping days in the period this year, one fewer than in 2005.The SpendingPulse figures are based on MasterCard sales data augmented with estimates for cash and cheque sales, excluding vehicles, and are one of the most comprehensive early indicators of US retail sales performance.SpendingPulse said the figures were “a continuation of a trend of decelerating growth that we first started to track in the second quarter of this year”.“The retail economy is still growing, however the growth is at a slower pace than we have experienced for the past two to three years.”The group, which analyses sales data on a regional basis, noted that while warm weather in the north-east US may have contributed to slower clothing sales growth, overall sales were also affected by the climate, suffering the impact of severe winter weather in the Great Plains and north-central states.SpendingPulse also estimated that online sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas rose “in the low 20 per cent range”, but were in “in the upper teens” if the extra day was excluded.Forrester Research, the e-commerce analysts, had predicted a 23 per cent increase in online sales over the Thanksgiving to Christmas period.Leading US retailers are due to report their overall sales for December on Thursday January 4.
441;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-12-26T22:02:04Z;Sales rush starts after a mixed Christmas;;Retailers on both sides of the Atlantic on Tuesday began slashing prices to boost sales following a mixed performance in the days leading up to Christmas.While some UK retailers, such as the John Lewis department store chain, reported a better-than-expected performance in the run-up to Christmas, in the US, many said sales had fallen short of their hopes. In both countries, the strength of retail sales is seen as a bellwether for the health of consumer spending.Selfridges department store on Oxford Street reported shoppers started queuing at 3am – well before last year’s 5am start – in the hope of snaffling a bargain on Tuesday, particularly in ladies’ accessories.In New York, Macy’s opened its doors at 7am to offer shoppers discounts of up to 75 per cent.According to SpendingPulse, which analyses US retail spending using MasterCard data, sales grew by 3 per cent from the day after Thanksgiving to Christmas eve this year, compared with 5.2 per cent growth in 2005.Many US analysts blame a slowdown in sales growth on troubles in the housing market, as well as unseasonably warm weather in the north-east, which hurt sales of winter clothes.In Germany, retailers have been upbeat about Christmas trade, although the HDE retailers’ association is waiting until Wednesday before presenting an update. Anecdotal evidence suggests shopping has been brisk in Europe’s largest economy.Amazon.com on Tuesday said its 2006 Christmas sales were its “best ever”, underlining the appeal of online shopping compared with the high street.Its top-selling items included The Audacity of Hope, a book by US Senator Barack Obama and the Beatles’ “Love” collection.
442;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-12-20T01:18:28Z;Mack enjoys bumper debut year at helm;;John Mack on Tuesday celebrated the end of his first full financial year as chief executive of Morgan Stanley by reporting bumper profits and reversing his one major change in the strategy pursued by his predecessor, Philip Purcell.The better-than-expected profits and the return to the plan to spin off the Discover credit cards business appeared to reinforce Mr Mack’s contention that it was not Mr Purcell’s strategy that was at fault. It was execution.When Mr Mack was appointed last summer following months of in-fighting over Mr Purcell’s leadership, he resisted calls for the group to be broken up.Mr Mack had been one of the driving forces behind the 1997 merger between Morgan Stanley and Mr Purcell’s Dean Witter, which many critics blamed for the group’s disappointing performance in recent years.He even rescinded Mr Purcell’s decision, made under intense pressure just before he was ousted, to spin off Dean Witter’s Discover credit card arm. Mr Mack insisted the struggling brokerage and asset management businesses, that also came with Dean Witter, could be turned around and Discover’s earnings provided valuable stability to the more volatile securities businesses of Morgan Stanley.There are signs he was right about the brokerage business. The new team under James Gorman, former head of Merrill Lynch’s brokerage arm, delivered its best performance in six years in the fourth quarter with underlying pre-tax income up 22 per cent in the year.The asset management arm is still struggling financially but Mr Mack told analysts on Tuesday it was not a candidate to be spun off. “There are a lot of synergies between asset management and the securities businesses,” he said.As for Discover, the business has performed well and Mr Mack says that the arguments against spinning it off last year have lessened. For a start, the Morgan Stanley securities businesses have become more diversified, so earnings, in theory, have become less volatile. The businesses have also grown strongly, reducing the potential for Discover to provide stability.But observers say the main change has been the reception from investors to MasterCard, whose shares have more than doubled since its flotation in May.MasterCard is valued at more than 20 times earnings, twice Morgan Stanley’s multiple. Analysts say Discover would not command such a high rating. Unlike MasterCard and Visa, which just run networks, Discover also issues cards.Guy Moszkowski, analyst at Merrill Lynch, suggests the shares could be valued at about 16.5 times the average of 2005 and 2006 net earnings.This rating, which partly reflects the likelihood that it would attract potential bidders and the sheer size of its portfolio ($50bn), would give it a market value of $13.6bn. The higher rating would also give Discover currency for acquisitions.However, Richard Bove, an analyst at Punk Ziegel, argues that the rating will be much lower – more in line with Morgan Stanley’s own – and predicts the spin-off will destroy shareholder value over the next 12 to 18 months.Although Morgan Stanley has enjoyed very strong market conditions this year, most observers would agree it has performed well under Mr Mack’s leadership, particularly given the concerns over the loss of a large number of experienced executives last year.David Sidwell, chief financial officer, says that it has performed strongly compared with the competition so far this year in terms of revenue, income from continued operations and return on equity.That is all reflected in the stock price which is up more than 40 per cent.Irritatingly for Mr Mack, there is one investment bank that has done even better: arch-rival Goldman Sachs.
443;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-12-19T19:09:02Z;Morgan Stanley;;Sometimes, it takes a while to rediscover yourself. In 2006, Morgan Stanley finally has. Its solid fourth- quarter results indicate renewed strength, admittedly in an exceptional environment. Better yet, Morgan Stanley has at last decided to spin-off its Discover credit card unit.Since John Mack returned to the helm in 2005, keeping the card unit has been pretty much the only source of persistent complaints among shareholders. Jettisoning Discover will remove the last eye-catching reminder of Morgan Stanley’s 1997 merger with Dean Witter, which most investors have come to regret.The stock market success of MasterCard underlines the possible appeal of Discover as a stand-alone entity. Still, as both a card issuer and a payment processing network, it will continue to face structural challenges.But even at a sizeable discount to MasterCard’s current multiple of 24 times 2007 earnings, a spin-off should unlock substantial value. Morgan Stanley itself trades at 11.5 times 2007 earnings, roughly in line with its Wall Street peers. As for the potential diversification benefits – the traditional justification for keeping Discover – investors can simply hold on to both shares if they want to.Even after the spin-off, Morgan Stanley faces fewer risks than its peers, partly due to continuing progress at its retail brokerage, its other perennial problem child. Last year’s string of high-profile staff defections failed to damage the bank’s performance. That could help dampen compensation demands. Finally, Morgan Stanley continues to look relatively conservative in putting its own money at risk. But like other investment banks, it could look a lot less appealing by the time Discover starts trading in late 2007.

Its shares soared on the news, up 12 per cent for the week at $16.41.Investors weighed up a mixed set of economic reports against a largely positive set of third quarter company earnings. But Pfizer lost ground after the release of mixed preliminary clinical data for a proposed follow-on to its anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor. Its shares were down 2.2 per cent for the week at $26.62.Merger and acquisition activity was in the spotlight all week. The biggest deal to be announced involved the $21bn merger between pharmacy chain CVS and pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx, with CVS exchanging 1.67 shares for each share of Caremark. Shares in CVS were 7.3 per cent lower at $28.92. Caremark shares were down 4.2 per cent to $47.59. The falls came amid fears the merger might invite antitrust enquiries from regulators.R.R. Donnelley & Sons said it intended to buy Banta in a deal of about $1.3bn. Shares in Banta soared 15 per cent for the week to reach $51.97. Donnelley’s shares were up 1.7 per cent at $34.64.In other merger news, American Power Conversion soared after Schneider Electric of France launched a $6.1bn, or $31 a share, offer. Its shares climbed 27 per cent to $30.18.In earnings news, MasterCard reported an 82 per cent jump in third quarter earnings to $1.42 a share, well above consensus estimate of $1.07 a share. Shares were up 21.3 per cent at $88.14.Verizon Communications’ earnings were in line with Wall Street estimates of 68 cents a share, but shares fell 5 per cent to $36.64 on fears over the amount of money being spent on its FiOS TV and internet project.Shares in radio company Clear Channel were down 1 per cent at $34.40, even though it reported better than expected third quarter profits of $185.9m compared with a year-ago profit of $205.5m.Investors bid up Dell on Thursday after an analyst’s note suggesting that investors had learned to live with slower growth.Describing the personal computer manufacturer as a “potential turnaround candidate” and pointing to room for profit margin upside, Goldman Sachs analyst Laura Conigliaro raised her rating on Dell to neutral, having kept the stock on the sell list for 2½ months.Dell shares fell amid a tech sell-off on Friday and were down 3.9 per cent for the week at $22.21.Leading market indicators looked set to finish the week lower. The S&P 500 index was down 0.9 per cent, or 14.4 points, on the week at 1,364.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index was off 0.9 per cent, or 31.4 points, at 2,328.45. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 12,000, down 1 per cent, or 109 points, at 11,988.4.Leading US retailers reported earnings and sales data over the course of the week. Wal-Mart set a bearish tone after it said disappointing apparel demand and disruption from store remodelling projects had pulled same-store sales below its lowered forecast.Sales for October ran at 0.5 per cent, well below Wal-Mart’s guidance of 2-4 per cent. This was its weakest performance since December 2000. Its shares were 6.5 per cent lower at $47.44.Federated, the department store chain, beat sales forecasts for the third quarter but fell 8 per cent to $40.33 on a weaker sales outlook.Mark Jordahl from First American Funds, said some retailers had been hit after mixed earnings and continuing concerns about high energy prices.He added: “I think it is not surprising, given the run up in equity markets since the start of August that the past week has been flat to down, particularly given the volume of lukewarm economic indicators.”A number of economic reports were issued during the week, with the Conference Board on Tuesday saying its index of consumer confidence fell to 105.4 from a revised 105.9 in September.Non-farm payrolls rose 92,000 in October, below the consensus estimate of 125,000 jobs.
445;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-11-01T21:29:01Z;Wall St lower as economic data weighs;;"Wall Street closed lower on Wednesday as the good mood surrounding stellar earnings from MasterCard and healthy deal activity was punctured by economic data.That in turn aggravated concerns among investors that the economy could face a harder landing in 2007.After a bright opening, shares pulled back when the Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index suggested activity was nearly at the threshold separating expansion and contraction. Housing and construction activity also slowed.In earnings news, MasterCard reported an 82 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings to $1.42 per share; well above the consensus estimate of $1.07 per share. Shares in the company closed $10.97, or 14.8 per cent, higher at $85.07.Merger and acquisition activity was also in the spotlight. R.R. Donnelley & Sons said it intended to buy Banta in a deal worth about $1.3bn. Shares in Banta increased by $7.87, or 17.8 per cent, to reach $52.15. Donnelley’s shares were 39 cents, or 1.2 per cent, firmer at $34.25.Pharmacy chain CVS and pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx, which has a market value of about $21bn, said they would merge, with CVS exchanging 1.67 shares for each share of Caremark. Shares in CVS were off $2.32, or 7.4 per cent, to $29.06. Caremark shares were down $1.06, or 2.2 per cent, to $48.17, once the terms were announced, down from a high of $53.65.Standard & Poor’s Equity Research Services reiterated its strong buy recommendation for CVS. “We believe such a transaction would fit well with CVS’s long-term strategy to increase the size and offerings of its pharmacy benefits management business,” said analyst Joe Agnese.The news buffeted the healthcare sector. Shares in McKesson swung sharply after its fiscal second-quarter earnings topped estimates and were off $1.10 or 2.2 per cent, at $48.99. Some analysts said a CVS-Caremark merger could reduce earnings at companies like McKesson.At the close of trading, the S&P 500 was 10.1 points, or 0.7 per cent, lower at 1,367.87. The Nasdaq Composite was down 32.4 points, or 1.4 per cent, at 2,334.35. Both indices were off earlier high points of 1,381.78 and 2,375.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 50.3 points, or 0.4 per cent, lower at 12,031.59.Time Warner said its third-quarter earnings were 19 cents a share; 1 cent below forecasts.

446;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-10-11T22:40:34Z;Visa IPO;;Decisions made by committees are rarely speedy. That probably helps explain why it has taken Visa so long to unveil plans for turning itself into a listed company. For now, Visa remains a membership association owned by more than 20,000 financial institutions, which have yet to vote on the plan but look set to approve it now that the boards of various Visa entities have done so unanimously.Visa’s plans certainly make sense. Apart from helping finance growth, the new structure should also reduce regulatory scrutiny, to which Visa, along with its rival MasterCard, has been subject for more than a decade. Most of the credit card organisations’ antitrust and other legal troubles stemmed directly from cosy relations with member banks and floating them has long looked like a logical step.Visa should certainly benefit from the success of MasterCard’s flotation. The latter’s share price has risen by 80 per cent since its initial public offering in May. A valuation of about 25 times earnings for this year suggests that investors increasingly believe that nasty surprises from ongoing litigation should be limited. But while MasterCard’s new structure might help shift the potential liabilities – say for overcharging merchants – to its erstwhile member banks, it remains too early to tell if the company will escape altogether.At least Visa shareholders should have less to worry about than their MasterCard counterparts when it comes to the European business, which will remain a separate membership association and become a licensee. Visa’s larger scale, with roughly twice as many cards and two and a half times higher sales volumes than MasterCard, should make for juicy margins. Its market share gains in recent years also suggest healthy underlying business trends, while secular forces favouring plastic remain intact.As the ad says, “life takes Visa”. Investors would probably agree now. But they have plenty of time to lose their exuberance before Visa finally gets to price its shares.
447;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-10-11T22:07:55Z;Visa to go public in radical shake-up;;Visa on Wednesday responded to mounting regulatory and legal pressure by unveiling a bold plan to transform itself into a public company while separating its European arm from the rest of the global credit card network.The move comes less than six months after MasterCard, its main rival, completed a stock market issue partially designed to shield its member banks from lawsuits in the US. The shares, priced at $39 in May, ended trading just below $70 on Wednesday, valuing the company at almost $9.5bn. Analysts see Visa, expected to opt for a New York listing, as worth significantly more than $10bn.The shake-up, approved by the boards of Visa’s six regional operating companies, will see the 36-year-old group transformed from a network controlled by the world’s banks into a commercial organisation with a majority of independent shareholders.Visa and MasterCard face growing scrutiny from regulators and retailers who claim they impose artificially high charges on users.The growth of electronic commerce has made networks such as Visa, which handled payments worth $4,300bn in the 12 months to June, increasingly central to the functioning of the global economy.Visa’s European arm will remain an association owned by its member banks, operating as a licensee of Visa Inc, the proposed publicly listed company. Executives said the structure was designed to allow member banks to meet the demands of the European Commission, which is pressing for the creation of a Single Euro Payments Area by 2008.“Building this single market, which we wholeheartedly support, is unique to Europe and will require investment in infrastructure and very close co-operation between European banks,” said Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe. “We believe the association structure is the best way to facilitate this.”European bank executives said the Commission had indicated its preference for Europe’s payments infrastructure to be operated by European-owned companies. But Visa Europe’s decision also reflects the desire of its member banks to distance themselves from lawsuits in the US.Michael Lafferty, chairman of the Lafferty Group, a payments consultancy, said: “As of now, neither Visa nor MasterCard is Sepa-compliant, though Visa’s separate structure for Europe might give it a slight advantage in becoming compliant.”Peter Hawkins, a director of Visa International, said the restructuring would improve Visa’s efficiency while giving it access to external capital to fund growth in emerging markets. As part of the restructuring, Visa has started a search for a new chief executive to run the business.Visa Europe and its member banks are expected to pocket a substantial windfall from the flotation, expected to take place in 12-18 months.
448;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall Street down on earnings fears;;US stocks closed lower on Wednesday as investors grew cautious following a mixed batch of corporate earnings.Legg Mason, the mutual fund manager, sank 17.2 per cent to $87.15 after it warned that its second-quarter earnings would come in well below analysts’ estimates, partly due to a shift away from equity funds and towards less profitable fixed income funds.The warning caused Merrill Lynch to cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “sell”. Its shares have dropped 27 per cent this year.“Given few strong equity products at Legg right now, equity net outflows are likely to continue,” said Merrill’s Guy Moszkowski in a note to investors. “Without equity net inflows, and after three [quarters of] earnings disappointments, Legg is likely to trade at a 10 per cent discount to the peer average.”The news dented shares in brokerages that were also suffering after Bank of America announced that it would give 30 free trades a month to customers with $25,000 in deposits at the bank.Charles Schwab fell 4.7 per cent to $17.22 while TD Ameritrade lost 11.9 per cent to $16.82 and E*trade shed 8.8 per cent to $22.31. The AMEX Securities Broker Index sank 4.2 per cent, its worst day in four months.Aluminium producer Alcoa, the first Dow component to report earnings, lost 5.1 per cent to $26.85. Late on Tuesday, it announced an 86 per cent increase in third quarter profit, significantly less than analysts had ex-pected. Alcoa attributed the results to lower aluminium prices and weakness in the home-building and car- manufacturing markets.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent, or 3.47 points, at 1,349.95, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent, or 7.16 points, at 2,308.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.1 per cent, or 15.04 points, to 11,852.13.Crude oil futures sank to $57.59 a barrel – their lowest level so far this year – denting energy stocks. Schlumberger dropped 3 per cent to $57.46, while Weatherford International tumbled 3 per cent to $40.52.Drugstore CVS rose 4.9 per cent to $31.16 after it reported better-than-expected profit in its preliminary third quarter earnings statement, thanks to a strong back-to-school season.Fertiliser and agricultural biotechnology group Monsanto slid 5.3 per cent to $43.95 after it announced its third quarter losses were greater than analysts had expected.Phelps Dodge rose 3.5 per cent to $90.84 after investment group Atticus Capital said it had met with potential buyers of the copper producer to gauge their interest.Advanced Micro Devices climbed 4.9 per cent to $24.27 after ThinkEquity raised its rating on the stock from “sell” to “buy”, saying fourth quarter demand for semiconductors in Asia and Europe should be strong.
449;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Visa to focus on developing Sepa regime;;Visa Europe’s decision to break away from the global group and maintain its structure as an association owned and controlled by member banks was on Wednesday explained by reference to the peculiarities of the European payment market.Visa executives pointed in particular to a landmark European Union effort to create a seamless, cross-border payments regime which will ensure that transfers between EU member states are completed as cheaply and simply as national ones.The regime, known as the Single Euro Payment Area, or Sepa, is intended to be up and running by 2008, and is seen by European policymakers as a cornerstone of their efforts to build a fully-functioning single market for financial services.Visa Europe said on Wednesday that its “membership-owned, not-for-profit association structure will enable it to remain focused on the development of the European internal market in payments and the Single Euro Payments Area”.Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the group’s structure was better suited to the demands of building and administering the complex infrastructure required to make Sepa work.He said: “If you are a publicly-owned company you have responsibility primarily for driving profit and not for building this infrastructure. The single market is absolutely unique to Europe. Nowhere else across the globe are countries trying to integrate different countries into a single payment area.”Mr Ayliffe said that Visa payment services would comply with Sepa’s requirements by the beginning of next year, but stressed that further investment and efforts would be necessary to operate successfully in this new commercial environment.One particular challenge would be to broaden the appeal of Visa Europe’s debit card, VPay, which currently lags behind rival MasterCard’s Maestro service.Industry experts pointed out that there were other differences between Europe and the rest of the world that may help explain Visa’s decision.One source highlighted the continuing regulatory risk faced by credit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard in Europe.Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, in April attacked credit card companies for making what she said were “outrageous” profits, and accused them of operating a “closed shop”, singling out Visa and MasterCard in her attacks.Another person familiar with the industry pointed out that the 4,500 banks that own and control Visa Europe had always shown a strong independent streak, and had been keen to keep the group’s New York headquarters at arm’s length.

Both Visa and its main rival, Mastercard, have in recent years come under attack from regulators, who have sought to break open what they argued was a cosy cartel controlled by the world’s banks. At the same time large US retailers, who are the main users of the credit card networks, have launched a series of lawsuits that accuse Visa and Mastercard of maintaining the interchange fees they charge merchants for using their networks at an artificially high level.The increased scrutiny reflects the growing power of credit cards. In 1958, when Bank of America launched its BankAmericard – the card that later became Visa – few could have predicted the extent to which electronic payments would replace cash and cheques as the preferred method for consumers to spend money. The rapid growth in electronic commerce over the internet has further boosted the traffic over Visa and Mastercard’s networks: last year, Visa handled one euro in every ten spent by European consumers.At first glance Visa is imitating Mastercard, which became a public company through its successful initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year. Mastercard shares, which were priced at $39 in May, have risen to more than $70, valuing the company at around $9.5bn. Although Visa’s current structure makes it hard to compare the financial performance of the two companies, most analysts believe Visa would have a substantially larger market share than its rival.Like Mastercard, Visa is hoping that becoming a listed company with a majority of independent directors and more than 50 per cent of its shares held by public investors will help to protect its member banks from lawsuits in the US. Though the credit card operators have vigorously denied any liability, the threat of large financial penalties has cast a pall over the success of both networks.Yet in one important way, Visa’s structure is different from Mastercard. Rather than creating a single global holding company, Visa has decided that its European arm should remain a separate entity controlled by its member banks. In order to achieve this, Visa Europe will be granted an exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable licence to operate the Visa network.In the past, Visa Europe executives have voiced their vehement opposition to incorporation. And some analysts said on Wednesday the move appeared to be at least partially designed to shield Visa’s European members from any legal liability arising from the United States. The decision also appears to be aimed to improve Visa Europe’s chances of benefiting from the planned introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area, which starts in 2008.Sepa is aimed at allowing consumers and businesses to make international payments in euros as simply and cheaply as domestic transfers. Bank executives said the European Commission has indicated that it would not look favourably if the payments systems that formed part of Sepa were part of an organisation incorporated in the US.“The decision for Visa to stay as a member-owned not-for-profit was a unanimous decision by Visa Europe’s board,” said Peter Ayliffe, chief executive of Visa Europe. “It is the best way to address the unique challenges we face in Europe.”Jerry Norton, director of strategy (financial services) at IT consultancy Logica CMG, said the split would help Visa Europe deal with the substantial regulatory change coming through in the cards and payments area, including SEPA. He said: “Visa needs to ensure as an organisation it is compliant with these changes and needs to keep in mind the potential impact of the Payment Services Directive.“Having the European division of Visa as a separate entity will aid compliance and help corporate governance and ensure that the work going into Sepa and the PSD will continue uninterrupted.”Visa will now embark on the task of combining its operations around the world into a single entity, while recruiting a new chief executive from outside the company and filling a board with a majority of independent directors.For Visa Europe and its member banks, the main question is what kind of windfall to expect from the IPO.
451;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-10-06T16:04:31Z;Load ’em up and take hold of the readies;;"If you make a claim on your home insurance policy or step off a flight to find your luggage has not arrived with you, you may now find that you are reimbursed with a pre-paid card rather than cash or a cheque.Pre-paid cards – cards loaded with money that can then be withdrawn or used to pay for goods or services – have been in the UK for around five years. But over the past 12 months their presence has really taken hold.Consumers, especially those who do not have access to credit or debit cards, can obtain them without credit checks and they do not need a bank account. They are also increasingly popular with businesses looking for more efficient ways to pay staff and customers.PSE Consulting, the European payment consultancy, estimates that the total number of pre-paid cards issued in the UK will rise from 2m currently to 44m by 2010. It expects that by 2010, €15bn will be spent on pre-paid cards each year in the UK.MasterCard has tie-ups with airlines, including KLM and Austrian Airlines. These companies are using pre-paid cards to provide compensation to passengers who are delayed or have lost their baggage. British Airways is also looking at offering a Visa pre-paid card for the same purpose. Reuters, the media group, provides pre-paid cards for journalists to cover expenses while travelling overseas.Cards being used by businesses are generally Visa or MasterCard-branded as these cards can be used at any cash machine or retail outlet bearing the relevant logo. Cards that have a fairly small one-off balance – perhaps £50 or £100 – generally do not require a pin number or signature.According to Rich Wagner, chief executive of Advanced Payment Solutions, the main advantage of using cards instead of cash or cheques is that the money is instantly available to the cardholder, whereas cheques can take days to clear. Cardholders do not need bank accounts to use the card. These cards also provide a secure alternative to cash: if a card is lost or stolen, it can be immediately blocked and reissued by the provider, usually at no cost to the user.Insurance companies are also entering the pre-paid market. Norwich Union, one of the UK’s biggest insurers, gives customers the option of receiving their insurance claim on a pre-paid Visa Electron card.So, for example, if someone makes a claim for a stolen television or a piece of jewellery, the company might send out a pre-loaded card that can be used to pay for a replacement. This way the claimant gets the money instantly and does not have to pay out of their own pockets and then reclaim from the insurer.Cards issued by Norwich Union can only be used in a number of specific retailers.Carol Heath, head of pre-paid at Visa Europe, expects strong growth in the motor and health insurance industries. She says you could be issued with a card to pay for a course of physiotherapy, for example.Chris Reddish, head of pre-paid at Mastercard Europe, says another fast growth area is payroll. Recruitment agencies and contractors are using pre-paids to pay
foreign nationals or short-term workers. Fifa, the football association, paid short-term staff working at this year’s World Cup tournament via pre-paid cards.More traditional uses for pre-paid cards are also seeing strong growth. These cards were initially used as gifts, and as an alternative to travellers’ cheques. Now they are widely used online to purchase groceries, holidays or pay for services such as the congestion charge, council tax or broadband.Sales of MasterCard’s pre-paid card, Cashplus, are growing at a rate of 20 per cent every month, and people are increasingly loading on larger values. Almost £25m has been loaded on to the Cashplus card since its launch a year ago. Meanwhile, Visa has seen demand for its pre-paid cards quadruple in the past year.You can buy these cards online, by telephone or at retailers, such as money transfer agencies. MasterCard says its Cashplus card can be reloaded at 14,000 locations worldwide, including all Post Offices.The downside of these cards is that they are fairly expensive. You will typically have to pay £1-£2.50 to withdraw cash from ATMs in the UK and up to £3 overseas. There are also initial and monthly fees. According to Moneysupermarket, MasterCard’s Cashplus card costs £9.95 initially and then cardholders can pay a monthly subscription of £4.95 or £1 per transaction. Liquid, a card offered by Newcastle Building Society, charges the same initial fee but only a £2 monthly fee.Other cards designed for taking money abroad are cheaper. These are offered with no fee by Travelex and Western Union, although exchange rates may not be competitive. The Post Office charges £10 for its travel money card and American Express charges £20."
452;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-08-22T19:50:38Z;IPO delays reach five-year high;;The number of US initial public offerings that have been withdrawn or postponed so far this year has reached a five-year high, with companies being put off by uncertain market conditions and a difficult capital raising environment.A total of 44 planned offerings worth a combined $10bn have been withdrawn or postponed, according to Dealogic. It is the highest level of withdrawals or postponements since 2001, when 127 deals worth a combined $12.8bn were pulled during the same period.Uncertainty about the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy alongside worries about inflation, rising oil prices and volatile equity markets have made investors wary about taking on new stock issues, especially in sectors perceived as more risky, such as technology, biotechnology and telecommunications, analysts say.The technology sector has been particularly affected in terms of deals withdrawn or postponed, with 10 deals pulled this year to date.This month alone, seven deals have been pulled across a range of sectors: the largest being the planned $1.9bn float of Telemar, the Brazilian telecommunications company.Some companies have chosen to proceed with planned public stock offerings, despite the challenging conditions, with varying degrees of success.Infineon, Europe’s second-largest semiconductor maker, was recently forced to slash the size of the partial float of Qimonda, its memory chip unit, on the New York Stock Exchange. At $546m it was down from an expected figure of more than $1.1bn. The company cited challenging market conditions and uncertain investor sentiment. Even at the reduced size, it was the largest float by a non-US company on the NYSE this year.Cowen Group, the investment banking unit being spun out of Société Générale, the French bank, saw its shares tumble by 5.25 per cent on its Nasdaq debut last month.Some 47 deals came to the market during the second quarter this year, raising a combined $10.3bn, according to IPO research firm Renaissance Capital.The best week for issuance this year was May 22-28 when MasterCard staged its $2.6bn float. MasterCard is the only company of the top 10 IPOs by size to have listed in the US this year. Many overseas companies have opted to float their shares in their home markets or in London because of concerns about the stiff regulatory regime in the US.
453;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-08-21T19:08:13Z;The problems of branding an unsuccessful team;;Any new owner of Newcastle United would certainly hope to capitalise on its brand. It remains one of the best-supported clubs in English football in spite of its notorious lack of success. In common with other clubs it has been trying to raise its profile overseas, including a strategic alliance with a Chinese club.Harry Philp, managing director of Hermes Sports Partners, says: “Newcastle is not much of a brand outside the north-east [of England]. We think it is more difficult to be a complete brand without success on the pitch. You can certainly run some teams better in a commercial sense, but building an international brand is a lot more difficult.”Compared with the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea, Mr Philp puts Newcastle in a second tier of English football clubs alongside Aston Villa and Totteham Hotspur. But unlike Aston Villa, which Randy Lerner, a US businessman, is buying for £62.6m ($118m), Newcastle United is carrying significant debt – about £55m, including the remaining portion of a debt securitisation deal to rebuild its stadium. The Belgravia Group is understood to have resources for any deal, while another part of its proclaimed expertise lies in strategic marketing. An arm called the Affinity Company offers things such as co-branded credit cards to fans. It lists among its clients Everton and Arsenal football clubs and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), alongside names such as MasterCard and American Express.It is unclear how much cash the group would inject into the team should a bid materialise.
454;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-08-11T15:19:26Z;Mark Sellers: Why greatness can beat expectations;;"When Google (GOOG) completed its initial public offering in August 2004, the stock seemed overpriced. Even after reducing its IPO price from $108 to $85, the company’s trailing price/earnings ratio was well over 200. Journalists, analysts and market pundits said Google was the most overpriced IPO in years, and warned investors to avoid it.Soon after the IPO, analysts picked up coverage but were confused about how to model the company’s earnings. The average analyst estimate for Google’s first quarter as a public company was 56 cents a share but the range of estimates was all over the map. Clearly, there was no “consensus” earnings number. Most analysts were cautious.When Google reported for the first time as a public company in October 2004, its earnings per share were 70 cents a share and the stock jumped 15 per cent in a day. In the next few weeks, analysts increased their estimates for the next quarter but again were too cautious. In the next quarter, Google beat the average analyst estimate by 15 cents, earning 92 cents a share compared with estimates of 77 cents. In the next quarter after that, Google earned $1.29 compared with the average estimate of 92 cents.As it turned out, Google’s stock was incredibly cheap at its IPO price of $85. In the year after its IPO, Google’s actual (not estimated) earnings per share were $4.27. This meant it was priced at just 19.9 times its forward earnings on the date of its IPO, although no one knew that at the time.We can learn something valuable from this historical analysis – great companies are often treated by the market as if they were merely average companies when they first go public. In the first four to six quarters expectations rise as analysts come to understand the company better. At the same time, analysts’ estimates become more clustered around a consensus, which gives investors more certainty about the company’s earnings outlook.These two factors cause a “double whammy” effect – not only do earnings expectations rise, lowering the forward p/e ratio, but the risk premium priced into the stock falls. In other words, both the earnings outlook and the p/e ratio go up. These two factors work like a slingshot, causing the stock price to rise dramatically. Google shares rose from $85 to $280 in its first year of trading as earnings estimates rose and the p/e ratio expanded.There are many other examples. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange went public in December 2002 at $42 a share, which was about 18 times trailing earnings per share. That seemed a fair price to many pundits who said the stock was fully valued at that price. But in its first quarter as a public company, the Merc earned 77 cents a share compared with analysts’ estimates of 64 cents. In the next quarter, the company earned $1.03 a share against analysts’ estimates of 93 cents. In this period, analysts grew increasingly bullish and confident in their estimates, and investors responded with a willingness to pay more for a dollar of earnings than they were on the IPO date. The stock price rose more than 700 per cent in the next three years.Then there is Moody’s Investors Service, which was $13 a share when it was spun off from Dun & Bradstreet in September 2000. In three years, the stock rose 120 per cent as analysts raised estimates and the market became more comfortable with Moody’s business outlook, thus awarding the company a higher p/e ratio. Or Morningstar, which went public in May last year at $18 and rose more than 100 per cent in the next year as analysts’ estimates rose and investors became more comfortable with the business model.There are two fundamental factors all these companies share. First, they have an “economic moat” allowing them to generate high returns on capital. Second, they have lots of operating leverage (as opposed to financial leverage). In other words, a 10 per cent rise in revenue translates into far more than a 10 per cent increase in bottom-line profits. Analysts usually underestimate operating leverage when they are not familiar with a company.When a company with these traits begins to trade publicly, analysts are usually too cautious. Investors can play this to their advantage by buying and holding great companies when they go public, ignoring what analysts say. Excess returns come from buying an asset when market expectations are too low and selling when expectations are too high. Never are expectations off so much as when a great company first trades publicly.My investment fund holds the shares of two companies that are at the beginning of this “increasing expectations” cycle – MasterCard International and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Both are recent IPOs, both crushed analyst expectations in their first quarter as public companies and both have high operating leverage. I expect them to outperform the broader market in the next couple of years.

455;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall Street gains on robust earnings;;US markets closed higher on Wednesday as investors were cheered by robust earnings news.Procter & Gamble reported a 36 per cent jump in fiscal fourth quarter profit, just ahead of analyst expectations, pushing its shares up 4.2 per cent to a three-month high of $58.29.TimeWarner added 2.6 per cent to $16.67 after it beat Wall Street estimates by reporting $1bn in profit in the second quarter, up from a loss of $409m in the same period last year.Health insurer Cigna leapt 10.2 per cent to $102.10 after beating analysts’ estimates with its second quarter results and raising its full-year forecast.The news pulled other insurers higher. Coventry Health Care rose 2.2 per cent to $54.52 and Health Net, which reports earnings on Thursday, climbed 5.5 per cent to $44.80.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.6 per cent, or 7.63 points, at 1,278.55, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent, or 16.82 points, at 2,078.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent, or 74.20 points, to 11,199.93.All the leading indices came off midday highs as the afternoon wore on. Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck said the afternoon pull-back was caused by nervousness over the broader economic outlook.“It doesn’t surprise me that we have rallies and flurries,” he said.“As much as there is good news in the earnings picture looking backwards, we do have this issue of what kind of cooling there is in the economy.”Software maker Adobe Systems gained 13.9 per cent to $32.28 after it said that it would meet its earnings target when it releases third quarter results in September.Shares in Electronic Arts rose 7.7 per cent to $50.12 after beating analysts’ expectations with higher revenue driven by strong sales of its most popular video game titles.Moodys Corporation, owner of the Moody’s credit rating agency, surged 11.1 per cent to $60.11 after it reported an 18 per cent increase in second quarter profit.Casino stocks climbed after Wynn Resorts said its losses had halved to $20m in the second quarter. Wynn surged 8.5 per cent to $66.94 while Las Vegas Sands climbed 6.3 per cent to $65.28. MGM Grand added 7.7 per cent to $38.00.Ford Motor added 5.8 per cent to $6.96 on news reports that it had embarked on a strategic review of its operations, with an eye towards the possible sale of poorly performing units.Mastercard, which made its stock market debut in May, swung to a loss in the second quarter, shedding $311m as it was hit by charges related to its initial public offering. The results were still ahead of forecasts and its shares gained 11.2 per cent to $50.02.
456;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
457;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-07-20T17:24:44Z;Wal-Mart’s amateur advertisers;;"Could Babi, Sam Flow and Jay Jay So Sexy represent the future for Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer?All three are featured on the personal web pages of The Hub – School My Way, an online project that is part of its current “back-to-school” season marketing campaign.Launched earlier this month, The Hub is Wal-Mart’s latest bid to reach out to fashion-conscious youth consumers, urging them to “check out what styles are on the horizon”, and to “express your style”.It also marks the giant retailer’s first venture into the rapidly evolving world of interactive consumer-generated advertising – with an online competition inviting high school students to create their own web pages and videos, with the winners to be used in a Wal-Mart cable television commercial, possibly also for cinema release.The “School My Way” project is jointly sponsored by Sony, and put together by Wal-Mart’s GSD&M marketing agency, part of Omnicom, the world’s biggest marketing services agency. It follows similar campaigns this year by Nike and its Converse brand, and by MasterCard, Toyota Motor and L’Oréal.Such strategies are a response to broader changes in the way media is consumed, especially by teen­agers and people aged in their 20s, an audience prized by advertisers.The rapid spread of high-speed internet connections, together with the greater ease with which people can put their own text, audio and video content on the web and edit it, has changed media consumption from a passive experience to an interactive one. The same factors are also contributing to increased viewing of video on the web, including video advertising, previously available mainly on television.“This is the most creative generation that ever lived,” said Aaron Cohen, chief executive of Bolt.com, a user-generated content site which this week ran a competition to create a cyberspace “virtual band”, sponsored by the Wendy’s hamburger chain.“For these consumers, everything is recorded on their phones or on digital cameras. Just as watching ­television is entertaining for many older people; for
them, putting up music and videos and being part of a group talking about this is entertaining.”MySpace.com, the world’s biggest social networking site – and owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp – has nearly 250,000 new people around the world signing up every day and is expected to reach 100m registered users next month. The site, launched just three years ago, allows users to create personal profiles and put up blogs, video and songs, link to other users and communicate with them. It is now being tested by many advertisers, for example, with the creation of profiles based around made-up characters promoting a product.Reggie Bradford is chief executive of ViTrue, a company that provides marketers with the technology to create interactive advertising and which is in talks about partnering with a large advertising agency. He says that while this year a handful of brands were experimenting with the new interactive advertisements, he expects hundreds of campaigns next year.“We are just scratching the surface. Instead of a small number of ad agency executives creating the best ads, millions of people will be contributing to creating the best ads. This is a huge change that will really enhance brand advertising.”Compared with the tens of billions of dollars spent every year on television advertising, the amount spent on internet video advertising is very small: probably tens of millions of dollars in the US, according to some estimates. Even as a share of the rapidly growing internet advertising sector, which reached $12.5bn last year in the US, video commercials are tiny, with most spending going on search- word advertisements.YouTube, the fast-growing video-watching site, which recently passed the milestone of 100m video downloads a day, does not carry much advertising, in spite of its reach. This is partly because many advertisers are cautious about the new media. The risks of being associated with inappropriate or illegally reproduced content might damage a brand’s reputation.Indeed, the perils of handing over creative control to the internet were demonstrated earlier this year by GM’s Chevrolet brand’s new advertising-building website for the launch of its Tahoe 2007 SUV, where viewers were able to add their own text to a selection of clips and music. The responses included more than 3,000 attacking the company over fuel economy, global warming and its safety record.Wal-Mart has adopted a restricted format, with rules that preclude posting a range of potentially offensive material – including impersonations of politicians and other public figures. Web pages can only use recorded music from a limited selection of songs made available on the site by Sony.All submissions are also reviewed. As a result, after 10 days of operations, most of the original video submissions were still blank and marked “pending approval”.Registering to join Wal-Mart’s Hubster community also requires parental consent. Registered Hubsters are not allowed to post personal contact details, such as phone numbers, e-mail addresses or last names.Wal-Mart’s effort comes at a time when other mainstream online retailers are beginning to take a closer look at the opportunities for creating online communities – which can both reinforce customer loyalty and provide valuable marketing feedback.Target, Wal-Mart’s main discount rival in the US, this year started posting customer reviews below products on its online site – using technology developed by Amazon Web Services, which administers the Target site.Amazon itself has pushed even further ahead in the US, developing its online reviews to create user profile pages that can include photographs, e-mail addresses and lists of recommendations. These can then be linked to other selected “Amazon friends”.It is also continuing to test “tagging”, which allows a user to create a personal set of links connecting a variety of recommended product pages under topics such as “money” or “amazing story”.Tim Stock, president of scenarioDNA, a brand consultancy, argues that the Amazon site – unlike Wal-Mart’s marketing-focused Hub – reflects a more appropriate understanding of the role that social networking can play.“A lot of companies are still misunderstanding what social networks are,” he says. “They’re not websites . . . they’re people who use the technology to connect. So you have to do something that is authentic, and offer something to make them want to use it. You are tapping in to what people do naturally.”YO, BUYERS! DIY COMMERCIALS DRIVEN BY FUN, FAME AND FORTUNENew web tools and cheap technology make it easy for people to create their own material for advertising. Online blogs, pictures, videos and music can be home-made or edited versions of existing content. Yet they still require people to do some work rather than just sit back and watch something. Why should anyone take the time and trouble to make advertisements for a company that is not their client or employer?■It’s fun. Contributors enjoy the creative aspects and entertainment of making their own videos or music.■Fifteen minutes of fame. Many websites offer the chance to get your art, video or music shown to the world, either online or on television or even in film advertising. You no longer need to have good contacts or luck to get one of a handful of jobs at advertising agencies.■Prizes. Probably the most traditional of incentives, prizes are already used in many marketing campaigns. The chance to win fashionable clothes, electronic goods or tickets to concerts or film screenings, often with exclusive access to stars, remains a popular way for companies to try to encourage participation.■Money. Advertising agencies are starting to experiment with paying people to reflect the popularity of their advertisements, using the pay-per-click model commonly used in the online advertising world. As well as giving amateurs an incentive to try to make great advertisements, this model might also encourage agency employees to do their most creative work incognito, unhampered by the need for client approval."
458;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-07-19T13:10:56Z;JPMorgan profit triples to $3.5bn;;JPMorgan Chase reported on Wednesday that its net income more than tripled to a record $3.54bn, or 99 cents per share, in the second quarter, as the bank reaped the benefits of an “extremely favourable credit environment”.Earnings at the third biggest US bank rose from $1bn, or 28 cents a share last year, and benefited by comparison with the previous year from the recovery of a litigation insurance charge of $1.2bn after tax, or 33 cents a share.Per-share earnings were 92 cents after stripping out one off private equity gains, litigation insurance recoveries, the sale of shares in MasterCard initial public offering, expenses in the Treasury portfolio and merger costs.That still beat average analysts estimates, according to Thomson, of 87 cents.Citigroup, the no. 1 US bank, reported earnings slightly below expectations earlier this week, and saw its shares dip sharply.Bank of America, the second largest bank, posted $1.22 a share net profits excluding charges on Wednesday, beating estimates by 12 cents a share.Earnings “benefited from the extremely favorable consumer and wholesale credit environment, which is not expected to continue,” said Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive.Revenue jumped 19 percent from the second quarter last year to $14.9 billion, although down about 1 percent on the first quarter.Investment banking net income rose by 37 per cent to $839m, although it was down 1 per cent on last quarter. Revenues were 11 per cent down on the first quarter, but revenues from investment banking fees reached a record $1.4bn, up 42 per cent, driven by record fees in equity and debt underwriting, the company said. Merger advisory fees were flat. Fixed income trading revenues lifted 43 per cent to $2.0bn, after falling 50 per cent last year. Expenses were 35 per cent up on the year at $2.9bn, because of higher performance-related pay.Credit card services delivered the most profitable results for the bank, with a rise in net income on the year of 61 per cent to $875m, but falling 3 per cent on the last quarter. Commercial banking was up 80 per cent on the year to $283 m and up 18 per cent on last quarter, driven by a 9 per cent increase in revenue. Treasury and security services rose 68 per cent to $316m on the year and 21 per cent from the first quarter.Retail banking, which includes loans to consumers and consumer banking, saw earnings fall to $868m, 11 per cent down on the year, and 1 per cent down on the last quarter, as JP Morgan’s mortgage banking arm made a $7m loss, compared to a profit of $124m a year earlier.JPMorgan shares were up 3.8 per cent in pre-market trading at $42.25, while Bank of America were ahead 2 per cent at $49.39.
459;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Online gaming;;Eventually, all gamblers run out of luck. For online gaming sites, that moment certainly seems to be drawing nearer. The arrest of David Carruthers, chief executive of BetonSports, has sent the whole sector into a tail-spin. Add indictments against other employees and business partners of the betting company, as well as legislative pressures for an outright ban on money transfers to settle internet wagers, and offshore gaming sites appear to have been dealt a lousy hand. After all, about half the sector’s $12bn annual revenues are thought to originate from US players.That said, past court rulings, notably in the 2001 MasterCard case, suggest that existing prohibitions may only be applicable to sporting events. The Department of Justice has long disagreed. But picking BetonSports as its first target is an implicit admission that going after online casinos could prove harder under existing law.On the face of it, that leaves gaming sites looking like another victim of US extra-territorial overreach. Following soon after the extradition of three NatWest bankers, such perceptions are already rife in the UK. With luck, that might even secure some support from British policymakers for gambling operators.It is worth keeping in mind, however, that many of today’s gaming sites owe their success at least in part to precisely the murkiness of online gambling’s legality in its largest market. This has kept competition, notably from Las Vegas casino operators, at bay. While most are listed in London, they also tend to be domiciled in more exotic – and low tax – jurisdictions.PartyGaming, the largest one, for example, generates over three- quarters of its revenues in the US. But thanks to its Gibraltar domicile, it only pays an effective underlying tax rate of under 6 per cent. Paying, say, 35 per cent would leave its shares trading at a no-longer outrageously cheap 13 times 2006 earnings. That suggests that even the most benign outcome for the sector of sensible but firm regulation could provide little relief to shareholders.
460;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-07-16T21:05:32Z;EU finds obstacles to bank competition;;Competition among retail banks in the European Union is restricted by a combination of customers’ reluctance to switch institutions and continuing obstacles facing banks when operating in other markets, the EU’s top antitrust authority has found.The investigation by the European Commission was designed to uncover market failures and possible anti-competitive practices in retail banking. The findings will be presented at a hearing in Brussels on Monday.The probe follows similar inquiries into Europe’s electricity and gas markets and the payment cards industry.Both of these sparked severe criticism of big market players, which were accused by Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, of breaking competition rules. Since then, the Commission has raided many large energy groups, and has also reignited a long-simmering antitrust case against MasterCard, the credit card group.The findings of the retail banking probe do not appear to merit such drastic action, however. Published late on Friday, they point to significant market failings but not necessarily to abuses of competition law by the banks or financial services groups. The main findings are:●Retail banking markets are heavily fragmented and closely follow national lines. Barriers to entry remain high.●The systems that allow inter-bank payments to go ahead are also fragmented, and may be used to exclude banks from entering another member state.●Few customers switch banks. Clients hold their current accounts with the same institution for an average of 10 years. Banks, meanwhile, are more profitable in markets where customer mobility is low.●Retail banks’ profitability varies greatly from state to state. Austria and Germany are the least profitable markets, Spain and Finland the most profitable.●The cost of banking services for customers also changes drastically from one member state to another. Luxembourg and Italy are the most expensive, Lithuania and Sweden the cheapest countries.The findings confirm the Commission’s long-held belief that the Union’s internal market has not achieved a meaningful degree of integration in the financial services area. Brussels has not yet indicated how it intends to dismantle the obstacles standing in the way of a fully integrated, pan-European market for retail banking services.
461;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-07-16T17:24:14Z;Advertisers discover the merits of networking;;The dramatic growth of social networking websites such as MySpace and Facebook is encouraging advertisers to step up their experiments with consumer-created internet content.Small-scale, early efforts have highlighted some of the benefits of allying with such content – as well as the dangers.The rise in particular of YouTube.com, which allows people to upload, watch and share home-made and often bizarre video clips, has caught the eye of brands keen to reach consumers spurning mass media.Brian Monahan, of the emerging media lab at IPG, the US marketing services group, says: “I have been doing online advertising for years and have never seen a jump like that (at YouTube).”The general expansion of web advertising – Zenith-Optimedia, the media buyer, predicts it will account for 7 per cent of all global advertising by 2008 – has persuaded the likes of YouTube that there will be enough revenue to fund the increasing costs of running such bandwidth-hungry websites.And moves by MTV, the music broadcaster, CNET, the technology publisher, and other media owners to embrace more user-generated content have convinced agency strategists that the trend will survive any start-up failures.Last week WPP, the marketing services group, announced a joint venture to tap social networking websites, which typically allow users to create and share content on a shared interest.Currently, most advertiser activity could be described as digital dabbling.Some brands are releasing commercials to websites, hoping people will pass on the clips “virally”.GoViral.com, a specialist company which offers TV spots to carefully selected web users, points to work for brands such as Goodyear, the tyre maker. Software tracks how many people open the clips or forward them. This month, three spots for Goodyear notched up an estimated 5.7m views.But Thomas Weikop, chief executive of GoViral.com, says the experience also illustrates that, “We are not in control”.Unlike traditional press or TV campaigns, which last only as long as advertisers are willing to buy media, virals endure as long as internet users want to pass them on.As such, virals are sometimes quoted in support of the fashionable “Long Tail” theory. Broadly, this argues that the web is able to sell a wider range of products to a larger number of potential customers than conventional retailers and therefore can support myriad niche markets comprising one “long tail”.Many of these niches involve products – such as books out of print – that are past their sell-by dates in conventional sales channels, with their need to maximise returns on floor space by selling “hit” mass market products.The “sting” in the long tail for advertisers is that virals can be seen on the web when any marketing messages they contain are no longer appropriate or even accurate.Amy Fuller, group executive, marketing, Americas, for MasterCard, says: “This is a different era. When you ran a spot on television you could control its distribution. It lives for ever online. That requires a lot of discipline.” And other initiatives to open up advertising to consumers also carry risks.When Chevy Tahoe, the General Motors car brand, invited consumers to construct a TV spot online, some created films blaming the vehicle for global warming. Opinions are divided over whether it suffered long-term damage.Other corporations have been burnt by attempts to associate themselves with blogging.Consequently, when MasterCard encouraged people to devise their own commercials, they had to submit material to a company website, priceless.com, rather than send it round the internet. Ms Fuller says: “What is astonishing is that all we are giving away are bragging rights to the winning campaign.”Industry analysts have seized on such evidence that people who create internet content are primarily motivated by self-expression. In the right circumstances, they might prove passionate brand advocates.Paul Kemp-Robertson, editor of Contagious, a magazine on marketing innovations, points to brands such as Toyota’s Yaris which increasingly cite the number of MySpace subscribers describing themselves as its “friend”.Mr Kemp-Robertson, who advises companies such as Diageo, the drinks group, says advertisers might in future have to position themselves as “hosts” for debates which consumers will be conducting online anyway.Mr Monahan of IPG adds: “It is a little bit scary right now for brands. They get targeted when they air on relatively tame parts of television. Imagine the letters they will get if their ad is playing next to a YouTube video of a kid repeatedly crashing his bike.”
462;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-06-29T21:03:40Z;MasterCard charged over antitrust rules;;The credit card group Master­Card has been formally charged by the European Union’s top antitrust regulator, accused of breaking its rules by restricting competition between banks.It is the latest escalation in a long-running antitrust battle between the European Commission and the credit card industry, and is the second time MasterCard has received antitrust charges from Brussels. It follows the Commission’s attack on groups such as Visa and MasterCard in April, when Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, accused them of making “outrageous” profits and operating a “closed shop”.MasterCard confirmed on Thursday that it had received a confidential “statement of objections” outlining the charges last Friday. The Commission also confirmed the charges, saying it had taken “the preliminary view that MasterCard restricts competition between member banks by pre-determining a minimum price retailers must pay for accepting MasterCard and Maestro branded payment cards”.The regulator also warned that, should it decide to rule against the group, it “could prohibit MasterCard’s interchange fees if the Commission is ultimately not convinced that possible efficiencies of MasterCard’s interchange fees sufficiently outweigh any restrictive effects on price competition be-tween merchant banks”.Interchange fees are paid between banks servicing the shops that accept credit cards and the banks servicing the cardholder. The allegedly excessive interchange rates in the MasterCard network were the subject of a 2003 statement of objections by Brussels.The crackdown on MasterCard is likely to affect millions of European consumers, since some 45 per cent of all payment cards issued in Europe carry the MasterCard or Maestro logo. The regulator has argued repeatedly that the high fees and lack of competition within card networks harm consumers because additional costs are ultimately passed on to cardholders.Should the group be found guilty, it also faces antitrust fines of up to 10 per cent of its global annual turnover. Last year MasterCard posted net revenues of $2.9bn (€2.3bn, £1.6bn).MasterCard, which used to be owned by a consortium of banks, was floated on the New York Stock Exchange last month, raising $2.4bn in its initial public offering. It is the second biggest credit card company behind Visa. Together the two groups control just under 90 per cent of the European market.MasterCard said on Thursday it would respond to the charges both in writing and at a hearing this year. It pointed out that “a Commission’s negative finding may be appealed to the European courts”. Under Ms Kroes, the Commission has made the credit card industry one of the main targets of its antitrust actions.
463;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-06-01T19:35:22Z;MasterCard and Visa battle for sponsorship;;MasterCard and Visa are embroiled in a battle over sponsorship rights that makes the rivalry between Argentina and Brazil seem cordial.MasterCard has been Fifa’s global partner in financial services for the past 16 years and expected to continue in that position. But in April football’s governing body replaced it with rival Visa, granting it global rights to a variety of Fifa tournaments from 2007 to 2014.MasterCard immediately cried foul, filing a lawsuit in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The harshly worded 22-page complaint accuses Fifa of “a blatant and deceitful violation of a right of first refusal granted to MasterCard”, noting the payment processor has over the years “paid tens of millions of dollars to be, and to have the option to continue being in the future, the official sponsor of World Cup soccer”.The complaint argues that MasterCard had already signed an extension and that if Fifa is not stopped from continuing in its agreement with Visa, MasterCard will “be deprived of a unique asset (Fifa World Cup sponsorship) and will suffer irreparable harm for which monetary damages, even of hundreds of millions of dollars, will not adequately compensate it”.MasterCard hopes to win the suit and force Fifa into honouring the contract it claims gave it rights to the next two World Cup tournaments. Analysts assume the 2006 tie-up has been very lucrative for MasterCard but the company declined to release any figures due to the ongoing litigation.Visa, for its part, is taking the high road. “Suffice to say we’re not going to get into any details about this until after this World Cup,” said Mike Sherman, Visa spokesman. “We don’t want to get in MasterCard’s way.”In an April 10 press release announcing the agreement, however, Visa took the chance to kick a little dirt in MasterCard’s eye. Christopher Rodrigues, president and chief executive of Visa International, said: “We will work with our extensive network of 20,000 member financial institutions to convey the zeal and excitement of football to our hundreds of millions of Visa cardholders worldwide.”What is at stake is an enormous marketing opportunity to reach fans of the world’s most popular sport. Beyond slapping logos on everything, MasterCard was also in the enviable position of being the only credit card accepted for advanced purchases this year.The company essentially had a lock on the millions of dollars in fees paid from processing the estimated 3m tickets sold at prices from €21 ($27) to €600.The winner of the MasterCard vs Visa match will not be known for some time. Regardless of the outcome, though, MasterCard will always have Berlin.
464;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-05-25T20:10:09Z;MasterCard IPO raises $2.4bn;;MasterCard debuted powerfully on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday - its shares soaring by more than 15 per cent - after the world’s second largest credit card issuer raised $2.4bn in an initial public offering. It was the biggest US IPO in two years.The debut helped to soothe nerves on Wall Street. MasterCard’s fortunes were in stark contrast to those of Vonage, the internet telephone company, which on Wednesday had staged the worst debut in almost two years.Vonage continued its downward trend on Thursday, with its share price approaching $13 – down from its issue price of $17.The size of the MasterCard IPO fell short of the company’s original expectations amid concerns over its mounting litigation problems.The shares were priced at $39, below the company’s previously forecast range of $40 to $43 a share. But in early first-day trading, the shares soared, reaching $44.8 shortly before midday. By late afternoon shares were up more than 16 per cent at $45.32.Securities and Exchange Commission-registered IPO volume has now reached $18.9bn in the year to date, its highest level in six years, despite the difficult market conditions.Rich Petersen, senior researcher at Thomson Financial, said: “We have a full IPO pipeline while we are by no means at the 1996 level. I’d say the market is generally looking pretty healthy.”The float transforms the 40-year-old credit card issuer from a membership association, jointly owned by banks, into a public company.MasterCard plans to use $650m of the proceeds to add to its anti-litigation war chest.The company and its larger rival, Visa, face ongoing legal battles over what are known as interchange fees, which retailers pay the associations to process credit and debit card transactions.MasterCard’s float, underwritten by Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and HSBC, is the largest since the $2.9bn IPO in May 2004 of Genworth Financial, a financial services arm of General Electric, according to Dealogic.MasterCard reported net income of $126.7m in the first quarter, up nearly 36 per cent. Revenue climbed 12 per cent to $738.5m.
465;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-05-25T18:34:23Z;Lex: US IPOs;;Vonage’s baptism of fire at the hands of investors has left it challenging for a spot among the worst recent US initial public offerings. The shares have now fallen a massive 22 per cent in two days. What does the flop mean for the broader IPO market?The timing of Vonage’s float was unfavourable. It came just as investors had come to refocus on risk after a long period of very healthy markets. Vonage’s high growth, yet speculative business model, might have looked slightly less scary a month ago. In today’s market investors have rightly focused on its huge losses and competitive challenges ahead. It did not help that two satellite radio companies with similar features – rapid subscriber growth and big losses – plunged by 11 per cent and 6 per cent on the day of Vonage’s IPO.But Vonage’s pain looks largely company-specific. The business model was unproven and the IPO underwriters misjudged true demand. The failure will seriously dent hopes of imminent IPOs for the more speculative companies out there. Alongside the recent pullback in equities and higher volatility, Vonage’s disaster will also muddy the waters more generally. Higher quality offerings, however, should continue to find investor support.On Wednesday night, MasterCard priced slightly below its expected range – probably partly because of Vonage. But its healthy 10 per cent “pop” in early trading, suggests it has not been affected.Vonage’s float was a disaster for its underwriters. It will also do nothing to endear the company to its customers, who were encouraged to buy the shares. But it was not all bad news – the $531m Vonage raised buys it a lot of time to try to prove the army of sceptics wrong.
466;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-05-24T19:39:03Z;IPOs fall victim to fragile investor confidence;;Casualties from the global market turmoil began to mount on Wednesday, as two initial public offerings in London were postponed and a prominent US market debutant saw its shares fall by up to 15 per cent ? the worst first-day drop for more than two years.In London, both CMC Markets, which provides spread-betting and foreign exchange services, and Sigma Capital Investments, the Black Sea property group, said they remained committed to their IPOs, but would wait until the markets were less volatile.Meanwhile in New York, fragile investor confidence saw shares in Vonage, a US internet telephony company, slump on their first day?s trading in an apparent flight from risk.The market?s sharp rebuke for Vonage?s $531m (?413m) offering demonstrated the growing caution among global investors, who showed little interest in the shares of a company which was still losing money, even though it was well-known and operating in a growth sector of the economy.Also in New York, MasterCard, the credit card group, late on Wednesday priced its IPO at $39 a share ? below the forecast range of $40-$43. The offering is the biggest in the US for two years, raising about $2.4bn.The London IPO delays came as the FTSE 100 closed down 91.6 at 5,587.1, with analysts blaming the postponements on the volatility in the markets.Investors have also been bruised by the recent Xstrata share sale. On Monday, the UK-listed mining group, raised ?1.3bn (?1.9bn) at a price of ?21 per share, a 0.05% discount to the previous day?s close.But with the recent wild market swings, investors were sitting on a paper loss of as much as ?200m, according to Thomson Financial. Xstrata?s shares closed down 57p at ?18.85p.As the fierce debate continued over the causes and fall-out of the current market volatility, Anthony Bolton, a star manager at Fidelity, said the decline in world markets might last. ?We see people being very prepared to take on risk. That worries me.?Meanwhile, Standard Life, which in April put a prospective value of ?4.8bn-?5.5bn on its forthcoming IPO, said it was working towards a July listing, but was monitoring conditions.Sandra Lawson, senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, said that although the broader outlook for the world economy still pointed to above-trend global growth, ?worries about growth and inflation are not likely to abate soon, and so markets may well be jittery for some time?.The plight of Vonage highlighted the extent to which, in the current environment, many traders are deserting risky investments.Additional reporting by Salamander Davoudi, Andrea Felsted and Robert Orr
467;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-05-17T17:51:54Z;Burger King leads flotation charge;;The market for initial public offerings in the US is set for a burst of activity as a several high profile deals, led by Burger King and Mastercard, come to market in the approach to the Memorial Day holiday at month’s end.Proof of the robust pipeline for equity offerings came as last Friday became the busiest single day for IPO filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission since March 2000, with 11 companies announcing their intention to float.The six-year daily high point contributed to a week during which 20 IPOs were filed with the SEC – the first time since 2004 that 20 IPOs were filed in a single week.The last time the weekly total exceeded 20 filings was during the week of April 10 2000 when the total was 24, according to Dealogic, the data provider.David Topper, managing director and co-head of equity capital markets at JPMorgan, said: “I’m certainly bullish about the rest of the year. The ‘Class of 2006’ IPOs, if you will, has seen some very high-quality companies perform very well. So if you look at it as an asset class, it is one of the best out there.”Dealogic defines SEC registered IPOs as those by companies, whether US or overseas, that opt for a listing in the US.Rich Petersen, senior researcher at Thomson Financial, said: “I’d characterise the market as healthy, if not robust. You see some brand name companies such as Burger King and Vonage raising money. We are also seeing something of a transition.“Where five years ago, technology companies were at the forefront of the IPO market, now you are seeing energy and power companies, restaurants and retailers leading the way. These are all companies with tangible products.”The healthcare sector has been the busiest of the year to date, with 22 IPOs filed so far during 2006.Overseas companies are also doing their bit. Last week’s filing by Telemar, the Brazilian telecommunications group, means half of the top 10 largest IPOs filed with the SEC this year come from outside the US. Telemar plans to raise $1.37bn. Burger King is expected to raise about $400m through an offering of 25m shares this week. It is one of an increasing number of companies being taken public by its private equity firm owners.The restaurant chain is currently owned by Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.IPO research firm Renaissance Capital said Burger King had spent the majority of the past 17 years as a neglected subsidiary of beverage giant Diageo. The private equity firms bought the company in 2002, for $1.5bn, replacing the management team and making an intense effort to revive its fortunes.“With its turnaround story nearing fruition, two years of positive same store sales growth under its belt and viable growth opportunities in the US and abroad, Burger King is hoping its IPO will bring the same heat as one of its famous flame-broiled hamburgers,” Renaissance said in a report.Burger King’s flotation will be followed by offerings next week from Mastercard and Vonage. The $2.6bn Mastercard flotation is the biggest in the US since the $2.8bn IPO of Genworth Financial two years ago.Vonage, the internet telephone services provider, is being taken public by underwriters Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS.The company, which is also backed by Bain Capital, along with 3i, New Enterprise Associates, Meritech Capital Partners and Institutional Venture Partners, recently doubled the size of its offering to $531m.Mr Topper said market conditions were still very conducive to a healthy market and pipeline for equity offerings, with lots of money in the system. He also pointed out that the IPO market was being used in some cases as an alternative to selling entire businesses in merger and acquisiton deals.Mr Petersen said: “This is still nothing like the 1990s [during which] you had hundreds of deals coming to market during a matter of weeks. Now you would be lucky to get a hundred deals in the first half of the year.But he added: “You are likely to see a flurry of IPOs between now and the end of June.”
468;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-05-03T18:37:29Z;MasterCard IPO to raise up to $5.6bn;;MasterCard, the US credit card association, is seeking a $5.6bn valuation from investors as it moves closer to ending its 40-year history as a private company through an initial public offering.In a filing with US regulators on Wednesday, MasterCard said it intended to sell up to 61.5m shares in the company at a price between $40 and $43 each. This would allow it to raise up to $2.6bn, slightly more than it originally expected, and give it a market capitalisation of about $5.6bn on its stock market debut.The IPO of MasterCard, which is expected in late May, will be closely followed by Visa, its main competitor, which has until now resisted going public.At the valuation being sought, which is equivalent to about 11 times earnings, MasterCard would still be trading at a significant discount to American Express.The increased size of the deal highlights how the market for new listings in the US is growing stronger after a choppy 2005, with brand-named companies appearing particularly attractive to investors.Vonage, the internet telephony provider, last week doubled the size of its planned listing, which now aims to raise $531m.Among the largest new issues in the pipeline is the IPO of Burger King, which is owned by private equity groups led by Texas Pacific Group.MasterCard’s IPO has been in the works for more than a year, with an initial target of raising $2.45bn.However, the timing slipped after Robert Selander, the chief executive, was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.This week, the company reported that first quarter earnings rose more than 30 per cent, from $93m last year to $127m, helped by increased spending on its cards, both by consumers and businesses.Net revenues rose 12 per cent to $738.5m in the first quarter.MasterCard shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol “MA”. In Wednesday’s filing MasterCard also named six new board members, including Mark Schwartz of Soros Fund Management.One issue hanging over MasterCard as it seeks to go public is a pending class-action lawsuit that accuses it and Visa of colluding to charge merchants exceptionally high fees for use of their services.The banks that issue credit cards and own MasterCard have also been named in the suit.MasterCard’s IPO, which is being managed by investment bankers at Goldman Sachs, will rank as the largest new listing in the US since 2004, when General Electric spun off Genworth, its insurance division.Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, has said it plans to lower its ratings on MasterCard’s debt after the completion of the IPO, which would increase lending fees.
469;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-04-12T18:16:10Z;EU attacks credit card operators over fees;;Neelie Kroes, the European Union competition commissioner, on Wednesday threatened to take antitrust action against banks and payment card companies for exploiting consumers and small businesses, singling out Visa and MasterCard.She said payment card operators were making ?outrageous? profits and accused the industry of operating ?a closed shop?.A European Commission inquiry into the payment card sector found yesterday that little cross-border competition existed between providers. Every year 23bn card payments are made in the EU worth ?1,350bn.Ms Kroes predicted that cardholders could save hundreds of euros if the market was made fully competitive.She praised Germany and the Netherlands as the countries with the lowest credit and debit card fees, while Portugal had the highest.The Commission?s investigation pointed to large discrepancies between fees charged in EU member states as evidence of the poor state of competition. It found that the fees retailers pay to credit card companies vary between countries by up to 500 per cent for Visa and by 650 per cent for MasterCard.Fees paid by consumers can be twice as high depending on where the card is issued.On average, card acceptance fees charged by banks across Europe add 2.5 per cent to every purchase, Ms Kroes said, describing the levy as a ?tax on consumption?.The current scheme was particularly hard on small and medium-sized retailers, whose fees for Visa and MasterCard transactions were up to 70 per cent higher than those raised on larger businesses.The commissioner called on the industry to come forward with plans to redress these problems during a 10-week consultation period. But should voluntary action fail to meet the Commission?s concerns, Ms Kroes said she would have no qualms about pursuing and punishing companies that break EU competition rules. Wednesday?s report detailed the interim findings of a sweeping probe launched last year into the EU?s retail financial services industry.The investigation reflects the Commission?s concern that its efforts to create a borderless, pan-European market for financial services have yet to deliver benefits to consumers and businesses.The EU competition watchdog has already conducted a series of antitrust investigations against Visa, MasterCard and other financial services groups, forcing Visa, for example, to lower its ?interchange fees? (the fees paid between banks for every transaction). Last year, the high level of fees charged by Visa and MasterCard also came under attack from Britain?s Office of Fair Trading.The Commission report said the credit card business was so lucrative that interchange fees could be abolished altogether without undermining the companies? ability to ?generate a healthy profit?.Ruth Wandh?fer, payments expert of the European Banking Federation, said banks remained committed to the introduction of the Single Euro Payment area, which is designed to make all cross-border payments in the EU as cheap as national ones by 2010.A Visa spokesman said the difference between fees charged in various EU member states reflected a range of factors.The group also warned that ?attempts by regulators in individual European countries to intervene in the setting of interchange rates run counter to the drive towards a single market for card payments?.
470;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-02-16T23:43:06Z;MasterCard expects to delay IPO to Q2;;MasterCard Inc. said on Thursday it expects to delay its $2.45 billion initial public offering until the second quarter, after Chief Executive Bob Selander was diagnosed with prostate cancer.The world’s second-biggest credit card association, based in Purchase, New York, had been expected to begin marketing the IPO to investors in late January, and go public by the end of March. The marketing efforts did not take place.A $2.45 billion IPO would be the largest in the United States since May 2004. MasterCard is owned by the roughly 1,400 banks that issue its cards.“It makes sense to postpone the offering, because the IPO process is all-consuming, and you really can’t conduct it on a part-time basis,” said Scott Dettmer, a partner at Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian LLP, a Menlo Park, California law firm, who advises companies on IPOs.“The CEO is the principal spokesman for the company,” Dettmer added. “Even for someone in perfect health, it’s a challenging process.”In a letter to MasterCard’s member financial institutions, Selander, 54, said he underwent successful surgery this week, has an excellent prognosis, and has resumed his normal responsibilities. He is working at home, and expects to resume working at the office in early March.Selander said, though, that he was advised “not to undertake a demanding travel schedule, such as a road show, over the next couple of months. We expect that this, combined with the timelines for our first-quarter results, will mean a delay in our transition to a new structure until the second quarter.”MasterCard disclosed Selander’s cancer and the IPO delay in a regulatory filing. The filing did not say when marketing for the IPO might resume. Spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin declined to comment on a resumption.The association had announced plans for its IPO in September, and named Goldman Sachs & Co. as lead underwriter.MasterCard, whose larger rival is San Francisco-based Visa, is planning to offer up to a 49 percent stake, valuing the entire company at about $5 billion.For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2005, MasterCard posted net income of $320 million on revenue of $2.2 billion.Earlier this month, MasterCard said cardholders in 2005 used 749.3 million MasterCard-branded cards for more than 19.1 billion transactions, generating volume of $1.66 trillion.It expects to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MA”.Dettmer said that while MasterCard risks facing a less friendly market when it is ready to go public, “this has been an eagerly anticipated offering, so unless the markets change,they stand a good chance of having a successful IPO.”
471;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-02-15T23:19:17Z;Credit card handling lapses spur regulatory effort;;Barney Frank, the senior Democrat on the house financial services committee, said on Wednesday he would consider legislation to require credit card companies to name the party responsible for consumer data breaches.Mr Frank said in a letter to the chief executives of Visa USA and Mastercard that the source of the data leak should notify customers affected, or be identified in public as being responsible.“If this can not be done legally at present, I feel make strongly enough on this point to make legislative changes to make this a requirement,” Mr Frank wrote.His letter follows Visa USA’s announcement this week that a data security breach at a US merchant may have compromised customer accounts.Visa said last week that it “was recently notified by a US merchant that it may have experienced a data security breach resulting in the compromise of Visa card account information”.The company said it had “quickly alerted the affected financial institutions to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring and, if needed, reissuing cards.”Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual have all blocked and reissued some debit cards in response to the reported breach. All have declined to identify the retailer involved or to describe the nature of the breach.Mr Frank said he had raised similar concerns in 2003, after a major breach of data security at BJ Wholesale Club, which led both credit card companies to instruct local banks and credit unions in New England to block and reissue credit cards. In that case, both Visa and Mastercard declined to identify BJ’s as the source of the leak.“The inability to identify the source of the breach created an inaccurate and unfair impression that these institutions were somehow at fault and that their card programs were not as secure or well managed as their larger bank competitors,” he said.He also argued that keeping the retailer’s identity hidden had “done more harm than good”, and led to a series of lawsuits against the retailer.“Had BJ’s followed the example of numerous other retailers, universities and banks that publicly disclosed security breaches over the past year, and then worked with all parties to mitigate potential fraud, these problems could have been minimised,” he argued.Last summer, MasterCard and Visa notified member banks of a security breach at CardSystems Solutions, a credit card processor, that may have exposed more than 40m cards of all types to fraud.The announcement marked the most serious instance to date of security lapses that have exposed customers' financial and other personal information to possible theft.
472;MA;Mastercard Inc;2006-01-20T17:28:04Z;On Asia: Don’t meddle with the markets;;"I have put this column up for sale. The deal is hard to resist.I will lend bidders interested in my weekly musings the funds to buy the column in nine interest-free instalments over five years. All they have to do is to pay about half of the total price upfront.Does my largesse sound excessive? I am not alone.The Pakistani government recently agreed similar terms over the sale of a controlling stake in Pakistan Telecom to Etisalat, a United Arab Emirates rival.Their deal is dafter than mine.The Islamabad authorities offered the interest-free instalments only after Etisalat complained that it could not pay the $2.6bn agreed only a few months earlier. Their change of mind came in spite of the fact that they had tabled a binding bid in order to beat rival offers from China Mobile and Singapore Telecom.That such a farcical chain of events should take place on what Pakistan had identified as a model privatisation is, to quote a MasterCard advertisement, priceless.It goes to show that Asian governments should not meddle in financial markets. That is true all over the world, but recent weeks have provided a higher than usual number of cack-handed interventions by Asian governments.For brevity’s sake I will mention just two: the pact signed with fanfare by China and India, banning their respective state-owned energy giants from bidding against each other for oil and gas assets; and the attempt by the family of Thaksin Shinawatra, the Thai prime minister, to sell their business empire to state-controlled Singaporean investors.These cases have in common a brazen contempt on the part of governments for market forces and for the rights of minority shareholders.In the Pakistan Telecom sale, once Etisalat was unable to find the money, the right thing to do would have been to reopen the auction, allowing all bidders to table new offers, or even to opt for a stock market sale.Considering that the Karachi exchange was Asia’s best performing last year, the Pakistani government would have avoided the interest-free (and integrity-free) payments and achieved a valuation not too far from the one offered by Etisalat.Incidentally, a stock market listing of Pakistan Telecom would have been a far more believable “privatisation” than an auction between Etisalat, China Mobile and Singapore Telecom, which are all state-controlled.As for the Sino-Indian “non-aggression pact” on energy assets, it is nearly illegal and nearly unenforceable.It is a given that such a deal will catch the eye of the anti-trust authorities in the west.And should the agreement be used to reduce competition in a bid war for a US or European energy company, Washington and Brussels might take action.It could also be harmful for minority investors in listed Chinese and Indian energy groups, as the companies might be barred from buying important assets for entirely political reasons.But the reality is that the chief executives of half a dozen Chinese and Indian energy companies are unlikely to exchange courtesy calls every time they want to bid for a power asset around the globe.Indeed, just days after the pact was signed, both China’s CNOOC and India’s ONGC were reportedly slugging it out for Canada’s Nations Energy.Luckily for him, Mr Thaksin has no such problems.The company that bears his name – Shin Corp – was built by him before he heeded the call of politics. As such, his family can do what they like with the stake, even if it means selling it to Temasek, Singapore’s state investment agency.But as someone who has built his success on his communications skills, Mr Thaksin could teach a thing or two to Shin Corp’s investor relations officials. Until last week, they were resolutely denying the stake sale.They, and the stock exchange watchdog, which failed to suspend the stock in spite of huge speculative buying, must be the only ones not to believe this deal would happen.Thankfully, in the past two days they have been helped by Thailand’s central bank governor and finance minister, who bizarrely confirmed the sale, as if to underline the conflict of interest inherent in Mr Thaksin’s tycoon-turned-politician status.On reflection, I should try to flog this column to one of the region’s governments. These people look like they stop at nothing to get their deals done."
473;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Flat screen TV boom helps Circuit City;;Aggressive price-cutting and promotional financing offers by Circuit City have helped it continue its turnround.Third-quarter earnings at the second-largest US consumer electronics retailer rose to $10.1m, or 6 cents per share, compared with a $5.9m loss in the same period last year.Earnings per share were boosted 3.2 cents by a $9.4m one-off gain from the settlement of legal action against MasterCard and Visa. Wall Street analysts had been expecting earnings of 4 cents per share.Circuit City’s total sales rose 15 per cent to $2.91bn, supported by strong sales of flat-panel TVs, portable digital audio products, notebook computers and digital photography products.However, its gross profit margin slipped from 25.2 to 24.2 per cent, reflecting price cuts for TVs and video software and its promotional low-interest financing offers.Comparable store sales rose 13.1 per cent, although the number of customers entering its stores was were largely unchanged. The company attributed the increased sales to customers buying more expensive items such as the new generation of flat-screen TVs, and to more effective merchandising in the stores.For the whole year, Circuit City said it now expected total sales growth of 8-10 per cent, up from a previous forecast expectation of 5-8 per cent.The company said also announced that Phil Schoonover, its president, would take over as chief executive from Alan McCullough when he retires at the end of February. Mr Schoonover, 45, joined Circuit City from Best Buy in October 2004.Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, saw its shares fall more than 11 per cent on Tuesday after it announced disappointing profits and a weak outlook for the fourth quarter due to higher operating costs.Circuit City’s shares rose more than 4 per cent in New York morning trading yesterday to $22.18.
474;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Credit card issuers feel squeeze;;When Barclaycard said on Monday it would lift interest rates for its credit card holders by up to 2 percentage points, it demonstrated the pressures faced by card issuers in the UK.A slowdown in consumer spending, and a simultaneous rise in defaults as over-indebted consumers try to absorb higher fuel prices, are combining to reduce the outlook for interest-payment revenues for the credit card industry.On top of this, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission have dealt twin blows to the sector by decrying the levels of both penalty fees and the interchange fees set by MasterCard.But as the pain spreads, one interesting point has emerged: namely, that these issues have yet to make a lasting impact on spreads in the market for credit card-backed securitisation. So far, it is a moot point whether or not this will hurt issuance in the future.There are signs of a slowdown: after three strong years of UK credit card businesses coming to market to help free up funds for further growth, activity this year has so far been muted.Krishna Prasad, head of structured finance research at Lehman Brothers, says 2005 has been fairly stagnant, with about $5bn in securitisations to the end of the third quarter last week. That compares with about $9bn for 2004, the biggest year to date in a market that only took off in the UK in 2002.Mr Prasad does not expect that picture to improve much before year’s end. “Consumer spending has slowed so it is not surprising and refinancing needs only account for a small proportion of issuance,” he says.Ganesh Rajendra, head of European securitisation research at Deutsche Bank, agrees: “There might be one deal if any at all before the end of the year, but it’s certainly looking like one of the quietest years.”Changes in funding needs are not only affected by growth prospects. Allen Appen, managing director in securitisation at Barclays Capital, says another factor could be consolidation.“MBNA was one of the most prolific issuers [of securitised card debt] in the US and the UK, but whether Bank of America will rely on securitisation to fund this business to the same extent has yet to be seen,” Mr Appen says.Others, however, expect more deals to come. Sarah Barton, securitisation analyst at Morgan Stanley, points out that two regular issuers, Egg, the on-line bank, and Morgan Stanley’s own UK credit card business, have not yet come to market this year. “I’m expecting quite a bit of issuance in the fourth quarter,” she says.There may have been private issues distributed to only one or two investors that are not visible in the numbers from the card companies’ master trusts: the special vehicles set up to hold the securitised lending.Mr Appen says that while such deals do not make up a huge proportion of the market, one or two may leave total issuance appearing artificially low.Demand for private deals is driven by investors looking for specific characteristics in terms of rating, maturity, or currency for instance. For this tailoring, they earn slightly less than they would in the public issues, but they can secure a larger proportion of an issue.But pressure on profitability does not mean increased likelihood of private issuance, says a banker, because card companies still earn far more from the underlying assets than they pay to investors public or private.For example, the spread for investors on a 3-year triple-B rated transaction, the lowest available, is in the low-to-mid thirties of basis points over Libor. That compares with excess spreads – the money earned by the originator – of up to about 8 per cent at present.That means investors are well-cushioned against rising bad debts – which, in turn, explains why gloom has not translated into a general widening of spreads.Ms Barton says that for those issues that performed worst in the summer in terms of rising defaults, spreads for investors did widen, but they have already come back in again.But the excess spread earned by the card companies illustrates where the pain is being felt. The range has slipped in the past two years, according to Mr Prasad, with the levels in July, a low point for this year, ranging from 4.6 per cent to 7.7 per cent. That compares with a range of 5.6 per cent to 12.6 per cent in July 2003.Barclaycard’s decision about interest rates and other moves such as cutting back on loyalty programmes and zero-per-cent interest deals will help to support excess spreads, but Mr Prasad believes they are likely to worsen and to settle at a lower level, which makes securitisation less of an attractive prospect.Issuers and the banks that arrange deals will have to look to less mature card markets than the UK and US in order to find growth.
475;MA;Mastercard Inc;2005-09-16T16:10:35Z;Now you can say that you’re loaded;;"Britons have a long-established love affair with plastic. This is reflected in the fact that over the past decade, the value of transactions made on debit and credit cards has more than doubled, according to Datamonitor, the market research group.But while our growing dependence on plastic may make us card savvy, many of us are unlikely to recognise one of the world’s fastest-growing cards if it were put into our wallets.Pre-paid cards, which are like bank accounts but are sold and reloaded like mobile phone top-up cards, are little known in the UK. In the US and Europe though, where they were launched a decade ago, they are a multi-billion dollar business.Consumers can buy the cards at local shops without a credit check, put their wages into them and make ATM withdrawals or online and telephone transactions. However the accounts have no overdraft, credit or cheque facilities.Sales of the cards in the US have tripled since their launch to $3.1bn in 2004, largely on the back of demand from immigrants and those with poor credit histories who find it hard to open a traditional bank account. Revenues are expected to soar to more than $50bn by 2008, according to the Nilson Report, the US industry analyst.Visa and American Express have been testing the market in the UK with electronic versions of paper gift vouchers and travellers’ cheques, such as Visa’s Travelex. However, the UK’s first general purpose pre-paid card is being launched in the UK. It can be used in the UK and abroad, in places you would currently use a debit or credit card.Rich Wagner, chief executive of Advanced Payment Solutions, which is launching the cashPlus card with MasterCard, says the success of mobile phone pre-pays in the UK is a good indicator of the appetite for the products in the UK. APS will be targeting the estimated 2.4m people in the UK who don’t have a bank account. “A lot of the unbanked are excluded from making purchases online; this will open up a whole new market for them,” says Wagner.The card is currently available from small retailers targeting the immigrant community. But soon cardholders able to top up their cards at more than 14,000 branches of the Post Office across the country.It’s likely that rival issuers won’t be too far behind: Visa is in talks to extend the Gift card which it co-launched with MBNA, the US bank, at the Trafford Centre in Manchester.Hugo Bottelier, vice-president of initiatives and partnerships for Visa Europe, says the real growth area for pre-paid cards is in the youth market, where parents buy the cards for their children as a safer alternative to giving them cash.Bottelier says there is also huge potential for the card in other areas, such as wage payments. “The cards may appeal to seasonal employees who don’t have an established banking relationship in the country,” he says.While the card companies have high hopes of replicating the US success of pre-paids in the UK, the launch comes against the backdrop of probes which have shed an unsavoury light on the card payment industry.Last week, the Office of Fair Trading ruled that the fees charged by MasterCard UK and the banks issuing its credit cards to process payments were “unduly high” and represented a “tax on consumers”.This week, the Competition Commission lambasted store card providers for charging retail customers up to 20 per cent more in annual interest rates than was warranted.Now the fees attached to the pre-paid cards are courting controversy with the National Consumer Council (NCC), saying they are loaded against the poor, the very target entry market for MasterCard.MasterCard’s pre-paid card will cost £9.95. Top-ups are free, but you will pay £1 per transaction and £2 to withdraw your cash at an ATM in the UK, or £3 abroad. The fees on purchases can be avoided if you pay a monthly account fee of £4.95.“These cards will push a lot of buttons for consumers because they offer facilities such as buying online and over the phone,” says Claire Whyley, deputy director of policy with the NCC. “But I am worried about the charges, particularly as the companies are not taking any risk as they are not lending money. Consumers are spending their own money. I want to see how these costs are justified.”Others say the cards may have niche appeal as a gift card, but doubt whether they would become mainstream, given the hostility to account fees in the UK.“In the US and Europe you have to pay for most parts of your bank account already including making withdrawals from cash machines other than your own bank,” says Sandra Quinn of the Association for Payment Clearing Services. “But the UK is a very competitive market. Nobody wants to pay for their banking here.”The NCC urges consumers to take a cautious approach to pre-paid cards, saying they are not a replacement for basic bank accounts.However, APS defends the cards, saying that basic bank accounts are not always the best option for those on low incomes. “We’ve found that that people who use these cards don’t like surprise fees, such as unauthorised borrowing or overdrafts,” says Wagner. “With a prepaid fee you know what your charges are as they are upfront.”"
476;MA;Mastercard Inc;2005-09-15T22:44:28Z;MasterCard to list on NYSE;;MasterCard is set to make its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange in what is likely to be one of the biggest initial public offering in recent years.The second-biggest card payment association plans to sell up to $2.45bn in stock or 61.5m shares to become an independent company in an attempt to distance its bank owners from regulatory and legal threats. The IPO would value the company at about $5bn and the group will list under the symbol “MA”. Goldman Sachs has been hired to handle the offering.The listing initial public offering of the company, which is owned by 1,400 financial institutions, would give outside investors 49 per cent of its equity and 83 per cent of its voting rights. It would have a new board with a majority of independent directors. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it said the move would give it a “more stable base” to implement its strategy and would address “perceived conflicts of interest”.“We believe regulators and others will recognise these changes and the increased openness they bring to our governance and ownership.”MasterCard and rival Visa have come under pressure from regulators and retailers over “interchange” fees that bank members impose on merchants for processing card transactions.In June, MasterCard and Visa and some of their biggest member banks were hit by a class-action suit filed by US retailers claiming the fees were too high.Two years ago they reached a $3bn (Pounds 1.68bn) settlement over a lawsuit brought by US merchants who said charging higher fees to process debit cards was unfair.Visa, which has a complex half-mutual, half-corporate structure, also faces pressure to go public, according to analysts.On Thursday, a Visa spokesman said “Visa is always thinking about the range of choices we might make in our business and organization that would allow us to continue to deliver maximum value to our stakeholders.”MasterCard said it would pass on some of the proceeds of the IPO to bank members but would retain $650m partly to cover potential legal costs. “Along with the proposed structural changes we believe these resources will place us in a position to defend our interests in the legal and regulatory arena.”MasterCard, founded in 1966, paved the way for the move by converting from a membership association to a private share corporation in 2002, when it started to file accounts.The second-biggest card payment association plans to sell up to $2.45bn in stock or 61.5m shares to become an independent company in an attempt to distance its bank owners from regulatory and legal threats.

477;MA;Mastercard Inc;2005-09-02T09:34:26Z;Lex: Dual-voting structures;;Credit where credit’s due. Rather than using a dual-voting structure to bolster the power of core investors after an initial public offering, MasterCard is planning the opposite. New shareholders in the business will get to control 49 per cent of the equity, but 83 per cent of the votes. A charitable foundation will hold the rest of the voting shares. MasterCard will also have a new board with a majority of independent directors.That should ensure it is run in the interests of all, rather than there being a limited pool of super-voting shareholders calling the shots. Such unsavoury structures have been common with, say, family-controlled media companies.Sadly, investors should not smell the beginning of a trend. The 1,400 financial institutions that control MasterCard are not suffering from a sudden burst of altruism. Instead, one reason behind the IPO appears to be an attempt to deflect potential regulatory threats by putting the business at arm’s length. Having outside shareholders controlling the majority of the votes and an independent board would help to reinforce the notion of MasterCard as a truly independent company.While a noble effort, the structure is not quite as clean as it looks. In addition to owning 41 per cent of the equity through non-voting shares, the existing owners will get M shares giving approval rights over areas including mergers and disposals. Letting go is tough. But MasterCard’s owners are making a good start.
478;MA;Mastercard Inc;2005-08-31T14:41:49Z;MasterCard to go public and revamp structure;;MasterCard, the world’s second biggest payment card association, is to become an independent public company in an attempt to distance its bank owners from mounting regulatory and legal threats.The company, which is owned by 1,400 financial institutions, said on Wednesday it planned an initial public offering that would give outside investors 49 per cent of its equity and 83 per cent of its voting rights.

A further 10 per cent of the equity would be held by a charitable foundation.
479;MA;Mastercard Inc;2005-07-12T19:54:45Z;Touch and go at some US supermarkets;;Shoppers at Piggly Wiggly supermarkets in South Carolina can afford to forget their cash, credit cards and cheque books this summer. All they need is a finger.The regional chain, whose slogans include “Shop the Pig”, in June became the first US retailer to roll out a new biometric payment system at all its 120 stores, introducing its customers to a technology more often associated with security gates than check-outs.To pay, a customer places an index finger on a small screen, types in a number on an adjacent pad, selects an account from an “electronic wallet” and walks away.“They don't have to pay with plastic for any kind of payment …plus the transaction for them is very easy,” says Rich Farrell, who oversaw Piggly Wiggly's introduction of the system.The payment system, produced by Pay By Touch, a San Francisco technology company, is also being tested by Albertson's, the second-biggest US supermarket, as well as a number of smaller regional retailers.In the UK, the Oxford, Swindon and Gloucester Co-op, a pioneer of self check-out in the UK, will launch a pilot this autumn. Similar systems are also being tested in Germany.If the technology catches on, users will only need to register once before using the same electronic wallet to shop at any retailer offering the system.Since it was set up in 2003, Pay By Touch has attracted an experienced management team including John Morris, its president, who previously headed IBM's $5bn Americas' retail industry operation.Mr Morris says: “We're clearly not a start-up we're a much more mature company. We've raised almost $100m so far, we have a very seasoned management team and we are working with a very important and powerful group of retailers.”Pay By Touch, he says, will raise an additional $50-$70m in the next few months, which will give it the capital it needs to break even. An initial public offering is possible next year.But the system faces powerful competition. Visa, Mastercard and American Express are all pursuing technology shifts of their own with the launch of “contactless” credit cards. Customers pay by passing the card, fitted with a radio frequency chip, over a reader. No signature or number is required for small payments.Both the contactless and Pay by Touch systems speed up transactions, potentially reducing queues and increasing sales at high-volume outlets such as fast-food restaurants.Contactless cards are also more secure than existing US credit and debit cards, which rely on old-style and easily copied magnetic strip cards, rather than the silicon chip “smart card” technology used in Europe and Asia.Richard Reese, who oversees technology developments at Discover Card, the smallest of the “big four” card issuers, says contactless and biometric payment systems are likely to develop together. “We don't believe there's going to be any single solution that will win out over the others,” he adds.But for US retailers, Pay by Touch offers a distinct attraction. It allows customers to pay directly from their own bank accounts, without using a bank-issued debit card. That reduces controversial network handling charges, known as interchange fees. These are currently the subject of an antitrust lawsuit brought by small retailers against Visa, MasterCard and leading banks.“A debit card transaction is in the range of around 30 cents. Pay By Touch is in the low teens. It's a very, very low-cost transaction,” says Piggly Wiggly's Mr Farrell.He also hopes the system, costing about $200 per unit, will reduce the number of customers using cash or cheques, which still carry about 45 per cent of US consumer spending. In an initial test in largely suburban neighbourhoods, about 15 per cent of Piggly Wiggly customers registered with Pay By Touch. However it may be harder to win over rural customers, who traditionally prefer cash.“There are some people that will not use it because they look it as a Big Brother kind of thing. Others just don't have time to register,” says Mr Farrell.Pay By Touch's John Morris says sceptical customers can sometimes be won over by explanation of the technology. The system, for instance, does not store information that can be used to generate a fingerprint, but an encrypted series of numbers identifying a combination of 40 data elements for each individual.Mr Morris is also convinced that people like the added security. It is, after all, “very hard to steal someone's finger”.

There are only 24 days to the annual meetings that will vote on proposals to create a unified Royal Dutch Shell. But there is still no sign of a chairman-designate to take over from Aad Jacobs next year (Mudlark, May 20).Since Shell has committed itself to selecting an external candidate, logic might argue that the lucky man or woman should get a bit of a run-in before taking the hot seat. Shareholders might also appreciate a glimpse of the future team before they vote on June 28.One stumbling block may be that “independent” – another condition set by Shell – could be interpreted as someone who is neither British nor Dutch. Are qualified British candidates – to complement Dutch chief executive Jeroen van der Veer – being excluded on the basis of nationality?Refund? PricelessFootball supporters have scored a rare victory in the world of big-money sport. Fifa, the game’s governing body, yesterday promised to reimburse fans who had been charged extra when buying World Cup 2006 tickets. An exclusive deal between Fifa, MasterCard and the German football league had meant that fans initially could buy tickets only through a MasterCard credit card, a German bank account or an expensive international bank transfer.Which?, the consumer group, cried foul, filing a complaint with the European Commission that fans outside Germany and without a MasterCard would have to pay as much as £35 extra for a bank transfer. Many expected the battle to end scoreless. But Fifa crumbled, sending Phil Evans at Which? into John Motson mode: “It seems that the EU’s half-time team talk with Fifa was more effective than [Rafael] Benitez’s Champions League rallying call to Liverpool.”Footballers’ wilesHow much does money motivate the modern football player? At this week’s seminar on big business, ethics and football organised by the Jewish Association for Business Ethics (Mudlark, Friday), David Bernstein, former Manchester City chairman, had a telling anecdote.Bernstein recalled City’s dramatic late comeback in the 1999 Second Division play-off final against Gillingham, which his side won on penalties.He was so elated that, for once, he went on the pitch after the match. One player came over, Bernstein said, and greeted him: “Chairman, don’t forget about our discussions on financial arrangements if we won this match.”A cleaner actPZ Cussons, best known for its Imperial Leather soap, thinks of itself as a fast- moving consumer goods company but it has been a slowcoach when it comes to corporate governance.Cussons, however, is now following GUS, Securicor, John Laing, and Youngs the brewer in scrapping its two-tier share structure. How long before Schroders, advocate of good corporate governance, does the same? Don’t hold your breath.Poise in the hoodPrudential this week turned the tables on City scribblers who believe international financial reporting standards (IFRS) are just for “anoraks”.

One analyst joked that recipients could now be “hoodies with our Prudential anoraks”.Prudential, incidentally, is an investor in Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, which has banned youths wearing hooded tops.One analyst was slow off the mark. He said: “I was such an anorak asking detailed questions that, by the time we emerged, there were none left. They have promised to send me one.”MisdirectedGreat Portland Estates, the property company run by Toby Courtauld, claims it was not allowed to call a new London development The Met Building.This was not because of angry London policemen. Instead, Courtauld said, the Post Office frowns on new properties beginning with the word “The”. So the block in Fitzrovia is called simply Met Building. But Royal Mail says there is no ban. “We have it listed as Met Building. If they want to change it, they just have to ask.”1-9 without a clueAn occasional lunch of crossword editors of the national broadsheets (or former broadsheets) gave a chance to ask them if Sudoku was going to send the cryptic crossword into oblivion. “Of course not” the editors answered, “it’s mindless and mechanical”, “only satisfactory when completed”, “not a social activity”, “will last about 10 years – the same as the Rubik cube”. And they doubted if it would appeal to “crossword people”. But one admitted that every morning he made three photocopies for members of his family to solve.At the shallow endThe only surprise was that it took until Friday for the press release to arrive. It notes the identification of Mark Felt as the Watergate Deep Throat to plug the imminent UK joint release of the film of the same name and a “wickedly probing documentary”, Inside Deep Throat.Early redemptionSome might think a new savings account from the Catholic Building Society skates close to blasphemy.

481;MA;Mastercard Inc;2005-04-22T15:18:12Z;Borrowers urged to reach for the sky;;The battle for credit card customers rages on as dozens of “rewards” credit cards now claim to offer something for nothing. While some credit cards offer money off new cars and others offer cashback, credit cards offering free flights remain one of the most popular type of loyalty card.In the past 10 years, the number of credit cards offering free flights has expanded from the original Air Miles scheme – which covers most UK airlines – to half a dozen cards, many of which have teamed up with major store chains such as Boots and Tesco.Yet the offers on these cards can vary enormously, with the amount you need to spend in order to qualify for a free flight differing widely depending on the card and route chosen. For example, you can spend anything from £3,900 to £20,000 on your card to qualify for a “free” return ticket to Paris.Last year, competition for flight giveaways intensified following the launch of the buy and fly! MasterCard from Morgan Stanley. The card appears particularly generous with cardholders earning a point for every £10 spent, compared towith one point for each £20 spent on the Air miles cards.In addition, on the buy and fly! scheme, the number of points needed to fly to many destinations is often lower than with other flights schemes. Points may be traded for flights on any of 18 partner airlines or for discounted holidays.But Morgan Stanley’s reward scheme highlights how collectors of free flights need to read the small print. Morgan Stanley cardholders may only need to spend £3,900 on their cards to fly to Paris, compared with £20,000 with the Citi A-Advantage Visa card or £9,000 with an Air Miles card.But the Morgan Stanley scheme appears to be unique in that its points have a two-year expiry date. For some lower-spending cardholders, this could mean that their points expire quicker than they can accumulate them.In addition, for longer flights, borrowers could be better off with other cards. The Citi card only needs a spend of £40,000 to get a free return flight to Singapore, compared towith a £100,000 spend on the Morgan Stanley card.The British Airways Amex card requires £80,000 and is limited to BA flights but is still cheaper than the £153,400 needed to be spent on the Air Miles card for a return flight to Singapore.Your choice of a free flight credit cards may also be influenced by how you can collect points. Morgan Stanley has only a very limited number of partners including Domino’s Pizza, Hard Rock Cafe and Odeon Cinemas. The Air Miles scheme is linked to a much wider variety of firms companies and gives double points for spending at major stores such as Tesco, Shell and House of Fraser. Frequent travellers may prefer to opt for a BA or Citi card as rewards points from these cards can be added to the respective airlines’ own rewards plans.Introductory offers can also be worth seeking out. The Air Miles card gives a free 200 free miles when customers take out a card, plus 300 bonus miles if you use the card 20 times or more before June 2005. If you fulfil these criteria, you will already have earned enough miles points for a return flight to Paris or Brussels (450 miles). But again cardholders need to have their wits about them. On most schemes, the number of points needed for a flight is often just a guideline. “Only people that book well ahead will get the advertised price (450 points). People booking late on a very busy flight may not get this price,” says Cristina Rebollo at RBS cards.The same is true of the Air Miles scheme, which recently changed its rules so that it costs more air miles points to fly to a chosen destination if you choose to travel at a popular time.Air travel programmes are very popular among card users, but it is notoriously hard to work up enough points to pay for flights. Especially when, in the case of the Morgan Stanley card the time in which you have to redeem the points is limited to three years from when the points are added to your card. The Airmiles scheme has no limitations.“Because of the small amount of points you receive it can take a long time to save enough points to redeem against something you want,” says Mike Naylor, senior researcher at Which?. “Redeeming against flights can sometimes be difficult because availability may be an issue and there may be taxes and charges to pay as well.”Naylor says it’s worth remembering that these schemes cost a lot of money to run and obviously companies don’t do it for their customers’ benefits, but instead offer these schemes to encourage us to spend more than we planned to and to get our loyalty.“People should be aware of this and shouldn’t spend more than they planned just to earn a few points. Importantly people shouldn’t change their spending patterns. It’s much more important to make sure you are getting a good price for whatever you are buying instead of thinking of the points you will earn,” he says.Stuart Glendinning, marketing director of www.moneysupermarket.com, says that unless you live a lifestyle that includes taking lots of flights or constantly using your credit card for purchases, taking out a credit card because of its loyalty points scheme is usually a bad idea.Glendinning adds that the cashback schemes can be a quicker way to make money unless you are collecting flights points through multiple sources (such as shopping at Tesco and swapping each £2.50 Clubcard voucher for 60 Air Miles).“The downside of cards offering loyalty benefits is that they are often quite specific and that means they are restrictive – you often can only spend your rewards at certain shops to benefit from being loyal,” he says. “And it’s often difficult to work out the value of the benefit you get so it’s difficult to compare them.”He points out that the rise in cheap flights companies means that it is possible to getbuy cheap flights to Europe anyway so borrowers may be better off getting a cashback card offering an average of 1 per cent on purchases and paying for their flights separately.“The golden rule is always that only if you never pay interest should you choose a card for its reward scheme or cashback – any gain from a scheme will be dwarfed by the interest charge,” he says.
482;MA;Mastercard Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

484;MA;Mastercard Inc;2004-11-10T12:58:37Z;OFT finds against Mastercard over fees;;The Office of Fair Trading has provisionally found that Mastercard has infringed competition laws on transaction fees which it charges on each credit card transaction.Since 2003, the regulator has been investigating whether shoppers are paying artificially high prices in shops that accept credit cards because of the ?unduly high? fees which MasterCard insists on every transaction made with one of its cards.The Office of Fair Trading has given MasterCard one last chance to appeal against its findings.The OFT will then make a final decision and could force the credit card issuer to cut its charges.Mastercard's interchange fee consists of 1.1 per cent of any transaction and is paid by the retailers' banks to the banks which issue the credit cards.The OFT said this cost was passed on to retailers and, in turn, to consumers, driving up prices at stores where cards are used.There are about ?30bn worth of transactions using MasterCard credit or charge cards each year, so shoppers are coughing up about ?330m a year for the interchange fee alone.The OFT said the system breached competition rules because it was so widely used and there were no incentives for banks to agree a lower fee.UK banks justify the intercharge fee because they say it helps cover the cost of fraud, which costs credit card providers ?275m in 2001.Analysts believe that the interchange fee could come down from 1.1 per cent to about 0.7 per cent.
485;MA;Mastercard Inc;2004-10-04T15:23:49Z;Supreme Court lets stand Visa, MasterCard ruling;;The US Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling that the Visa and MasterCard credit card associations violated federal antitrust law by barring their member banks from issuing credit and charge cards on the rival American Express and Discover Card networks.Without any comment, the justices rejected separate appeals by Visa and MasterCard of a ruling that found their so-called exclusionary rules harmed competition.The Department of Justice opened a case against Visa and MasterCard in 1998, claiming the two stifled competition by forbidding thousands of banks in their networks from issuing American Express and Discover. Visa and MasterCard had appealed to the Supreme Court in a last-ditch attempt to overturn the rulings.Kenneth Chenault, chairman and CEO of American Express, welcomed the decision, saying in a statement it marked the begining of ?a new era of greater choice for US consumers and financial institutions?.The move clears the way for American Express and Morgan Stanley to file a lawsuit, claiming up to a billion dollars in damages from Visa and MasterCard, the world?s two biggest credit card issuers.The two claim that Visa and MasterCard?s actions in barring their member banks from issuing rival credit cards deprived them of hundreds of millions of dollars in business.On Friday, David Balto, a lawyer with Robins, Kaplan, Miller Ciresi, predicted American Express and Discover would have an easy time proving the case since lower courts already ruled rivals were in the wrong.?It?s a very simple case,? Mr Balto said. ?The court has said unambiguously that Visa and MasterCard were liable. It?s just a matter of figuring out the cost of damages.?David Boise, the government?s lawyer who won the antitrust case against Microsoft, has been hired as the lead lawyer for American Express. Lloyd Constantine, who represented US retailers in the antitrust case over debit card fees against Visa and MasterCard settled for $3bn last year, will represent Discover. The suit represents another blow for Visa and MasterCard, which have faced a series of lawsuits in recent years alleging anti-competitive behaviour.
486;MA;Mastercard Inc;2004-08-03T01:50:51Z;Visa accused of breaching EU competition rules;;The European Commission has charged Visa International, the credit card group, with restricting competition, in breach of European rules.The accusations, which could lead to fines, are contained in a confidential document known as a statement of objections sent to the company on Monday night.The move follows investigations into the business practices of Visa and its rival MasterCard, which together control just less than 90 per cent of the market in Europe. The charges illustrate the Commission?s new emphasis on abuses in the financial services sector. It has launched a drive to crack down on anti-competitive behaviour by bourses, banks and credit card companies.Last month, Commission officials raided the offices of Euronext, the pan-European stock exchange, and earlier this year charged a French credit card group with competition abuses.MasterCard and Visa have already faced a different set of allegations, when the Commission accused them of overcharging retailers. But while MasterCard is still under investigation, Visa struck a deal with the Commission two years ago by promising to reduce charges.The new allegations focus on a decision by Visa, an association of banks and financial services groups, not to admit Morgan Stanley. The US investment bank had wanted to offer card services to shops and merchants in the European Union, but was denied access to Visa customers because the bank has its own credit card.The exclusion, the Commission argues, reduced competition in the ?merchant acquiring market?, which deals with transactions between merchants and card companies. Brussels is concerned that this side of the credit card business suffers from less competition than card issuing.Visa said: ?Morgan Stanley operate the Discover brand credit card a product that competes directly with Visa. We believe, therefore, that allowing Morgan Stanley into the Visa association would give them competitive information which would effectively reduce competition in the market, and that strong competition in the payments industry benefits everyone, particularly consumers.?
