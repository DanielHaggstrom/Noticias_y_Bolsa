0;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-02-05T04:00:28Z;Adobe and Salesforce overturn old order in cloud revolution;Oracle and SAP fade after failing to change fast enough;Shantanu Narayen, the chief executive of US software company Adobe, sounds almost incredulous about his company’s recent stock market transformation.Best known for its Photoshop image-editing software and Acrobat document reader, Adobe had a stock market value of $8bn in the wake of the financial crisis. Late last week, however, it overtook Oracle to become the world’s second most valuable software company after Microsoft, with a stock market value of more than $170bn.“We’re worth more than Oracle, we’re worth more than SAP — we’re worth a lot more than IBM,” said Mr Narayen, ticking off the old powers of the IT world that his company has eclipsed. His short explanation for this reordering of the pecking order in tech: “We’re all about growth.”There has been a changing of the guard in the software world. A rejuvenated Microsoft, under Satya Nadella, still sits at the top of the heap. But below it, companies growing fast on the back of cloud computing have benefited from a surge in investor interest.Salesforce, known for its cloud-based sales automation software, itself overtook German software maker SAP in market value last week and is now within 4 per cent of overhauling Oracle. For Marc Benioff, the former top Oracle salesman who co-founded Salesforce 21 years ago, that would represent a big victory over his former mentor, Larry Ellison. The Oracle boss long scoffed at what he claimed was the faddishness of Wall Street’s infatuation with cloud stocks.Speaking late last week, Mr Benioff wouldn’t be drawn on the rivalry with his old employer, but was dismissive of Oracle’s own, stuttering efforts to latch on to the cloud. “Customers don’t talk about them much,” Mr Benioff said. Pointing to the sales growth that has lifted companies such as Salesforce, he added: “The customers have spoken, in terms of the revenue acceleration of the cloud companies.”With stock market investors starved of growth, cloud software has become “one of the only durable growth markets out there right now in a low-interest rate environment”, said Alex Zukin, a technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Public fascination with the most recent generation of highly valued tech start-ups, known as unicorns, has centred on companies that serve consumer markets, like Uber and Lyft (now valued at $62bn and $14bn, respectively). But business software start-ups have turned out to be a more reliable bet, with companies such as ServiceNow and Shopify — each founded within the past seven years — now worth $64bn and $54bn.The rise of cloud software has been a rapid one. Seven years ago, Adobe became the first traditional software company to jettison its old way of doing business — shipping discs loaded in return for an upfront licence fee — and make the switch completely to the cloud.Swapping upfront licence sales for regular subscription fees meant delaying the recognition of revenue until future years, leading to a pause in reported sales. It took three years for Adobe’s revenue to get back to the point it had been at the start of the transition. But in the four years since, it has jumped more than 130 per cent.Both Adobe, which makes tools for creative professionals and marketers, and Salesforce, which expanded from sales to marketing departments, have benefited from the greater penetration of software in the “front office” of businesses, reshaping the jobs of many people whose jobs involve dealing with customers.This was partly a result of luck, said Mr Zukin: As online interaction began to produce a deluge of data from customers, both companies were well placed to help businesses understand and manage the new flood of information.We’re just still at the beginning of the digital transformation of so many companiesAdobe, whose core software products were used by creative types like designers and illustrators, benefited from an explosion in digital content creation that came with the advent of smartphones and the cloud. The cloud also opened the way for “measurement and monetisation”, said Mr Narayen — giving marketers tools to analyse how people were interacting with their content, as well as ways to cash in on it.Companies of all types are still at an early stage of reshaping their operations around this new fount of customer data, added Mr Benioff. “We’re just still at the beginning of the digital transformation of so many companies,” he said.Making their software applications available over the cloud has also made it possible to reach many more users. “We used to serve the top of the pyramid, people [in creative jobs] viewed us just as people in finance view the Bloomberg terminal,” said Mr Narayen. Low-cost versions have expanded the market, particularly in the developing world, he added. The huge shift in stock market value to companies that have risen with the cloud also speaks volumes about the struggles of the old guard to latch on to the cloud revolution. Shares in SAP dropped 6 per cent last week after it reported a fall-off in new cloud business, with a deceleration in bookings to 17 per cent in the most recent quarter, from 34 per cent in the preceding three months.SAP has placed some big bets on the cloud, including two $8bn acquisitions in recent years — of Concur, whose software is used to manage travel expenses, and Qualtrics, which runs online surveys. But SAP’s main growth has come from re-engineering its original back-office applications to process and analyse large volumes of data more rapidly. What cloud growth it had managed had come from “add-on services and applications” rather than its core business, said Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.Shares in the German software maker have at least fared better than Oracle, whose stock has underperformed the wider US stock market by 60 per cent over the past five years. But SAP and Oracle have been held back by their focus on back-office systems, said Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies — a result of their rise at a time when enterprise resource planning, or ERP, was the driving force in business automation. “Neither has figured out the front office,” Mr Thill said.“It takes years to implement an ERP system, and once it’s implemented you want to run it for years” rather than replace it with cloud software, said Mr Walkush at Jensen, an Oracle investor. In addition, he said, companies using cloud services had become less concerned about the underlying technology they ran on — eroding the loyalty towards Oracle’s database software, which has been a core part of the IT foundation for many corporate applications.In its fiscal year ending in May, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of about $40bn — only 8 per cent more than it did eight years before. The company stopped disclosing its cloud revenue separately in 2018, adding to worries on Wall Street about the slow pace of the transition.The huge valuation swing to fast-growing cloud software companies, meanwhile, has left them more vulnerable to any shift in stock market sentiment or economic outlook. For companies such as Salesforce and Adobe, investor attention has also started to focus on profit margins as well as growth, as they digest recent acquisitions and their sales growth moderates.Shares in Oracle, on the other hand, are trading at only 13 times expected earnings in its current fiscal year. But with little sign of growth returning, there have been few takers.
1;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2019-11-15T20:13:13Z;US Supreme Court takes up copyright case between Google and Oracle;;The US Supreme Court has agreed to take up a Google appeal in a long-running copyright case brought by Oracle that has cast a shadow over common development practices in the software world.The decision, announced on Friday, comes despite a recommendation by the Solicitor General that the justices reject the case, and gives the internet giant new hope in a case that has run since 2010. Had the court refused Google’s appeal, the case would have been returned to a lower court for damages to be assessed, with Oracle seeking $9bn.The case turns on whether Google illegally copied code from Java, a software development framework owned by Oracle, when it created its Android mobile operating system. By using the same “labels” for its software interfaces, it made it easier for software developers who had already written programs for the mobile version of Java to adapt them for Android.Google’s supporters have claimed that, if it loses the case, software developers will have to seek permission before writing applications to run on the most widely-used tech platforms, hurting competition in the software industry. Welcoming Friday’s decision, Kent Walker, Google’s top legal officer, said the internet company hoped “that the court reaffirms the importance of software interoperability in American competitiveness.”Oracle, by contrast, has argued that a ruling would make no difference to how the software industry currently operates, and many other top technology companies have already taken out licences to Java — something that some Google engineers had warned internally was legally necessary when it first adopted the Java code without first seeking permission.
2;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2019-10-18T18:48:40Z;Silicon Valley veteran Mark Hurd dies at 62;Former Oracle co-chief hailed as ‘brilliant and beloved leader’ by Larry Ellison;Mark Hurd, a high-profile Silicon Valley executive who was most recently co-chief of Oracle, has died at the age of 62. Mr Hurd took a medical leave of absence from Oracle just last month. The enterprise tech company’s founder Larry Ellison and co-chief executive Safra Catz had since taken on his responsibilities, which had focused on sales and marketing. In an email to staff on Friday, Mr Ellison said that Oracle had “lost a brilliant and beloved leader”. “All of us will miss Mark’s keen mind and rare ability to analyse, simplify and solve problems quickly,” Mr Ellison wrote. “I will miss his kindness and sense of humor.” An Oracle spokesperson had no further comment on the cause or circumstances of Mr Hurd’s death early on Friday morning. Bill McDermott, who recently stepped down as chief executive of SAP, an Oracle rival, tweeted that Mr Hurd was “a self-made success in the industry & presided over mega accomplishments”. “While we competed vigorously in the market, we enjoyed professional respect. My heartfelt prayers are with Mark’s family on this solemn day,” he said.Mr Hurd had been at Oracle since 2010, becoming joint chief alongside Ms Catz in 2014. He had joined from Hewlett-Packard, where he helped return the Silicon Valley veteran to growth after the tumultuous leadership of Carly Fiorina. He was forced out as HP’s chief executive following alleged breaches of its code of conduct, from which he was later cleared. At the time, Mr Ellison — who regularly played tennis with Mr Hurd — described HP’s move as the “worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs”. Before HP, Mr Hurd had been chief executive at NCR, spending 25 years at the maker of cash machines and checkout terminals. He played a central role in Oracle’s transition from a vendor of databases and servers to a provider of cloud computing services, including overseeing acquisitions such as NetSuite. He was also among the tech industry’s most highly paid executives, with his total compensation last year exceeding $100m. Some Oracle employees paid tribute to Mr Hurd on Twitter on Friday. “He was blissfully unapologetic about his fierce competitive nature, and drive to win,” said Ann Rombach, a talent adviser at the company.Mr Hurd is survived by his wife, Paula Hurd, and two daughters. 
3;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2019-09-11T20:44:02Z;Oracle co-chief Mark Hurd to take leave of absence for health reasons;Shares slide as results posted earlier than expected;Oracle co-chief executive Mark Hurd will take a leave of absence for health reasons, the software company announced Wednesday.In a memo to employees, Mr Hurd said he decided to spend time focusing on his health, and Oracle’s board had granted him a medical leave of absence at his request.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who serves as executive chairman and chief technology officer, said he and co-chief executive Safra Catz would cover Mr Hurd’s responsibilities during his absence.“As you all know, Larry, Safra and I have worked together as a strong team, and I have great confidence that they and the entire executive management team will do a terrific job executing the exciting plans we will showcase at the upcoming OpenWorld,” Mr Hurd said.The news came as Oracle reported quarterly financial results a day earlier than scheduled, revealing earnings that met forecasts while revenue fell short.The business software maker earned net income of $2.14bn in its fiscal first quarter that ended August 31, down from $2.27bn in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, Oracle’s earnings per share rose 10 cents to 81 cents, matching analysts’ average estimate in a Refinitiv poll.Revenue climbed slightly to $9.22bn compared with $9.19bn a year earlier. Analysts were looking for about $9.29bn. Oracle booked a 3 per cent gain in revenues from cloud services and license support, while its hardware unit saw its sales drop 10 per cent.“As our low margin hardware businesses continue to get smaller, while our higher margin cloud business continues to get bigger, we expect Oracle’s operating margins, earnings per share and free cash flow all to grow,” Ms Catz said.Oracle’s shares pared their after-hours losses to trade 2.1 per cent lower, after rising 1.5 per cent during Wednesday’s regular session.
4;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2019-07-12T17:12:27Z;Oracle loses challenge to Pentagon’s $10bn cloud computing contract;The US defence department had chosen Amazon and Microsoft as finalists;A federal judge has cleared the way for the US Department of Defense to award its $10bn cloud computing contract to Amazon or Microsoft with a ruling on Friday dismissing a challenge from Oracle.Judge Eric Bruggink of the US Court of Federal Claims dismissed Oracle’s claims that the procurement process violated federal laws meant to ensure a competitive process and was marred by conflicts of interest.Because Oracle could not meet the criteria for the bid, “it cannot demonstrate prejudice as a result of other possible errors in the procurement process,” he wrote.The Pentagon named Amazon and Microsoft as finalists to win the multiyear contract in April, eliminating IBM and Oracle from consideration. It has said it expects to make a final decision by the end of the summer.Oracle has been complaining about the way the bidding process has been conducted since last year. The company objected to the Pentagon’s decision to award the contact to a single company, rather than breaking it up among several providers, arguing that favours Amazon Web Services as the biggest player in the industry.Oracle has also alleged conflicts of interest over AWS’s hiring of two former defence department employees involved in the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) procurement process. The company previously filed a complaint with the Government Accountability Office, which was also rejected.Oracle said in a statement: “We look forward to working with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and other public sector agencies to deploy modern, secure hyperscale cloud solutions that meet their needs.”AWS, which was a defendant in the case alongside the government, said it “stands ready to support and serve what’s most important — the DoD’s mission of protecting the security of our country. The DoD deserves access to the best technology in the world and we are unwavering in our support to their mission.”“We are pleased with the determination made by the US Court of Federal Claims. This reaffirms the DoD’s position: the JEDI Cloud procurement process has been conducted as a fair, full and open competition, which the contracting officer and her team executed in compliance with the law,” said Elissa Smith, a Department of Defense spokeswoman.“DoD has an urgent need to get these critical capabilities in place to support the warfighter and we have multiple military services and Combatant Commands waiting on the availability of JEDI. Our focus continues to be on finalising the award decision.”
5;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2019-06-19T20:39:50Z;Oracle claims headway in shift to cloud;Shares rose after the software maker posted stronger earnings than expected;Business software maker Oracle claimed headway in shifting its applications to the cloud on Wednesday, as it reported stronger than expected revenues and earnings in its latest quarter.The news prompted a 7 per cent jump in the company’s shares in after-market trading, before they fell back to give up half of the gain.The company, best known for its database software, has faced periodic scepticism on Wall Street over the pace of its move to the cloud, and recently gave up reporting its cloud revenue separately. Oracle has also been struggling to convince investors that it can make higher profit margins after a period of investment as it moved into the cloud.Mark Hurd, co-chief executive officer, said that both the company’s Fusion online applications, as well as the NetSuite suite of services aimed at smaller businesses, had seen revenue increases of 32 per cent in the company’s last fiscal year, which ended in May.“Our high-margin Fusion and NetSuite cloud applications businesses are growing rapidly, while we downsize our low-margin legacy hardware business,” said Safra Catz, co-CEO. As a result, she added, Oracle’s pro forma operating profit margin had reached 47 per cent, one percentage point higher than a year before and the highest level in five years.Oracle reported revenue of $11.1bn, up 1 per cent from a year before, despite a three percentage point headwind caused by the rise of the US dollar. Pro forma earnings per share — the measure on which Wall Street judges the company — climbed 23 per cent to $1.16, compared to the $1.07 most analysts had been expecting.
6;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2019-05-12T13:33:02Z;Oracle China staff protest at wave of ‘political firings’;R&D workers blame US-Beijing tensions for 900 job losses;The American software company Oracle has fired 900 staff from its China team, making up 60 per cent of its research and development effort there, according to employees, some of whom blamed tensions between the US and China for the cuts.Oracle’s China staff were told on May 7 that the company was “optimising” its workforce and that redundancies would be made by May 22, according to eight employees at the company’s R&D centre in Beijing, Oracle’s biggest unit in China.The announcement came as a surprise and led to protests outside Oracle’s building. The decision, which came in the same week as the US announced additional tariffs on Chinese goods, saw staff blame the trade war.Although only the first wave of 900 job cuts have been officially announced, many employees said they believed the whole of the China R&D operation would eventually go. A job fair in Beijing’s Software Park, near Oracle’s headquarters, was peppered with engineers still wearing their red Oracle lanyards last week.“I’ve not been laid off yet, but I expect to be,” said one young Oracle employee at the fair. “There are lots of people saying that Larry (Ellison) doesn’t like China. I think it’s because the US has this ‘China threat’ narrative,” he added.The employee referred to the Oracle co-founder’s interview with Fox Business last October, in which Mr Ellison said that “we [the US] have a serious competition going with China, I’m on Team USA”, and “if we let China produce more engineers than we do, if we let China’s technology companies beat our technology companies, it won’t be long that our military is behind technologically also”.Oracle did not confirm or deny the job cuts, and declined to comment on the company’s China strategy, but said: “As our cloud business grows, we will continually balance our resources and restructure our development group to help ensure we deliver the best cloud services to our customers in China.”But some employees, many of whom were surprised as well as angry about their two-week notice period, have come to their own conclusions. At a protest on Wednesday near the Oracle R&D centre in Beijing, staff unfurled red banners with slogans such as “Oppose Oracle’s political firing of staff, keep politics away from technology” and “Keep the jobs in China”.“The official explanation is they are ‘optimising’, but I think this is unreasonable, because they are cutting a lot of product lines that still make money: databases, ERP [enterprise resource planning],” said a second Oracle engineer.“We think the real reason is to do with the US-China trade war. If it was about business, they’d cut a portion of staff or only lossmaking teams, not everyone. It’s not about products, it’s about nationality,” the engineer said.Another engineer working on Oracle’s ERP line said: “It’s not about the business, it’s about the international situation. They want to continue to sell products to China, but not to make products in China. I say if they do that, then we should set up our own competitor, the government should subsidise our own technology.”The Chinese media has praised Oracle for offering a minimum of six months’ severance pay. But employees were concerned about social insurance payments stopping by the end of the month, which in Beijing is tied to the provision of education and the right to buy housing.Beijing’s other tech companies saw their opportunity to swoop in: at the jobs fair, two Huawei headhunters put up a sign advertising a “Oracle-Huawei dialogue” messaging group on WeChat.At least two other WeChat groups set up for axed Oracle workers have reached their maximum capacity of 100, including one specifically for those over 35 years old — many tech companies explicitly say they will not hire older workers.“Our team is profitable, and in fact two years ago we were given a new project to develop,” said a developer who had worked on Oracle’s PeopleSoft team for five years, who said that about 90 members of their China team of 130 had been fired.“They still need PeopleSoft, so they’re going to re-hire in India and the US. The way they’re doing it, it gives us the impression they want to get rid of us as quickly as possible,” she added.
7;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2019-03-14T21:42:00Z;Oracle ekes out better than expected profit despite strong dollar;;A strong US dollar again weighed on revenue growth at Oracle in its third quarter, taking some gloss off a result that saw the company eke past both sales and earnings expectations.Revenue fell 1 per cent from a year ago to $9.6bn in the three months to February 28, which was about $280m ahead of the median expectation among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Adjusting for foreign exchange moves, though, revenue was 3 per cent higher than a year ago.Sales for its cloud services and license support, which represents 69 per cent of group revenue, increased 1 per cent from a year earlier, while sales from its cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and services divisions were all down.Oracle reported net income of $2.8bn compared to a loss of about $4bn last year, while earnings of 76 cents a diluted share topped Wall Street estimates by 11 cents. Adjusted earnings of 87 cents were up 8 per cent from a year ago and were 3 cents ahead of market forecasts.Safra Catz, chief executive, said she was pleased with the company’s adjusted results. “Our overall operating margin improved to 44 per cent as our lower margin hardware business continued to get smaller while our higher margin cloud business continued to get bigger,” she said in a statement.“With year-to-date [adjusted] EPS growth rate now at 16 per cent in constant currency, we will comfortably deliver another year of double-digit EPS growth,” Ms Catz added.Shares were down 0.4 per cent in after-hours trade on Thursday.
8;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2019-03-14T17:29:58Z;Treating Big Tech as a monopoly offers the app makers hope;Senator’s call for utility-like regulation is one possibility to keep greedy hands from taking all the pie;Google’s founders famously claimed, during their IPO in 2004, that they were “making the world a better place”. One of the things they pointed to as evidence was the burgeoning online economy their advertising supported: At the time, 39 cents out of every dollar in advertising Google collected was passed on to the independent web publishers who carried its ads.Fifteen years on, things look very different. The absolute amounts have grown as a flood of advertising has gone online, but Google now passes on only 12 cents of every advertising dollar, keeping the rest for itself — a sign of how it is answering more internet search queries through its own services.This, as tech commentator Tim O’Reilly points out, is the classic evolution of dominant tech platforms. Companies like this always end up trying to grab a bigger share of the applications or services they support. Microsoft did much the same, turning its Office suite of applications into the standard for Windows machines — in the process squeezing out independent PC application developers.As more of life comes to revolve around digital platforms, is this an inevitable end-state that will leave Big Tech with too much power over an ever-growing share of the economy? Spotify’s antitrust complaint against Apple to the European Commission this week is the latest case in point. Like other app makers, Spotify is a beneficiary of the smartphone, and the mobile app stores that make distribution of its service easy. But Spotify is now crying foul, as Apple sees music streaming and other services as its next big business opportunity.One possible response was floated by Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren last week. She argued for carving out the tech platforms and treating them as regulated utilities, as part of a wider break-up of Big Tech. That, after all, has been a model for dealing with “natural monopolies” in other industries, from electricity transmission to railways. App stores, search engines and ecommerce platforms (Amazon) would all be forced to give equal treatment to all-comers, rather than favouring in-house products and services.One common response to this in Silicon Valley is that tech is different (this is certainly how the tech companies see it). According to this argument, the dominance of today’s platforms is a temporary phenomenon based on the current state of computing, just as the Microsoft and IBM monopolies were in the past.But when a technology is at its peak, it is hard to expect politicians and regulators to simply take this on faith. The centre of computing gravity may one day shift to intelligent cars, augmented reality glasses and “smart home” gadgets. But right now, the smartphone is the centre. Also, today’s tech leaders are investing heavily to make sure they are the ones who control the next dominant platforms.But there are plenty of weapons short of break-up to restrain tech leaders from unfairly pushing out upstart competitors. The Spotify complaint points to one. Illegal “tying” of services — using a dominant position in one market to unfairly take over another — has been used before to restrain the power of tech companies, most notably Microsoft.Regulators will need to be expansive in the use of their powers to be effective. The challenge by German federal regulators against Facebook is a case in point, attacking the company’s ability to use data collected for one of its service to support others.Along with more activist regulators, the courts will need to do their bit. Two cases currently before the US Supreme Court highlight the issues at stake. One concerns the right of consumers to challenge the 30 per cent fee that Apple applies in its App Store.The other is an appeal by Google, in a case involving Oracle. If the lower court ruling stands, it will become easier for companies with a dominant position to prevent upstart competitors from building services that tap into their technologies.The threat of a break-up — if not the act itself — may also be a potent weapon. IBM and Microsoft were both threatened with that ultimate sanction. They survived intact, but wariness about overplaying their hands may have been one factor that allowed new competitors to grow up in their shadows.For that reason alone, Spotify, along with every other app maker that has come to rely on Apple’s smartphone App Store, must be hoping that politicians like Senator Warren keep up the rhetorical attack.richard.waters@ft.com
9;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-12-17T22:19:05Z;Oracle buyback helps prop up Q2 earnings per share;;Oracle bought back another $10bn of its own stock in the latest quarter, contributing to stronger earnings per share at a time when the rising US dollar is weighing on its revenue and profits growth.The aggressive repurchases, prompted by last year’s US tax reform, helped to push earnings per share up by 19 per cent, to 80 cents. That was two cents above Wall Street expectations and prompted a 3 per cent bounce in the software maker’s share price in after-market trading.Oracle has been struggling to demonstrate consistent growth as it makes the transition to cloud computing and deals with adverse currency effects. In the three months to the end of November it reported revenues of $9.6bn, virtually unchanged from a year before. The company said its revenue would have risen 2 per cent had it not been for the stronger dollar.Revenue from cloud services and licence support, the company’s largest segment, grew 3 per cent, to $6.6bn. Oracle stopped reporting its cloud revenue separately earlier this year, despite the close attention the figure had received as an indicator of the company’s attempted transformation.The $10bn stock buyback matches the amount in the preceding three months and underlines Oracle as one of the most aggressive tech companies in repurchasing stock since the tax change. It left the company with net debt of nearly $9bn, compared to a net cash position of nearly $7bn at the start of its fiscal year in June.
10;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-12-04T18:38:09Z;Amazon: AWSome;Ecommerce group’s cloud division is a rainmaker;Amazon Web Services’ journey from side gig to profit mainstay is a decent rejoinder to those who sneer at flops such as the Fire Phone. Amazon’s experiment in cloud services has transformed into a business expected to generate more than $26bn in revenue this year.Cloud computing is a crowded market. AWS may be the industry leader by size but Google is regarded as offering the most innovative data analysis tools, while Microsoft’s hybrid service appeals to conservative organisations nervous about putting all of their information on to the cloud. AWS has designs on both businesses. New tools and services announced at last week’s Las Vegas conference included hybrid service AWS Outposts and new machine learning chip Inferentia. Both will increase revenue.AWS’s last quarterly revenue growth number of 46 per cent already outstrips (year on year) the 29 per cent reported for the group. Growth will speed up if data-rich groups such as governments and financial services companies can be persuaded to make the jump to the cloud. Outposts will allow customers to put servers used in cloud computing data centres on their own premises — choosing which information is moved to the cloud and which is kept on site. When it is released next year it will neutralise one of the few advantages Microsoft’s Azure has to offer. News of the plan is already helping Amazon to compete in the fight between Apple and Microsoft for top spot by market capitalisation. For a brief moment on Monday, Amazon became the world’s most valuable company.Google remains a distant third in the battle for cloud computing, just as parent company Alphabet trails in markets. Google’s new boss of cloud services, Thomas Kurian, a former Oracle executive, is likely to have ideas about ways to close the gap. But AWS’s new machine learning tools target exactly the sort of data evaluation that Google offers, meaning Google will find it harder to stand out. The expansion in services adds fuel to existing interest in Amazon spinning out its cloud company, although Amazon may not want to lose its profit generator. AWS is a higher margin business than ecommerce and is expected to grow at a faster pace. Technology companies trade at higher multiples than retail and ecommerce companies. If AWS were priced at a Microsoft-like seven times revenue, rather than Amazon’s existing four times, it would be worth just under $200bn. Either way, AWS is making inroads against its competitors.
11;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-11-14T22:20:12Z;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway takes new stake in JPMorgan;Investor increases his giant bet on the US financial sector;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has taken a nearly $4bn stake in JPMorgan Chase and pumped billions of dollars more into other US banks, as his sprawling investment group expanded its reach across American finance.Berkshire, whose long-held bank stakes include American Express, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, disclosed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had purchased 35.7m shares of JPMorgan, or about 1.1 per cent of the bank’s outstanding shares. The investment in JPMorgan takes the number of major financial institutions held by Berkshire to 14, in a $94bn portfolio that ranges from regional banks such as US Bancorp and M&T Bank to the largest lenders on Wall Street including Goldman Sachs. Berkshire itself is an insurance powerhouse, using the earnings it generates from policy premiums at its Geico and reinsurance units to invest in stocks or take over companies outright. While Mr Buffett has found a dearth of acquisition targets over the past two years, he and his investment protégés Todd Combs and Ted Weschler have instead ploughed billions into the US stock market.The disclosure on Wednesday showed Berkshire also purchased more than 6m shares in PNC Financial, the regional bank with a large presence on the US east coast, worth more than $800m. It added to its stakes in Bank of America, US Bancorp and the Bank of New York Mellon.Berkshire, whose overall stock portfolio was valued at $207bn at the end of September, cut its stake in Wells Fargo by about 9.7m shares in the third quarter. Mr Buffett last year said Berkshire would sell shares in the scandal-hit bank because it needed to keep its holding below the 10 per cent threshold at which the Federal Reserve can exert oversight over a bank shareholder.The direct investment in JPMorgan comes after the bank and Berkshire teamed up with online retailer Amazon in a healthcare joint venture that they plan to use to cut their employee healthcare costs. Mr Buffett has also joined forces with JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon to argue that companies should stop giving quarterly earnings guidance, to foster long-term thinking. The pair led a group of almost 200 US chief executives arguing that the nature of short-term reporting was harming the economy.Berkshire’s Mr Combs is on JPMorgan’s board.Wednesday’s regulatory filing reveals that Berkshire also scooped up shares in tech giant Oracle and insurance company Travelers during the third quarter, while it sold out of US big box retailer Walmart and reduced its stake in energy group Phillips 66.The company also made the rare move of buying back its own shares in the quarter, underscoring the difficulty Mr Buffett has had finding appealing deals. Shares of JPMorgan climbed 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading on the news, while Oracle gained 2.6 per cent.
12;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-11-13T12:57:25Z;Five US tech giants spend combined $115bn on buying back stock;Outlay on buybacks almost doubles, putting investors among biggest beneficiaries of Trump tax reforms;The five US tech companies with the largest cash piles took advantage of President Trump’s tax reforms to spend more than $115bn in the first three quarters on buying back their own stock.The share buybacks so far this year by Apple, Alphabet, Cisco, Microsoft and Oracle, after the tax change came into force at the end of 2017, are nearly double what the companies spent in the whole of last year, making investors some of the biggest beneficiaries of a plan that was billed as a boost to US jobs.They also increased their capital investment by 42 per cent compared with the same period last year, to $42.6bn, according to FT calculations.Tech companies have also led a parallel trend, identified in a report released on Tuesday by Moody’s Investors Service, for US companies to channel a large part of their tax windfalls into paying down debt.The new data add to the debate about the extent to which the tax reforms have boosted investors, rather than stimulating investment and benefiting American workers.The National Association for Business Economics reported last month that the changes to the tax code had “not broadly impacted hiring and investment plans”.Tech companies had been sitting on some of the largest cash piles, almost all of it stranded offshore where it escaped an immediate tax.Last year’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought these reserves into the tax net but at a reduced rate — in turn freeing the companies to use the money rather than leave it to continue to pile up.“Most companies are using cash to buy back stock and make acquisitions, rather than invest in new facilities,” said Walter Price, a tech investment manager at Allianz. “I think this is good for shareholders and management.” Tech companies were also paying down debt they took on in previous years to buy back shares, he added.Apple, with the largest offshore cash and investment holdings, generated headlines soon after the passage of the tax bill when it said its “direct contribution” to the US economy would be $350bn over the next five years.Since then, it has lifted its capital spending to $14.5bn, an increase of 14 per cent from the year before. But its spending on buybacks has soared to $62.6bn in the first nine months of the year, nearly three times as much as the same period the year before.Investors and analysts said that repatriated cash was also contributing to renewed investment. But planning new facilities takes longer than executing a buyback, and will take longer to show up in capital spending figures, said Mr Price.“There’s a strong correlation between tax reform and capital spending,” added Youssef Squali, an internet analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, pointing at Google and Facebook, which plan to spend a combined $37bn between them this year, up from just under $21bn in 2017.The US commerce department said that growth in business investment overall had slowed in the third quarter after a bumper start to the year. Brett Ryan, senior US economist for Deutsche Bank, said last week he expected a recovery in capex in the fourth quarter, followed by a gradual slowdown in 2019. Meanwhile, share buybacks have risen 44 per cent so far this year, according to Goldman Sachs, which estimates that buybacks will climb another 22 per cent in 2019. Just 25 companies accounted for 99 per cent of the growth in buybacks this year, the bank found, underscoring the outsized influence of tech companies’ use of cash.In the aftermath of tax overhaul we have seen a drastic change in company behaviour, with companies moving from a net borrower to net payer positionMoody’s analysis of a sample of 100 non-financial companies with large cash piles found that they had flipped since the tax overhaul was implemented last December from adding debt to repaying it. The selected companies repaid $72bn of debt in the first six months of 2018, close to the $81bn they spent on buybacks and dividends, and more than the $47bn they allocated to capex or research and development.“In the aftermath of tax overhaul we have seen a drastic change in company behaviour, with companies moving from a net borrower to net payer position,” said David Gonzales, Moody’s senior accounting analyst.Tech companies have been in the vanguard, with Moody’s finding $6.5bn of incremental net debt repayments at Apple and $4.8bn at Microsoft compared with the 2016-2017 pace. Abbott Laboratories, Chevron and Gilead Sciences were also among those sharply increasing debt repayments. The debt of US corporations has risen to pre-crisis levels of $9.4tn, or 46 per cent of domestic output, and former Fed chair Janet Yellen has voiced alarm that lending standards have loosened as memories of the crisis fade.
13;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-10-24T19:22:45Z;Oracle: clouds on the distant horizon;Buybacks look overly defensive as group aims high;You can tell a lot about an organisation from the company it keeps. Oracle used to position itself as a rival to software maker SAP. Now it wants to be put in the same bracket as cloud computing leader Amazon Web Services. That makes the company’s earlier decision to stop reporting the precise performance of cloud products look peculiar. At its annual OpenWorld shindig in San Francisco this week, co-founder Larry Ellison claimed Oracle was so invested in the business that it was moving to a more secure ‘cloud generation two’. Yet it will not still specify the speed at which its cloud business is growing.This new generation gives some indication of how long Oracle has been shifting to cloud computing. Until Oracle unscrambles revenues it will be difficult to judge the transition. The newly blended cloud services and license support unit makes up almost three-quarters of Oracle’s business by revenue. It grew 3 per cent in the last quarter to $6.6bn. But it is impossible to know how much was driven by cloud sales instead of legacy products.Other sections of the business are not growing at all. But then, moving customers to the cloud was always likely to undercut revenue growth. And yet Oracle can afford to slowly turn its supertanker of a business round. The $182bn market cap company still prints cash. It generated nearly $7bn in cash flow from operations last quarter on a 30 per cent operating margin.But for a company so quick to square up to its competitors, Oracle’s buybacks look overly defensive. It recently promised another $12bn. Last quarter it spent about $10bn. In part, this is a way to take advantage of a US tax law change. But it is also intended to soften the blow of disappointing results.Oracle claims that such let-downs will soon be in the past. This week it said applications — another small but growing segment — could double in size as the cloud business accelerates. If Oracle is serious then it should stop pouring money into buybacks and invest more in that source of growth. 
14;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle props up earnings with buyback despite revenue miss;;Oracle took advantage of the recent change in US tax law to spend nearly $10bn on buying back stock in its latest quarter, marking one of the biggest buybacks since American companies were freed to tap into their overseas cash holdings.However, the massive bout of repurchases, while lifting the US software company’s earnings per share well ahead of expectations, was not enough to make up for a disappointing sales performance. Oracle’s shares dropped nearly 5 per cent in after-market trading, wiping about the gains seen on the year.Oracle’s latest buybacks almost equal the record $11.4bn it spent in the previous 12 months combined, which was itself a big jump from the $43.6bn seen in the 12 months before that.The tax law enacted at the end of 2017 applied an immediate but reduced charge to the foreign earnings that many American companies were keeping offshore, tax-free. That in turn has allowed them to repatriate the money without facing any extra tax charges, fuelling stock buybacks.Oracle’s massive buybacks dwarf even Cisco Systems, which has been more open with investors than other tech companies about its intention of using its cash reserves to repurchase stock. Cisco has purchased around $6bn of its own stock in each of the last two quarters.Oracle reported revenue of $9.2bn for the latest quarter, up 1 per cent from the previous year but below the $9.3bn Wall Street had been expecting. Its pro forma earnings per share, at 71 cents, were ahead of an expected 69 cents per share.
15;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-06-22T16:02:37Z;‘Fake it till you make it’ — but know when to stop;An appearance of strength can be as good as the real thing;“Fake it till you make it” is a well-worn strategy in business. It is a perfectly valid approach, but it has limits.During the financial crisis Deutsche Bank under-reported huge derivatives risks. Asset prices later recovered and the paper losses evaporated — in finance, in particular, the appearance of strength can be as good as the real thing. Less successfully, Lehman Brothers used an accounting scam known as Repo 105 to boost its liquidity position but it could not fake hard enough to survive.For years, Vice Media sucked in attention, investment and staff. At times it relied on a Potemkin village approach. To make it seem like a buzzy, fast-expanding workplace, friends were roped in to wander around toting laptops. New York Magazine reported that for one single, crucial meeting to impress Intel, a potential advertiser, a neighbouring office of architects was implored to vacate their space, which was quickly converted into a swanky annex (“an employee answered a buzz at the door to find a plumber who’d come to install a fancy Japanese toilet”). Vice won the Intel marketing money and, despite plenty of ups and downs, it endures.Eventually, though, the bluffing can grow wearisome. For a while Oracle, a venerable enterprise software company, has portrayed itself as a cool “cloud” business. You can see why. Upstarts such as Salesforce, run by Oracle alum Marc Benioff, have commanded soaring valuations with their web-based subscription alternatives. Oracle did not want to be seen as a fading old colossus. Yet the company’s spin has never rung true: it has struggled to make the case that it has moved beyond its traditional licensing model.This week Safra Catz, Oracle’s chief executive, led the company’s earnings presentation by highlighting “a tremendous number of wins in the cloud”. There were a whopping 66 mentions of the C-word on the conference call. But Oracle also surprised investors with a decision to stop disclosing cloud revenues.“There is no hiding,” Ms Catz insisted. “It’s quite clear that we had a superb quarter and we’re expecting the same next quarter.” The shares dropped 5 per cent.Oracle is on the gentle side of exaggeration. It has just, arguably, overcooked its presence and prospects in a whizzier adjacent sector. The lure of exciting tech, though, extends even to companies in totally unrelated fields that are looking for a boost.Long Island Iced Tea Corporation decided late last year to change its name to Long Blockchain Corp. For a brief moment it came good: the company’s shares jumped 500 per cent as cryptocurrency nuts piled in.Then Nasdaq accused it of trying to “mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology”. This week Long Blockchain was delisted. There was more fizz when Long Island stuck to soft drinks.At some point the jig is always up.BP first deployed its “Beyond Petroleum” campaign 18 years ago but is still making the vast bulk of profits from hydrocarbons. The same is true of Royal Dutch Shell — which chief executive Ben van Beurden describes as an “energy transition company”.They could follow the route of Big Tobacco, wringing plentiful cash from a slowly dying industry. Or they will have to gird investors for an expensive gamble on a real shift to clean energy. The “fake it” part can be fun but the “make it” part matters too.
16;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-06-19T23:19:14Z;Oracle defends cloud business disclosures;Shares slide as analyst worries it may be ‘obfuscating weakness’;Oracle executives insisted that the company was not trying to hide anything from Wall Street, as the US software company’s share price slid 4 per cent in the wake of a change in its financial disclosures and a weak financial forecast.The decline came after Oracle issued a quarterly earnings release that for the first time did not separate out the performance of its closely watched cloud business. The growth rate from the cloud operations has slowed rapidly over recent quarters, leading to a series of cuts to analysts’ growth forecasts.“First of all, there’s no hiding,” co-chief executive Safra Catz insisted on a conference call with analysts late on Tuesday, after being asked if Oracle was running the risk of being accused of “obfuscating cloud weakness”.She pointed out that Oracle had disclosed its latest cloud revenue on the call, even though this was not part of its new formal breakdown. At $1.7bn, the number showed “we are right where we said we’d be. No hiding . . . We don’t have any bad news,” she said.Mark Hurd, co-CEO, added: “This is a nothing-burger. There’s just nothing here.”The growth rate in Oracle’s cloud business, which accounts for 15 per cent of total revenues, has halved over the past year. That has led Wall Street to rethink its earlier confidence that the company was well on the way to making a successful transition away from its traditional software business, as Microsoft had before it.Ms Catz said Oracle had altered its financial disclosure because of a change in its business model that had blurred the line between the cloud and its traditional business, of selling licences for software that customers deploy on their own computers.Under a new arrangement called BYOL, for “bring your own licence”, Oracle now lets customers continue to use the traditional software model — paying an upfront licence fee followed by regular support payments — while getting access to the software through the cloud.Oracle issued a downbeat forecast for first-quarter earnings on its analyst call, reversing the more positive mood created only an hour before by the publication of stronger than expected numbers for the fourth quarter. Ms Catz put the lowered forecasts down to the strengthening of the US dollar since the company last issued guidance.For the fourth quarter, Oracle had been expected to show growth in cloud revenues of around 25 per cent, with revenue from its traditional software licensing business falling by 9 per cent. Instead, it combined its licensing revenue from both cloud and traditional businesses, reporting sales for this segment of $2.6bn, down 5 per cent from a year before.It also combined its other cloud services with its traditional software support business. Together, these operations produced revenue of $6.3bn, up 8 per cent from the year before.Overall, Oracle reported revenue of $11.3bn, up 3 per cent and ahead of the $11.2bn that had been expected. On a pro forma basis, earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 99 cents, above the consensus analyst forecast of 92 cents.
17;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle reports solid revenue, earnings growth in Q4;;Oracle investors breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday as the software giant revealed solid revenue and earnings for its key fourth fiscal quarter, which ended in May.The news followed a weak stock market performance this year amid worries about a bumpy transition of Oracle’s business to the cloud, lifting its shares by more than 2 per cent in after-market trading.Although the overall numbers were stronger than most analysts had expected, Oracle broke with past practice and did not disclose a separate figure for its closely watched cloud revenues in its earnings release. The growth rate from the cloud business has slowed over recent quarters, leading to a series of cuts to analysts’ growth expectations.For the latest period, the company had been expected to show growth in cloud revenues of around 25 per cent, with revenue from its traditional software licensing business falling by 9 per cent.Instead, Oracle combined its licensing revenue from both cloud and traditional businesses, reporting sales for this segment of $2.6bn, down 5 per cent from a year before.It also combined its other cloud services with its traditional software support business. Together, these operations produced revenue of $6.3bn, up 8 per cent from the year before.The lack of detail about cloud performance failed to dampen Wall Street’s response to the earnings news. Overall, Oracle reported revenue of $11.3bn, up 3 per cent and ahead of the $11.2bn that had been expected. On a pro forma basis, earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 99 cents, above the consensus analyst forecast of 92 cents.
18;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-05-15T09:06:24Z;Australia probes claims over Google’s use of smartphone data;Competition watchdog to investigate Oracle reports of data harvesting to sell targeted ads;Australia’s competition watchdog said on Tuesday it was investigating Google over reports that it was harvesting vast amounts of personal data from Android smartphone users to sell targeted advertising. The probe followed information supplied by US software company Oracle, which reportedly told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) it believed Android devices transferred up to a gigabyte of data, including detailed location information, every month to Google.Mobile phone users paid for the data transfer in their monthly phone bills, according to reports in the Australian media. “The ACCC met with Oracle and is considering information it has provided about Google services,” said an ACCC spokeswoman. “We are exploring how much consumers know about the use of location data and are working closely with the privacy commissioner.” The investigation was part of a wider inquiry by Australia’s competition watchdog into the market power of Google, Facebook and other digital platforms and how this was affecting the advertising and media industries. It came as global regulators stepped up scrutiny of technology giants, whose power and influence was highlighted in the 2016 US presidential election. The report, first published by The Australian newspaper, said smartphones and tablets running Google’s Android operating system continued to track a user’s exact location even when location services were turned off and the phone had no sim card, according to the Oracle presentation. It also showed how Android devices transmitted the addresses of mobile phone towers, WiFi stations and bluetooth networks back to Google servers. Barometric sensors embedded into android handsets were able to inform Google on which floor of a building a user was on, said Oracle.Google argued that tracking of data by the company was done with the permission of users, who could see what data were collected and how it was used. In a statement the company said users could control their data and were free to disable Google’s location service, adding that the data sent back to Google’s servers was anonymised. It accused Oracle of not sticking to the facts. “Like many of Oracle’s corporate tactics, this presentation is sleight of hand, not facts, and given that Oracle markets itself as the world’s biggest data broker, they know it,” said Google. Oracle said it did not have a comment at this time and had not published the presentation that it provided to the ACCC. Rod Sims, ACCC chairman, told The Australian he found the Oracle presentation interesting and the watchdog was “certainly going to follow up”. Mark Taylor, a legal expert at University of Melbourne, said it was not just a question of whether users signed a policy when they took out a contract, giving Google permission to collect data. “If consumers don’t know how data will be used once it has been collected, and don’t realise the cost implications for their data plans, then there is a question to be answered about whether any permission is adequately informed,” he said.
19;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-05-14T12:31:58Z;Digital-keen customers put airport cyber security at risk;A report says the more seamless the experience, the bigger the danger;Air passengers’ growing desire for a seamless digital experience is putting airports at greater risk of cyber attack, a new study has found.The report from PA Consulting, Overcome the Silent Threat, said that a “hyper-connected model” where passengers in airports wanted fast internet and digital engagement with airlines and retailers brought “a larger attack surface for cyber criminals to exploit”.There were 1,000 cyber attacks each month on aviation systems in 2016, according to the European Aviation Safety Agency.Last year, Latam Airlines and Ukraine’s Boryspil airport were indiscriminately hit by ransomware, and in 2016 Vietnam Airlines had to carry out its operations at airports by hand after hackers took down its website.David Oliver, global travel security lead at PA, said: “There’s a steady trend of the customer being more demanding, expecting more and more connectivity and a more and more seamless experience and that puts the pressure on the airports to innovate . . . and integrate things in a way they wouldn’t have done previously.”John Abel, senior business director at tech company Oracle, which provides cyber security services to the airline industry, said customers were creating “billions of data points” and this made securing systems harder: “Every connected device is increasing the amount of data we have to look at, so a human looking at the data can’t do it any more.”In January, Munich airport opened an information security hub, bringing together the airport owner’s IT specialists with European aviation experts to develop strategies and approaches to defending against cyber attacks.The PA report said developments such as smart boarding gates and biometric immigration controls increased speed and reliability but were “less mature” and “could also expose airports to new risks and unknown threats”.It also identified other weak points, such as replacing humans giving pilots clearance to take off with digital instructions instead: a pilot could identify a suspicious voice command but perhaps not a message from a malicious source. “This will further increase the opportunities for cyber-terrorism activities through the issuance of false clearance messages,” the report said.Aircraft now regularly broadcast their movements on the ADS-B system, and anyone with “an inexpensive receiver” could track their exact position. It is “a significant new security risk to airport operators”, said the report, which looked at four unnamed global airports.The complex interaction of several data systems used by airports, including connections with other databases, increased risks, too. These “external vulnerabilities, third-party companies, may mean security is not in your control”, said Mr Abel.Mr Oliver said he was surprised that cyber security was not taken as seriously as physical or personal security: “Cyber is mainstream in that it’s on the risk register at executive level but it wasn’t mainstream with the same priority as the physical was.”
20;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-03-28T01:12:09Z;Software industry on watch for Google court battle with Oracle;Long-running intellectual property case likely to reach US Supreme Court;Google has indicated it is planning an appeal to the Supreme Court, after losing the latest round of a long-running intellectual property battle against Oracle that could have far-reaching implications for the software industry.The appeals court for the federal circuit, which hears patent cases, ruled on Tuesday that Google was not covered by the “fair use” protections under copyright law when it used some of Oracle’s IP as the foundation for its Android operating system.Fair use is designed to allow use of protected material under limited conditions. But the judges decided that Google did not meet all of the requirements, such as coming up with a “transformative” use for the technology. The case was also referred back to a lower court to consider Oracle’s request for $8.8bn in damages.The importance of the case and the unusualness of the rulings it has led to raise the chance that the highest US court will take it up, according to legal experts. That would set up a final showdown in one of Silicon Valley’s most bitter corporate feuds, which has run since 2010.Tyler Ochoa, a law professor at Santa Clara University, said the judges’ decision to reverse a lower court was an “extraordinary” intervention after they had earlier sent the case back to the same court for consideration of the fair use issue. That raised the question of whether juries or appellate courts were the best judges of how to apply fair use principles, and could encourage the Supreme Court to get involved, he said.Google said it was “disappointed” by the decision and warned that it could make “apps and online services more expensive for users”. It added: “We are considering our options.”For a very, very long time, independent software developers have been able to license their software to run on a number of software platformsMany in the software industry have warned that victory for Oracle could upset a delicate balance, under which companies are able to write applications for dominant software platforms without needing permission from the companies that control them. That could give platform owners more power to charge for access.However, Dorian Daley, Oracle’s general counsel, rejected the claim, and said open source licence agreements had been widely used to support software ecosystems that were open to small developers.“I fundamentally disagree with it,” she said. “The fact of the matter is, for a very, very long time, independent software developers have been able to license their software to run on a number of software platforms.”By using aspects of Oracle’s Java programming framework without seeking a licence, she said, Google had broken with that practice.If Tuesday’s decision stands, Oracle executives indicated that they would seek an agreement with Google that could break open the company’s Play store, which carries apps that run on the Android operating system.Any future terms for Google to use Oracle’s IP would require it to make Android apps that follow the Java principle of “write once, run anywhere”, said Matthew Sarboraria, associate general counsel. That could force Google to allow the apps to run on any operating system, undoing the tight link between Android devices and the Play store.The legal dispute raises the same issues that the Supreme Court deadlocked on in a 1996 case, said Mr Ochoa, increasing the likelihood the court would want to consider the latest case.Michael Keyes, a partner at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney, said the higher court may decide to take the case because fair use is “an integral piece of the puzzle in just about every copyright case”.He also pointed out that Google had been one of the parties in the last significant legal US appeals court ruling: a 2015 decision involving Google Books that went in its favour. The fact that the two cases, before different courts, led to completely different outcomes could also prompt the Supreme Court to take up the case, he said.
21;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-03-27T16:33:53Z;Oracle wins key round in long-running Google fight;Implications for software developers in court ruling over ‘fair use’ of intellectual property;Oracle has scored what could be a key victory in an eight-year legal tussle with Google, as a court case with far-reaching implications for other software developers moves towards a conclusion.A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled on Tuesday that Google was not covered by the “fair use” protections under copyright law when it used some of Oracle’s intellectual property as the foundation for its Android operating system.Fair use is designed to allow use of protected material under limited conditions. But the judges decided that Google did not meet all of the requirements, such as coming up with a “transformative” use for the technology. The case was referred back to a lower court to consider Oracle’s request for $8.8bn in damages.It not immediately clear whether Google would seek to take the case to the Supreme Court. Google said in a statement: “We are disappointed the court reversed the jury finding that Java is open and free for everyone. This type of ruling will make apps and online services more expensive for users. We are considering our options.”Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley said that the decision “upholds fundamental principles of copyright law and makes clear that Google violated the law. This decision protects creators and consumers from the unlawful abuse of their rights.”Many in the software industry have warned that victory for Oracle could upset a delicate balance, under which companies are able to write applications for dominant software platforms without needing permission from the companies that control them.The appeals court had already sided with Oracle at an early stage in the legal saga, ruling that the company’s Java software framework was covered by copyright law. The case was sent back to a lower court, where Google succeeded in a claim that it was covered by the fair use defence in 2016, setting up the latest showdown.
22;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-03-19T20:34:10Z;Oracle’s mixed earnings brightened by the cloud;;Sales from its growing cloud business continued to power Oracle’s latest quarterly revenue jump. However shares fell in after market trading after its net earnings were wiped out by a massive charge related to US tax reform.The US business-software company on Monday reported a 6 per cent year-over-year increase in revenue to $9.8bn for the three months ending February 28 — its third fiscal quarter of 2018 — in line with what analysts had been expecting, according to Thomson Reuters data.A $6.9bn charge related to tax reform wiped out its reported profits to leave it with a $4bn net loss for the quarter, or 98 cents a share. Adjusting for special items, income came in 21 per cent higher from a year ago to $3.5bn, or 83 cents a share, compared to the $3.01bn, or 72 cents, that Wall Street was looking for.Total cloud revenue for the quarter rose 32 per cent to $1.6bn, coming in a hair over the $1.58bn that analysts on average were expecting, according to Factset. While it didn’t blow Wall Street away, it underscored the steady progress Oracle has been making in this closely watched segment.Oracle chief executive Safra Catz said the earnings put the company solidly on track to achieve the double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for fiscal 2018 that it had predicted last year, with non-GAAP earnings per share up 20 per cent in this past quarter.“At this point, I feel quite confident that we will comfortably deliver on my original forecast of double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth for FY18.”The mixed bag of earnings left Oracle shares down 3 per cent in after-hours trading. After advancing 22.9 per cent in 2017, they are up 9.17 per cent so far this year.
23;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2018-01-14T15:42:04Z;The rise of the superstar company;In the corporate economy, it is not gender or race that matters, but class;"It seems inevitable that Oprah Winfrey, America’s empathiser-in-chief, would emerge as the Democratic dream of a candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2020. As an African-American woman, she speaks to any number of interest groups and political issues around identity, from #MeToo  to Black Lives Matter. But as the most popular all-round female media star in the US over the past several decades, with a television, movie and magazine empire, she also talks to the middle. Oprah is, like our current president, a global brand, which is telling. We are living in a superstar economy in which the top individuals, companies and even geographic regions command hugely disproportionate power, wealth and attention. Since the late 1990s, we’ve seen the rise of the superstar company. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, three industries — tech, finance, and healthcare and pharma — have seen their share of profits nearly triple since then, to about 45 per cent of all corporate profits in the US (the concentration in these industries is also increasing, albeit to a lesser extent in other rich countries). Yet increasingly in the US, this isn’t reflected just in the intellectual property-rich sectors, but throughout the entire economy. As a recent Brookings Institution paper explained, over the past two decades, more than 75 per cent of US industries have seen an increase in concentration of both wealth and influence. If you compare the numbers with the post-second world war period, when US growth was strongest, the contrast is striking. In 1954, the top 60 companies accounted for less than 20 per cent of US GDP. Today, the top 20 companies make up more than 20 per cent. Why is this happening? One reason, of course, is global competition, which has put more pressure on US businesses and pushed companies away from the more equitable postwar pie sharing between workers, corporations and local communities. Another is the shift in antitrust law. It’s no accident that the changes to monopoly regulation advocated by federal judge Robert Bork spread in the 1980s when foreign competition was rising. The Bork ethos, which held that as long as consumer prices were declining, there was no competition problem, has prevented authorities from checking corporate concentration as much as they did both during the Gilded Era of the late 19th century and just after the second world war. It’s no accident that the changes to monopoly regulation overseen by federal judge Robert Bork happened in the 1980s when foreign competition was risingYet the largest and most powerful industries today don’t function like industries of the past. Their products are often cheap or free, so consumer prices should not be the measure of competition. Network effects allow the players that can grab the most market share quickly to dominate entire industries seemingly overnight (Amazon, for example, took 44 per cent of ecommerce sales in the US in 2017). Their huge cash hoards allow them to snap up potential competitors. Monsanto, the US agrochemical company, purchased more than 30 companies over the past decade; business software maker Oracle snapped up over 80; and Google more than 120. Nearly every other industry — from food and beverages, to banking, to packaged goods, to media — is merging in response, to gain the heft they need to have a chance of success against the largest tech players. It seems quite clear that the well-reported decline in start-ups and entrepreneurial zeal in the US has much to do with the concentration of power among a handful of rapacious players. Around superstar companies, there are clusters of superstar investors and workers. Note, in particular, the rise of “pass-through” corporations, which were given even more special tax preference under the Trump tax plan. Pass-through corporations are businesses that are taxed at the individual owner’s personal tax rate. They make up 50 per cent of all total US corporate income (twice the share than in 1980) and mostly represent people working in those intellectual property-rich areas such as tech, law and finance. They also represent about 40 per cent of the rise in income inequality recorded by academics such as Thomas Piketty. It’s no surprise that these clusters of economic power have led to the concentration of geographic power. A 2016 report by the Economic Innovation Group, revealed that 75 of America’s 3,000-plus counties make up 50 per cent of all new job growth*. It’s a trend that snowballs, as the most talented millennials are attracted to a handful of cities, driving up property prices and making it tougher for anyone who isn’t part of the superstar club to get a leg up on the socio-economic food chain. That’s why, as much as I love Oprah and the emotional contrast she presents to our current president, I’m not so sure I’d want her in the White House. Democrats spend a lot of time worrying about concentrations of power in race and gender. But at the risk of sounding like a Marxist, the real action is in class. I’d love to see our next president be someone who cares deeply about understanding and deconstructing the superstar economy, which is suffocating a more shared and sustainable economic recovery. I’m just not convinced a media billionaire is the person to do it. rana.foroohar@ft.com* This article has been amended to reflect Robert Bork’s judicial position, and to correct the reference to the number of counties producing job growth."
24;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Potential Buffett heirs named vice-chairmen of Berkshire;;Two candidates tipped to eventually succeed Warren Buffett as head of Berkshire Hathaway have been appointed as vice-chairmen of its board.Greg Abel, who runs the Omaha-based company’s energy division, and reinsurance chief Ajit Jain were both elevated to the board of directors at the sprawling US conglomerate and investment house, bringing the size of the board to 14 seats from 12.Mr Abel will become vice-chair for non-insurance operations, while Mr Jain will be vice-chair of the insurance business.Mr Buffett, the so-called ‘Oracle of Omaha’, will remain chairman, while his long-time partner Charlie Munger will retain his role as vice-chair. The duo “will continue in their existing positions, including being responsible for significant capital allocation decisions and investment activities,” Berkshire said in a statement.Succession talk has heated up over the past few years since Mr Buffett is 87 years old and Mr Munger is 94.In an interview with CNBC, the television news network, Mr Buffett said the decision was “part of a movement towards succession over time”, although he said “there’s nothing magic” about the timing of the announcement on Wednesday.The billionaire executive praised Messrs Abel and Jain, saying the two are “key figures at Berkshire”. “They’ve both got Berkshire in their blood, they know the company … so it’s very good for Berkshire and even better for me”, he said.He joked that when he brought up the idea in individual meetings with other directors, “the degree to which they jumped at the suggestion was alarming”.Mr Buffett is seen by many as one of the world’s leading investors and the transition plans for his insurance-to-rail conglomerate are closely watched on Wall Street.
25;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-12-18T13:15:23Z;Aconex/Oracle: brick by brick;Investors are right to remain unenthused by this small deal;Taking a short-cut is one way to win a race. On Monday, Oracle offered to pay A$1.6bn (US$1.2bn) for Aconex, an Australia-based specialist in cloud services for the construction industry, which generated revenues of $161m in the most recent year. That sales figure is modest, compared with Larry Ellison’s competition with Salesforce to reach $10bn of cloud revenues. Investors are right to remain unenthused by this small deal until it becomes clear Oracle’s revenues can jump without acquisitions.The Silicon Valley group is paying a 50 per cent premium over the undisturbed market price for Aconex, which has lost money in four of the past six years. Among its attractions are annualised revenue growth of 30 per cent in five years. The construction industry is playing catch-up in its adoption of digital tools.A minority of sales come from the increasingly competitive market in Europe and Africa, according to a study by analysts at RBC. A majority is generated by Australia, New Zealand and countries in Asia, where competition is lighter. Aconex has applied for approval to operate in the US, which would bolster its competitive position in this important market.Despite 44 per cent year-on-year growth in cloud revenues, which now account for 16 per cent of overall sales, investors are sceptical of Oracle’s plans. Its larger business of selling software licences has been declining and cloud services margins have shown no clear widening trend. The group acquired NetSuite for $9.3bn, which implied an enterprise value of near nine times revenues in 2016 — roughly in line with the Aconex offer. Construction cloud group Textura, similarly acquired last year, commanded a multiple of 7.6 times revenues.Aconex investors should welcome the transaction, which is still subject to their approval. Oracle shareholders must hope that, ultimately, builders, not M&A bankers, will help put the company’s cloud growth on a steady footing.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

26;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-12-18T01:49:04Z;Aconex surges after $1.2bn Oracle takeover offer;;Australian cloud-based solutions company Aconex jumped as much as 47 per cent on Monday after it received a $1.2bn takeover offer from Oracle.Aconex, which provides collaboration software to coordinate construction and engineering projects, said on Monday it had received a A$7.80 ($5.96) per share buyout offer from Oracle, valuing the company at A$1.6bn.The company said its board of directors unanimously recommended the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.Mike Sicilia, senior vice president and general manager for Oracle’s engineering global business unit, said:Delivering projects on time and on budget are the highest strategic imperatives for any engineering and construction organisation. With the addition of Aconex, we significantly advance our vision of offering the most comprehensive cloud-based project management solution for this $14 trillion industry.Aconex shares surged to a high of $7.655 on Monday, the highest level in 16 months. The S&P/ASX benchmark was 0.6 per cent higher.
27;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-12-14T22:08:59Z;Oracle shares slip as cloud growth misses but quarterly results top view;;Oracle’s stock dropped by around 4 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday, as its cloud revenues turned up just shy of Wall Street expectations even as quarterly revenues and earnings topped forecasts.The slip follows a solid 20 per cent gain over the past year as investors have grown increasingly confident that the US business software company’s transition to the cloud is starting to pay off.Safra Catz, co-chief executive, said the results reflected “the increasing scale and the gathering momentum” in the cloud business, which now accounts for more than 15 per cent of sales.Cloud revenues jumped 44 per cent to $1.52bn but were just shy of forecasts for $1.56bn according to a Thomson Reuters survey. That lifted Oracle’s overall growth to 6 per cent, with revenues of $9.6bn slightly ahead of an expected $9.52bn. Pro forma earnings per share climbed 14 per cent to 70 cents, two cents higher than forecast.The cloud business was once again boosted by cloud-based applications, which registered a 55 per cent revenue jump, to $1.1bn. By contrast, the cloud platform and infrastructure businesses — a market where Oracle has set its sights on market leader Amazon Web Services — revenues rose 21 per cent, to $396m.
28;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-11-07T22:15:16Z;Tech sector leads pullback for investment grade debt market;Bonds sold by Apple, Sprint, Oracle, AT&T and Qualcomm suffer from pressure on market;Bonds sold by some of the country’s largest technology, media and telecommunications companies have come under pressure this month, buffeted by sparring in US Congress over tax reform and as investors face a spate of multibillion-dollar new debt sales.Risk premiums for investment grade rated US technology and electronics companies have climbed 8 basis points since the start of last week, according to data from ICE BofAML Indices.Bonds sold by Apple, Sprint, Oracle, AT&T and Qualcomm have been among those under pressure, showing weakness that has not been mirrored by tech shares, which have climbed more than 1 per cent this month.Investors pointed to the Republican tax plan for some of the weakness, with a proposal to tax multinationals a potential weight on groups with large international operations. The tech sector generates more of its sales globally than any other sector.Merger talks between Disney and 21st Century Fox, as well as Broadcom’s spurned approach to take over Qualcomm and the end of negotiations between Sprint and T-Mobile, have also dragged on debt prices.Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance, said the rally in technology bonds this year coupled with possible changes to the tax code could be prompting some selling.“We are seeing a little bit of profit-taking as we go into year-end,” he said. “Spreads have had a great run.”Premiums, as measured by the spread over a benchmark US Treasury yield, on nearly 80 per cent of the most actively traded corporate bonds across the three sectors on Tuesday were wider for the month according to MarketAxess data.In contrast, roughly a fifth of issues in those sectors were tighter for November.“There are concerns that there will be more deals done and a lot of supply,” said Monica Erickson, a portfolio manager with asset manager DoubleLine Capital.Ms Erickson added that more borrowing could ensue if many of the largest tech companies brought their offshore cash home and fund acquisitions or share buybacks and dividends.A sense of market indigestion was highlighted by the second day performance of $7bn in bonds that had been sold by Apple on Monday.The deal attracted $16bn of investor orders. The iPhone maker’s new 10-year debt, the most actively traded corporate bond on Tuesday, changed hands with a spread of 77 basis points halfway through the trading day. That was up 5 basis points from the previous day.Oracle also tested investor appetite with a $10bn bond sale on Tuesday, in a deal it said the company said would fund general corporate purposes including share buybacks and dividends.That adds to the $261.5bn tech, media and telecom companies already have borrowed through US debt markets this year, an all-time high, according to Dealogic.“We’re at a time of year when there are a lot of issues [that] don’t have a lot of sponsorship,” added Matthew Freund, the chief investment officer of fixed income at Calamos. “It doesn’t feel like there’s a lot of real money buying.”
29;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-10-26T17:57:34Z;Gorillas in the mist await cloud players old and new;Traditional IT companies are struggling not to be picked off as laggards in new world;Sometimes, in the midst of a technology shift that takes years to play out, you have to stop the clock to see what is happening.Relative value has been seeping away from old-line IT companies as the cloud becomes a significant locus for computing. It is not a binary choice for tech buyers, who are facing massive sunk cost in their existing systems — as this week’s alliance of convenience between Google and Cisco Systems shows. But there is no disguising the direction of travel.Between them, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc, Cisco and VMware are now worth about $420bn — only 15 per cent more than this same group (before the HP break-up) was worth a decade ago.These companies, taken together, represent a large chunk of what, not so long ago, was thought of as the IT sector. The cloud has changed all that. To put it in perspective: their entire market capitalisation is equivalent to the extra value added over the past decade by Amazon, the leading cloud player.True, Amazon’s business still revolves mostly around ecommerce and logistics. But the solid profit margins of its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, are supporting the entire enterprise. The sheer scale of the addressable market — global IT spending should hit $3.5tn this year, according to Gartner — supports the analysts who argue that this will eventually become Amazon’s main business. That puts into perspective the messy transitional period the IT world is now in — and will continue to struggle through for a long time to come.When traditional IT companies first coined the term “hybrid cloud” — meaning the mixture of computing on their own premises and cloud-based services that is now the reality of life for most big consumers of IT — they were sounding a plea for continued relevance. But the pure cloud players are now making the same case, and building the relationships needed to work in this world. Amazon struck a deal with VMware last year, and now Google has allied itself with Cisco.The truth is, despite the tectonic shifts that seem to upend established tech companies with regularity, IT is a business with very long residuals. The heyday of the mainframe computer ended many years ago, but IBM is still reckoned to derive nearly half its profits from selling the machines, along with related software and services.However, that should not distract from where value — both in business and stock market terms — is shifting. The cloud is no longer just about buying extra storage capacity or processing capacity. Many of the most advanced development environments and higher level services for application developers are now being supplied from the cloud.With the partnership announced this week, Google will be creating many of those tools for Cisco’s customers. And machine learning is the not-so-secret weapon that will do much to drive the next round of cloud development: the chance for outside companies to plug into the artificial intelligence developed for the search giant’s own services could be a big draw in future.Some IT companies, at least in the stock market’s eyes, have already come through the Valley of Death represented by this transition. Microsoft has added $350bn in market value in the past 10 years. Oracle, after leading a wave of consolidation among traditional software companies, is finally getting a cloud lift that has added $120bn in market cap.The market value comparisons are pertinent. The IT sector has always gone through cycles, as periods of innovation give way to scrambles for consolidation. The winners are the ones best positioned when consolidation hits.After an incredible run as two of the winners from cloud-based software applications, Adobe and Salesforce are worth $85bn and $72bn respectively. That might make them look like survivors of the cloud transition. But it is all relative.When Microsoft toyed with buying Salesforce three years ago, for a reputed $60bn, it would have represented about 17 per cent of the larger company’s then-stock market value. Now that Microsoft has a much higher market cap, paying perhaps $80bn now would only represent 13 per cent of its present worth.The cloud is big enough to contain a multitude of software, services and infrastructure companies and more will emerge as it expands further. But there are already gorillas in the mist and — from the traditional IT players to the pure-play cloud services — no one can feel safe.richard.waters@ft.com
30;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-10-25T12:01:21Z;Google and Cisco hook up to boost cloud services;New alliance aimed at helping both tech groups catch up with Amazon and other rivals;Google and Cisco Systems have forged what until recently would have seemed an unlikely technology alliance, in the latest sign of the realignment caused by the rise of cloud computing.The relationship echoes a similar partnership established last year between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and data centre technology company VMware, as the old and new powers in IT find common ground.Companies such as Cisco, VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise toyed with building their own cloud computing businesses before deciding that they could not match the massive investment and scale of the industry leaders. Among the old guard of the IT industry, only IBM and Oracle are still trying to become significant cloud players.Google, meanwhile, was late to put serious resources behind its own cloud computing effort, leaving it behind industry leaders AWS and Microsoft’s Azure. That has left it in need of IT allies as “enterprise” customers — large corporations and governments — look to shift more of their computing from their own data centres to those of the giant cloud services.“Google needs Cisco because it doesn’t know anyone in the enterprise — Cisco has a huge salesforce that goes back years,” said Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester. The need to make up for lost time has left the internet company “a bit more desperate” than its bigger cloud rivals, making it more in need of a partnership with an established IT power, he added.Cisco, meanwhile, is at risk of being relegated to a supporting role as networking provider, rather than as a core supplier of the cloud infrastructure and services that are expected to consume a growing part of customers’ IT budgets. “Cisco’s relationships aren’t with the developers, they’re with the ‘plumbers’,” said Mr Bartoletti.By combining their different technologies, the companies said the alliance would enable them to offer the mixed computing environments companies are expected to maintain, as they shift more computing needs to the cloud while also continuing to run their existing IT facilities.“It lets customers do things at their own pace,” said Diane Greene, head of Google’s cloud division, and a founder of VMware.The companies said they hoped a big draw would be Google’s expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The technique, developed to improve its own services, has already been opened up to Google’s cloud customers, so they can use their own corporate data to train its systems.Cisco and Google said they were committing “significant” resources to the alliance, though they did not provide details. The two face a demanding timetable if they are to hit their target of getting test systems in the hands of customers in the first half of next year, said Mr Bartoletti.
31;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-10-06T00:49:38Z;Oracle: every cloud;Larry Ellison’s pay is falling, maybe;Larry Ellison has a prodigious appetite for pay. He owns 27 per cent of Oracle but gets a large remuneration package on top. Other tech royalty such as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg own smaller slices of their companies yet consider big bonuses infra dig.After a series of shareholder protests — the pay of co-chief executives Mark Hurd and Safra Catz has attracted criticism too — Oracle is embracing relative austerity.No longer will stock awards be made regardless of performance. The value of the package is falling by half too, at least by the software group’s calculations. Yes, options given to Mr Ellison, Mr Hurd and Ms Catz are still worth a lot at $103m each. But that is over five years and embodies an apparent 47 per cent drop on last year.The cut assumes Oracle has correctly assessed the probability of hitting targets. We do not know the assumptions. Past form suggests it would not be shocking if the $103m is an underestimate.At least there is a simple set of seven goals. First, the management aims to get the share price to $80, from about $49 now. To do that within five years requires appreciation of about 10 per cent a year. That gets one-seventh of the award. The other six tranches pay out on a combination of market capitalisation and operational goals.The bottom end of the market cap goals are soft. If Oracle cannot add $17bn of value to its $207bn market worth in five years there will be big problems. The top end is $100bn, which is about $73 on today’s shares.The operational goals are worthwhile in that they are all incentivising a move to the cloud, which Oracle must do to stave off foes such as Salesforce.Hit all the targets, hold the shares and the value of the award looks more like $500m each in five years. Shareholders might not begrudge that given the performance gains that will have been achieved. And it is more like the size of remuneration package that Mr Ellison has become accustomed to.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Is Larry Ellison worth every penny?
32;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-10-05T23:21:00Z;Oracle bows to shareholders by cutting Larry Ellison’s pay;Co-founder’s compensation halved and tied to performance after 5-year campaign;Oracle has bowed to years of shareholder unrest by halving the pay of co-founder Larry Ellison, who for years has been at or near the top of rankings of the highest-paid US business leaders.Beyond the pay cut, Mr Ellison also risks missing out on all but $1 a year in compensation over the next five years, unless the US database software company hits new performance and share price targets.The concessions mark a victory for the company’s biggest institutional investors, who have agitated against its pay arrangements for years. Oracle lost so-called “say on pay” votes five years running, as a majority of investors rejected its executive compensation arrangements. While making some changes to reduce pay and add more performance-based elements, it had not bowed until this year to the non-binding votes — a festering issue with Wall Street.The changes received a lukewarm reception from corporate governance experts. Charles Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware, questioned why Oracle had resisted its shareholders over the matter. “The pay of the top three executives at Oracle has been very high over the last few years,” added Kirk Hanson, head of the centre for applied ethics at Santa Clara University. He added that, while “say on pay” votes had been effective at drawing attention to excessive compensation, it was too soon to judge how the new Oracle arrangements would work in practice.Oracle said in a regulatory filing that unhappiness with executive pay had been the top issue shareholders raised in meetings with its independent directors, but that it had “positive feedback” on the new arrangements.Following the concessions, Oracle has valued a stock option package it has handed to Mr Ellison for the next five years at $103.7m, or $20.7m a year — a cut of 47 per cent from the stock grant he received before, and representing a 50 per cent fall in his overall pay.However, the company did not explain how it has valued the 17.5m options included in his package, and the final value of the stock could end up being much higher if Oracle hits the targets in the compensation plan. Oracle has also not guaranteed that Mr Ellison and other top executives will not get more stock awards during the next five years, though it said it did not “expect” any further grants.Investor unhappiness rose after Mr Ellison, who is currently chief technology officer, received compensation worth $94.6m in 2012. His pay packages were enough to take him to the top of the league table of best-paid executives, earning him about $650m over the past decade.Even that, though, pales in comparison to his 28 per cent stake in Oracle, which is currently worth $57.2bn and makes him the fifth richest person in the world, according to Forbes.The fact that Oracle has handed Mr Ellison generous stock incentives, even though he benefits more than anyone from improvements in its stock price, has been one of the sticking points for opponents. “The question is, do they need to give him any more stock to incent him? The answer is no,” said Prof Elson.The new pay arrangements also apply to Oracle’s co-chief executives: Safra Catz, a former investment banker, and Mark Hurd, a former head of Hewlett-Packard.The ultimate value of the pay packages will depend on how far Oracle’s share price advances in the next five years, as well as on the growth and profitability of its cloud business. The full amount will only pay out if Oracle’s shares hit $80, or 64 per cent above their current level.Details of the new executive pay arrangement were contained in a regulatory filing made last week, but had not previously been reported.
33;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-09-28T03:00:28Z;Corporate America’s patchy disclosure on cash piles raises risks;US groups enjoy latitude on what must be revealed about cash and securities holdings;It is not just the iPhone that is supporting Apple’s almost $800bn valuation. The company has hundreds of billions of dollars of cash and other investments, eclipsing that of many established asset managers.However, in contrast to the disclosure by investment firms, Apple offers investors only the broadest brush strokes of what the money is actually in. While the tech company has the largest pile of financial assets by a US non-financial group, the lack of detail is typical of the 30 large US-domiciled companies analysed by the FT that hold more than $10bn of cash and other securities on their balance sheets.The latitude US regulators give corporate America on what they need to divulge is creating risks, experts say, given the sheer scale of the cash and other investments companies have accumulated in recent years and the danger that holdings of financial assets are hit as the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy.“Patchy disclosure is a fundamental problem,” says Shivaram Rajgopal, the vice dean for research at Columbia Business School. “These are broad categories and you don’t know what is in there, you don’t know what the credit ratings are. And these are big numbers.”Collectively the 30 companies, which includes General Motors, Qualcomm and Pfizer, own nearly $900bn in US debt and equities, according to an FT analysis of filings with the SEC. They have a portfolio of more than $400bn of US corporate bonds, representing nearly 5 per cent of the outstanding market.The Financial Accounting Standards Board sets the guidelines for what is required under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has the authority to intervene if it wants more transparency on a topic. For example, companies must disclose an analysis of market risks, but they are under no obligation to identify individual securities they own.Indeed, by disclosing its separate holdings of foreign government bonds, asset-backed securities and the specific make up of its cash equivalents — including commercial paper, agencies and money market funds — Apple is, on a relative basis, among the more open about what is in its $262bn portfolio. Other companies, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, disclose far less.PepsiCo notes that it owns just under $13bn of debt securities as part of its portfolio, including $6.7bn of short-term investments that mature in less than one year. It does not divulge the asset classes it has invested in.Apple, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo declined to comment beyond their respective regulatory filings.Thomas Gilbert, a professor at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business, says the swelling in the cash and securities holdings have made it “very difficult for investors” to judge whether companies are properly valued given the limited information that is revealed.Although the investments are often thought of as safe as hard cash, they carry real risks and can materially affect a company’s quarterly results. Companies are obliged to assess their market risks as part of annual filings with the SEC, which often include projections of how shifts in interest rates could affect their portfolios. Some will discuss credit risk, duration, and even their exposure to counterparties and companies within their quarterly reports.Apple, for example, warned in its annual filing with the SEC last year that a one percentage point jump in interest rates would hand it a $4.9bn paper loss on its holdings. At Oracle the number is smaller, but still significant. The software group says it could suffer mark-to-market losses of nearly $350m if rates rise by half a percentage point, according to its last annual report with the SEC. Microsoft says it could lose more than $200m in a single day if there was an “adverse” market shock. Cisco estimates the value of its equity portfolio would drop by $171m if the stock market suffered a correction.Yet even these warnings remain broad and devoid of detail, experts argue. What commentary companies do give on their holdings gives investors little to chew on. Apple, like many companies, says its “investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer” and that the company “generally” requires its purchases to be rated investment grade.“I need information on what they are holding, what the riskiness of the assets are . . . is it a fair return for the risk they are taking, so I can evaluate the stock price,” says Mr Gilbert of University of Washington.These concerns have simmered as cash piles have climbed and financial markets have rallied to record levels. A growing list of money managers has raised red flags over low credit spreads, high stock and bond market valuations and the durability of the US economic expansion as it heads into its ninth year. And corporate treasurers have been burned before after diving into riskier asset classes.“We know in the Michael Milken junk bond era companies went deep into less conservative investments,” adds Neri Bukspan, a partner in EY’s financial accounting advisory practice. “In the financial crisis we knew companies invested in commercial mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage-backed securities that were rated triple A. Companies thought they were solid.”Pamela Marcogliese, a partner with law firm Cleary Gottlieb, adds that the number of companies disclosing counterparty risk soared after the financial crisis. But it is up to the company to determine whether that risk is material and requires disclosure.If there is little pressure on companies to disclose, Mr Rajgopal of Columbia Business School says the growth of passive, index-tracking investment is capping the clamour from shareholders to know more.“Here is the problem,” he says. “Who usually wants more disclosure? It’s equity analysts and equity analysis in today’s world is in trouble.”
34;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-09-25T19:42:14Z;Apple ditches Bing for Google search results in Siri;;"Apple has swapped Microsoft’s Bing for Google text search results inside its Siri virtual assistant, further embedding the world’s largest search engine into its iPhone operating system.
The move shows that while Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android are fierce rivals in the smartphone world, the two companies have struggled to reduce their interdependency.Apple first started to incorporate Bing into Siri in 2014, making Microsoft’s service the default search engine when Siri users asked certain questions or to show web search results. At the time, it was seen as a big win for Microsoft, which has long trailed behind Google in search results, especially in the US. It followed Apple’s ejection of Google Maps from iOS in 2012, after an initially disastrous attempt by the iPhone maker to embed its own maps service and reduce its reliance on Google services.However, Google has always remained the default search engine for queries typed into its Safari web browser, giving it a powerful position on hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads and Macs.It emerged last year in court filings related to an Oracle case that Google paid Apple $1bn in 2014 for that position and analysts at Bernstein have estimated the fee could rise to $3bn in the current financial year, or around 5 per cent of Apple’s total operating profits.Neither Apple nor Google would comment on the commercial arrangements behind the Siri integration, which began rolling out to customers on Monday.Apple presented the change, which also affects queries from within the iOS home screen and on its Mac desktop, as an effort to improve the consistency across its different services. And Bing will still provide image search results inside Siri while video queries will go through YouTube.“Switching to Google as the web search provider for Siri, Search within iOS and Spotlight on Mac will allow these services to have a consistent web search experience with the default in Safari,” Apple said in a statement, which was first reported by TechCrunch. “We have strong relationships with Google and Microsoft and remain committed to delivering the best user experience possible.”Google confirmed the tie-up but declined further comment."
35;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-09-20T04:02:52Z;Welcome to the school of the future;‘Oracle believes its staff will learn as much from the pupils as students will from the workers’;I had low expectations last month when I donned a hard hat for a tour of the Design Tech High School (d.tech): the first school built on a tech company campus. Once construction is finished, a three-year-old local public high school will move in and educate 500 pupils aged 14 to 18 on Oracle’s Silicon Valley site in a building paid for by the software maker.From “ed-tech” start-ups to billionaire philanthropists, many digital entrepreneurs are funding education projects in an attempt to better equip the next generation for a changed world. Technology is moving so fast that we don’t know what jobs will be available in the future but most agree that the current education system, designed in the 19th century, will not help students thrive in the 21st.The d.tech school is unique: students will spend their days in a tech company office park. From January, the high-schoolers will share a conference centre with Oracle staff. This is not an extended version of bring-your-child-to-work day: Oracle workers’ children will not be prioritised and, in fact, the school, which is free to attend, is trying to get permission to select students from poorer backgrounds.My experience of the company’s cloud application software — a monthly misery tackling its iExpenses process — had not particularly convinced me that Oracle had the potential to inspire a new generation. Nor did the building’s grey and glass façade make it seem a fun place to learn.But I entered to find a light-filled, flexible space, designed in collaboration with children, teachers and Oracle employees. I was impressed by how the building has creativity at its centre. Instead of a large lecture hall, there is a “design realisation garage”. The garage, so-called because all the best start-ups were founded in them, has a large floor for metalwork, woodwork and circuitry, while, upstairs, students can design and code.What intrigued me the most, however, was that Oracle believes its staff will learn just as much from the schoolkids as students will from the workers. Instead of finding the noisy teenagers a disturbance, Colleen Cassity, executive director of the Oracle Education Foundation, believes they could help disrupt working practices in a good way. “Instead of [our employees] going back to school, the school is coming to them,” she says.Oracle and the students are already working together to create an internship programme and the teens could even end up leading design challenges for the company. Eventually, Oracle wants to connect each of its campuses with a school.D.tech follows a theory pioneered by Stanford’s design school. The method focuses on solving problems and building empathy for your users, thinking always of how to design for their needs. Ken Montgomery, co-founder of d.tech, tells me that at Stanford, where he did his PhD, MBA students often start with “constraints in their head” and need to be shaken up to encourage “wild ideas”. Teaching high-schoolers, he has to do the opposite. “Working with kids, we have to get [them] to think about the constraints, because they believe everything is possible.” For example, the school did not agree to the kids’ wish to install a zip line and a rooftop pool on the campus.One example of balancing kid-like instincts with adult-like constraints is a wearables project that a group worked on at the high school. A 14-year-old girl presented a problem: her partially sighted grandmother couldn’t distinguish between denominations of dollar bills. Her team created a wearable device that scanned the notes for their underlying colour — and played a different song for each one. Now her grandmother can hear the Mario Kart tune every time she grasps a $5 note.As an employee, I’m unsure that I would want my serene shuttle to work turned into a school bus. But as an Oracle user, I would welcome a kid’s fresh approach. Perhaps the company can ease the tedium of filing expenses by playing a Mario Kart tune each time I enter a claim for a taxi ride. I can only hope Oracle’s adult minds will be opened by the children on campus. Hannah Kuchler is the FT’s San Francisco correspondentIllustrated by Christopher de Lorenzo
36;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-09-18T17:54:16Z;John Chambers to step down at Cisco Systems;Executive chairman who led network giant from mid-90s will depart at end of year;John Chambers, one of the towering figures from the tech boom of the late-1990s, is to step down as chairman of networking equipment company Cisco Systems, the company said on Monday.His departure comes a decade and a half after Cisco enjoyed a brief spell as the world’s most valuable company, and comes as the company is going through an upheaval in its business caused by the rise of cloud computing.Mr Chambers stepped back as chief executive two years ago, handing the reins to former head of sales Chuck Robbins, but stayed on as executive chairman and has remained a prominent face internationally for the company.“It needed a different type of person to lead it through this transition,” said Glenn O’Donnell, an IT analyst at Forrester Research*. “They needed someone to come in and really shake things up. It hasn’t made [Mr Robbins] popular with a lot of people inside Cisco.”Mr O’Donnell said Mr Chambers had picked the right moment to cede control, rather than risk the company’s future by staying on too long — a fate that befell Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, the Boston-based company that foundered on the transition from the mini-computing to PC eras.With an affable salesman’s charm, pronounced West Virginia accent and expansive enthusiasm, the voluble Mr Chambers rode the first wave of the internet boom to overtake the world’s biggest communications equipment makers. The routers and other IP-based gear it produced ended up swallowing most of the voice calls and other traffic that flowed over other networks, undermining giant telecoms equipment companies of the era, such as Nortel and Lucent.“Our competitors from 10 years and before are gone,” said Mr Chambers, 68, in an FT interview on Monday. Referring to constant talk in the tech world of successive start-ups that would turn into a “Cisco killer”, he said: “Nobody’s been able to get us.”Cisco emerged from a group of small IP networking companies in the mid-1990s, rising from $1.2bn in revenue when he took over to $48bn last year. “We got the market transitions right. We innovated at a pace other companies couldn’t,” Mr Chambers said.At one point during the boom, Cisco overtook Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable company, as its stock market value topped $600bn — a level that would still make it the third most valuable today, behind Apple and Google’s parent, Alphabet.There were concerns when he stepped down as chief executive that his full-time executive role would overshadow his successor. However, he said he had cut his role to half-time about a year ago, and insisted that the development of his “partnership” with Mr Robbins, who will take over as chairman in December, had been part of a well thought out plan.His departure at the end of the year will leave Larry Ellison of Oracle and Michael Dell as the only heads of leading US tech companies from the 1990s to still play an influential role in the industry.Mr Ellison, who has also handed over the chief executive responsibilities while still playing a central role in strategy, is steering Oracle through a major transition to the cloud. Mr Dell, meanwhile, bought back the PC company that bears his name in the largest buyout and has since turned it into one of the world’s biggest IT companies in terms of sales.A former computer salesman who got his start at IBM, Mr Chambers joined Cisco in 1990 and rose to become chief executive in 1995.* This article has been amended to reflect that Glenn O’Donnell is an IT analyst at Forrester Research
37;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Oracle slides after guidance fails to impress;Wall Street powers to new highs as S&P 500 breaks 2,500 for first time;Oracle shares tumbled by the most in nearly two years on Friday after the business software company issued second-quarter guidance that failed to impress investors.The stock, which hit a record high of $51.88 last week, was the biggest loser on the S&P 500. It dropped 7.7 per cent to $48.74, the biggest one-day decline since November 2015.The sell-off came after Oracle executives said in an earnings call with analysts late on Thursday that fiscal second-quarter revenue would grow at between 2 and 4 per cent, compared with analysts’ consensus of 5.5 per cent.The outlook overshadowed Oracle’s better than expected results for the fiscal first quarter.For the three months to end of August, overall revenues rose 7 per cent to $9.2bn, compared with expectations of $9bn. Pro-forma earnings per share of 62 cents were up 12 per cent and 2 cents ahead of most analysts’ predictions.The latest figures were buoyed by a 51 per cent jump in cloud revenues, to $1.5bn. Thanks in part to the last year’s acquisition of NetSuite, cloud applications revenue rose 62 per cent, to $1.067bn, while the platform and infrastructure businesses were up 28 per cent.Before Friday’s sell-off, Oracle shares had already risen by 37 per cent this year, thanks to signs that the growth in cloud sales was finally starting to more than make up for declining sales of traditional software.Revenue from new software licences — once the key indicator of the underlying health of the company — fell 6 per cent in the latest period, to $966m.Analysts at Drexel Hamilton said in a note to clients that any weakness in the stock on Friday would be a buying opportunity, arguing that the toughest parts to Oracle’s transition from a conventional software business to web-based services were largely over.“Although Oracle’s transition to the cloud has proven to be an arduous journey over the past three-plus years, we believe the worst is over and we believe last night’s results provide further support that the company is heading in the right direction,” said analyst Brian White, who maintained his $62 price target on the company.Elsewhere, Blue Apron, which has failed to close above its $10 IPO price since it went public at the end of June, enjoyed a rare day of respite from the selling.Shares in the meal kit delivery company rose 7.3 per cent to $6.06 after analysts at Canaccord Genuity reiterated its buy rating and $11 price target on the company.Despite Blue Apron being one of the worst-performing IPOs this year, amid investor concerns over competition from Amazon and the company’s own high operating costs, Canaccord argued the steps the company was taking in revamping its products would significantly improve customer retention and order frequency.In the wider market, investors shrugged off tepid US economic data and the latest sabre-rattling by North Korea to push the three main stock indices to new highs.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to cross 2,500 for the first time, powered by gains in the telecoms, financials, industrials and technology sectors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has now set four straight closing records in a row, as it gained 0.3 per cent to 22,268. The Nasdaq Composite, rose 0.3 per cent to 6,448.
38;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-09-14T20:44:51Z;Oracle beats earnings expectations with a boost from cloud business;;Oracle has rewarded Wall Street’s growing confidence in the growth potential of its cloud software business, turning in quarterly revenue and earnings numbers that topped market expectations after the market closed on Thursday.The latest figures were buoyed by a 51 per cent jump in cloud revenues, to $1.5bn. Thanks in part to the last year’s acquisition of NetSuite, cloud applications revenue rose 62 per cent, to $1.067bn, while the platform and infrastructure businesses were up 28 per cent.The US business-software company’s shares had already risen by 37 per cent this year ahead of the earnings announcement, thanks to signs that the growth in cloud sales was finally starting to more than make up for declining sales of traditional software. Revenue from new software licences – once the key indicator of the underlying health of the company – fell 6 per cent in the latest period, to $966m.Oracle’s shares climbed nearly 2 per cent higher in after-market trading ahead of an analyst call to discuss the numbers. Overall revenues for the quarter — the first of Oracle’s fiscal year — rose 7 per cent to $9.2bn, compared to expectations of $9bn. Pro-forma earnings per share of 62 cents were up 12 per cent, and 2 cents ahead of most analysts’ predictions.While shares climbed nearly 2 per cent higher in after-market trading immediately after the results were released, they dropped 4 per cent as executives discussed their outlook for the second quarter. Oracle executives said they were looking for total year-on-year revenue growth of 2 to 4 per cent, adjusted earnings per share of 64 to 68 cents and cloud revenue growth between 39 and 43 per cent.

But there was an uptick in entries and exits from the list around the time of the crisis, as markets went through tumultuous changes and the value of even quite stable businesses gyrated.Still, a small group of billionaires in Forbes’ top 10 in 2000 remains on the list today. Microsoft founder Bill Gates continues to top the list, while Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Larry Ellison of Oracle also make the cut. Members of the Walton family behind US retail giant Walmart — while not in the top 10 this year — have maintained spots in the top 20. Carlos Slim of Mexico’s América Móvil and Amancio Ortega, the founder of Inditex, which owns the Zara retail chain, have also become fixtures in the elite list in recent years.Meanwhile, technology has re-emerged as the most highly represented industry in the top 10, following the swift rises of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. Mr Bezos even briefly overtook Mr Gates as the richest man in the world last month.
40;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-07-19T15:14:28Z;Republicans shift gaze to US groups’ $1tn in offshore cash;America’s technology behemoths are at the centre of a debate over US tax reform;Corporate cash piles are increasingly concentrated at a few dozen big companies, making them big potential winners if there is a generous tax break for repatriation as Republicans shift their gaze away from healthcare.As of end-2016, roughly $1tn of cash was held overseas by 50 US companies, with Apple, Microsoft, Google-owner Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle accounting for $512bn of the figure, according to rating agency Moody’s.That puts the technology behemoths at the centre of a debate on how to tax profits earned abroad, with the combined overseas cash levels at the five groups more than triple 2010 levels.The issue will be one of the most charged in the debate over US tax reform, which Republicans are beginning to revive after the collapse of efforts to overhaul American healthcare.The accumulation of offshore earnings is seen by some as proof that the American tax code makes the US a less attractive place to invest, and by others as a betrayal of their home country by US companies.The Trump administration has advocated for a 10 per cent tax on offshore earnings to boost government revenues. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, has called the current tax on repatriation of profits earned overseas — which he estimated at about 40 per cent when including state taxes — “crazy”.To avoid those taxes a host of companies, including the iPhone maker, have tapped bond markets to fund capital expenses, buy back shares and pay dividends to stockholders. That has fuelled an increase in debt alongside the increase in cash and cash-like instruments on the balance sheets of the largest US companies.There is unusually broad agreement among Democrats and Republicans that the right way to tackle the issue is to impose a one-off “deemed repatriation” tax on the earnings regardless of whether companies bring them home or not.“But given the divisive political climate in Washington, a one-off tax reduction on repatriated cash, much less a more comprehensive reform of US tax law, is looking increasingly unlikely this year,” said Moody’s analyst Richard Lane.Disputes have arisen quickly in Washington over where to set the level for the one-off tax. Disagreement is also rife over whether to tax cash and invested earnings differently and over how to handle future offshore income.Under US law offshore earnings are subject to the country’s 35 per cent corporate income tax rate, but in reality the tax is not levied unless the earnings are repatriated, giving companies an incentive to leave them overseas.Moody’s calculated overall cash levels rose 9 per cent from a year earlier to $1.84tn for the companies it rates in the US, excluding banks. While that figure has eased concerns over the extent of the pace of debt issuance — corporate bond sales are up 5 per cent from a year earlier, according to Dealogic — its concentration within 50 companies is nonetheless a point of scrutiny for investors.
41;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-06-26T20:02:03Z;Kiwis wrest America’s Cup from Oracle Team USA;Underdogs’ revolutionary ‘pedalling’ system powers New Zealand to sailing victory;"The America’s Cup has been won in emphatic style by New Zealand, the underdogs who ‘pedalled’ their way to victory in revolutionary style in the contest for the oldest trophy in international sport.Emirates Team New Zealand, led by skipper Glenn Ashby and helmsman Peter Burling, were on match point at 6-1 after two race victories on Sunday over software billionaire Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA, the two-time defending champions led by skipper Jimmy Spithill.Victory in the first race on Monday secured sailing’s most prestigious prize.Bill English, the New Zealand prime minister, congratulated the team on the win. “The crewmanship aboard Team NZ has been outstanding and the innovative use of pedal power to drive the hydraulics on the New Zealand boat has showcased Kiwi ingenuity to the world,” he said.In wresting the cup from the US, the Kiwis earned the right to decide where the next regatta is held, as well as its timing and the type of boats used.They will have to decide whether to stick with foiling catamarans, which skim 1m above the waves, or heed Patrizio Bertelli, the head of Italy’s Luna Rossa team, who favours a return to big monohulls and whose Italian syndicate could well be back in the next cup as the Kiwis’ challenger of record.The expectation is that the next event will be in Auckland, though it has been suggested that it could be held in Dubai, where main sponsors Emirates Airlines is based. A previous attempt at a Middle East staging at Ras Al Khaimah, UAE, came to nothing.Burling, at 26, is the youngest helmsman to lift the oldest trophy in international sport after steering the 50ft wing-sailed and foiling catamaran to clear wins in Bermuda’s Great Sound.The Kiwis won eight races but started with a point behind Oracle, who won the qualifying rounds.The result will go some way to erasing painful memories of the 2013 final for the sailing-mad island nation. Then, Team NZ, under Dean Barker, built up an 8-1 lead before Britain’s Ben Ainslie, a tactician for the Americans, was instrumental in helping Oracle rally to eight straight wins to complete one of the greatest comebacks in sport.The NZ team returned to the fray this summer with a revolutionary cycling system powering the boat’s hydraulics, enabling it to sail the entire course with both hulls ‘flying’ in consistently fast runs against all opposition.The Kiwi victory also defied a David and Goliath contrast in funding terms. The Kiwis were on a tight budget; many returning members of their team took pay cuts since 2013, while Oracle continued to enjoy Mr Ellison’s vast resources.The Kiwis’ team comprised New Zealanders with just one exception: Ashby, the skipper and wing trimmer, is Australian. Oracle’s team was as international as a Silicon Valley start-up. Of the nine sailors on Sunday, only one — grinder Cooper Dressler — is fully American, although the tactician Tom Slingsby and another grinder, Louis Sinclair, hold US passports.Team New Zealand first won the cup when Russell Coutts, today the chief executive of Oracle Team USA, led a five-race triumph in 1995 over Dennis Connor off San Diego. The Kiwis then lost to Switzerland’s Alinghi, where Sir Russell was again triumphant. The Kiwis then lost again to Alinghi in 2007.The cup, first raced round the Isle of Wight in 1851, has been won by only four nations. In the first race, despite starting last of 15 boats, the schooner America overtook the whole fleet and, as other craft fell away, finished several miles ahead of the remaining contenders.When Queen Victoria asked who came second, an aide replied: “Ma’am, there is no second.”Sailing is about hulls in the water / From Mark Peaker, The Peak, Hong Kong"
42;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-06-24T03:08:14Z;New Zealand pedals towards America’s Cup victory;Sailors use cycle power to control vessel in latest innovation in celebrated contest;Simon van Velthooven won a bronze medal in cycling at the London Olympics. This weekend the New Zealander hopes his pedalling power will propel him to glory in a different sport — the America’s Cup.Cycling has played an unexpected role in this year’s incarnation of the international sailing match, which resumes this weekend in Bermuda. Mr van Velthooven and the rest of the crew of Emirates Team New Zealand hold a 3-0 lead against Oracle Team USA and can win the contest this weekend.In the latest of the technical innovations that have peppered the 160-year history of the cup, New Zealand’s 50-ft catamaran uses pedal-powered hydraulics to control its towering fixed-wing mainsail — 24m high — and the daggerboards and foils that provide stability. Four crewmen provide the power from cycling stations in each hull instead of grinding winches by hand.The theory is simple: bigger leg muscles produce more power for longer. The benefits are “obvious”, says Dan Bernasconi, design co-ordinator for the New Zealand boat.Mr van Velthooven told the New York Times: “If you have half a brain and you know that your legs are stronger than your arms, why wouldn’t you give it a go?”Jimmy Spithill, the Oracle skipper, has questioned the potential benefit of using cycling, saying the fixed positions may cause extra wind resistance and prove problematic during manoeuvres such as tacking. “We looked at it hard, as I know all the teams did, and it’s a compromise. Nothing is straightforward,” he said. “I don’t think that decision will be the deciding factor.”A win for New Zealand, skippered by 26-year-old Peter Burling, in each of this weekend’s four races would end the contest. Oracle need to win seven races to keep the trophy in the hands of Larry Ellison, the American software billionaire.This year’s head-to-head challenge is a rematch of the 2013 incarnation of the event, when Team New Zealand reached match point at 8-1. Oracle then took eight straight victories on San Francisco Bay to retain the oldest trophy in international sports.The USA chose to contest the trophy in Bermuda — the first time the Americans have defended the world’s oldest sporting trophy outside of America.This year’s boats are smaller and so technically advanced that they can sail a whole race without their hulls touching the water. Mr Bernasconi uses the language of aviation to describe the challenge, saying winning the cup “is all about maintaining a stable flight on the entire racecourse”.The race has been transformed since John Cox Stevens, commodore of New York Yacht Club, brought America, a 31m schooner, across the Atlantic in 1851 and competed in the Royal Yacht Squadron’s race around the Isle of Wight in southern England. The prize was a trophy costing just £100.Mr Ellison is thought to have spent around $300m on Oracle’s 2013 win.
43;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-06-22T00:09:00Z;Oracle is first enterprise tech group to hit $200bn valuation;Ellison says cloud business is poised for ‘hyper-growth’;Oracle’s stock market value jumped above $200bn on Wednesday for the first time since the tech bubble of the late 1990s, as Wall Street bet that the business software maker had finally turned the corner in its transition to cloud computing.The near-11 per cent after-market bounce made Oracle the only so-called enterprise technology company — one selling almost exclusively to big businesses and governments — to have broken through the $200bn barrier. By comparison, IBM’s market value has fallen by 16 per cent in the last four months, to $145bn, as investors have worried about its own attempt to remake its business for the era of cloud computing.Oracle’s stock price bounce underlined a swing in sentiment on Wall Street this year that had already seen the company gain more than 20 per cent, more than double the broader market.Co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said the company’s latest quarterly numbers, released after the market closed on Wednesday, showed Oracle was “well on our way to passing Salesforce.com” as the largest seller of cloud software. Led by former Oracle salesman Marc Benioff, Salesforce is still larger than Oracle based on its cloud revenues, but its revenue growth rate of 24 per cent in the latest quarter lagged behind the 58 per cent growth that Oracle recorded in its own cloud business.Mr Ellison predicted that the platform and infrastructure parts of Oracle’s cloud business would hit “hyper-growth” in the coming year, putting them on track to match the growth from cloud applications. The company’s shares were up by $4.87 in after-market trading, to $51.20.Oracle executives had taken to promising Wall Street in recent months that their company was finally ready to show results from its move from selling on-premise software to selling subscriptions to its cloud services. Wednesday’s earnings for the all-important fourth quarter of the company’s fiscal year went a long way to reinforcing confidence in their claims.The company reported a 3 per cent increase in total revenues, to $10.9bn, ahead of the average analyst forecast of $10.45bn. Pro forma earnings per share rose by 10 per cent to 89 cents, well ahead of the 78 cents most analysts had been expecting.The outperformance came on the back of a strong showing from Oracle’s software-as-a-service, or cloud applications, business. On a pro-forma basis, revenues from this business jumped 75 per cent, to more than $1bn. The gross profit margin from this business climbed from 54 per cent to 65 per cent and was projected to be “very close” to 80 per cent by the end of the current fiscal year, according to Safra Catz, co-chief executive.The platform-as-a-service business also did well as the company attracted new customers such as AT&T to its cloud-based database service. However, the gross profit margin from the this part of the business — which was combined with the cloud infrastructure business after a reporting adjustment — slipped as the company invested in new data centres to support future growth.Oracle also succeeded in slowing the erosion of its traditional on-premise licensing business in the latest quarter, to the end of May. Sales of new software licences declined by 5 per cent on the year, to $2.6bn, but that was much better than the 15 per cent drop Wall Street had been expecting.
44;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-06-21T20:34:07Z;Oracle’s revenue lifted by strong cloud growth;;If Oracle has taken to promising Wall Street recently that it has finally turned the corner in transitioning its business to the cloud, then quarterly earnings released on Wednesday went a long way to supporting those claims.The US business software maker’s shares jumped nearly 9 per cent in after-market trading as it reported a 3 per cent increase in total revenues to $10.9bn, ahead of the average analyst forecast of $10.45bn.Pro forma earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 89 cents, well ahead of the 78 cents most analysts had been expecting.The out-performance came on the back of a strong showing from Oracle’s software-as-a-service, or cloud applications, business. On a pro-forma basis, revenues from this business jumped 75 per cent to $1bn.The platform-as-a-service business also did well, as the company attracted new customers like AT&T to its cloud-based database service. That lifted total cloud revenues 58 per cent for the quarter.Oracle also succeeded in slowing the erosion of its traditional on-premise licensing business in the latest quarter, the all-important fourth quarter of its fiscal year, when it records its highest volume of new software sales. Sales of new software licences declined 5 per cent on the year to $2.6bn. That, however, was much better than the 15 per cent drop Wall Street had been expecting.In a statement ahead of an earnings call with analyst, Safra Catz, co-chief executive officer, said the numbers showed that “hyper-growth” in the cloud business was pushing up the company’s operating profit margins, and that the company expected its earnings-per-share growth to accelerate in the fiscal year that has just begun.
45;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-05-22T03:04:23Z;Challengers aim to foil Oracle Team USA in America’s Cup;In international sport’s oldest trophy, five high-tech boats are looking to overhaul Larry Ellison’s American team;Five teams of the world’s best sailors are challenging for the right to take on Larry Ellison’s America’s Cup defenders Oracle Team USA in 50ft catamarans ‘flying’ over waters off Bermuda on hydrofoils in a qualifying contest that starts this weekend, following a delay due to high winds.All six teams will be racing boats that can reach around 46 knots (53 mph or 85km/h), powered by a fixed wing-sail the height of a seven-storey building.The boats lift their twin hulls out of the water using foils and daggerboards, bladelike J- or L-shaped carbon fibre boards which slot through hulls to stabilise the vessel in contact with the water.Pushing a hull through water rather than over it creates drag, with resistance increasing with speed, so the foils skimming the surface allow the boat to move faster while using far less power. The boats can travel at three times the speed of the wind and in the right conditions can be sailed right around the course in 20-minute races entirely on their foils, manoeuvring through tacks and gybes without hulls making contact with the water.“The difference is like riding a bicycle, and then riding it without the stabilisers on,” said Andy Claughton, head of technical and engineering at British team Land Rover BAR.“We never see both hulls in contact with the water at any one time so little speed is lost in any manoeuvre, making the racing more like the monohull contests of old. The challenge is not so much trying to hit the top speed but maintaining and raising high average speeds throughout each race.”In recent years, match sailing at this level has become a high-tech enterprise as teams with budgets of around £100m battle for engineering advantage by applying techniques developed in areas like aviation and Formula One motor racing.The six boats are essentially identical, but can be tweaked within design rules so teams can gain advantages in their use of foils and daggerboards, rudder control systems, aerodynamics, and wing deployment.Innovations this 35th regatta include Emirates Team New Zealand using a pedal cycling system instead of arm grinders to power its hydraulics while the British team has 400 sensors on board to help optimise tactics and decision-making, coupled with video and data feeds that allow the team to operate a ‘virtual chase boat’ at its Portsmouth base.The action off Bermuda this summer represents the climax of a competition that started in Portsmouth two years ago.The Louis Vuitton America’s Cup Qualifiers run to June 3. These races are followed by the Challenger Playoffs, which determine the one team which will meet defenders Oracle in the final match. In that duel, the first team to seven victories lifts the cup.Land Rover BAR, skippered by Sir Ben Ainslie, is hoping to win back the Cup for Britain for the first time since the inaugural race of 1851.Only four nations in the history of the oldest trophy in international sport have succeeded in winning in more than 30 events over 166 years. American teams have won 28 times, but Australia II’s victory in 1983 broke the New York Yacht Club’s grip on the cup. It has since been won twice by teams from Switzerland and twice by teams from New Zealand.
46;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-04-27T17:02:38Z;US tax holiday will benefit tech shareholders not workers;Repatriated offshore cash likely to be used for buybacks and dividends;After years of lobbying from technology companies, the White House this week set the ball rolling for a tax holiday that would slash the cost of bringing home the mountain of cash that Silicon Valley has stranded in offshore accounts — though with scant detail on how it might work.President Donald Trump wants to twist the arms of US companies to make them invest more in growth at home, and there are no companies with greater financial wherewithal to invest than the tech giants. But if jobs are the objective, tapping foreign cash reserves is unlikely to produce the prize the White House is hoping for.For a start, the headline numbers overstate the amount of stranded cash that could be put to use. Tech groups are sitting on about half of the $1.3tn that US companies have lodged outside the country, according to Moody’s Investors Service. But much of that money has already, in effect, come home through the back door.Consider the five tech companies with the biggest foreign cash positions: Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle and Alphabet. Together, these companies have added $314bn to their offshore cash holdings in the past five years, bringing the total to $512bn.Over the same period they have also borrowed $218bn and then used the money in ways they could not have done with the offshore cash without paying tax. Put another way, this means they have found a release valve for 70 per cent of the foreign cash they generated in the period.It is not hard to find where the money went. The top five companies have paid out $350bn through stock repurchases and dividends in that period. So while shareholders cannot get their hands directly on foreign profits, that has not stopped a massive giveaway to investors.The drawback of this arrangement is that the money left sitting in overseas accounts continues to pile up at a steady rate and it earns a negligible return, while the matching debt has a cost. But at least the tech giants have been enjoying some US tax relief on their interest payments while they wait for a solution to this mismatch.The backdoor repatriation is just one of the factors that makes the tech offshore cash mountain less of a prize than it seems. A large slice of the cash has already been handed out, leaving a mountain of debt to be paid down.Another complication is that it is hard to see how the White House can use a tax holiday to nudge the big tech companies to ramp up employment in the US. Their hiring and investment has not been held back by a lack of liquidity. The debt financing has supplemented a powerful onshore cash flow that has supported an expansionist period for the largest tech companies, as they try to stake out territory in big new markets such as cloud computing.The five biggest holders of foreign cash spent $45bn on research and development last year, so they — unlike other large US companies — cannot be accused of under-investing in their businesses.To force investment, the White House could attach conditions to any cash that is returned under a temporary tax holiday. But that might make companies reluctant to bring their money back. During the last tax holiday for foreign cash, in 2004, less than 10 per cent of the money held offshore was repatriated, according to Moody’s. Even then, almost all the money that came back found its way into shareholders’ pockets through buybacks or other means, rather than being invested in expansion.There are other levers that politicians could use to try to force tech companies to plough more into their US businesses. Republicans in Congress are proposing a border tax that would put a levy on imports. That might tip the scales for a company such as Apple and encourage it to invest in more US manufacturing.But the White House tax plan announced on Wednesday did not mention a border tax. Tough talk about the end of globalisation and a trade war might spur Apple and others to invest in local production as a hedge. But it would take years to build an electronics supply chain in the US to match that in China, making this a poor response to short-term political risk.The coming White House photo op is easy to imagine. Tech executives will stand beside Mr Trump and talk about how releasing all that offshore money can bolster US growth. But it will be shareholders rather than workers who will be celebrating the most.

And the labour department accused Google this month of “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce”.The regulators filed a lawsuit against Palantir last year accusing it of accepting far fewer Asians than other job applicants. The company questioned the statistical validity of the labour department’s analysis and said it had singled out a small number of cases where it had received an unusually large number of applications from Asians. The company claims that people of Asian descent make up 35 per cent of its product engineers.In a statement on Tuesday, Palantir said it “disagreed” with the regulator’s allegations and continued to “stand by our employment record”. It added that it had settled “in order to focus on our work”.Google has also claimed that its own analysis shows that it has abolished any pay gap between men and women. For its part, Oracle claimed the labour department legal action was “politically motivated, based on false allegations, and wholly without merit”.
48;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2017-03-16T18:08:31Z;Intel and Oracle sense the road ahead in tech;Latest acquisitions show old tech titans are searching for success in new directions;How many of tech’s old guard will make it into the new world? This week Intel and Oracle made their attempts for long-term relevance (the term that tech companies strive for above all else). Intel’s PC and server chips, and Oracle’s database software, will churn out cash for years to come. But the future of tech has always been defined by architectural shifts in computing — things that go under vague terms like the cloud, the internet of things and (most recently) artificial intelligence — that bring new companies to the fore.To judge by their share prices, it looks like the writing has been on the wall. Intel’s stock has missed a powerful chip sector rally, while Oracle’s shares had gone nowhere in the past three years, until a rally this quarter. The leaking of relative stock market value to a new generation is a clear sign that investors are looking elsewhere for the companies that will define the next era of computing.Yet even though tech disruption sometimes seems to happen with lightning speed, shifts in computing architecture play out in slow motion. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman, has been talking about a coming shift of computing into the network for two decades. He may have ceded an early lead in cloud computing to Salesforce.com (started by a former Oracle protégé, Marc Benioff), but with the vast bulk of corporate IT budgets still tied to legacy technology, the battle has barely begun.It is tempting to see the sky-high price Intel paid this week for self-driving technology group Mobileye as the sort of desperate roll of the dice that companies make when they fear being left behind. After missing the smartphone boom, Intel clearly needs to stake out a place in the next big tech markets. The tech landscape for self-driving cars is quickly taking shape: Nvidia has been forging alliances to cement its processors as the most powerful “brains” for autonomous vehicles, while Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP and SoftBank’s purchase of ARM have positioned them to take a bigger slice of what is expected to be a rapidly expanding market for silicon in cars.It sounds extravagant for Intel to pay nearly 40 times revenue for Mobile, which provides just one component for the driverless cars of the future: the imaging technology that helps cars “see” their surroundings. But the company could turn out to be a key piece of the jigsaw for Intel, if it opens new supplier relationships in the automobile world, and if the Israeli company can turn its large market share in image-sensing into a fuller set of technologies for driverless vehicles.The real test will not be about technology nor strategy, but whether Intel can develop the skills and forge the alliances needed to compete in this new market. Carmakers are not like the computer manufacturers Intel has dealt with before, and the manufacturing prowess that has been one of its main competitive strengths will only take it so far in a market where success requires more than building faster processors.Oracle made what looked like a desperate gamble of its own recently with the $9bn purchase of NetSuite, a deal that appeared to be driven more by an urge to bulk up Oracle’s cloud revenues than a strong industrial logic.Delivering software and computer platforms as a service in the cloud requires a new approach, as well as a new business model. It takes time to prove that a company built around one way of selling technology can adapt its culture and processes — or that the new business will achieve the kind of scale and profit margin profile needed to sustain Oracle’s stock market valuation. An 8 per cent bounce in Oracle’s shares on Thursday after its latest earnings — taking this year’s rally to 21 per cent — is a sign that investors think it may finally have reached an inflection point.To Oracle’s advantage, there have been other examples of software companies making this switch. Adobe and, more recently, Microsoft have been through similar tortuous transitions and have emerged on the other side with a re-rating of their shares. Turning a supertanker still takes time, but a belief that the ship will actually respond can take hold remarkably quickly. Companies such as Intel and Oracle have been late to stake a more aggressive claim to a larger part of the new computing landscape. But there is still much to play for. The test for companies like these is unchanged: can they channel their formidable resources into competing against a different set of rivals — and how long will their shareholders stay patient?richard.waters@ft.com
49;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle: rallying cry;The software company has not proved it is a fast-growth cloud supremo;As Roger and Rafa prepared for their match at Indian Wells on Wednesday evening, Larry Ellison graciously stepped away from the tennis tournament, which he owns, to participate in the earnings call for Oracle, the software company, where he is executive chairman.Like the tennis stars, Oracle is in its 30s and trying to look younger. Known for its venerable database software, the company would rather talk about the “hyper growth” of its cloud business and how it can beat Amazon Web Services.There is a school of thought, perpetuated openly by Oracle’s nemesis at cloud pioneer Salesforce, that Oracle is full of hype rather than hyper growth. Certainly, overall revenue growth was not so spry, up only 2 per cent in the quarter to $9.2bn. Within that, revenues from cloud software and platforms grew faster than 70 per cent to more than $1bn for the first time — now meaningful. But the business that Mr Ellison likes to talk about most, the infrastructure-as-a-service cloud offering, which allows corporate customers to use a provider’s servers for computing, is barely a blip on the income statement. Its revenues were $178m in the quarter, advancing a reasonable but less than hyper 17 per cent year-on-year. It is hardly in the same league as AWS, whose revenues last quarter were 20 times bigger.Shareholders can disregard all the marketing blather around cloud and still appreciate the company. Its operating margin, though two points lower than last year, was a strong 32 per cent. Oracle increased the dividend by 27 per cent.But the stock rose more than 5 per cent after-hours, close to its post-dotcom bubble high. It is being priced more like a growth company. Oracle may be capable of more speed but that is not yet evident. Like Mr Federer and Mr Nadal, it still looks vulnerable to younger competitors in the next round.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The company’s shares were up 12 per cent since the start of the year, nearly double the broader market.Ms Catz’s comments came as the company reported earnings for the third fiscal quarter. They included a reassertion of the group’s forecast that its earnings per share will return to growth of at least 10 per cent next year, on a pro forma basis.The latest figures showed how Oracle’s rush to remake itself as a cloud software company has slowed slightly after a steady acceleration throughout 2016. Revenues for the quarter came in at $2.9bn, 2 per cent up from a year before but below forecasts of $2.95bn.However, the company’s shares still rose on Wednesday after it increased its dividend by 27 per cent and beat expectations for pro-forma earnings thanks to an increase in non-operating income.Revenue from its fastest-growing cloud activities, in platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service, rose 73 per cent in the latest quarter, to $1bn. That was a slight slowdown from the 81 per cent of the preceding three months, though it still reflected a big pick-up in cloud growth that has been apparent in recent quarters.Meanwhile, Oracle’s traditional software licensing business fell a further 16 per cent, to $1.4bn. Though less severe than the 20 per cent fall that worried investors in the previous quarter, it still highlighted a faster decline that set in last year. Investors are hoping for greater resilience from software licensing in coming quarters with the launch of a new version of Oracle’s database.Thanks partly to $189m in non-operating income, up from $65m the year before, Oracle was able to report a 5 per cent increase in net income for the three months to the end of February, to $2.2bn. Earnings per share rose four cents, to 55 cents.On the pro-forma basis Wall Street judges the company, earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 69 cents, compared to expectations of 62 cents.

The company’s shares were already up 12 per cent since the start of the year, nearly double the broader market.Revenue from its fastest-growing cloud activities, in platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service, rose by 73 per cent in the latest quarter, to $1bn.

52;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-12-29T17:01:57Z;Silicon Valley: giving away the farm;Tech company directors are often big shareholders, with mixed results;Silicon Valley boardrooms are as stuffed with equity as their corporate car parks are clogged with Teslas. At two-fifths of the top 150 US technology companies, directors own more than a tenth of the shares, according to a study by Fenwick & West, a California-based law firm. That is very different from the broader market: at 72 of the S&P 100 companies, directors hold less than 1 per cent of the equity.A large part of the gulf in ownership is that tech companies are generally younger, often with founders whose ownership has not been heavily diluted. This helps align their interests with other shareholders — to a point. It can also allow them to overwhelm dissent. 2016 has seen Facebook join Alphabet in introducing a third class of shares, allowing Mark Zuckerberg to retain control of the company even if his economic interest dwindles. Nor is it necessarily the case that an outsized stake is solely due to founding the company. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison’s stake has risen from 23 per cent to 27 per cent over 10 years (it was 39 per cent when the company went public in 1986). That is in part because the software company’s board has continued to pay its co-founder a lavish amount of options and shares.Perhaps more glaring among tech founders being awarded large chunks of stock in their own company is Nick Woodman of GoPro. In 2015, Mr Woodman counted as the best paid CEO in the US after receiving shares worth almost $300m — an unusual move for a company floating that same year (although shareholders were warned about the bumper payday in the IPO prospectus). One toadying analyst said it was “appropriate” for such a “special entrepreneur”. And, in a funny way, it was. With the company struggling and the shares plummeting, the unusual bonus is now worth $40m.Even if voting power is stacked against them, independent shareholders can demand change. Silicon Valley may be a bubble but there are few companies oblivious to outside opinion, expressed forcefully. After shareholder protests, Oracle’s board did cut Mr Ellison’s pay by a third to $41.5m this year. The repeated successes of Elliott Management, in particular, have shown that tech companies are not immune from activist assault. If performance falters, giving away ever-larger slices of a company looks especially egregious. Expect executives to get more heat in 2017 from their fellow shareholders.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
53;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-12-15T22:07:50Z;Oracle shares fall as cloud revenue growth fails to impress Wall Street;;Despite unveiling quarterly earnings largely on track with Wall Street’s expectations, Oracle shares dipped 2 per cent in after-hours trading after it unveiled flat year-on-year revenue growth despite continuing healthy growth in sales of its cloud products.The technology company on Thursday said that, during the three-month period ending November 30, revenues were relatively flat on a year-on-year basis at $9.03 bn, just a hair below the $9.11bn predicted by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Quarterly revenue from its cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (Iaas) crossed the $1bn threshold for the first time, at $1.1bn, but still accounted for just 12 per cent of its overall revenue.Those gains helped to offset year-on-year declines in its hardware products and support divisions, as well as new software licenses. The division accounting for 68 per cent of its revenue, on-premises software, meanwhile, dipped 4 per cent.Earnings per share came in at 48 cents on net income of $2.03bn, in line with Wall Street’s forecasts.Oracle has increasingly looked to the cloud to shore up declines in parts of its software and hardware divisions, although it is facing fierce competition from the likes of Amazon and Microsoft as the tech heavyweights battle for domination in the still-emerging market for those services.Oracle chief executive Safra Catz noted in a statement that this was the fourth straight quarter in which cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue had grown, adding: “As we get bigger in the cloud, we grow faster in the cloud.”It hopes to speed up its cloud revenue growth with its recent $9.3bn acquisition of cloud software company NetSuite, which the company hopes will add $1bn to cloud revenue as it attempts to become the first company to reach $10bn in revenue from the cloud business. While that share of its revenue grew more than 60 per cent during the most recent quarter, the $1.1bn is still well short of that mark.Oracle shares, which have increased 6.9 per cent from a year earlier, fell more than 2 per cent in after-hours trading following the earnings.
54;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Trump looks to reassure Silicon Valley chiefs at New York summit;Meeting comes as Tesla’s Musk and Uber’s Kalanick sign on to advise president-elect;Donald Trump told executives from Silicon Valley’s most prominent companies that he was “here to help you folks do well”, as he opened his first meeting with the technology industry since winning the US election.At Trump Tower in New York on Wednesday, Mr Trump told the chiefs of companies including Apple, Google and Amazon that he stood ready to do “anything we can” to help them, despite potential divisions with Silicon Valley over issues including encryption, imports and immigration.“We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation,” Mr Trump said, flanked by Mike Pence, who will be his vice-president, and Peter Thiel, the Facebook investor who is working on his transition team. “There’s nobody like you in the world.”He added: “We are going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.”Ahead of the meeting, the incoming administration announced that Elon Musk of Tesla Motors and SpaceX and Travis Kalanick of Uber have signed on as advisers to Mr Trump.The two chief executives’ decision to join the new administration’s business policy forum, alongside the meeting in Trump Tower, are the first signs of a thawing between the president-elect and a Silicon Valley tech establishment that has treated his rise with deep suspicion and wariness.The decision by leaders of the tech industry’s nine most valuable companies to accept the summons to Trump Tower has caused waves in Silicon Valley, where the views of Mr Trump and some of his cabinet picks on issues from immigration to LGBT rights have brought a backlash from the industry’s highly liberal workforce.In the past, Mr Trump has tackled Apple over its reliance on manufacturing outside the US and for its reluctance to aid the FBI’s attempt to break into an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos has also been singled out for criticism because he owns the Washington Post, whose coverage of his campaign Mr Trump disapproved of.Nonetheless, in Trump Tower on Wednesday, the president-elect called the assembled executives “a truly amazing group of people”. He said he was “very honoured by the bounce” in the stock market — “so right now everybody in this room has to like me, at least a little bit”.However, tech stocks have largely underperformed the S&P 500 since Mr Trump’s victory, with some, including Facebook and Amazon, trading lower.While most tech companies have declined to comment on the meeting, Mr Bezos struck a conciliatory note, saying it was “very productive”.“I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech — agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing — everywhere,” he said.Mr Bezos, IBM’s Ginni Rometty and other executives arrived through the main lobby of Mr Trump’s Fifth Avenue headquarters, declining to comment to reporters before the meeting. Tourists gathered along the marble walls hoping for a glimpse of the president-elect, as shoppers walked by with bags from Nike and the Lego store.Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, was the only CEO from the nine companies not scheduled to attend. His place was due to be filled by Sheryl Sandberg, the social networking company’s chief operating officer. Others on the invitation list included the chief executives of Microsoft, IBM, Cisco, Intel and Oracle.Mr Musk, the CEO of both electric carmaker Tesla and private space company SpaceX, as well as chairman of solar company SolarCity, has said that the impulse to build his business empire came from concern about climate change, an issue that the president-elect has scorned. During the campaign, the South Africa-born Mr Musk described Mr Trump as “not the right guy” to serve as president.Mr Kalanick, a Democrat who is said by a person close to him to have strong liberal leanings, has been more circumspect in public comments, though he joked more than a year ago that if Mr Trump were elected, he would move to China.However, both executives could bring important perspectives to a broad-based council that is meant to advise the incoming administration on issues such as productivity and job creation. Tesla and SpaceX have used high levels of automation to build successful manufacturing operations in the US.Uber, meanwhile, has provided jobs for an army of part-time drivers, even as it has jeopardised the more stable jobs of existing taxi drivers.It has also been the most aggressive of the US tech companies in bringing driverless car technology to the streets, signalling a threat to the jobs of Uber’s own informal workforce as well as millions of professional taxi and truck drivers.Mr Trump’s 18-strong business advisory group, which is first due to meet in February, already had one tech industry representative in the form of Ms Rometty, CEO of IBM, part of the east coast business establishment.
55;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-11-05T22:18:00Z;Oracle overcomes opposition to $9.3bn NetSuite acquisition;Deal will add almost $1bn to Oracle’s revenue from cloud software;Oracle has narrowly overcome opposition to its $9.3bn offer for cloud software company NetSuite after threatening to walk away if shareholders held out for a higher price.The US software company disclosed late on Friday that holders of nearly 56 per cent of NetSuite shares who were eligible to vote had chosen to take its offer, laying the groundwork for the deal to close on Monday.The deal will add nearly $1bn to Oracle’s revenues from cloud software, moving it closer to its goal of being the first tech company to reach $10bn in revenue from the cloud business. Its existing business grew 60 per cent in the latest quarter but still accounted for just under $1bn in revenues.Netsuite’s board had run into criticism from mutual fund group T Rowe Price, the company’s biggest outside shareholder with nearly 18 per cent of the stock, which argued the Oracle offer was too low. The investment firm pushed last week for the offer to be raised from the current $109 a share to $133.That overture was rejected by Oracle, which had already said it would walk away from the deal on November 4 if holders of fewer than 50 per cent of the shares eligible to vote on the deal backed its bid.The offer was complicated by the fact that Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder and chairman, is also Netsuite’s main shareholder, with nearly 40 per cent of the stock. To avoid charges of conflict of interest, Mr Ellison agreed that his shares would not count towards the NetSuite vote.T Rowe Price’s failure to force a higher price for NetSuite marks the second time this year it has come away empty-handed after questioning the price paid in a big tech acquisition. A court in Delaware backed its argument that PC entrepreneur Michael Dell had underpaid in 2013 to buy out the PC maker that bears his name, awarding shareholders who held out against the deal a 28 per cent higher price. However, the T Rowe Price found it had mistakenly voted in favour of the Dell offer and couldn’t collect on the payout, eventually paying $194m to its investors to make up for the error.
56;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Coupa Software prices IPO at top of range;;Coupa Software has priced its IPO at the top of its projected range in the latest sign of robust investor demand for technology offerings.The group sold 7.4m shares at $18 a piece, compared with its expected range of $16 – $18, which was raised on Tuesday from $14 – $16.At its maximum, assuming underwriters use a so-called greenshoe option that lets them sell an additional 1.1m shares, the deal will be valued at $153m, placing it among the biggest US tech offerings this year.The pricing came at a premium to the group’s latest financing round, when it sold shares at $16.72 each at a valuation of $1bn, averting the possibility of it under-shooting the mark it had achieved on the private market.The upbeat performance comes after Nutanix, a maker of software for cloud data centres, last week avoided a so-called “down” round, and then surged in its first two trading days.The strong investor demand for shares of the two unicorns, or tech groups that have achieved a private valuation of at least $1bn, comes as a positive sign for Silicon Valley venture capitalists.It has been a weak year for US listings, with new deal volume in the first nine months of the year notching the lowest level since 2009.While the biggest unicorns, like Airbnb, Uber and Snapchat, are unlikely to be swayed by the relatively small offerings, other groups are likely to take notice, analysts have said.Coupa is backed by venture capitalists, including Battery Ventures, as well as funds managed by T. Rowe Price.The California-based company provides a service that allows groups to manage their finances online through the cloud. It competes with offerings from more established rivals, like Oracle and Germany’s SAP.Coupa’s sales in the six months to July 31 were $60.3m, from $34.5m in the same period in 2015. Net loss was $24.3m, from $25.1m.Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Barclays are leading the deal, with RBC, JMP Securities and Raymond James also acting as underwriters.
57;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-09-23T04:21:44Z;Larry Ellison takes aim at Amazon Web Services;For once, Oracle’s co-founder picks fight in market where he is heavily outmatched;Larry Ellison has a new enemy. But for once, the Oracle co-founder has picked a fight in a market where Oracle is heavily outmatched — and Wall Street is scratching its head over whether he has just taken on one battle too many.Mr Ellison, renowned in the software industry for his mastery of competitive strategy, has frequently whipped up feuds against other companies to inspire his own staff and provide extra fuel for Oracle’s marketing machine. In recent years, targets have included German software maker SAP, along with cloud software companies Salesforce.com and Workday.At Oracle’s annual customer conference in San Francisco this week, he went a big step further, taking direct aim at Amazon Web Services, the clear leader in the market for selling cloud computing services to business customers.He unveiled a revamped Oracle service to take on AWS in its core market. Known as “infrastructure as a service”, or IaaS, this involves selling raw computing, storage and networking power so that companies can run their software over the internet, rather than in their own data centres. It is the base layer in the “stack” of cloud services, which also includes higher layers where Oracle has a stronger foothold: platform as a service (PaaS), or the range of services that support software applications, and software as a service (SaaS), the individual applications that run on top.In a note to investors, Morgan Stanley analysts noted Oracle’s deluge of marketing behind IaaS this week, but said they had not been able to “pick up any meaningful usage” of its services in this market before. What’s more, the company’s capital spending has been falling, leaving customers wondering whether it is serious about a business that is capital-intensive by nature, the analysts said.Oracle spent $1.2bn last year on new facilities and equipment, down 4 per cent from the year before and only one-quarter as much as Amazon’s capital investment budget.On Wednesday, Mr Ellison was clear about the reasons for his latest salvo: “We had no choice, if we wanted to move our customers [to the cloud].”Oracle’s cloud business has so far largely been built around selling its own SaaS applications, and the platform services to support these. Now, however, it is facing a far more important test: moving users of its core database software to the cloud.Speaking at Oracle’s annual analyst meeting, Mr Ellison spelt out the biggest problem his company faces if it does not become a force in IaaS: “If someone wants to bring their existing workloads into the Oracle cloud they can’t do it.” For instance, companies that run their business on SAP applications and Oracle’s database software can’t make the switch unless Oracle can sell them cloud infrastructure as well, he said.Though it lags behind Amazon, Oracle may not need to match it to be competitive. “It doesn’t have to be the best IaaS, it has to be ‘good enough’,” says Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner. The database business is an “anchor” that will pull other applications into Oracle’s cloud, she added, putting it in a strong position to hold on to most of its existing customers as they move towards the cloud.Despite this week’s marketing blitz, however, Oracle is still at the beginning of a long battle. It has hired developers from AWS and Microsoft to lead its IaaS revamp, but its service still barely matches those companies, says Ms Jeong. “They’re coming from very far behind,” she says. “It’s more the foundation for a future competitive offering.”The attempt to take on Amazon comes as Oracle’s overall cloud business has finally been showing signs of real traction this year. A decade after it began rewriting its applications software to run in the cloud, its SaaS and PaaS services have registered accelerating growth, with combined revenues jumping 77 per cent in the latest quarter.Though the cloud still only represents 11 per cent of Oracle’s overall sales, this has brought it to a tipping point. The cloud growth has now more than made up for recent declines in its traditional business of selling software licences, and overall revenues grew for the first time in five quarters.But by taking aim at Amazon, Mr Ellison has shone a light on a market where his company barely registers. Revenues from its IaaS operation grew only 6 per cent last year.In his attempt to move down into the infrastructure business, meanwhile, there is a model for Mr Ellison to follow. Microsoft once hoped to use PaaS as its entry point into the cloud. But after a slow start, Satya Nadella, then head of cloud services, pivoted into IaaS. That move has since propelled Microsoft into a clear number two position behind Amazon and helped elevate Mr Nadella into the software company’s top job two years ago.Mr Ellison drew another direct parallel with Microsoft on Wednesday. The growth of Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform owes much to its success in moving customers of its Office applications to the service, he said. Oracle, he added, now faced the same opportunity with its database customers: “I think Amazon has as much chance of getting the Oracle database workload as they have of getting the Microsoft Office workload,” the Oracle chairman said.
58;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-09-16T20:34:39Z;Intel shares climb on pick-up in PC demand;Chipmaker’s advance comes alongside sell-off in broader US stocks;Chipmakers were in focus on Friday after Intel unexpectedly raised its third-quarter revenue forecast and cited a pick-up in PC demand.The group, which has been trying to offset the long-term decline in its traditional PC market by focusing on higher growth areas such as cloud computing, said it now expected third-quarter revenue to come in at $15.6bn, plus or minus $300m.This is higher than its previous projection of $14.9bn, plus or minus $500m.The news sent Intel shares up by as much as 4.1 per cent. The stock later pared its gains and ended the day 3 per cent higher at $37.67 in New York.The PC market — which accounts for more than half of Intel’s sales — has been suffering a slow but steady decline in recent years as consumers increasingly migrate to tablets and mobile phones.Global PC shipments are expected to drop 7.3 per cent this year, after tumbling 10 per cent in 2015, according to market researcher IDC.Intel said in a statement that the expected increase in revenue was primarily driven by the “replenishment of PC supply chain inventory”. It added that it was “seeing some signs of improving PC demand”.The comments provided a boost to rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, which also depends heavily on the PC market.AMD shares, which have surged more than 222 per cent over the past 12 months on the back of persistent takeover rumours, gained another 0.6 per cent to $6.06.The advance in Intel came alongside a sell-off in the broader stock market. By the close, the S&P 500 had shed 0.4 per cent to 2,139.2, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 per cent to 18,123.8, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 5,244.6.Elsewhere, Oracle shares fell 4.8 per cent to $38.92 after the US business software company issued a downbeat earnings forecast for the current quarter, alongside weaker-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results.During its earnings call, the California-based company said it expected to earn between 59 cents to 62 cents a share in the current quarter, below Wall Street estimates for 65 cents.In its fiscal first quarter, the company said sales at its cloud software business continued to grow at a double-digit rate but that was not enough as overall revenues missed forecasts.Larry Ellison’s company, which was late to the game, agreed to buy cloud computing pioneer NetSuite for about $9.3bn this year as it has worked to catch up with rivals Microsoft and Amazon, which have significant operations around cloud computing.However, the California-based company said cloud revenue increased 59 per cent from a year ago to $969m in the three months ended in August and accounted for about 11 per cent of overall sales.Weak demand for its traditional hardware business though led to the company posting overall revenues of $8.6bn, up 2 per cent year-on-year but shy of estimates for $8.7bn.Net income rose to $1.8bn, or 43 cents a share, compared with $1.7bn, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 55 cents a share were shy of estimates for 58 cents.
59;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-09-15T23:58:01Z;Oracle shares dip after cut to earnings forecast;Software company cites effects of Brexit and higher US tax rate;Oracle sliced its earnings forecast for the current quarter, as the combined effects of Brexit and a higher US tax rate hit its short-term profit prospects.However, executives at the US software company insisted that recent progress in its belated transition to cloud computing was unaffected, and the company raised its forecasts for cloud revenue growth from the rest of its fiscal year.The earnings warning, along with weaker than expected profits and revenues for the three months to the end of August, wiped nearly 3 per cent off Oracle’s stock price in after-market trading.Wall Street has been cautious about the company’s ability to make the switch from its traditional, highly-profitable software licensing business to charging cloud subscriptions, though the sentiment among investors has improved in recent quarters as cloud growth has accelerated.In a conference call with analysts after announcing quarterly earnings on Thursday, Safra Catz, co-chief executive, said Oracle would see 6 cents shaved from its earnings per share in the current quarter, the second of its fiscal year, as a result of the tax and currency factors, as well as the costs of a recent debt issue. That would leave pro forma earnings per share at 58-60 cents, she added, which compares with a consensus Wall Street forecast of 65 cents.The fall in sterling following the UK’s vote to leave the EU wiped 1 per cent from profits and revenues in the latest period, Ms Catz said.Oracle blamed a skewed pattern of growth in its newer cloud business, which has seen the US market take off faster than elsewhere, for the tax hit.“This is the best bad news you could get,” said Mark Hurd, co-chief executive. “I hate to say we’ve over-executed, but that’s what it is.” Rising cloud bookings in Europe, which would flow into revenue in future periods, already demonstrate that the tax effect would reverse again, putting the company’s overall tax rate back to its historic range, Ms Catz added.This is the best bad news you could get. I hate to say we’ve over-executed, but that’s what it isMeanwhile, Oracle raised its revenue growth forecast for its core cloud business to 78-82 per cent in the current quarter, following higher than expected growth of 77 per cent in the latest period. While Wall Street has been encouraged by the company’s progress in the cloud, it still accounted for only 11 per cent of total revenues in the first quarter. By comparison, sales of new software licences, the company’s traditional business, fell 11 per cent in the period, stirring continuing worries about the overall impact of the transition.Overall, Oracle reported revenues of $8.6bn in the latest period, up 2 per cent from the year before. Pro forma earnings per share rose 4 per cent to 55 cents, below the 58 cents analysts had expected. Based on formal accounting rules, earnings rose 10 per cent, to 43 cents a share.

That fell shy of analysts estimates for $8.7bn.That came alongside profits that rose to $1.8bn, or 43 cents a share, compared with $1.7bn, or 40 cents a share, in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 55 cents a share were shy of estimates for 58 cents.Oracle chief executive Mark Hurd also said the company was on track to sell more than $2bn of annually recurring revenue in the so-called software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) markets.Larry Ellison’s company, which was late to the game, agreed to buy cloud computing pioneer NetSuite for about $9.3bn earlier this year as it has worked to catch up to rivals Microsoft and Amazon which have significant operations around cloud computing.Oracle shares, which have advanced nearly 12 per cent so far this year, were down more than 1 per cent in extended trading.
61;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-08-08T19:33:40Z;Oracle’s Micros payments unit breached by cyber hackers;System is used by hundreds of thousands of stores and hotels;Oracle has discovered a cyber security breach in its Micros payments system that is used by hundreds of thousands of stores and hotels across the world.The software company has sent letters to Micros customers asking them to change their passwords and any passwords used by customer services representatives.In the letter, Oracle said it had “addressed” the malicious code found in the payments system, and that all payment card data were encrypted. It is not known if a hacker was able to decrypt the card data or use it to steal money from consumers.The company said its corporate network and its “other cloud and service offerings” were not affected.The data breach was first reported by cyber security blogger Brian Krebs, who claims a Russian organised cyber crime group called the Carbanak Gang appeared to have breached hundreds of computer systems at Oracle including the Micros system. Oracle would not comment beyond the letter.Oracle acquired Micros in 2014 for $5.3bn. It said at the time that Micros technology was used at more than 330,000 customer sites in the hospitality and retail industries. In the nine months before it was acquired, two-thirds of its $1bn revenue came from services, with 21 per cent from point of sale hardware and the rest from software.Almost two-thirds of data breaches at retailers were caused by point of sale intrusions in the last year, according to Verizon’s closely watched annual data breaches investigation report.Some cyber criminals have been concentrating on targeting point-of-sale systems, which collect credit card details when customers make transactions. ever since a high-profile breach at US retailer Target in 2013 showed how vulnerable they can be. Data from about 70m customers including 40m card details was exposed in the Target breach.Over the next year several high-profile retailers in the US were also attacked, including Home Depot, which became the largest breach of a retailer on record, with up to 56m cards affected.More recently, hackers have targeted the hotel industry, with Hilton Hotels, Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Mandarin Oriental and the Trump Collection all admitting that their payments systems were compromised last year.Shares in Oracle rose slightly to $41.19 in afternoon trading in New York.
62;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-07-28T17:33:54Z;Oracle: all in the family;NetSuite may be a logical target but its close links are a concern;"Oracle may have been late to the cloud computing party but its founder Larry Ellison was not. In the late 1990s he backed a software start-up, NetSuite. On Thursday, Oracle gatecrashed the joint by agreeing to buy NetSuite for $109 a share, all in cash.That is a tidy return for Mr Ellison; NetSuite, which proclaims itself the original cloud player, floated in 2007 at $26 a share. But the tie-up came as no surprise, and neither should the circumstances around the deal. NetSuite financial planning software is geared towards small and medium-sized companies that rent it over the internet, while Oracle offers massive projects for Fortune 500 firms installed “on premise”. They have co-operated before, for instance by making Oracle’s human resources software available to NetSuite’s client base.Oracle has been touting its own rapidly growing cloud business for years. In the fiscal year ending in June, its $2.8bn of sales accounted for a tenth of Oracle’s total software revenue. NetSuite should add more than $1bn in 2017. Mr Ellison believes Oracle can be the first software firm to hit $10bn in annual cloud revenue. That growth comes at a price. To add NetSuite, Oracle is paying 150 times the target’s 2017 earnings; its own shares trade at 14 times. It has said the deal would add to earnings.Oracle has past form of buying companies controlled by Mr Ellison, too. In 2011, it acquired Pillar Systems (although not without controversy; Mr Ellison agreed to give up his gains after legal pressure from investors). But Pillar was private; Oracle’s acquisition of NetSuite is pitched below its all-time high of $115 in 2014, and the premium to its undisturbed price is around 36 per cent — adequate but not egregious. Given Mr Ellison’s stake, it is difficult to see the company attracting competing bids from the likes of SAP or Salesforce.Mr Ellison has built a family of software companies. And as the godfather, it is perhaps inevitable that he is benefiting the most.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
63;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-07-28T15:55:38Z;Oracle chairman Larry Ellison set to net $3.5bn from NetSuite deal;US business software group to expand cloud computing operations;Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, once a vocal critic of the new era of cloud computing, is set to make a personal profit of $3.5bn from his company’s takeover of cloud company NetSuite.The software group’s all-cash acquisition for $9.3bn, which was announced on Thursday, marks Mr Ellison’s biggest deal since he bought PeopleSoft 11 years ago. The billionaire Oracle co-founder will increase his fortune as he is also the largest shareholder in NetSuite.Despite his early involvement and near 40 per cent stake in NetSuite, Mr Ellison has publicly criticised cloud computing, dismissing it for many years as a fad, in what was seen as an attempt to defend Oracle’s traditional software business. He later said he had only objected to the word “cloud”.Mr Ellison claimed credit for inventing cloud computing in 1998, when he came up with the idea for NetSuite, which was set up to run the software that controls other businesses’ back-office functions over the internet.It was founded six months before Marc Benioff, a former Oracle salesman, established Salesforce.com, which is widely credited with pioneering the idea for cloud-based software.The NetSuite deal follows a spate of acquisitions of other cloud software companies this year as software companies such as Oracle, SAP and Microsoft try to transform into cloud companies.Oracle has since gone on to appropriate the cloud name for its own business as it tries to convince Wall Street that it can make up for a decline in its core database and application software products with its small but fast-growing cloud services. It is now locked in a race with Salesforce to become the first to reach $10bn in cloud software revenues.To deal with the potential conflicts of interest, Oracle said that a special committee of its independent directors had led the evaluation and negotiation of the takeover, and had approved the deal unanimously on behalf of the board. It also said that Mr Ellison would abstain from a NetSuite shareholder vote to approve the deal.Oracle was the target of a shareholder lawsuit after buying another company controlled by Mr Ellison, Pillar Data Systems, in 2011. The Oracle chairman later agreed to forgo the $575m he would have received, if Pillar had met subsequent earnings targets as part of Oracle.NetSuite’s focus on small- and medium-sized businesses represents a departure for Oracle, whose own collection of database and application software products is aimed mainly at large businesses and governments.Mark Hurd, Oracle co-chief executive, described the companies’ products as “complementary” and said they would “coexist in the marketplace forever”.Oracle’s $109 a share offer represents a near 30 per cent premium to NetSuite’s closing price on Tuesday, before rumours of a bid approach started to circulate.Oracle shares were down 15 cents at $40.78 per cent in midday trading in New York, while NetSuite jumped 18 per cent to $108.
64;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-07-28T12:26:50Z;Oracle expands cloud with $9.3bn Netsuite buy;;"Everyone seems to want a piece of the cloud these days.Oracle, the US business software company, has on Thursday agreed to buy cloud computing pioneer NetSuite for around $9.3bn in cash, as it looks to ramp up its presence in this fast-growing business segment.The $109 a share offer represents a near 30 per cent premium to NetSuite’s closing price on Tuesday, before rumours of a bid approach started circulating.It comes as Oracle, the company behind the global development platform Java and Javascript, urgently looks to offset the decline in its conventional software business with a move to web-based services.Rivals Microsoft and Amazon have already built substantial and lucrative operations around cloud computing and much of the dealmaking in the tech sector this year has been around companies specialising in this space.Although cloud computing currently still only represents a small fraction of its revenues, Oracle said earlier in June that it would be the first company to reach $10bn in cloud revenues.“We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to Oracle’s earnings
on a non-GAAP basis in the first full fiscal year after closing,” said Safra
Catz, Oracle’s chief executive."

A technology company, it sells to big businesses and is big itself, with a market value of more than $40bn. Its five-year average revenue growth rate is almost 10 per cent, and it expects to grow at least that much this year. Earnings have grown a bit more slowly as competition has compressed margins, but profitability appears to have stabilised in the last year or so. It carries no debt. Almost two-thirds of sales are to clients in the strongest large economy in the world, the US. It trades at 16 times this year’s expected earnings — a few notches pricier than (for example) Oracle’s 14. But Company X is growing much faster than Oracle.At this level of abstraction, X is appealing. It is a halfway point between the cheap, slow-growth stocks such as Oracle, IBM and Cisco and fast-growing but wildly expensive stocks such as Salesforce. Last week, though, X announced quarterly results and reduced its sales growth target for the year by a percentage point, to about 11 per cent. The shares fell by almost a tenth. Surely that is an overreaction, given the strong fundamentals just outlined? Time to buy?Perhaps not. Company X is Infosys, the Indian IT service provider. Its industry is changing fast. The move from on-premise servers running licensed software to renting software delivered as a service over the internet has been seismic, and the role of service providers in the new world is still to be determined.At the least, as Morgan Stanley has pointed out, outsourcing and product support is now less important, and high-end consulting and systems integration becomes more so. Here, Infosys is better positioned than many peers. But the shakeout is not over. So investors, unsure of the endgame, are left to look at the acceleration or deceleration of sales growth, and extrapolate. Infosys’ growth is still strong, but it is decelerating.Investors are very jumpy, but this is not irrational. Expect it to continue.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The servers were based on Itanium chips, which had been jointly developed by HP and Intel.Though once described as a “moonshot” venture for the chip industry, given the complexity and ambition of the technology, Itanium servers did not live up to their high hopes. HP argued that Oracle could not back out of Itanium, since it had signed a contract promising to write software for the servers.The fear of losing support for Oracle software, including its widely used database products, led customers to pull back from the Itanium platform and damaged the business, HP said.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman, claimed that Itanium was already in decline before he turned his back on the technology, and that Intel had already signalled that it was moving away from the chips.A court in 2012 took issue with that and ordered Oracle to resume its support for Itanium.However, that was not enough to revive the Itanium business, with HP claiming that the damage had already been done when Oracle showed a lack of confidence in the technology the year before.The $3bn award, which followed a month-long trial in a California state court in San Jose, matched the amount of damages that HP had claimed in the case.Oracle said it would appeal against both the 2012 ruling and this week’s award.“Two trials have now demonstrated clearly that the Itanium chip was nearing end of life, HP knew it, and was actively hiding that fact from its customers,” said Dorian Daley, Oracle’s general counsel.

Molson’s sale of debt will help fund the company’s full takeover of brewery MillerCoors.Lower interest rates on high quality bonds in the wake of risk aversion prompted by Brexit is also attracting companies to tap the credit market.The average yield on the Barclays Aggregate US investment grade bond index has fallen in recent days from 2.11 per cent to 1.92 per cent, the first time the index has sunk below 2 per cent since January 2015. The index has an average duration of about five-and-a-half years.“There was concern around what type of impact the UK vote would create on the marketplace but today proves we continue to see strong appetite for investment grade product in spite of the volatility around Brexit,” said Dan Mead, head of the US investment grade syndicate desk at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, one of three bookrunners on the US portion of the deal.There have been four other bond deals by investment grade European companies this week, two issuing in Japanese yen, one in South Korean won and one in Norwegian krone.“I see no reason for the European corporate bond market not to be functioning again in the next few days,” said Marc Baigneres, head of debt capital markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for JPMorgan.The European credit market has additional support from the European Central Bank’s current programme of regular corporate debt purchases.While European stock markets fell sharply in the aftermath of the referendum and have rebounded, the reaction in credit markets has been muted: the iBoxx non-financial European credit derivatives index has risen 0.3 per cent.Mr Baigneres said: “[the euro market] is likely to be fairly quiet until September, which we’d expect to be pretty busy with issuers likely to pre-empt US elections.”Mr Mead expected more deals in the days to come before the second quarter ends on Thursday and US activity ebbs ahead of the July fourth holiday weekend.“We had a decent pipeline waiting until after the Brexit vote,” he said. “Now that we have seen the success of the Molson deal, we would expect supply to pick up as early as Wednesday.

The purchase was part of a recent spate of deals in the cloud software industry as buyers have stepped in to pick up companies whose shares were battered in a market shake-out since last autumn.Microsoft’s agreed offer for LinkedIn, announced on Monday, points to a new phase in the takeover wave as some of the giants of the tech world try to make up for lost time and move more quickly into the cloud computing business.Microsoft is hoping to use the information LinkedIn has on more than 400m professionals to supercharge its own online software business, for instance by helping salespeople who use its customer relationship management software to target potential leads more effectively.As the largest player in cloud software for salespeople, Salesforce attempted something similar on a smaller scale with the purchase of Jigsaw, a company with a database of business contacts, six years ago.It also has a loose partnership with LinkedIn, whose Sales Navigator product, designed for salespeople, is available on the Salesforce platform. However, it does not have the level of integration with LinkedIn’s data that Microsoft hopes to achieve after buying the company.Salesforce’s early lead in the software-as-a-service sector has made it a target for big companies whose traditional software businesses have come under pressure from a move to the cloud. Microsoft considered making a takeover offer for Salesforce last year, said one person familiar with the matter.Meanwhile, Oracle, which is also trying to boost its revenues from the cloud after a slow start, has set its sights on surpassing Salesforce. On Thursday, its executives said they believed they could overtake Salesforce to become the first company to reach cloud software revenues of $10bn — a milestone Salesforce has set for its own business.

You can sign up here.Microsoft’s $26bn acquisition of LinkedIn this week shows how it values its membership and wrapping those social connections into its own business software and services, but advertisers will probably value just as much a new stream of data on users being made available by Facebook.Ahead of the Cannes Lions Festival — advertisers’ annual pilgrimage to the south of France — the company announced new ways for brands to access its data as market research, rather than just for targeting and measurement when they upload a completed ad. Mondelez International, the owner of the Cadbury and Oreo brands, and AB InBev, the brewer of Stella and Budweiser, are early partners for the audience insights beta programme.The data can show the kinds of experiences users are posting on the service.

71;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Software M&A: get off of my cloud;Some of the mooted deals in the sector look reckless;The arms race in enterprise software is getting increasingly hazardous. Two financially dubious acquisitions have been narrowly avoided. Microsoft is reported to have tried to buy Salesforce last year for more than $50bn. Salesforce tried to buy LinkedIn before Microsoft eventually prevailed in a $26bn deal this week.Revenue growth at Salesforce is truly impressive — there are almost no other software companies with its scale growing at more than 25 per cent a year. Yet it makes a net loss and modest earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. It would be a huge gamble for Microsoft, which, while rich, has not got infinite resources. Any winning cash bid would have wiped out its net cash of $60bn.For the same reason, even the idea of Salesforce buying LinkedIn should create anxiety for both sides. With just $500m of ebitda in the past 12 months and a slight net debt, Salesforce could not fund a cash purchase. The only choice would be to use its own sky-high multiple — an enterprise value of more than six times revenues or 100 times ebitda — in an all-stock deal. No wonder LinkedIn took Microsoft’s cash.The more natural deal on paper would be for Oracle to acquire Salesforce. The businesses are more comparable. Oracle desperately needs to move from being an old-school IT vendor to the new world of the cloud. Yet the two management teams seldom spurn an opportunity to rubbish each other. On its earnings call last month, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff noted that he was succeeding, in part, because Oracle was “doing so poorly in the cloud”. Oracle’s call on Thursday featured three different executives all taking potshots at Salesforce.Fortunately for Oracle, rather than doing “poorly” its homegrown cloud business exceeded estimates in the quarter, and chairman Larry Ellison said he could be the first to make $10bn in cloud revenues. (That happens to be the oft-stated goal of Mr Benioff.) That pace of growth might make the tie-up unnecessary.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
72;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle aims high in race to the cloud;Larry Ellison challenges rival Salesforce to be first company to reach $10bn in cloud revenues;Cloud computing still only represents a small fraction of revenues at Oracle, but it was front and centre on Thursday as the US business software company claimed to have reached a turning point in its attempted overhaul for the new cloud era.Larry Ellison, co-founder and chairman, also used a quarterly earnings call with Wall Street to throw down a challenge to Salesforce.com, the largest cloud software company, by claiming that Oracle would be the first company to reach $10bn in cloud revenues — a target already set publicly by Marc Benioff, the former Oracle star salesman who now runs Salesforce.Meanwhile, Safra Catz, co-chief executive, claimed Oracle was “officially at the complete end of the beginning” in making the move to the cloud. In the new fiscal year that started at the beginning of this month, the extra sales Oracle makes from selling cloud services will for the first time exceed lost sales in its bigger, but declining, core software business, putting it back on a growth path, she said.“We have made the transition,” Ms Catz said.Despite the latest forceful claims from Oracle’s executives that the company is finally getting past its late start in cloud computing, Wall Street has remained cautious about its progress. Its shares have slipped 13 per cent over the past year compared to a 14 per cent rise at Salesforce over concerns about declines in its non-cloud business, which still accounts for 92 per cent of sales.In its latest quarter, Oracle said revenues from new software licences — once its main engine of growth — had slumped 12 per cent, to $2.8bn. But in a presentation to Wall Street, it shone a spotlight instead on its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service businesses, the parts of its cloud operations that are growing fastest.Revenues from these new markets climbed 66 per cent from a year before to $690m, and were set to see further acceleration to 75-80 per cent in the present quarter, the company said.Including its slower-growing infrastructure-as-a-service business, Oracle said overall cloud revenues grew 49 per cent to $859m.The pick-up in cloud growth was not enough to overcome the broader decline in Oracle’s on-premise software business. Revenues for the period fell 1 per cent from a year before, though at $10.6bn they were still ahead of Wall Street expectations. Pro forma earnings per share, the measure analysts use to judge the company, rose three cents to 81 cents, though they were below the 82 cents Wall Street had expected.Oracle’s shares edged up 2 per cent in after-market trading as the company predicted a return to growth in the current quarter. Revenue is forecast to rise 2-5 per cent, Ms Catz said, ahead of the 2 per cent increase expected by most analysts. Earnings per share are projected to reach 56-60 cents a share, compared to market expectations of 59 cents.Mr Ellison said the cloud “hyper-growth” of the company’s most recent fiscal year, to the end of May, would continue “for the next few years”. As a result, he added, Oracle now has a “fighting chance to be the first cloud company to reach $10bn” in revenues from the SaaS and PaaS markets.Though growing fast, Oracle is still lagging behind in the cloud market. Salesforce’s revenues hit an annualised rate of $7.7bn in its most recent quarter, after climbing 27 per cent, putting it far closer to the $10bn milestone.In comments to analysts, Ms Catz rejected a recent lawsuit from a former employee accusing the company of artificially boosting its cloud revenues by distorting its accounting. “We have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident it is 100 per cent accurate and, if anything, slightly conservative,” she said.
73;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle logs rapid cloud sales growth, shares rise;;Cloud computing may still only represent a small fraction of revenues at Oracle, but it was front and centre on Thursday as the US business software company claimed that its move into the new market was accelerating.In prepared remarks ahead of a call with analysts and investors, Oracle executives highlighted a 49 per cent jump in the company’s cloud business in its latest quarter, with growth particularly strong in the software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service markets, writes Richard Waters in San Francisco.With cloud revenues only 8 per cent of the total, however, Oracle was weighed down by a decline in its broader business, with overall revenue falling by 1 per cent from the year before, to $10.6bn. Pro forma earnings per share in the period, at 81 cents, came in one cent below Wall Street’s expectations.But with revenues stronger than expected and a buoyant forecast for accelerating revenue growth from the cloud in the next quarter, Oracle’s shares edged up 2 per cent in after-market trading.Larry Ellison, co-founder and chairman, predicted that the “hyper-growth” of the company’s most recent fiscal year, to the end of May would continue “for the next few years.” As a result, he added, Oracle now has a “fighting chance to be the first cloud company to reach $10bn” in revenues from the SaaS and PaaS markets.The claim sets up a direct rivalry with Salesforce.com, presently the largest pure cloud software company. Led by former Oracle star salesman Marc Benioff, Salesforce has also set its sights on hitting $10bn in revenue.In its prepared remarks, Oracle did not refer to a recent lawsuit from an ex-employee accusing it of artificially boosting its reported cloud revenues. In an earlier statement, it called its cloud accounting “proper and correct” and promised to bring a counter-suit against the former employee.

At least typewriters are seeing a revival. #techFT is a daily newsletter on technology, media and telecoms. You can sign up here.With print advertising revenues falling off a cliff this year, there are fresh fears over the future of the UK’s national newspapers.Daily Mail and General Trust’s 13 per cent decline in its first half, reported on Thursday, follows news of job cuts at The Daily Telegraph andThe Guardian and the closure of The Independent and New Daynewspapers. John Gapper says there is the same hollowing out of national newspapers taking place as has happened in the regional press.Roy Greenslade in The Guardian goes further, saying “it is simply a matter of time before it becomes unprofitable to continue publishing newsprint papers”. The Guardian says the UK’s top 10 newspaper advertisers, which includes names such as Sky, BT, Tesco and Asda, have been taking their business elsewhere and Facebook and Google have been the main beneficiaries of any shifts to online advertising.DMGT has been a leader in the shift to digital, with its MailOnline site attracting 240m unique visitors a month, although online media is still less than 10 per cent of group revenue. Lex comments that this part is growing at 20-30 per cent annually. If new media revenues keep growing at 20 per cent, within a year their gains will outweigh a 7 per cent decline in old media.That’s some encouragement, but John Gapper concludes gloomily: “In any other industry, cost-driven mergers would loom. The question is: does anyone have the appetite to roll up Fleet Street?”#techFT takes a break for Monday’s holidays.

75;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-05-26T21:11:18Z;Google beats Oracle in $9bn copyright case;Ruling will probably have broad impact on software development;Google has won a high-profile copyright case against Oracle, fending off a $9bn damages claim and establishing a legal principle that is likely to have a broad impact on software development.The verdict, in federal court in San Francisco, came after nearly four days of jury deliberations over complex issues to do with how developers write code to allow systems to link effectively in the increasingly interconnected online world.The case was triggered by Google’s decision to use some of the code from Java — a software platform later acquired by Oracle — when it was developing its Android mobile operating system. The software it copied played a key role in helping outside developers write apps to run on Android, determining the so-called application programming interfaces that act as “hooks” to enable different programs to interoperate.Oracle had already won an appeals court ruling that the APIs were covered by copyright law. But on Thursday the 10-person jury sided with Google’s argument that the internet company was covered by “fair use”, the doctrine which allows use of copyrighted material in limited circumstances.Oracle immediately said it believed “there are numerous grounds for appeal”, and that it would bring the case to the federal circuit — the same court that had earlier upheld its claim that copyright law should apply to APIs.“We strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market,” Dorian Daley, Oracle’s general counsel, said in a statement.Google welcomed the verdict as “a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products”.Supporters of open source software had warned that a win for Oracle would have put a chill on widely used methods for developing code, preventing outsiders from writing new programs to run on common technology platforms unless they had already negotiated a licence.If higher courts side with Google and the fair use defence stands, it will leave copyright law with regard to software essentially where it was before Oracle first brought its case, experts have said.
76;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-05-26T20:42:16Z;Google beats Oracle in key copyright suit;;Google has won a high-profile copyright case against Oracle, in the process fending off a $9bn damages claim and establishing a legal principle that is likely to have broad impact on software development.The verdict, in federal court in San Francisco, came after nearly four days of jury deliberations over complex issues to do with how developers write code to allow systems to link effectively in the increasingly interconnected online world, writes Richard Waters in San Francisco.The case was triggered by Google’s decision to use some of the code from Java – a software platform later acquired by Oracle – when it was developing its Android mobile operating system.

77;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-05-23T20:54:50Z;Google makes final pitch in copyright trial with Oracle;Group says it was covered by ‘fair use’ of software code in case where $9bn in damages are sought;Google on Monday made a final courtroom pitch to defend an approach to programming that has become second-nature to many software developers in the era of open-source.However, Oracle accused it of a failure of innovation when developing its Android operating system, forcing it to steal software code rather than risk losing its dominant position on the internet. “Google took a short-cut — and they took a short-cut at Oracle’s expense,” said Peter Bicks, representing the database software company.The two technology groups were squaring off in a federal court in San Francisco with closing arguments in a high-stakes copyright trial in which Oracle is seeking damages of $9bn.Google is trying to convince a jury that it was covered by “fair use”, which permits the use of copyrighted material in limited circumstances, when it copied interfaces from the Java open source programming platform into its Android mobile operating system. Oracle bought Sun, which had owned Java, and sued after abandoning its own attempt to create rival smartphone software.Google has already tried to argue that the interfaces, known as application programming interfaces, are not covered by copyright, but lost the argument before an appeals court. A previous jury also failed to agree on whether fair use should apply.The case is being closely watched in the software world, where using interfaces is seen as an essential element in being able to create new products, riding on the popularity of commonly used existing software.“What the Google engineers did was not out of the mainstream,” said Robert van Nest, a lawyer for Google, on Monday. They took “declaring code”, used to specify an API rather than actually implement a program, “which everyone at that time understood to be open source”, he added.Mr Bicks lent squarely on a series of internal emails at Google that showed executives worrying about the legality of their use of Java. In one email, Andy Rubin, the then head of Android, said he believed the APIs were copyrighted.In another email, which featured prominently in the earlier 2012 trial and has played a starring role again, Tim Lindholm, a Google engineer, said he had studied all the alternatives to using Java and they “all suck”. That left the company no choice but to take a Java licence, he warned his superiors.The burden of proof in the trial rests on Google, a standard that legal experts have said represents a high hurdle given the technical complexity of the issues raised in the trial.Google has maintained that its use of the Java code led to a “transformative” new product that would not have existed otherwise — one of the main tests of fair use.“Android was exactly the kind of thing fair use was designed to protect,” said Mr van Nest.Google also said it could not have hurt Oracle’s own business by taking the code, since the version of the software it copied from, called Java SE, was intended for desktop computers and servers rather than mobile devices.If the jury backs Oracle’s case the trial will move into a second phase to assess damages. Oracle has won in a copyright case before, securing a $1.3bn jury verdict in 2011 against German software maker SAP, the biggest ever award in a copyright case. The damages portion of the case was sent back for a retrial and the two sides later settled for $357m.
78;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
79;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;US companies’ cash pile hits $1.7tn;Five technology groups including Apple and Microsoft hold $504bn between them;Five US tech giants are hoarding more than half a trillion dollars, a record sum that underscores how cash has become increasingly concentrated at a handful of groups seeking to avoid a tax hit.Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle had amassed $504bn of cash by the end of 2015, nearly a third of the total $1.7tn held on the balance sheets of US non-financial companies, according to a new report from rating agency Moody’s. The top 50 holders accounted for $1.1tn of that amount.US multinationals have left roughly $1.2tn of their earnings overseas in an effort to skirt the tax charge of moving profits back to US shores under the country’s complex tax code.It is the first time the top five cash hoarders have been made up exclusively of tech groups, an industry that generates more of its sales abroad than any other sector and one that has been embroiled in tax disputes in both the US and Europe.The ever increasing amount of cash also highlights how US boardrooms are reticent to invest in their businesses, choosing instead to increase dividends, in a sign of the continued anxiety that economic activity could still slow at home or in China.The report showed the first annual dip in capital spending since the US emerged from recession. Expenditures on things like new equipment slipped 3 per cent to $885bn as energy and mining groups retrenched in the face of sharply lower commodity prices.“Companies are hoarding cash,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.Apple accounted for more than a tenth of the total cash reserves, holding $216bn, 93 per cent of which is overseas. The top-five list included the addition of Oracle, which ousted Pfizer after the pharmaceuticals group completed its $17bn takeover of Hospira.The iPhone maker is currently under investigation by the European Commission for its overseas tax practices, with Brussels questioning whether its huge cash pile was compiled by sweetheart tax deals in Ireland. A decision in the case, which could include a multibillion-dollar fine, is expected within the next two months.Despite the mounting pressure, Moody’s analysts expect companies to leave cash abroad as the US election looms. Groups are instead expected to deepen their reliance on debt, issuing bonds to finance shareholder returns and mergers and acquisitions.“At this stage in the political cycle and given strong differences on both sides of the aisle in Washington, we do not expect tax law reform that would prompt overseas cash repatriation,” said Moody’s Richard Lane.The failure of companies to invest their cash pile has frustrated investors who say companies are not ploughing enough back into their underlying businesses, in research and development, to reinvigorate sales.“If you look at the most recent GDP report . . . investment was down at an annualised rate of well over 5 per cent, a dramatic drop,” said Mr Ablin.But the rising cash piles mask a rapid increase in debt. For the first time since 2012, cash, short-term investments and liquid long-term investments slipped below debt maturities due over the next five years, Moody’s found.At this stage in the political cycle …we do not expect tax law reform that would prompt overseas cash repatriationTotal debts rose nearly $850bn last year to $6.6tn, a separate report from S&P showed, which put overall cash levels in the US at a slightly higher $1.8tn. While cash had increased by about $600bn over the past five years, obligations surged by $2.8tn.The increased leverage has been concentrated in smaller and lower quality groups that took advantage of record-low borrowing costs spurred by stimulative monetary policy.While the top 25 cash hoarders hold cash in excess of their obligations, the cash-to-debt ratio fell to 12 per cent for low-rated junk companies. In 2010, that figure stood above 20 per cent.“Companies aren’t exactly flush with cash,” S&P analyst Andrew Chung added. “As the credit cycle ages, rates rise and macroeconomic growth slows, that’s when companies in the bottom 99 per cent who levered up [could have] funding issues.”The increased leverage has not deterred investors from hoovering up large US debt sales, which topped $400bn earlier this week as bankers completed billion-dollar plus transactions for Dell, CVS Health, Southern Co and Boeing.Investors have pointed to the drop in sovereign debt yields as they buy up corporate bonds, with nearly $10tn of debt trading with a negative yield.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

81;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Mixed signals on future for Google’s Android operating system;Changing legal and regulatory climate will be key for software;Android, the Google smartphone operating system, was the centre of attention in three very different places recently: a sun-soaked celebration for developers in Silicon Valley, a San Francisco federal courtroom and the hallways of the European Commission in Brussels.And views of what has become one of the world’s most widely used pieces of software varied widely depending on the location.At an outdoor Google conference for 7,000 that felt more like a festival than a hardcore technology event, Android this week played an uncharacteristically low-key role.Like oxygen, it has become a pervasive and necessary part of the broader Google technology ecosystem, though the focus has shifted to the new products and services it supports rather than the software itself.Elsewhere, though, Android has been far more conspicuous — and under attack. In San Francisco, a long-running legal fight with Oracle over the software is about to come to a head, with closing arguments expected on Monday.The result will have a bearing on Android itself, and a large part of the software economy, built on a liberal “sharing” of ideas between developers, could also be facing a watershed moment.Pity the 10-person jury. The case turns on whether, in writing Android, Google contravened the copyright in Java software, which is now owned by Oracle. At the time, Java was a common platform used by developers who wanted their code to run on any piece of hardware, regardless of the operating system.By copying 37 of the Java interfaces, known as APIs, Google made it easier for people who knew Java to write applications for Android as well. Its defence turns on the fact that it did not copy the underlying “implementing” code into its own operating system, instead only using the APIs as labels or signposts.If the technical issues raised in the courtroom have been hard for non-coders to follow, they also seem to have floored some of the experts. Witnesses in the trial, which began last week, have struggled with sometimes contradictory descriptions of what APIs are and how they work. The engineers have been even more vague about the legal issues surrounding their use.But some of their deliberations have led to evidence that could be damning for Google: one of its engineers wrote to chief executive Larry Page that the company should negotiate a licence for using Java because all the other options “suck”.Even if Google’s use of the APIs without a licence reflects wider practice, it highlights a sometimes slapdash, corner-cutting approach among developers who are racing to meet a deadline and need to make their technology interoperate with other companies’ technology.When a company has built a multibillion-dollar empire on the result, practices that might not raise an eyebrow in other contexts suddenly assume a deeper significance.The courts have already ruled that the Java APIs are covered by copyright. Google’s hopes now hang on the defence that it was “fair use” for it to take the code anyway.If it fails — and if Oracle gets anywhere near its $9bn damages claim — it would not merely be an expensive setback for Android. Copyright law would have made inroads into software development, making life harder not just for Google but any developer trying to work in the increasingly interconnected technology world.On the other side of the Atlantic, meanwhile, the European Commission is preparing to levy what is expected to be its biggest-ever antitrust fine against Google after filing a formal complaint against the company over Android earlier this year. The result could limit the group’s use of one of its most important competitive weapons.Using the smartphone software — and the army of developers who write apps for it — to break into other markets could invite a regulatory backlash, just as Microsoft once found with its Windows PC operating system.At its developer conference this week, Google made clear that it still has expansive plans for Android.

82;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-05-16T11:46:49Z;Berkshire Hathaway discloses $1bn stake in Apple;;The Oracle of Omaha is sinking his teeth into Apple stock.Shares in the iPhone maker are up more than 2 per cent in pre-market trading after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in a quarterly regulatory filing that it holds a 9.81m stake in the company as of March 31.It is unclear precisely when Berkshire bought the stake, which is valued at more than $1bn.News of Berkshire’s investment couldn’t come at a better time for Apple. Shares in the technology giant have fallen by more than 19 per cent since mid-April after it reported its first quarterly revenue fall in 13 years and the first-ever decline in iPhone sales.Concerns over the company’s outlook and whether it will find a new product that will move the needle have sent the stock to a near 2 year low and led it to temporarily lose its status as the world’s most valuable company to Alphabet, Google’s parent company, on Thursday.In a bid to diversify its business, Apple unveiled last week a $1bn investment in the Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, making it the group’s largest minority investment ever.The stake in Apple also represents a departure for Mr Buffett. The 85-year-old has for years avoided investing in technology companies, saying in the past that they are either too complicated or that it is hard to determine whether they pass his “moat” test.The moat concept is a principle of Mr Buffett’s style of value investing. It refers to the competitive advantage a company has in its business that allows it to generate long-term profits and continue growing market share versus competitors.Aside from Apple, IBM is the only other technology company that Berkshire owns a significant stake in.Berkshire’s investment in Apple comes after billionaire investor Carl Icahn said last month that he has exited his position in the company.
83;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-05-15T20:29:57Z;VMware: Tractor beam;The software company is being sucked into Dell but retains an attractive valuation;It sounds a bit Star Trek. Despite being protected by The Federation, VMware is being captured by the secretive aliens of Denali. Yet this is a side-effect of the biggest tech deal in history. Dell and Silver Lake, in the guise of “Denali”, last year agreed to pay more than $60bn for EMC, the server group whose self-styled “Federation” of quasi-autonomous businesses includes VMware, the server virtualisation company.As the crown jewel inside EMC, VMware investors and employees have displayed some skittishness at being taken over by Michael Dell and his private equity ally. Shares in VMware remain more than 20 per cent lower than when the deal was announced in October. Parsing the future under Dell is complex. Concern has centred on Dell’s decision to pay for EMC, in part, with tracking stock in VMware, equivalent to a 53 per cent economic interest. There is also a vague timetable around $1bn in promised revenue synergies supposedly derived by VMware - not much incentive. And EMC CEO Joe Tucci has acknowledged worries that Dell might raid VMware's $7bn in net cash to pay down its huge debt pile, though he has also pledged it won’t happen.VMware’s share price decline was partly caused by the Dell deal and an arbitrage opportunity from selling VMware stock and buying EMC, but operating woes were also a factor. VMware cut guidance in two of the last three quarters. It has yet to prove that it can prosper in a world where customers use the clouds of Amazon, Microsoft and Google rather than the on-premise data centres where VMware ruled.There are, however, enough positives to make the valuation interesting. Last quarter VMWare defied expectations of a slump in IT spending. Its faster-growing mobile and cloud-focused businesses (under a Star Trek-like “Project Photon”) can make up for the slowdown of its legacy products. It is used to being operated as a subsidiary - EMC today owns 81 per cent. In spite of the healthy cash position, it trades at 13 times forward earnings, lower than other mature software companies such as Microsoft, Oracle and Citrix. The last of these three, which has an existing partnership with Dell, has more to fear from the EMC deal than VMware. Existing investors should cling on.

85;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-05-08T15:48:31Z;Oracle and Google copyright fight is back in court;Ruling could set a precedent that raises costs for tech companies;A long-running battle between Oracle and Google that could have a sweeping impact on how copyright laws apply to the software industry is set to resume in San Francisco on Monday.Oracle has lodged a claim for $8.8bn in profits that it says Google has made by infringing its copyright in the Android smartphone operating system, a figure that legal experts say is almost certain to far exceed any final damages award, should Google lose.However, a ruling for Oracle could set a precedent that raises costs for many other technology companies, while also giving Oracle leverage to negotiate new royalty payments that would impact all developers who write apps for Android smartphones.Oracle lodged its complaint in 2010, claiming Google had infringed its copyright in the Java programming framework by copying parts of it in Android. Oracle lost in federal court but won on appeal, prompting Google to apply to take the case to the Supreme Court.That bid was rejected, though the case was returned to federal court in San Francisco. A jury will be asked to decide whether Google’s use of some of the Java code was covered by “fair use”, which permits copying in limited circumstances.If Oracle wins, it would dampen innovation in the technology world by giving owners of today’s dominant tech platforms more power to limit how new upstarts tap into them, according to legal briefs from a number of computer scientists and law professors supporting Google.The case turns on the way Google copied parts of Java to make it easier for developers to write apps to run on its Android phones.Since many developers were already familiar with Java, Google copied a series of labels used in that software. The labels are used to specify APIs, or software interfaces that developers rely on to get their apps to run.Programmers understand this instinctively — but how many people on the jury will be programmers, or be able to understand what this is all about?“Google starts out going a little uphill” since the jury will begin from the point of view that it copied Oracle’s code, said Tyler Ochoa, a law professor at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley.Mr Ochoa also said the technical complexity of the case was likely to favour Oracle. “Programmers understand this instinctively — but how many people on the jury will be programmers, or be able to understand what this is all about?”The freedom to use open APIs to build on top of existing technology has been one of the keys to innovation in the computing and internet worlds for years, according to Google’s supporters in the tech industry. They claim that extending copyright law to these essential software “hooks” would give incumbents the power to hamper new upstarts.Google will have to meet a number of tests to justify using the Oracle code, including proving that it made a “transformative” use of the Java software that had not been exploited before, and that it did not prevent Oracle from creating a similar new market.
86;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-04-08T09:21:56Z;Blood Simple;Two years ago, it was one of the hottest properties in Silicon Valley. Now the healthcare company is facing claims that its technology is flawed;"“If only they’d found out sooner. Maybe they’d still be alive.” It is the cry of anyone who has lost a loved one to a terminal illness — the belief that if the disease had been diagnosed earlier, that person’s life would have been longer. But modern medicine does not work like this. Serious illnesses tend to be diagnosed after the appearance of symptoms — a sore stomach that will not go away, a persistent headache that is getting worse — by which time it can be too late. Yet most of us still believe there is nothing inevitable about sickness or death before old age. If only it had been caught earlier. If only.What if there were a different way; a way of knowing we are sick before our body tells us, before time runs out? Enter Elizabeth Holmes, the 32-year-old founder of Theranos, a Silicon Valley healthcare group that has promised nothing short of a paradigm shift in medicine. She wants people to have their blood tested so regularly that they can spot a serious illness long before it claims their lives.Holmes declined to be interviewed for this article but in a 2014 talk at TedMed, a medical conference focusing on big ideas, she said that her own experience of losing a loved one had spurred her to drop out of Stanford University just over a decade ago to start Theranos. “I grew up spending summers and the holidays with my uncle. I remember his love of crossword puzzles . . .I remember he loved the beach,” she recalled. “He was diagnosed one day with skin cancer, which all of a sudden was brain cancer, and in his bones. He didn’t live to see his son grow up, and I never got to say goodbye.”Theranos’s mission was to make blood testing so painless, so cheap, so convenient, that people would get tested all the time. We would become so familiar with our health data that we would read the results as though they were credit-card statements. Small changes in the numbers, imperceptible to the body itself, would alert us to the fact that something was amiss long before symptoms appeared.“We [at Theranos] see a world in which every person has access to actionable health information at the time it matters, a world in which no one ever has to say, ‘If only I’d known sooner’,” Holmes told her audience. In this world, her uncle might have lived, and so might countless others.For most of the past two years, Theranos has been one of the hottest properties in Silicon Valley, with a roster of big-name investors such as Larry Ellison, the Oracle founder, and a board of directors that reads like a Who’s Who of the US establishment, including two former secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz.Since last October, however, the company has been fighting for its survival, amid claims that its blood-testing technology is, at best, fundamentally flawed and, at worst, unsafe. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the government agency that regulates blood-testing labs in the US, recently warned that inaccurate test results sent out by Theranos’s California laboratory had put patients’ lives at risk. Walgreens, the chain of pharmacies with which Theranos has a high-profile partnership, has instructed its lawyers to find a way of pulling the plug on their deal.It was in 2013, after a decade of working in secret, that Holmes first articulated her plans in public. Most eye-catching was her claim to have found an alternative to the needles and venous draws that are typically used to take blood samples: if people were going to have their blood tested every few months or so, Theranos had to come up with a less invasive method. Her solution was the “nanotainer”, a tiny glass vial shaped like a miniature light bulb, which drew blood via a small prick to a person’s fingertip. Its ease of use would allow people to take tests more regularly, as well as providing a less scary experience for those who fear needles.By testing samples taken via the nanotainers, using its own laboratory machines rather than buying equipment and supplies from others, Theranos said it would be able to slash the cost of blood testing, offering prices to health insurers and the government that were between 50 and 90 per cent lower than those of larger competitors.There are claims that Theranos technology is, at best, fundamentally flawed and, at worst, unsafeAt the end of 2013, the company agreed a deal with Walgreens to set up “wellness centers” — concessions inside its stores in Arizona where customers could have their blood drawn and tested. Then, last year, the company helped legislators in the state draft a bill that changed the law, allowing patients to bypass their doctor and order their own blood tests at more than 40 Walgreens stores as regularly as they liked.It was the final piece of Theranos’s revolutionary business model: blood testing was painless, thanks to the nanotainer; cheaper, thanks to Theranos’s proprietary lab machines; and it was more convenient, now that all a customer had to do was order their own tests while picking up shower gel and deodorant.Investors tripped over themselves to buy into Holmes’s vision. In 2014, Theranos raised $400m in a fundraising that valued the company at $9bn, putting it alongside other “unicorns” — companies that secure valuations of $1bn or more before going public.“What they did was put their finger on a hot-button issue,” says Cary Gunn, founder of Genalyte, another California-based biomedical company which is also developing tests that require just a few drops of blood. “Doing lots more testing, and using computation in a way that can drive down costs, is the key to predictive, preventative medicine.”Plaudits quickly followed. In 2014, Holmes appeared on the cover of Fortune and was profiled in the New Yorker; last year she was on the cover of Forbes and T, the New York Times’ style magazine. Usually she was photographed wearing her trademark black turtleneck, which inevitably drew comparisons with the late Apple founder Steve Jobs.Like Jobs before her — as well as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg — Holmes dropped out of university before completing her degree, when she was just 19, in 2003. During her first year at Stanford, where she was studying chemical and electrical engineering, she had become interested in the theory of microfluidics, which involves generating accurate readings from very small volumes of liquid. One of her teachers, Channing Robertson, now professor emeritus at Stanford, recalls a fiercely intelligent and precocious student, who convinced him to bend the rules. He enrolled her in an oversubscribed class, even though it was not meant to take first-year students, and eventually allowed her to do research in his lab, a privilege he had never before afforded a freshman.“It was really unusual,” he tells me. “In 30 years I hadn’t seen anyone who had demonstrated her capabilities at that stage in their academic career.”After her first year, Robertson arranged for her to do a spell of summer work experience at the Genome Institute of Singapore, where Holmes was shocked at how little diagnostic testing seemed to have changed since the 1950s.“When she came back, she handed me a thick pile of papers and said it was her patent application,” says Robertson, who recalls being blown away by her invention, and a little envious that he had not come up with the idea first.Holmes had envisioned a device that would be a “doctor or a pharmacy on your arm”, he says. The machine was designed to deliver a patient’s medication automatically at exactly the right dose, and to work out the correct dosage by constantly testing a person’s blood. The second part of the invention — the tiny blood-testing machine — would form the basis of Theranos’s technology.As her second year started, Holmes began to devote more time to her invention. “This is what I felt like I was born to do,” she said during a lecture to students at her alma mater in November last year. “I grew up in a family that was very involved in public service and I got to a point where I was really thinking that if I were going to build a product, create something, what would make the biggest difference in people’s lives. At an emotional level, I couldn’t think of anything that could be more meaningful than changing what we all go through when we say goodbye to the people we love too soon, because we didn’t find out in time.”Jobs, Gates and Zuckerberg might have changed the world by radically altering the way we live but Holmes wanted to stop people from prematurely losing their lives.I felt like I was born to do this. On an emotional level, I couldn’t think of anything more meaningfulShe asked her parents if she could use money they had set aside for her university tuition to set up Theranos. “They were wonderful,” she recalled. “It wasn’t much of a discussion, it was ‘This is what I’m going to do now’. They could have made it very difficult — the money that I used to start the company would have allowed them to retire — but they didn’t.”Robertson was so excited by the company’s prospects that he agreed to join as a technical adviser, a position he still holds. He also introduced Holmes to some of his contacts in the venture capital community to raise further funds.Holmes suspended her studies and used the cash from her parents and Robertson’s contacts to rent a basement in a strip mall near the Stanford campus, and to hire her first staff members, creating a narrative that includes some of Silicon Valley’s favourite tropes. How often have we heard the story, in part apocryphal, that Apple and Google were started with limited means in the insalubrious environs of a garage?All digital disrupters need a target, ideally an established industry that is resistant to change and unpopular with customers, like the taxi drivers who have been taken on by Uber, or the hoteliers threatened by Airbnb. In the US lab-testing industry, Holmes found an almost perfect villain.She has argued that the lab-testing system is a racket, and there is much evidence to support this. In the privatised US healthcare system, blood testing works like this: when a patient is sick, or due an annual physical examination, they visit their doctor, who will decide whether their blood needs to be tested. If it does, the sample is sent to a commercial laboratory, which runs the blood through its machines to generate the test results, before returning them to the doctor. If the patient has health insurance, or is covered under a government programme for the elderly or poor, they will normally pick up the bill. If patients are not covered, or have a cheap insurance plan, they may have to pay some or all of the cost out of their own pocket.The market is dominated by two companies, Laboratory Corporation of America and Quest; together, they had sales of almost $16bn and gross profits of $5.7bn last year. There have been no new entrants to speak of in more than a decade. Test results take weeks to come back. Chasing them by phone involves some of the longest call waiting times in the US.Theranos’s meteoric rise came to an abrupt halt in October of last year, when the Wall Street Journal published a front-page article that claimed the company’s proprietary technology was so flawed that — rather than using the nanotainer and its own machines — it had been doing almost all of its tests using other, commercially available equipment. While the Journal was reporting the article, Theranos deleted a sentence on its website that said: “Many of our tests require only a few drops of blood.”The Journal also reported that the company’s former chief scientist had committed suicide in 2013, apparently after telling his wife that its technology wasn’t working. Theranos has strenuously denied the link.Later that month, the Financial Times reported that Theranos was employing scientists with dubious qualifications to run its labs: the director of its California facility, Sunil Dhawan, was a dermatologist working for the company part time, while in Arizona its operations were overseen by someone without a medical degree. Neither had much experience in phlebotomy, the science of blood testing, or accreditation from a relevant professional body. Theranos has since hired a new director to run the California facility.As Theranos tried to contain the fallout, regulators started to express misgivings in public. In October, the US Food and Drug Administration censured it for using the nanotainer to collect patient blood without the necessary regulatory approvals and published a damaging report saying the group had failed to deal with complaints from customers. One complaint said the glass walls of the nanotainer “were too opaque to be able to see [blood] clotting clearly”, leading to “difficulties in inspecting… specimen quality”. The company did not investigate the complaint, according to the FDA report.Theranos has suspended the use of nanotainers for all but one of the more than 260 tests it offers — a herpes test. It now uses conventional venous draws to do the majority of its diagnostics, although it says it uses needles that are not as painful and that it typically takes less blood.The biggest blow came in January, when the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services warned that Theranos was risking “serious injury, harm or death” to patients because of deficiencies in its labs. Inspectors’ concerns focused on a test that determines what dose of blood thinner a patient should be taking, and sources close to the company say that roughly 40 people may have been sent erroneous results. Theranos has since recalled the results and urged those customers to repeat the tests.There’s a clashing of two worlds with Theranos. Secrecy and stealth is not a good model for medicineTheranos is not the only company to have had to recall tests. In 2009, for instance, Quest admitted it had potentially sent erroneous results to thousands of patients who had been tested for vitamin D levels.For executives at Walgreens, already worried about their reputation, the report from CMS was the final straw. The company tried to convince Theranos to suspend testing while it addressed regulators’ concerns, but Holmes declined. Walgreens has since decided to extract itself from the partnership and asked its lawyers to find a way of forcing Theranos to close the centres in its stores.Theranos has always guarded its secrets fiercely, releasing few details about its technology, arguing it does not want competitors to steal its intellectual property, and has given no indication of the size or scale of its business. Such a posture is typical in Silicon Valley, home to some of the world’s most private companies. For many technology start-ups, digital disruption is all about stealth — keeping your biggest advantages hidden, and surprising your rivals when they expect it least.However, such an approach has earned the company few supporters in the life sciences community, which thrives on a culture of openness and collaboration. When scientists think they have discovered something new, they publish their findings in a journal so it can be reviewed and challenged by their peers. Theranos’s reluctance to do this is one of the first things that medics and scientists cite when expressing misgivings about the company.“In Silicon Valley, you have thousands of start-ups trying to come up with something spectacular, but we have to remember the success rate is modest,” says John Ioannidis, a professor at the medical school at Stanford. “There’s a clashing of two worlds with Theranos. Secrecy and stealth is not a good model for medicine because we need to have accountability, otherwise you can hurt people — they won’t just lose their money, they will lose their lives.”Eleftherios Diamandis, the head of clinical biochemistry at Mount Sinai hospital in Toronto, says he too is “opposed to claims without evidence”, and thinks Theranos’s privacy is shielding the limitations of its technology.Theranos is “aware of the criticism, and sensitive to it”, says Robertson, “and we’re working on strategies to lift a little bit of the veil in a way that will answer a lot of the questions being asked”. The company is considering putting its technology through some kind of peer review process, either by publishing articles in journals and holding presentations at medical meetings, or by making its machines available for testing by third parties.It’s hard to turn back the clock and say we should have anticipated this. Most of us are scientists and hadn’t grown up in the atmosphere we find ourselves inLast month, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai hospital in New York found the Silicon Valley group’s test results were less reliable than those produced by its two largest rivals, Quest and LabCorp. Although the results were similar for most of the 22 tests investigated during the study, Theranos was less accurate in some cases. Of most concern were its results for cholesterol, which showed a “systematic bias” towards lower scores, according to the study. The variance was large enough to influence the choices made by patients and their doctors, the researchers said.Eric Schadt, the director of the Icahn Institute at Mount Sinai and one of the authors of the report, said: “It does matter if you’re calling something systematically lower, it is a problem, and it’s that systematic bias that’s most worrying.” Theranos responded by rejecting the study, which it described as “flawed and inaccurate”.Should Theranos have been more prepared for the criticism, and responded to it more quickly? “It’s hard for us to turn back the clock and say we should have anticipated this,” says Robertson. “Most of us are scientists and engineers and hadn’t grown up in the atmosphere we find ourselves in; it’s taken us a bit of time to work through it.”Diamandis and Ioannidis are among those scientists who believe that Theranos’s technology is just a variation on a type of blood test that has been available for more than 30 years. So-called capillary tests draw a small amount of blood by making a shallow prick to the skin, usually the fingertip. They are commonly used to test children, and for the sort of diagnostic procedures that are carried out while the patient waits, such as a rapid HIV test in a sexual health clinic.They are not used more widely because they give less reliable results. The problem arises because capillary blood is a mixture of blood from a person’s veins and their arteries, and can often become contaminated with bodily fluids that surround a person’s tissues.“There is a scientific reason for why they are not as accurate as venipuncture,” says Diamandis. “For many people, a finger prick will not cause free-flowing blood, in which case they squeeze their finger and contaminate the sample with interstitial fluid.”Robertson concedes that capillary blood testing is challenging but insists that Theranos’s technology has overcome its limitations. “Much of what we’ve done is to peel back the onion on those problems, and to solve them,” he says. “The technical challenges were substantial, and that’s why it took us a decade to crack the nut.”Holmes has painted many of her critics as members of a fusty medical establishment. “It’s not a coincidence that there aren’t many companies in healthcare technology that have broken through, because this is a space that doesn’t want to change,” she said during her Stanford lecture last year. “We knew going into this space that this would happen at some point once we sort of started to make an impact.”If Theranos’s critics are right, then some impressive scientific figures must be wrong. William Foege, an eminent scientist credited with helping to eradicate smallpox, is a director of the company, as is Bill Frist, who was a surgeon before entering Republican politics. Walgreens might have turned sour on its partnership with the company but it was sufficiently confident in its technology to sign the deal in the first place. Hundreds of scientists turn up to work there every day. Silicon Valley venture capitalists have backed the company. Have they all been duped?Jeff Sonnenfeld, a management professor at Yale, believes so, and argues that Theranos is part of a long history of “medical hucksterism” in the US, where people are always looking for “hope in a bottle”. Although the tradition is often associated with poorer people — the unwashed crowds gathering around the snake-oil salesman — he argues that it is just as prevalent among wealthy elites, who have poured time and money into the pursuit of immortality.The PayPal founder Peter Thiel is among the billionaires who have backed “life extension” schemes, while others are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to freeze their bodies upon death, in the hope that they can be thawed and reanimated at some point in the future once someone has discovered the elixir of life.“We’ve always seen in the investment world a fascination with the new thing, when people wind up suspending their critical judgment,” says Sonnenfeld, citing the tech bubble of the 2000s. “If you try to puncture the enthusiasm, you’re chastised for being a Luddite. With rich people, there’s this element of wanting to be on the frontier, or on the edge, but also this insiderness: everyone looks at who else has signed off — in this case Larry Ellison, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz — and thinks that somebody else must have done the due diligence.”Theranos has much work to do if it is to survive: it will have to prove to wary regulators that its technology works and that its labs are safe, while trying to convince Walgreens to stand by its Arizona outlets. It will have to lobby other states to implement laws that allow patients to order blood tests without first seeing a doctor, and repair its relationship with the scientific community by publishing data in peer-reviewed journals. To pay for all this, it will need to secure fresh funds from investors in Silicon Valley.Even if it succeeds in this huge undertaking, it will have to overcome a problem that many believe is insurmountable: regular diagnostic testing might not stop people from dying after all. Theranos is built on Holmes’s fervent belief that a huge number of lives could be saved if people were tested more frequently but there is scant scientific evidence to support her.Screening for a handful of cancers — such as prostate and cervical — is done in most developed economies, and its success is contested. Take prostate cancer, which is screened for by testing blood for levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). A large European study published last year showed the programmes had reduced deaths by 27 per cent but similar studies in the US, where regular screening is not recommended, show little or no benefit.The investment world has a fascination with the new thing. People suspend their critical judgment“For many years we have been screening people for PSA, and the evidence suggests we’re harming people,” says Ioannidis, adding that some people with low PSA scores have cancer but ignore the symptoms because their test scores lull them into a false sense of security. “Others who test positive don’t have cancer but they still have biopsies and get their prostates removed, and end up with bladder problems and sexual dysfunction.”Cervical cancer screening has had much better results but it is done using a pap or smear test rather than a blood test. “I believe cervical-cancer screening has saved lives but that is probably the exception and it is fundamentally different from blood testing, because in a pap test you can actually see the cancer cells,” says Ioannidis.When I ask Robertson if any of the tests offered by Theranos could have saved Holmes’s uncle, he takes a long pause. “I don’t have his information at my fingertips but most, if not all, diseases have a molecular or cellular sign, and there is a high degree of probability that it appears in the blood.”But the truth is there are no simple blood tests that can accurately or reliably diagnose skin cancer or brain tumours, nor many big killers such as ovarian or lung cancer. Finding a disease before symptoms appear might make a difference to our chances but the limitations of modern medicine make it very hard.“I do not exclude the possibility that someone will one day come in with a technology that really does deliver non-invasive, cheap, accurate testing that can diagnose cancer,” says Diamandis, adding that some researchers are trying to develop a microscopic camera that could patrol our body looking for disease. “I think it will likely happen in our lifetimes,” he adds.If only.David Crow is an FT correspondent in New YorkPhotographs: Jennifer Hueston; Getty; Alamy"
87;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Oracle shares rise on robust cloud growth;Rapid acceleration in group’s cloud business fails to offset sluggishness elsewhere;Oracle shares rallied on Wednesday after the business software company revealed strong growth in its cloud division, offsetting muted results in its legacy business.The California-based company’s cloud revenues jumped 39.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the quarter to the end of February. The advance came on the back of a 56.7 per cent surge in sales in units that offer businesses software that can be accessed on the cloud. Together with a platform that companies can use to develop their own applications in the cloud, these units for Oracle grew at a pace of 34 per cent in the previous quarter, Bloomberg data show.The rapid acceleration in Oracle’s cloud business failed, however, to offset sluggishness elsewhere. On-premise software sales, which still account for the bulk of Oracle’s revenues, fell 4.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Total revenues, meanwhile, slipped 3.4 per cent to $9bn, missing Wall Street estimates of $9.1bn. Net profits slid 14.1 per cent to $2.1bn.Oracle’s shares gained 3.8 per cent to $40.22, bringing their 2016 advance to 10.1 per cent as investors focused on the cloud division.“The overall [Oracle] cloud story is impressive,” Karl Keirstead, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to clients, cautioning that certain areas might still face problems.Elsewhere, Chipotle shares slipped after the US burrito chain warned it might face its first quarterly loss as a public company while it continued encountering pressure from concerns over food safety.The Denver-based group said it expected to post a current quarter loss of $1 a share “or worse”, compared with $3.88 a share in the first quarter of 2015 and weaker than Wall Street estimates of a profit of 3c a share.The company said it would “incur high expenses” for marketing aimed at attracting customers back into its stores, along with higher food costs due to new food safety protocols. Chipotle has taken the actions after outbreaks last year linked to the company made 485 people ill.The shares dropped 0.5 per cent to $500.35, extending their 12-month decline to 25.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, meanwhile, cut LinkedIn to “equal-weight” from “overweight”. Mr Nowak warned that with its current product offerings, the professional networking site “isn’t likely to be as big a platform as we previously thought”.The shares fell 5 per cent to $109.85 and have now shed half of their value this year.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had risen 0.6 per cent to 2,027.2, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 17,325.8, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8 per cent to 4,763.9.US equities pushed modestly higher after the Federal Reserve warned about the risks posed to the US by “global economic and financial developments”. At the same time, the US dollar fell against the euro and the yen as investors analysed the Fed’s policy statement.The energy and materials sectors led the way higher, while healthcare and financials were the biggest laggards.
88;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-03-15T20:21:36Z;Oracle’s cloud surge brightens quarter;;Larry Ellison’s Oracle has reported another jump in sales at its cloud software business, overshadowing a drop in overall revenues and sending its shares up more than 4 per cent in after-market trading.The California company, which was a pioneer of software designed for businesses, made profits of $2.1bn in the quarter through February, up from $2.5bn a year earlier. Revenues fell three per cent to $9bn, just shy of expectations of $9.1bn. Adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, were 64 cents and topped estimates by two cents.Oracle is looking to cash in on a move by businesses to begin using software that is accessed through the cloud, instead of on individual workstations. So-called software as a service revenue surged 57 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $583m. Total cloud revenues jumped 40 per cent.The still much larger on-premise software group generated revenues of $6.3bn, down 4 per cent from a year ago.Oracle also said it will buy back an additional $10bn stock under an existing programme “in future quarters”.The shares climbed more than 4 per cent in extended trading.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are advising on the sale.One source familiar with the matter said the sale could grow to $12bn. The deal, expected to be completed later on Tuesday, was issued by Berkshire and one of its finance subsidiaries.Investment grade debt sales have ratcheted up in the past two weeks, ending a drought caused when fixed-income and equity markets sold off sharply.Companies have sold $274.5bn of investment grade paper in the US this year, a record pace, according to data from Dealogic. However, the deals have been concentrated among fewer and fewer companies, reflecting the surge in average deal size.So far this year, 186 high grade companies have tapped US debt markets, the fewest since 1995.The $10bn sale by Berkshire Hathaway would be the year’s fourth largest, behind Anheuser Busch InBev’s $46bn transaction in January and $12bn offerings from Apple and Exxon Mobil last month.

Asked if this was a direct attack on Oracle, the leading database software company, he added: “They are the incumbents, absolutely.” The new software is not scheduled for release until mid-2017.In previous moves beyond Windows, Mr Nadella has released the Office 365 service to run on mobile devices using the Android and iOS operating systems from Google and Apple. Last week, Microsoft also bought Xamarin, a private company which makes tools for developers to write apps running on Android and iOS.Those departures were prompted by Microsoft’s failure to make a dent in the smartphone market with Windows, forcing it to look at other ways of reaching consumers on mobile devices. By contrast, the decision to turn SQL Server into a cross-platform play comes from a position of strength.Microsoft overtook IBM to move into second place in the $32bn a year database market between 2011-14, according to Gartner, the research group, although its 21 per cent market share was still only half that of Oracle.Scott Guthrie, the executive in charge of Microsoft’s cloud and enterprise group, indicated that it would price the software in line with what it charges on Windows, a level he said would be “disruptive” to other database companies.Microsoft quotes a price of $13,000 for running its database software on the most basic servers, compared to a list price of more than $100,000 for a similar Oracle licence once various add-on features are included, according to Donald Feinberg, a Gartner analyst. Oracle discounts often mean its customers pay significantly less than the list price, though Microsoft’s software was still likely to be much cheaper, he added.
92;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2016-01-29T22:34:52Z;Cancel those Omaha tickets, Berkshire to webcast investor meeting;;"Is Warren Buffett shorting stocks in Omaha hotels companies?
For the past couple of years, he has been telling the 40,000 or so shareholders who usually attend the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting that they should consider using the Airbnb room sharing service to avoid price gouging by hoteliers in the company’s home town.Now the investment guru has come up with an even more radical idea: a webcast so investors can watch the famous event without having to make the trek to Nebraska at all, writes US investment correspondent Stephen Foley.Plans are afoot to broadcast this year’s meeting on April 30, according to insiders, meaning Mr Buffett and his sidekick, Berkshire vice-chairman Charlie Munger, could enjoy the biggest ever audience for their annual Q&A session.The wisecracking pair take audience questions for the best part of six hours, covering everything from the minutiae of Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries to Mr Buffett’s investment philosophy and macroeconomic outlook.Such is the attendance, hotels get booked up a year in advance and many demand that guests book in for three nights, whether they want to or not. The Wall Street Journal was first to report planning for a webcast alternative, a short time ago.Online viewers will not be getting the full “Woodstock of Capitalism” experience, of course. Events in Omaha include personal appearances by Mr Buffett, and a mini-trade fair featuring goods from most of Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries and investee companies, including See’s Candies, Fruit of the Loom clothing and products from Coca-Cola and Heinz.But a webcast would mean that the man they call the Oracle of Omaha will be able to disseminate his investment wisdom even to those who do not make the pilgrimage – and Omaha’s hoteliers must be quaking in their boots."
93;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T22:40:49+0000;Tableau thrives as it seeks to free data from ‘Excel hell’;The fast-growing Seattle software maker helping managers bring dry charts to life;"In 1993, Pat Hanrahan was part of the Pixar team that won an Oscar for animation software. A decade later, he co-founded a company that aimed to bring a similar visual flair to the presentation of business data.Tableau Software has not yet won as many garlands as Pixar, the maker of the Toy Story series. But rapid sales growth, partly at the expense of Microsoft’s Excel, has given it a $6bn market capitalisation and an evangelical following among managers trying to make sense of today’s data deluge.There is something Apple-like about the zeal with which Tableau users discuss the product. More than 10,000 attended an annual conference in October in Las Vegas, sitting in on sessions with titles such as “Data in the Wild: Taming it in Tableau”, “Hot. Dirty. Sets”, “Tableau Jedi Calcs: Welcome to the Dark Side” and “Dashboarding on the Edge of Impossible”.Many of these attendees will harbour an ambition to get one over on peers by being granted “Zen Master” status by Tableau, the Seattle-based company’s answer to Microsoft’s “MVP” or “Most Valuable Professional” designation for users of tools such as Excel and PowerPoint. The Zen Master honour is accorded for willingness to share knowledge with others as well as individual expertise; it is announced with a suitably enigmatic gesture: the delivery of an inscribed pebble.Tableau’s software pulls in business data from a number of internal and external sources (spreadsheets, databases, the cloud), allows rapid manipulation of that data and various ways of visualising it. Outputs can be viewed individually, merged into dashboards or presented as more of a narrative. Ease of use is uppermost in Tableau design considerations — it describes itself as “self-service analytics”. Customers supplying enthusiastic testimonials about the product on the company’s website include Deloitte, the auditor and consultant; Tesla Motors; and Barclays, the UK bank. Zen Masters can spring from less obvious quarters, though. Among the 21 users who bear that title is Robert Radburn, research and insight team leader at Leicestershire County Council in the UK. “It’s tough financial times for local government so we are using more and more data to help us understand how to redesign our services,” he says, adding that Tableau lets him do this in meetings faster than Excel.Mr Radburn believes that such tools mean an analyst does not need to know a particular domain inside out: “I don’t have to be an expert in social work or highways maintenance to bring fresh insight to that data.”Chatting with Christian Chabot, Tableau’s chief executive and one of the co-founders of the business with Prof Hanrahan (who still teaches computer graphics at Stanford University), it becomes clear that he greatly admires Apple and its early spirit of innovation. Mr Chabot enthusiastically quotes the late Steve Jobs (“computers are like a bicycle for our minds”), and echoes Jobs’ passion for the power of computers to augment human intellect.And then there is a shared willingness to tweak the tail of Microsoft. Mr Chabot says managers trap themselves in “Excel hell” when they choose to track and visualise data using the ubiquitous spreadsheet software. He even goes so far as to argue that spreadsheets have provided “no contribution to the human understanding of facts” over the past 30 years.Tableau is not pitched as a direct replacement for Excel: it is more expensive and its licensing model is not designed to put a copy of the software on the desktop of every employee.But Mr Chabot has a strong conviction that there is a big opportunity in the middle ground between desktop tools such as Excel and the beefier “enterprise business intelligence” software sold by the likes of Oracle, IBM and SAP.The Tableau boss is equally dismissive of this latter sector, which he sees as having stagnated. “The name alone [enterprise business intelligence software] instils fear in most people,” he says, accusing the products of being “architecture-heavy, development-intensive, slow-moving and understood only by technical specialists — that’s more than one minor annoyance”.Tableau releases its 2015 fourth-quarter results next Thursday. It posted sales of $451m for the first nine months of the year, a 67 per cent increase on the same period in 2014, although the net loss for the period — a byproduct of the group’s land-grab strategy — widened to $42m.Amid stock market volatility and a more sceptical approach to technology company valuations, the group’s shares have shed about 40 per cent of their value since peaking last summer. Mr Chabot, however, believes that there are “decades of growth ahead” based on the fact that its success to date has delivered Tableau just “1 per cent or 2 per cent” of the market.Among data visualisation diehards, such as those who thronged the Tableau conference last year, there is perhaps no greater crime than simply accepting the default charts offered by Excel, the dreaded three-dimensional pie chart being the biggest culprit of all.This is a trap Tableau has been keen to avoid, seeing “intelligent defaults” as a source of market differentiation. Keeping up with best practice in visualisation consequently forms an important part of its research and development activity, headed by Jock Mackinlay. An early recruit to the Tableau team, Mr Mackinlay was part of the influential Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where he worked with experts on computer graphics and user interfaces in the late 1980s. That team coined the phrase “information visualisation” making Mr Mackinlay well placed to assess how the industry has progressed since. Kinder on Excel than his CEO (“a fantastic tool for a different kind of problem”), his prime concern is keeping rank-and-file humans — and not ever-advancing technology — in charge of decision-making. “There’s nothing wrong with building up predictive analytics algorithms, but the problem is that there are so few data scientists in the world. If that was the only way you could do it, it would take too long — machine learning or predictive al­gorithms are only part of the solution.” Businesses need to respond to advances in computing by giving managers on the ground the access to the data they need to make informed decisions, rather than falling back on old habits of centralisation, Mr Chabot says. “The most important thing a leader needs to do now within an organisation is to start fomenting the cultural change and the belief system that we should trust our people with access to the data.”At December’s Information is Beautiful data visualisation awards in London, the “Free Dataviz Tool” category was dominated by open source software. The overall winner was D3, an open source software library for creating interactive web graphics and, like Tableau, a tool with a Stanford University origin. Second place went to R, an open language for statistical and graphical computing. But third place went to Tableau Public, a free version of Tableau’s software that, along with a free iPad app, will be key to building a new generation of visual analyst, the company hopes. Tools like D3 and R, which require programming knowledge, do not represent direct competition for Tableau. Instead, new players such as Sweden’s Qlik and US-based Alteryx as well as renewed efforts from traditional heavyweights such as IBM, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, form the market reference points.To read the first article in this two-part series, “Charts that can withstand the data deluge”, visit ft.com/smartchartsFurther reading from the FT archive: Clive Cookson’s 2013 FT Magazine article on Edward Tufte, “the guru of graphics, the high priest of presentation”"

95;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-12-21T21:31:56Z;Oracle settles Java security flaw charge;FTC claimed tech group deceived computer users over safety of its software;Oracle has suffered another black eye over security flaws in its widely used Java software, as the US tech company on Monday settled a regulatory charge that it had deceived computer users about the safety of the software.Java was singled out by Larry Ellison, the company’s chairman, as the key asset in his 2010 purchase of server maker Sun Microsystems. The software, which makes possible many features of web browsing, has since become an important weapon in Oracle’s arsenal against other tech companies. It prompted a partially successful lawsuit against Google’s Android mobile operating system that critics warn could have far-reaching effects in the tech world.But security weaknesses in Java, dating from long before Oracle’s acquisition, have also made the software a problem for the company. In the worst incident, a number of leading tech companies, including Apple and Facebook, revealed in 2013 that attackers had used flaws in the software to penetrate their systems.On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission accused Oracle of deceiving consumers over the degree to which updating the Java software to newer, safer versions protects their computers from attack. The complaint relates to the Java Standard Edition, which is installed on more than 850m PCs, the regulator said.According to the complaint, Oracle did not warn computer users that updating Java does not automatically remove older — and less secure — versions of the software, with only the most recent version being deleted. That left millions of users exposed to attacks, including having the usernames and passwords of their financial accounts stolen, the regulator said.The problem continued even though Oracle “was aware of the insufficiency of its update process” in 2011, the FTC said.“When a company’s software is on hundreds of millions of computers, it is vital that its statements are true and its security updates actually provide security for the software,” Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s consumer protection bureau, said.Under a consent agreement announced on Monday, Oracle has been ordered to notify consumers who are updating Java if they have older versions of the software on their machines and give them option to uninstall it.Oracle declined to comment on the charge.
96;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-12-17T00:48:52Z;Strong dollar hits Oracle sales and profits;Cloud computing cheers software maker as it posts gains;Oracle’s latest quarterly sales and profits took a hit from a stronger US dollar, but its cloud computing business, which it is counting on as an engine of growth, posted gains.The software maker’s profits declined by 12 per cent to $2.2bn in the quarter to the end of November. That decline would have been only 3 per cent without the drag from the dollar.Cloud revenue accounted for 7 per cent of total revenues in the second quarter, up from 5 per cent in the same period in 2014.“We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition,” said Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-chief executive, adding that fiscal 2016 should prove to be “a trough year for profitability as we move to the cloud”.Concerns about how the growing popularity of cloud services across the IT sector were affecting Oracle’s traditional software business have hung over its shares all year. The stock had declined 13.5 per cent for 2015 as of the close of trading on Wednesday. The California-based company’s shares rose 2.4 per cent in after-hours trading but later fell back around 1 per cent as investors digested its outlook.Overall sales dropped 6 per cent to $9bn, just behind Wall Street estimates of $9.1bn. Without currency fluctuations, revenue would have been flat year on year. Adjusted earnings per share were 63 cents, topping expectations by three cents.Oracle posted a 26 per cent gain in sales at its cloud division as its software-as-a-service business shined. Ms Catz predicted a “material second-half acceleration”, as Oracle was “taking share in the industry”.Many of the biggest companies in the technology sector, such as Microsoft, are trying to deepen their exposure to the burgeoning trend of corporate customers moving computing operations from individual workstations to centralised data centres.Despite predicting that it was past the worst of the hit to profits from this transition, Oracle still derives 71 per cent of its revenues from traditional “on-premise” software, which is installed locally. Here, sales were down 7 per cent at $6.4bn, which Ms Catz said was “better than expected”.New software licences, usually a forward indicator of performance, were 12 per cent lower on a constant currency basis, but 18 per cent down in dollar terms. In a note to clients, analysts at Citi said licence revenues were “not as bad” as investors’ “low expectations”.In the current third quarter, Ms Catz said that total cloud and on-premise software revenue would grow 3 to 4 per cent, after adjusting for currency fluctuations. Total sales could increase as much as 3 per cent on the same basis, she added, with cloud revenues likely to increase by upwards of 50 per cent.

98;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-12-08T17:21:03Z;Salesforce: fast talk;The enterprise software company is avoiding demands that it make any money;"Mealy-mouthed chief executives make way: Salesforce’s founder and chief executive Marc Benioff is coming through. Salesforce is going to hit $6bn in sales “faster than any other enterprise software company in history”.It is an odd sort of milestone, certainly, but Salesforce will have a reasonable claim to it next year, when it is on course to hit the $6bn figure 17 years after founding and 12 years after its initial public offering. But it is close. Oracle, taking inflation into account, got there 19 years after founding and only 10 years after its IPO. And Microsoft, on the same basis, got there in 1993, at 18 years old and seven years after its IPO.The bombast is a little overdone. For a real speed demon in enterprise software, and a cautionary tale, look to Siebel Systems, which surpassed $1bn in revenues in 2000, after seven years. It took Salesforce 10 years to hit that more rounded marker. However, Siebel burnt out. It was over-specialised in customer relationship management software and, struggling financially, sold itself to Oracle in 2006.There is no sign that Salesforce is risking the same fate but there is not much sign of profits either. The company is on course for its fifth straight year of net losses — margins sacrificed to heavy spending on marketing and the incessant pursuit of growth. Nemesis Oracle has not made an annual loss since 1992; SAP and Microsoft have never recorded one. All three companies were printing cash when their top lines reached $6bn. Meanwhile, Mr Benioff aims only to hit $8bn of revenues in 2017 and $10bn shortly thereafter.At a different time, shareholders would be justified in demanding that Mr Benioff dial down the rhetoric and the expenses, and dial up the profits. But having correctly bet that corporate customers would move to the cloud, he has time to play with. Even SAP’s chief executive has said that growth in profit margins is irrelevant as the German company tries to adapt to a market changed by Salesforce.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
99;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-10-23T18:20:21Z;Big Tech back in vogue on Wall Street;Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are displaying cost discipline, but how long will it last?;The sometimes fractious relations between Wall Street and Silicon Valley enjoyed a moment of harmony on Thursday, as a combined $100bn was added to the stock market value of three of the world’s biggest technology companies.But with the tech giants projecting future jumps in capital spending and on a collision course for greater — potentially margin-eroding — competition, it was a harmony that may be shortlived.The share price bounce for Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet (the new holding company for Google) came as the three companies reported third-quarter earnings and took their combined market value to some $1,200bn.In their financial statements and comments in conference calls with analysts, the three conveyed a remarkably consistent message. The new mantra from the west coast of the US: greater cost discipline is the order of the day. New and more detailed disclosures are being tried to give investors a better understanding of how the companies are evolving. Where possible, excess cash is being returned to shareholders, not frittered away on the latest faddish tech ideas.But behind these more shareholder-friendly messages was an unapologetic recognition of the effects of their uniformly expansionist strategies. All three companies said they were anticipating big periodic jumps in spending as they build out the networks of data centres needed to keep up with global internet competitors.For this week, however, the overriding tone has been one of conciliation. Companies that once seemed almost to scorn Wall Street oversight, and which had a history of disappointing investors with surges in spending that dented their margins, appear united in their desire to appease their shareholders.Of the three, it is Amazon’s changed relations with Wall Street that have been most remarkable. Investors had grown weary of its high-growth, profitless business model, marking down its shares 25 per cent in 2014 in the midst of a strong bull market. But Amazon’s share price has doubled since the beginning of the year, including Thursday’s after-market gain, as it has presented a different face to the financial markets.Amazon’s longstanding policy has been to offer few shareholder incentives — it has never issued dividends or repurchased shares, and the company manages profits to be close to zero.The company’s efforts to get back into the good graces of its investors began early this year when it pledged to break out results separately for its Amazon Web Services business, and as management went on an unusual shareholder tour. The AWS figures, when they came in April, revealed that the cloud computing service was highly profitable, and still growing fast despite already being the biggest provider in its sector.Microsoft unveiled a new segmental reporting arrangement of its own on Thursday, in an attempt to present a clearer picture of how the move to cloud computing is affecting its business. And the newly-named Alphabet is hoping for a lift with its own promise of greater disclosure three months from now, when it next reports quarterly earnings. After years of pressure from Wall Street, the company has said it will separate the results of its Google internet services business from its many other investments, ranging from driverless cars to internet access networks.Results boosted by North America and cloud computingRead moreEven before that, a studied series of shareholder-friendly gestures has already paid off for Alphabet. Along with greater transparency, new chief financial officer Ruth Porat pledged a focus on cost controls after arriving at the company earlier this year, prompting a jump in Alphabet’s share price.The Porat effect was in evidence again on Thursday, as the company announced its first-ever return of capital to shareholders in the form of a stock buyback of up to $5.1bn. The figure was small in relation to Google’s net cash of $69bn and Ms Porat herself on Thursday pledged an unshaken commitment to the company’s growth strategy.But the signalling to Wall Street has had a powerful effect. Eleven years after its IPO, when it laid out its intention to pursue a financial strategy with little regard to immediate shareholder gratification, the company formerly known as Google has sent a clear message that things have changed.Meanwhile, Microsoft’s stock touched a new 15-year high in after-market trading. Brent Thill, who tracks the company as an analyst at UBS, said Wall Street’s fears that it was tied to a shrinking personal computer industry were giving way to a new confidence in its positioning in the growth market for cloud computing.“Microsoft moved to the cloud years ahead of Oracle and others in the industry,” said Mr Thill. With operating margins coming in ahead of UBS’s forecasts, “they are showing as they move to the cloud they can actually become more profitable . . . Their cost control has been exceptional.”Whether the good feelings that washed through Wall Street on Thursday will last is another matter. All three companies warned that capital spending would remain heavy — and, in the cases of Amazon and Alphabet, volatile — as they build out their global technology platforms.To maintain its number-two position in cloud computing behind AWS, Microsoft is spending $1.5bn this year in data centres around the world, after opening new facilities in India recently. “Global scale is a must,” said Satya Nadella, chief executive. Even as it shaves costs with continuing lay-offs across the business, Amy Hood, finance director, warned investors to expect Microsoft to “accelerate our investment in data centres and capital equipment”.Windows helps drive revenue and earnings above forecastsRead moreAmazon also said it had no intention of slowing down its pace of investment. “Innovation and investment will continue and can be lumpy over time,” said Brian Olsavsky, chief financial officer. At the same time he insisted Amazon’s investment levels were “not as much of a pendulum as has been portrayed”.If the big tech companies are finding themselves back in favour on Wall Street, it could be as much a result of their perceived safety in a volatile market as their near-term results.Mr Thill said that as the tech industry’s latest growth cycle approached its end, there was a “flight to safety” that was benefiting Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. Several smaller “point solution” tech companies’ stocks fell as the larger companies’ leapt on Thursday evening. For now, it seems, “Big Tech” is the place to be.

101;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-09-24T22:25:27Z;"Share buybacks: don’t panic; worry";After three years of vigorous growth buyback are going sideways;"There are a lot of silly theories about what moves the stock market. One thinks of “psychologically important levels”; of “money on the sidelines”; of the venerable Fed Model. Among the dreck, though, there are a few that make good sense. Here’s one: in the short term, buybacks support stocks. Last year, for example, companies in the S&P 500 bought back nearly 3 per cent of the index’s equity (netting out the companies’ equity issuance). That is a lot of incremental demand and, indeed, corporations have been one of the few consistent net buyers of US equities in recent years.The possibility that this source of (short-term) support might dissolve is alarming. In the second quarter, S&P companies bought back a net $104bn in shares, 7 per cent more than in last years’ second quarter, on S&P Capital IQ data. No need to panic.Zoom out a little, however, and complacency fades. First off, one-quarter aside, the trend is heading in the wrong direction: over two years, buybacks are going sideways, after three years of vigorous growth. Further, the buying is concentrated. Four companies — Apple, Oracle, Qualcomm, and AbbVie — contributed more than a fifth of the total buying last quarter. Other former buyback stalwarts — GE, Goldman Sachs, Chevron, Walmart, and Coca-Cola — are backing off.Looking at buybacks by sector raises another worry. The energy sector was buying more than $10bn a quarter a year ago; less than $2bn now. Materials has seen a similar collapse. Media’s buying is off by a third. These sectors have performed poorly this year. One wonders if, in a buyback driven market, operational weakness starts stocks falling. This makes boards shy of buybacks, taking a buyer out of the market and depressing prices. And fewer buybacks mean lower earnings per share growth — a third hit to the shares. A buyback driven market may, in other words, be a very volatile one. So don’t panic; but some worry is in order.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.comShare buybacks are unlikely to move markets / From Dan Brocklebank"
102;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-09-16T21:05:30Z;Cloud shift casts shadow on Oracle result;Executives maintain software company taking market share from rivals despite revenue fall as dollar rises;The shift to the cloud put another dent in Oracle’s revenues in its latest quarter, according to the latest earnings released on Wednesday.But the short-term financial impact failed to defuse the enthusiasm of its executives, who continued to maintain that the US software company was eating into the market share of its main cloud rivals.Oracle blamed weakening global economic conditions for its decision to issue a cautious financial forecast for its current quarter, sending its share price down about 2 per cent after the guidance was issued on a conference call with analysts.New licence revenue — traditionally a key indicator of the health of software companies, which rely heavily on booking upfront sales — fell by 16 per cent in the three months to the end of August, or 9 per cent after adjusting for currency changes.The decline echoed the 10 per cent fall that Oracle recorded in the previous quarter, a figure which spooked Wall Street as investors worried that the company was struggling with the transition to the cloud.However, Oracle continued to report strong gains in its far smaller cloud business in the latest quarter, adding weight to its claims that the decline in traditional software was a symptom of its success in shifting customer to its cloud services, where part of the revenue is deferred until later periods. Cloud revenues rose 34 per cent in constant currency terms, close to the 35 per cent of the preceding three months.In a further move to reassure Wall Street, Oracle executives said the company was on the verge of seeing a big pay-off after what they described as three years of operating as a “start-up” in the cloud business.Larry Ellison, chairman, predicted that operating profit margins from the cloud would jump from around 40 per cent to 80 per cent in the next two years. He also said the company was on track to book $1.5-2bn of new cloud business this year, dwarfing cloud rival Salesforce.com.Overall revenues in the quarter fell by 2 per cent to $8.45bn, though they would have grown by 7 per cent had it not been the rise of the US dollar.The dollar is set to weigh on results again in the present quarter, leading executives to warn of a revenue decline of between 5 to 8 per cent if currency rates stay at their present level.Wall Street had been expecting revenues to be largely unchanged for the period compared with the year before.Earnings per share, on the pro forma basis on which investors judge the company, fell to 53 cents from 62 cents the year before, though Oracle said they would have been six cents higher had it not been for the currency movements.
103;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
104;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-09-16T05:30:07Z;The power of prizes to encourage innovation;The power of prize money is rediscovered to spur innovation;"In 1906, Lord Northcliffe, the proprietor of Britain’s Daily Mail newspaper, offered a £10,000 prize to the first aviators to cross the Atlantic Ocean, just three years after the Wright Brothers ascended into the sky at Kitty Hawk. The notion that anyone could get across a 2,000-mile stretch of water was so preposterous that it prompted the satirical magazine Punch to offer prizes of its own: £10,000 apiece to anyone who could swim the Atlantic, travel to Mars and back, or journey to the centre of the earth.Lord Northcliffe got the last laugh, of course. With his money and his mouthpiece at the Daily Mail, and his political connections, few people were able to champion the possibilities of air travel — for scientific progress, for business and for warfare — so effectively. His newspaper offered a string of smaller prizes for smaller aeronautical feats before the big one was finally won on June 15, 1919, when John Alcock and Arthur Brown inelegantly landed their modified Vickers Vimy nose first in an Irish bog after a 16-hour flight from Newfoundland.A century later, the power of prizes to spur innovation has been rediscovered by a new generation of wealthy individuals. Exploring space or finding extraterrestrial life? Cleaning the oceans or clearing the atmosphere? Curing disease or looking for the key to immortality? For anyone with ambitious goals, offering a prize can get you a bigger bang for your buck than traditional giving. Think of it like leveraging your investment portfolio: a carefully crafted challenge spurs spending by competing teams that can add up to many times the value of the prize purse.“It is something like the opposite of the traditional model of philanthropy,” says Paul Jacobs, who is executive chairman of Qualcomm, the semiconductor giant founded by his father in 1985, and whose charitable arm is going to give $10m to anyone who can make the Tricorder from Star Trek a reality (of which more in a moment).“People are always sceptical about charitable organisations and about how many of their dollars actually get to the cause that needs funding,” Jacobs says. “In the traditional model, you put in money and somewhat less of it than you put in gets there. In prizes, somehow more money gets there than gets put in.”Today’s prizologists take their inspiration from another figure in aviation history, Raymond Orteig, a Franco-American hotelier who, just weeks before Alcock and Brown’s voyage, offered $25,000 for the first person from any Allied country to fly between New York and Paris. By the time an obscure air mail pilot from St Louis, Missouri, called Charles Lindbergh pipped better-funded and better-known teams to the prize in 1927, the nation had become obsessed with the feats of engineering and design, and daring, of the competitors.Peter Diamandis, a young scientist and entrepreneur who had been trying to build companies launching satellites into space, read Lindbergh’s account of his transatlantic flight in 1994 and resolved to bring the spirit of the Orteig prize to the commercial space race. Two years later, he travelled to St Louis to launch a competition to build a reusable craft for suborbital space travel. The XPrize was born.The ship that won that first prize, a $10m cheque from the Ansari family, whose wealth was built in the telecoms equipment industry, is now part of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic venture.XPrize is the biggest and best known of the private organisations running such challenges, with some $100m of prizes either awarded or still up for grabs, seeking a dizzyingly diverse range of breakthroughs including stamping out adult illiteracy, radically improving the clean-up of oil spills and landing robots on the moon. The organisation is closely allied with Google — or Alphabet as we shall soon have to start calling it — to reflect its ambitions to move beyond search engines into technologies such as drones, self-driving cars and internet-enabled thermostats.A $30m lunar lander prize is sponsored by Google. Larry Page, the company’s founder, is a trustee and Wendy Schmidt, wife of Google chairman Eric Schmidt, has twice dipped into her family’s fortune to fund environmental challenges through XPrize — something she says she would love to do again.“When Eric and I do anything, we are trying to look at transformational change and trying to look at systems change,” Schmidt says.“This is an urgent problem. We are looking at the outcome of a century of maladaptive behaviour, when it comes to the human interface with the natural world. We’re depleting things, we’re using reckless technologies in the oceans, we’re doing things that maybe create a better standard of living for people in the short term, but in the long term they’re simply not sustainable.”Schmidt’s first foray into prizology came after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, when it became painfully clear that clean-up technology had not advanced in the two decades since the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled gallons of crude oil in the Gulf of Alaska in 1989. The winning design, using spinning plastic disks that attract the oil, proved it could skim oil from the surface of the water at more than four times the industry standard rate.In July, Schmidt awarded her second XPrize to a company called Sunburst Sensors, which won a competition to develop a device to accurately track the acidification of the world’s oceans, a problem with potential dire consequences for marine life.Prizes allow for the possibility that innovation could spring from somewhere unexpected, anywhere in the world, she says, citing the Las Vegas tattoo artist who sketched his oil clean-up idea on the back of a casino napkin and ended up among the semi-finalists.Star Trek wasn’t a TV series; it was a business planThe list of illustrious prizologists grows longer seemingly by the week. Elon Musk, the PayPal co-founder who now runs both SpaceX, the rocket company, and Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, is funding a Global Learning XPrize for software that can teach children anywhere in the world the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic.Barbara Bush, the former US first lady, is sponsoring an adult literacy prize. The Methuselah Foundation, whose backers include Peter Thiel, the billionaire libertarian, and Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, will reward breakthroughs in growing new human tissue and new organs.A Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation challenge prize spurred the university Caltech to invent a self-cleaning, solar-powered toilet that turns human waste into hydrogen and fertiliser.Following the examples of these modern-day Northcliffes and Orteigs, governments are also again getting back into the prizes game.In the US, the website Challenge.gov has centralised and encouraged prize competitions across 75 government agencies, from Nasa to the US Mint, awarding more than 400 payouts totalling more than $120m in four years, and Darpa, the US Defence department’s research arm, has launched multimillion-dollar prizes for self-driving tanks and maintenance droids.Things have come full circle. As early as the 16th century, the Spanish royal family was offering money to anyone who could solve the accursed problem of accurately pinpointing a ship’s longitude while at sea. The British government’s Longitude Act of 1714 offered rewards for improvements in naval navigation and gave the world the marine chronometer.Last year, the independent UK charity Nesta — originally funded by an endowment from the National Lottery as the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts — established a new Longitude Prize, which will hand out £10m for a “cost-effective, accurate, rapid and easy-to-use test for bacterial infections” to help combat the rise of drug-resistant bacteria.Designing a good prize is an art and a science. The challenge must be sufficiently ambitious but conceivably attainable. The prize money has to be the right amount to attract the broadest range of participants and it has to be calculated to capture the public’s imagination, too. PR is part of the game. Hence all the Star Trek.Next year, Trekkies worldwide will be marking the 50th anniversary of the start of the original series, while the Trekkies at XPrize will be awarding the Qualcomm Foundation’s $10m to the developer of a real-life Tricorder, the handheld scanner used by Dr McCoy for sensing, computing and recording medical data from patients.The Tricorder XPrize is down to seven finalists now, including teams from India and Taiwan as well as north America. While wearable fitness trackers and healthcare apps are becoming ubiquitous, the competition aims to show they can be combined with accurate medical diagnostics, made easy enough to use to genuinely “put healthcare in the palm of your hand”. The device and any attachments must weigh less than 5lb, monitor five vital signs and detect 15 medical conditions, according to the rules.Even before it has been awarded, the leverage on that $10m is being felt. One of the teams, Canadian company CloudDX, is already taking pre-orders for its Vitaliti, a necklace that can track vital signs and fitness.Scanadu, a medical device venture headquartered out of a Nasa research centre in Silicon Valley, has re-engineered its business in the hope of winning the prize for its grab-bag of medical kits, including a blood pressure monitor called the Scout, which users press against their forehead, all of which connect wirelessly to a smartphone app.Star Trek “wasn’t a TV show”, says Walter De Brouwer, Scanadu’s wild-haired founder. “It was a business plan.”The Tricorders are undergoing testing with real volunteers in San Diego over the next few months, before a winner is crowned in time for the publicity around the golden anniversary.Qualcomm’s Jacobs says Diamandis had him sold on the Tricorder prize within moments of starting his pitch for sponsorship. “We all grew up watching Star Trek; it’s why every engineer is trying to work on Star Trek things.”If Punch magazine were still publishing, it would no doubt be offering a satirical “Warp Drive XPrize” and ribbing today’s prizologists as mercilessly as it did Lord Northcliffe. But who really will have the last laugh?"
105;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-09-15T06:58:18Z;The Oracle’s verdict on Jeremy Corbyn;;I was at the Greek archaeological site of Delphi last weekend, attending a conference on Europe’s future, when the news arrived that Jeremy Corbyn, a 66-year-old leftwinger, had been elected as leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party. I climbed up the hill and asked the Oracle for some predictions.TB: Oh, Oracle, will the world see Corbyn’s triumph as irrelevant? After all, Labour’s never going to win a general election under him, so he will never be prime minister.ORACLE: Not irrelevant, my friend, but illustrative. The world will see Corbyn’s success as one more that Britain, like a snail, is retreating from the international stage and withdrawing into itself.TB: Explain that a bit more, Oracle.ORACLE: In foreign and security policy, Corbyn is an isolationist. He gives the impression that he dreams at night of building socialism on one island. But consider two other political parties, the Scottish Nationalists and the rightwing populist UK Independence party. Each, in its own way, is also inward-looking and not engaged in the geopolitical issues of our age. As for the Conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron…TB: What about it?ORACLE: Under Cameron, the British have been all but invisible in every big challenge that faces Europe, from the Ukraine conflict to the eurozone crisis – except insofar as they want to defend their own narrow interests. On the refugee emergency, they have been dragged unwillingly into displaying a smidgeon more generosity. As for the foreign office, governments have used it for years as a trade promotion agency and, with astounding stupidity, have run down its capacity to supply expert analysis of world problems.TB: Oh, Oracle, does Corbyn’s victory mean “Brexit” – a British vote to leave the EU in a referendum before the end of 2017 – is certain?ORACLE: My friend, what makes you think I give straight Yes or No answers? Corbyn’s victory increases the risk of Brexit, but does not make it inevitable.TB: How so?ORACLE: Corbyn voted in 1975 against British membership of the Common Market, the EU’s predecessor. In Corbyn’s eyes, the EU waves the flag for capitalism and grovels to multinational companies. He thinks the EU does nothing for the toiling masses and even less for socialism. He is not a credible figure to lead a pro-EU referendum campaign for the Labour Party. Quite a few Labour voters will drift into the anti-EU camp.TB: So the Brexit forces can start planning their victory celebrations?ORACLE: Let me finish, will you? The pro-EU cause is far from lost in Britain. There is a good chance that it will prevail in the referendum. What is essential is that Cameron, having renegotiated Britain’s membership terms, campaigns enthusiastically to stay in the EU. The British are cautious people, famous for common sense. A majority will follow Cameron’s lead, so long as he acts and sounds as if he believes sincerely in what he’s saying – which, admittedly, is not something he’s well-known for.TB: Oh, Oracle, do Corbyn’s views on world affairs make him the most radical leader of a mainstream political party that Britain has ever had?ORACLE: Are you trying to catch me out, my friend? I do forecasts, not historical questions. But since you ask, he is the most radical since George Lansbury, the Labour Party’s leader from 1932 to 1935. Lansbury was a pacifist deeply opposed to British rearmament despite the menace from Nazi Germany.TB: What would a Corbyn government’s foreign policy look like?ORACLE: There probably won’t ever be a Corbyn-led government. For now, as leader of Britain’s main opposition party, Corbyn can be expected to play down his commitment to pulling Britain out of Nato. He will probably also tone down his defence of Russia’s armed intervention in Ukraine. After all, the only other British party leader who sticks up for Russia is Nigel Farage of Ukip. Awkward company to be in!TB: I like your company, Oracle.ORACLE: Keep your hands to yourself and get back to your conference.
106;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-08-27T15:51:21Z;Box and its lessons for ambitious technology start-ups;The cloud storage unicorn co-founded by Levie has had a rough ride;What does the future hold for unicorns?There are now 131 private tech companies valued at $1bn or more — a threshold that has earned them the “unicorn” label — according to research provider CB Insights. But if a 10-figure valuation was once rare enough to justify comparison with mythical one-horned creatures, it draws a blasé response in the current tech boom.“Billion is the new hundred million,” says Aaron Levie, co-founder and chief executive of Box, a cloud software company and former unicorn. The name “only works if it implies some level of scarcity or rarity”, and it no longer does any more, he says.Mr Levie’s company now stands as a lesson in what may lie ahead for many of the unicorns. Earlier this year, Box became one of the few to have completed a Wall Street listing, prompted by a thirst for capital that could not be satisfied in the private markets.But it has been a rough ride. The August stock market rout hit its already battered stock price, pushing the shares below their initial public offering price and leaving them at barely half the peak they hit early this year.Like the chief executives of many public companies in a similar position before him, Mr Levie claims this is the result of a misconception. “You’ve seen it with Netflix or Facebook or lots of companies that have been misunderstood on what the long-term vision is,” he says. “I think we’re maybe in one of those periods temporarily.”Box delayed plans for a share sale last year, at a time when shares in cloud computing companies fell. The company was eventually valued in its IPO at less than it had been in its previous round of private capital-raising. That fate now awaits many unicorns, warns Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley, as the slump in public share prices opens an even bigger gulf with overheated private valuations.Fast-talking, irreverent and at times facetious, Mr Levie says he has not given up the trappings of the start-up entrepreneur — the brightly coloured canvas shoes he always wears, or the barbed tweets. (A typical recent example: “So Trump apparently won that debate. Scary times when reality television figures are indistinguishable from plausible presidents.”)Along with school friend Dylan Smith, Mr Levie dropped out of college to start the company. A decade on, at the age of 30, the touches of grey around the temples are spreading — something, he says, that is “correlated with doing lots of stressful things”. But he plays along with the suggestion that it might bring some useful gravitas: “People trust me way more now.”During its troubled IPO, Box became a lightning rod for some of the biggest issues in the software world.Companies that are building large, leading market positions decide to invest in growth and invest in dominating their market and that’s what we’ve been doingOne is whether the largest tech companies such as Amazon and Google will march into the most promising cloud services, swallowing up or wiping out smaller start-ups. The market of companies such as Box is generally described as cloud storage — holding information for customers in centralised data repositories. To many, that sounds like a commodity-like service that will end up being dominated by companies with massive scale.Mr Levie says this is a misunderstanding of Box’s business and that it is selling a higher level of service based on securing and managing information, not just storing it: “Where our revenue comes from is businesses that care about security and data control and compliance and workflow, and what we give them is free storage as well.”With the highly fragmented online data storage and management sector facing consolidation, Box is racing to prove that it can become one of the survivors. A partnership this year with IBM and the extension of an alliance with Microsoft have helped to advance its hopes of being seen as a key element of the cloud computing infrastructure, a place where large companies and governments store their data. But with expected revenues of only $290m this year, it still has a long way to go.A second issue raised by Box concerns the stock market’s willingness to back the financial model of cloud software companies, which spend heavily to acquire customers in anticipation of subscription income stretching far into the future. Its losses were held up during its IPO as evidence of a lack of discipline, although Mr Levie rejects the criticism.“If you look in history, that would be how you would describe Amazon, how you would be describing Salesforce.com early on,” he says. “Companies that are building large, leading market positions decide to invest in growth and invest in dominating their market and that’s what we’ve been doing.”Moderating its marketing spending ahead of its IPO helped to silence some of the criticism. But if Box bends to the market and spends less money now trying to win new clients, does that not mean it is crimping its growth in the longer term? Mr Levie shows mo­mentary frustration at the question: “So now you’re saying that you want me to spend more? You’ve got to decide. You’ve got to land on an answer here.”This is the quandary for all so-called “software as a service” companies, caught between conflicting pressures to invest for growth and demonstrate near-term returns. Box is out to prove it can stop burning cash — it has set a target of early 2017 for turning cash flow positive — but it is also facing a sharp revenue decline, with growth slowing to 34 per cent this year from 74 per cent the year before.The company proves that at least one thing has not changed about the software industry as it moves to the cloud. Selling to enterprise customers — big companies and governments — is still a lengthy and expensive process, even if the internet creates the potential for viral growth in consumer services. Legal, compliance and security concerns are among the issues that slow sales.“I’ve always had this blind spot that I think everything is going to happen way faster,” says Mr Levie. “Because once you see that this is so obviously the future, the most time you could think that it would take the world to change [is], like, three years.”Instead, he says, it has turned out to be “more a decade [or] two-decade type of problem”.Box is now facing the brutal reality of enterprise software, where a handful of large tech companies such as Oracle and IBM have maintained their dominance through generations of technology. As new waves of start-ups have emerged, most have been absorbed through acquisition or been marginalised.“We’re certainly not selling,” says Mr Levie, voicing the perennial optimism of the newcomer. The $750m that Box has raised over its lifetime certainly points to outsized ambition.“We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars building out the core technology and the sales and marketing to win in this market,” he says. “And it’s going to be very expensive for anybody else to enter.”

Do corrections to feature. Revise radio script. Read board papers. Write agony aunt column. Do emails. Record podcast. Say no to various people who have been trying to get me to do things. Start tax return. Tell employer my new home address. Do expenses.By midweek, I was feeling complacent. Almost everything had been done; most of the tasks, when I got down to them, turned out to be easy. Work is astonishingly straightforward and pleasant in August when there is no one getting in the way, so much so that it always makes you wonder why we make such a meal of it the rest of the year. As for email, that is fine too. I have developed a post-holiday system in which I mark all messages for deletion, and then before committing them to a mass grave glance through them and rescue the few that look interesting. Two weeks’ email backlog takes an hour and a half to shift. Saying no is also simple now that I have learnt how to do it. And even the tax return is not too bad. Electronic banking and share registers mean it no longer matters if you have lost vital scraps of paper as it is all there online.But then I embarked on the task that ought to have been the most innocuous. My employer owes me £92.29. I have the receipt to prove it, and all that is needed is a little admin to get back what is rightfully mine.I started the job at 3.30pm and by 5pm was close to tears. Three times I had to interrupt other people for help. Everyone who sits around me was disturbed by shouts of “I (insert expletive) hate this (insert expletive) expenses system.”There is something about doing expenses that has always been loathsome, even in the old days when all you had to do was fill in a few columns on a sheet of A4. There is the dispiriting matter of emptying pockets and handbags in search of missing receipts — as well as the existential uncertainty about what is OK to claim for.I remember seeing a survey saying that many office workers would rather scrub the company’s lavatories than do their expenses. I’d go further still. Not only would I rather scrub loos, I’d rather have a root canal.While most admin tasks are getting less painful, expenses are getting more so. The FT, like most other companies, has recently moved to a web system — Oracle’s iExpenses.Last week, I reacquainted myself with how horrible it is: I could not make it work in Chrome; it kept telling me to disable my pop up blocker, but as I do not know what that is, I could not oblige. Then every time I tried to fill in its baffling boxes, it replied “invalid value”. There are four pages to be completed; whenever I tried to move to the next page it informed me I had not done the last one correctly.When you finally submit the form, you still aren’t done. You have to print out the report, photocopy all receipts, then work out how to scan them all together and email them to some poor person who is paid to process them.In the end, after a good deal of swearing, I succeeded — which is more than some of my colleagues manage. One seasoned foreign correspondent, who is more than capable of looking after himself in some of the world’s most dangerous places, is so floored by iExpenses that he has been given a special dispensation to use the old system. The system is so painful, one can only conclude it was deliberately designed that way. Now that all software is user friendly, it must have taken very special coding from the clever people at Oracle to make something quite so unfriendly. It is not hard to see why companies are so happy with the result: the more difficult it is to claim, the lower the expenses bill.Yet that ignores the opportunity cost — the hours we all waste faffing around as I did last week. It also ignores the stress caused — just think of the money that has to be spent on those “wellness” programmes that help employees de-stress. Surely it would be better not to wind people up in the first place.So what is the answer? I know someone who works in a big organisation who got so fed up with helping out a team mate with his expenses that she slapped a 10 per cent commission on him. Not only did he not object, but word spread throughout the company, and soon everyone was asking her for the same deal.This is a brilliant idea for any entrepreneurial person with inhuman levels of patience and low blood pressure. Do your colleagues’ expenses for them, and charge 10 — or even 20 — per cent. You would make a fortune. And you would secure for yourself a place in heaven.lucy.kellaway@ft.com

108;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-08-02T01:05:43Z;Executive pay is a touchy but misunderstood subject;There is a difference between accounting-based estimates and actual compensation, says Robert Pozen;"Executive compensation is closely scrutinised by politicians and public investors. Oracle, the software company, was criticised last year for paying its three top executives more than $35m each.Yet public reports of executive pay have often been misunderstood because they include accounting estimates of contingent compensation that may never be received. As such, I welcome the recent proposal from the SEC, the US financial regulator, that would mandate the reporting of pay actually received by corporate executives.The key differences between accounting-based compensation and actual compensation is down to stock awards, restricted shares and stock options, which most companies (including Oracle) award their top executives.These differences are caused by two main factors. First, stock-related awards are often subject to vesting conditions. Options may vest only after the executive has been in office for a specified number of years, or the stock-related awards might be tied to company performance.As such, the estimated value of the compensation assigns a probability to these conditions being met, but this estimate will be far off the actual compensation if these conditions are not met.Second, there may be a significant change in stock price between the time it is granted and the time of receipt of stock-related compensation. If the stock price is higher than the assumption, the actual compensation earned will be higher than the estimate. Conversely, the executive could actually earn far less than the estimate if the stock underperforms.Let us take a simple example to illustrate how actual compensation can differ from accounting estimates. Company X awards 100,000 shares of restricted stock to its chief executive when the share price is $1 per share; 25,000 of these shares will vest each year over the next four years, but only if Company X’s revenue growth exceeds 7 per cent during that year.The company may value these restricted shares at $75,000 at the time it is granted, assuming the earnings meet the target in two of the four years and that the share price rises to $1.50. However, the chief executive might end up earning zero if growth never exceeds 7 per cent. Or the package could be worth $400,000 if earnings surge ahead every year and the stock price zooms up to $4.Similarly, Company Y awards its chief executive 100,000 stock options when its shares are trading at $1 per share. The options have an exercise price of $1 per share; they vest after 4 years and expire 10 years after being granted. The value of these options might be $30,000 at the date they are granted. However, the range of compensation the chief executive actually receives can vary significantly. If the stock price stays the same or declines for 10 years, those options will be worth zero. If the stock price rises to $2 in the fourth year, the chief executive could exercise the options to realise an income of $100,000.The difference is clearly significant.Canada and Australia require disclosure of all components of executive pay on the date it is granted, similar to the current US model. In contrast, the UK has adopted an approach much like the one proposed by the SEC, providing information both when compensation is awarded and when it is earned.Elsewhere, detailed compensation reporting is not universally required; it is optional in some countries in the EU. Reporting may be required for company directors only, which means that there may not be data for highly paid executives who do not sit on the management board. And regulations may not be specific, giving companies considerable leeway on what needs to be reported and when.In short, regulators in all countries should clarify who is covered by their disclosure rules on executive compensation, and how exactly stock-related awards should be reported under their rules. Moreover, regulators should follow the lead of the SEC in requiring public companies to report the actual compensation received by their top executives each year. Such reports will help public investors better assess whether the actual compensation of top executives reflects the actual performance of their companies in a given year.Robert Pozen is a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution"
109;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-07-21T15:18:47Z;SAP does not intend to follow rivals in buying back stock;German software group beats quarterly revenue forecasts and signals further shift to the cloud;"SAP sees no need to copy its US rivals by buying back its own stock, as it reported quarterly revenues that exceeded analysts’ forecasts.Luca Mucic, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times that the German business software group was “not a believer” in using cash and cheap debt to fund share repurchases, a strategy that has been used by a slew of established US technology companies, including competitor Oracle.“You send a signal to the market that the market is smarter at using the money than yourself . . . we rather tend to think we can use the money in a smart way,” he said.“It’s something that we might consider at some point but primarily for a specific purpose,” he added, referring to the possibility of using buybacks to fund employee share-based compensation programmes.Under pressure from nimble cloud-based business software companies such as Salesforce.com, SAP has also been deploying its financial firepower in other ways.A succession of big cloud acquisitions, including the $8.3bn purchase last year of Concur, the travel management company, has swelled SAP’s gross debt pile to more than €10bn. Further big acquisitions are not planned for the next one to two years, Mr Mucic said. The company will instead prioritise paying down debt and investing in innovation and new data centre capacity.SAP is growing quickly in the cloud — new cloud bookings almost trebled to €203m in the second quarter compared with a year ago. However, in the short term, those sales are weighing on profits.As customers increasingly prefer to rent software from SAP servers, rather than have it installed on their premises, the group is restructuring so that more staff are focused on cloud services.Cloud sales sacrifice the big upfront revenue contribution associated with on-premise software in return for repeat rental income, which is spread over time.Mr Mucic said as many as 4 per cent of its employees, or some 3,000 workers, would take voluntary redundancy or early retirement this year. “That is good news as capacity is shifted towards growth and innovation,” he said. Nevertheless, total headcount has increased 10 per cent over the past year due to acquisitions.Restructuring costs also contributed to a 24 per cent increase in operating expenses in the second quarter. Net profit declined 16 per cent to €469m, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Total revenues jumped 20 per cent to €5bn; however the increase was 8 per cent when adjusted for currency translation effects linked to the weak euro.The stock closed down 1.6 per cent to €67.65 on Tuesday, having gained about 15 per cent in the past year."

It was led on Thursday by a near 3 per cent advance in the biotech sector.The gains follow comments from Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday that the central bank would raise rates slowly and there remained division over the pace at which it should tighten.“The underlying message from yesterday’s meeting was that the prevailing bias remains for the start of policy normalisation later this year,” said Millan Mulraine, strategist with TD Securities. “Wrapped within that message was a dovish tone that suggests the Fed is placing a greater burden on the data to justify any policy action.”The comments buoyed biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which have enjoyed a strong rally this year on industry consolidation and drug advances. Shares of Celgene advanced 4.24 per cent to close at $116.92, Regeneron climbed 2.94 per cent to close at $527.97, Vertex gained 2.89 per cent to close at $127.63, and Amgen rose 2.87 per cent to close at $160.12.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 had set intraday and closing record highs earlier this year.US stocks have also been somewhat rangebound as investors readied for the Fed to move and concerns mounted over valuations.A narrower pace of tightening than expected in March has helped alleviate some of those concerns. Strategists with Wells Fargo note that despite a heightened sense of nervousness by investors, “the bull market likely remains intact”.“Nervousness is rather normal around the first Fed tightening,” said Gina Martin Adams, a strategist with the bank. “Nervousness is also usually rather scarce at the time of bull market peaks.”Two flotations were also well received by the market, with shares of Fitbit and Univar climbing. Shares of the fitness tracking device maker soared 52 per cent to $30.40 in their debut, lifting the company’s valuation to $6.2bn. Fitbit closed at $29.68.Univar, which sold shares on Wednesday at $22 apiece, gained 15.45 per cent to $25.40.Shares of Oracle slid 7 per cent to $41.56 midday after the software maker said profits fell by nearly a quarter to $2.8bn as a strengthening dollar cut into sales. Oracle closed at $42.74.Oracle, which offers database and cloud products for companies, said overall sales fell 5 per cent from a year earlier to $10.7bn in the three months to the end of May, attributing roughly $900m in lost revenues to the dollar.The company reported adjusted earnings of 78 cents a share, short of analyst expectations for 87 cents.Overall, markets advanced on strengthening economic data, as initial jobless claims declined by a better than expected pace and an index of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region hit its highest level of the year.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both climbed 0.9 per cent to close at 2,120.88 and 18,113.84 respectively.

111;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle stirs unease as software suffers from rise of cloud;Unexpected software weakness and dollar effect leads to shares falling 7% in after-market trading;Oracle stirred up a fresh bout of unease on Wall Street over the dent to traditional software companies caused by the rise of cloud services, as it reported weaker than expected revenues and earnings in its latest quarter.The strengthening US dollar also delivered an unpleasant surprise for investors in the US business software company and contributed to a 7 per cent fall in its shares in after-hours trading on Wednesday.In an earnings call with analysts, Oracle executives issued a strong defence of the company’s strategy and depicted the accelerating shift to sales of cloud services — which hurts revenues and earnings in the short term — as a deliberate decision.“Clearly, our cloud business has entered a hyper-growth phase,” said Larry Ellison, chairman.Over an extended period, the amount of revenue Oracle stood to make from the sale of a cloud service was likely to be more than three times what it would have made from selling software to the same customer, he said.Wall Street’s negative reaction reflected “healthy scepticism” about whether the new cloud business model will work as promised, said Bill Kreher, a software analyst at Edward Jones. “There is a bit of a leap of faith here — but we’ve seen it rewarded before at other companies like Microsoft and Adobe.”Oracle’s forecast of 60 per cent growth in cloud sales in its new fiscal year, which began this month, and its success in reporting revenue growth in constant currency terms in its latest quarter provided some comfort that it was managing the transition well, said Mr Kreher.The disruptive effects of the move to cloud services were clearest from Oracle’s performance in Europe in the latest quarter, with overall sales of software and cloud services in the region slumping by 22 per cent.However, Oracle executives sought to paint the revenue drop as the result of a deliberate decision to sell more cloud services. Since part of the revenues from these sales is deferred until later periods, compared to software sales that are booked as revenue upfront, the higher cloud sales hit results in the short term.“Our Europe new licence was down a lot, our Europe cloud was huge: they went all in on pushing the cloud,” said Safra Catz, co-chief executive. “The truth is, our customers are focusing on cloud, as are our sales force . . . We are pushing that conversion quickly.”As a result of what Oracle described as a deliberate shift, its core software sales fell by 10 per cent in the quarter, even after adjusting for currency fluctuations.Oracle’s overall reported revenues fell by 5 per cent to $10.7bn, below the $11bn the markets had been expecting. Pro-forma earnings per share dropped 14 per cent to 78 cents, compared with analyst estimates of around 87 cents.Had it not been for the strength of the dollar, the company said it would have seen a 3 per cent increase in revenues, with pro-forma earnings per share falling by only 5 per cent.Ms Catz said that the currency effect was greater than consensus expectations, wiping 9 cents from earnings per share.However, the newer cloud services on which Oracle has sought to focus Wall Street’s attention in recent quarters grew more strongly than expected. Revenues from so-called software as a service and platform as a service rose 29 per cent to $461m, ahead of the $300m Oracle had forecast and beating most analysts’ estimates.

It has also been trying to fend off Waitrose at the upper end of the market.Former chief executive Steve Lewis stepped down in February, a month after shares dropped 17 per cent in a single day in January following downgrades to market forecasts.Analysts will be looking for Mr Gormley to ask tough questions about Majestic’s store target of 330 sites, its pricing and its minimum purchase policy, which requires customers to buy at least six bottles in-store.

Majestic Wine FY 25.73p (26.60p)The ground keeps shifting for Ashtead, the British group that rents construction equipment mainly to businesses in the US, as it reports full-year results.In March it raised its full-year financial forecasts amid balmy conditions in the UK and US construction markets. But twice last month the group, which rents out diggers, cherry pickers and generators, tumbled to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after United Rentals, a US rival, talked down activity in the sector given the drop in demand from oil and gas customers.Ashtead, which has a market capitalisation of £5.7bn, rebounded, proving that it still had the support of the City. A clutch of analysts have reiterated “buy” ratings for the stock, pointing to the group’s aggressive growth strategy as it looks to increase its clout in the sector.Its American business, Sunbelt, provides more than 90 per cent of group profit and the shares are valued for growth because the US has been slower to adopt equipment rental than mature markets such as the UK and Japan.

Ashtead FY 61.75p (46.30p)When FedEx, the express parcel-delivery service, reports results for the year to May 31, it will be under pressure to show that it is managing to grow while keeping costs and capacity under control.Careful management of its costs has enabled it over the past year to beat analysts’ expectations repeatedly while also avoiding some of the operational problems that have befallen UPS, its larger rival. UPS suffered severe congestion in much of its network over Christmas 2013 after underestimating traffic levels. It then overspent the following Christmas after overestimating traffic.FedEx continued its cost-cutting efforts on June 1 when it announced that it was accelerating the retirement of 15 fuel-hungry aircraft.Analysts forecast net income adjusted for one-off items up 1.6 per cent to $2.57bn, on revenue 4.6 per cent higher at $47.7bn. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise 2.4 per cent to $8.93.In common with other logistics companies, FedEx faces upheaval as its business shifts towards deliveries of ecommerce purchases to homes. Express parcel services previously concentrated on handling larger bundles of packages to business addresses, which are easier to serve. The shift has encouraged a move away from higher-value, fast services and towards slower deliveries, often by ground.Although FedEx remains smaller in most markets than UPS, it is set to grow significantly in Europe and some other important geographies if its planned €4.4bn takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express, announced in April, goes through. FedEx, which has only a 5 per cent share in the European market, is expected to face far fewer barriers to buying TNT — which has 12 per cent of the European market — than UPS did to its €5.4bn bid for the company in 2012.UPS, which has 16 per cent of the European market, abandoned its offer because of opposition by European competition regulators.
Robert Wright● The strong US dollar is likely to have hit results at Oracle hard, with lower revenues expected.Last year the currency impact weighed heavily on the US business software company, but it is expected to take an even bigger toll in the all-important fiscal fourth quarter to the end of May, when it typically records its strongest sales.Oracle has set a modest target for the quarter, with revenues growing between 1 per cent and 6 per cent in constant-currency terms.With overall results under pressure, Oracle executives are expected to direct the spotlight again on the small but fast-growing cloud business, a focus of recent earnings announcements though still representing less than 6 per cent of revenues.Disappointing quarterly results two weeks ago from Workday, a human resources company, were seen on Wall Street as a sign that Oracle had intensified cloud business competition.Analysts expect the group to report lower sales than a year ago, with revenues of $11bn, from $11.3bn last time. Pro-forma earnings per share are expected to be 87 cents, down from 92 cents.
Richard Waters● Betfair’s full-year results will serve to cement the online betting exchange’s position as the frontrunner in the gambling industry after a strong 12 months during which its shares have more than doubled in value.Analysts are expecting the company to report strong revenue growth of 20 per cent to £472.2m and an even bigger rise in pre-tax profits, which are forecast to grow 49 per cent to £91.5m, according to consensus estimates from Bloomberg.The high expectations come despite the absence of a World Cup this year and the introduction of regulations, in particular a point-of-consumption tax in December, which means gambling companies have to pay duty on bets placed by UK customers even if they are booked overseas.Betfair, which floated at a £1.3bn valuation in 2010, has spent much of its time as a public company beneath its float price of £13.The shares, which finally came back up above water in November last year, were boosted by a profit upgrade in March and are trading at more than £25.However, analysts at Numis warned this month that the share price had “got ahead of itself”, arguing that because of competition in the online gambling space Betfair deserved a lower rating and share price of £21.

113;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-06-10T17:39:58Z;Salesforce shareholders protest vote against Benioff pay deal;Almost half of shareholders vote against $39m package for software group head;Marc Benioff, head of Salesforce.com, has become the latest enterprise software executive to become the target of shareholder unrest over high pay levels, following criticism of long-time rival Larry Ellison at Oracle.Mr Benioff, whose 6.5 per cent stake in the cloud software company is worth $3bn, received a remuneration package of $39.9m last year, making him one of the highest paid executives in the technology sector.While unhappiness with Mr Ellison’s pay package has spilled out in a series of outright rejections from shareholders, the opposition to the Salesforce chief’s pay has been more muted but steadily increasing.Mr Benioff’s remuneration package barely won the backing of a majority of investors in a so-called “say on pay” vote, according to a regulatory filing made late on Tuesday.About 47 per cent of Salesforce’s shareholders voted against the arrangements when it came up for a vote at the company’s annual meeting, which was held last week.That is up from the 24 per cent who voted against executive pay levels last year and 17 per cent the previous year.Mr Benioff, a former top Oracle salesman who co-founded Salesforce at the end of the dotcom boom, has seen the value of his stake rise tenfold since the depths of the financial crisis.The company has benefited from a wave of change that has brought cloud computing to the heart of corporate IT. Reports that it has been the object of preliminary takeover discussions have also helped to boost its stock price — and the value of its CEO’s stake — in recent weeks.Mr Benioff and Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo, who made $42.1m, were the only two tech executives on a list of the ten highest paid US chief executives in 2014 calculated by Equilar, the executive pay company.Mr Ellison, who was paid $67.3m last year, has handed over the chief executive title to two lieutenants but remains Oracle’s executive chairman.$3bnValue of Marc Benioff’s 6.5 per cent stake in SalesforceShareholder objection to Mr Ellison’s pay has led to a majority voting against the company’s pay arrangements for three consecutive years. His remuneration package last year was down from $79.6m last year and $96.2m the previous year.Despite the reduction, two of Europe’s largest pension funds, PGGM of the Netherlands and Railpen, the UK’s Railway Pension Trustee Company, protested earlier this year about the company’s “excessive” remuneration and failure to engage more with investors.Besides Mr Benioff, Salesforce’s most highly paid senior executives last year were former head Oracle salesman Keith Block, who was paid $12.5m, and chief financial officer Mark Hawkins, who made $9.9m.Salesforce defended its pay policies in a statement on Wednesday. “We describe our pay practices in significant detail in our proxy statement, including our compensation philosophy and the rationale for those decisions.”
114;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Washington backs Oracle in Google case;Tech experts warn lawsuit could impede software innovation;The US administration has backed Oracle in a landmark legal case against Google that some technology experts have warned could put a serious brake on innovation in the software industry.While rejecting Google’s legal case, however, the US solicitor-general said on Tuesday that the company may have alternative legal remedies, leaving open the chance that the search engine group may still prevail.The case dates from 2012, when Oracle argued that Google had breached copyright in its Java software when creating the widely used Android mobile operating system. Oracle lost its case in the lower court but succeeded in having the decision partially overturned on appeal, setting up a possible Supreme Court showdown.The case turns on application programming interfaces, or APIs, the software “hooks” that other developers rely on when writing code that interconnects with other companies’ products.Google has warned that if Oracle succeeded in claiming copyright protection in its APIs, software developers in future will be forced to negotiate licences before writing code that is compatible with other widely-used programs. That would restrict the freedoms that most developers rely on and lead to less competition and a greater degree of technology “lock-in” for customers.Google had asked the Supreme Court to take up the case after losing at the appeal court stage. In response, the Supreme Court asked the White House for an opinion on whether or not it should take up the case — something it does in a small number of cases each year.In a response on Tuesday recommending the justices not hear the case, Donald Verrilli, solicitor-general, wrote that the point of law that Google had used to make its case “is not the appropriate statutory provision”.However, he added that “legitimate concerns with interoperability and lock-in effects are far better addressed” under the doctrine of “fair use”, which grants others the right to use copyrighted material under limited circumstances.Oracle welcomed the solicitor-general’s intervention, and added that the stance the administration had taken “affirms the importance of copyright protection as an incentive for software innovation”.The White House position was criticised in some corners of the tech industry, where the case had been closely watched.“The technology sector is heavily dependent on interoperability and imposing legal constraints on interoperation between programming languages can lead to serious competitive harm,” said Ed Black, head of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.
115;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-05-17T22:30:18Z;New market entrants create competition for business schools;Publishers, tech start-ups and recruiters vie for chunks of executive education worth $70bn a year;"Just when business school deans thought it was safe to step back into the executive education market, they are discovering demand for these short, non-degree programmes is not as straightforward as they had believed.The top 85 customised programme providers
See tableThe top 75 open-enrolment programme providers
See tableStrategy consultancies such as Bain and Boston Consulting Group have long been executive education providers, but now publishing companies, technology start-ups and recruitment consultancies are circling in an attempt to land chunks of a global market worth in excess of $70bn a year.In some cases, the new entrants have arrived through acquisitions — LinkedIn, the professional networking site, for example, recently bought Lynda.com, the training company. Others have arisen through alliances, such as the Financial Times’ partnership with Spain’s IE Business School to deliver corporate programmes.For the educational technology companies, it is a case of building on their existing businesses. “We are beginning to see the emergence of edtech-driven, venture capital-funded start-ups that believe edtech [the use of technology in teaching] is the driver of executive education,” says Mike Malefakis, associate dean for executive education at Columbia Business School in New York.The recruitment agencies too, faced with the erosion of their customer base by sites such as LinkedIn, are building assessment tools and skills training into their services to corporate clients.But the competition does not stop there, says MIT Sloan dean David Schmittlein. The number of business schools entering the executive education space is increasing, especially young, up-and-coming ones. “How much of it is because of a more stable economic environment and how much because of spare human capital as MBA numbers are down [is unclear].”There is even competition from closer to home — from universities’ continuing education divisions, law schools, medical schools and engineering schools, says Prof Schmittlein. As subjects such as leadership creep on to the agenda of engineering schools, for example, “these will [begin to] look even more like management education institutions”.What is more, companies that traditionally have been the customers of business schools are setting up corporate universities, often with the help of schools and cherry-picked professors.“More and more we are being asked to help companies build their internal capabilities,” says David Altman, executive vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at the US-headquartered Center for Creative Leadership, a not-for-profit research organisation and education provider. “Big companies are calling them academies, while others are saying they want to build their own internal capabilities.”Trends that began before the financial crisis are continuing, such as corporate demand for shorter courses. The trend for companies to eschew open-enrolment courses in favour of ones designed for a single company has accelerated, as has the need for programmes that award a certificate or diploma, which can often be credited towards a degree.Top overall: Iese Business School has not only topped the table for customised executive education programmes in 2015, but has taken the number one slot in the combined custom and open table.Continue readingDemand for certification is very important in Asia, says Guy Saunders, associate dean for executive education at Melbourne Business School in Australia. He believes all schools could eventually allow short courses to be credited towards a degree. “My sense is that the wall is cracking in the big schools too.”The demand to prove return on investment — a thorny concept in the context of education — is also back on the agenda. Josep Valor, academic director of customised programmes at Iese Business School in Spain, which topped the FT’s customised executive education rankings this year, says there are ways to measure this through executive promotion.He cites the example of Oracle, the software group, where Iese runs a programme for senior managers with Michigan Ross business school. Oracle judges the success of the programme by the number of people who go on to become vice-presidents in the company.“Companies are looking for value for money and can see [we offer that] because we can prove we have successful programmes that address their challenges,” says Prof Valor. “We do not know how to solve their problems — they know how to solve their problems. We help them think about how to solve their problems better.”Asia, Africa and the Middle East are proving to be the growth markets for executive education in 2015. Demand is biggest in Asia for cross-cultural leadership and for training managers to run subsidiaries outside the region.Demand from China in particular for executive programmes has rebounded, says Kai Peters, chief executive of the UK’s Ashridge Business School, which along with other schools has trained Chinese government officials. In the Middle East and Africa, the demand is for developing younger leaders.In the US and Europe, demand is increasingly sophisticated, says Mike Canning, chief executive of Duke Corporate Education, part of Duke University in the US. “It is no longer about filling knowledge gaps. It is about rewiring, [which] is not about knowing something, but making sense of things for which we have no model.”The use of online technology is also on the rise. This year, half of Columbia’s executive education participants will be distance learners. Although demand for campus-based programmes shows modest growth, “online has mushroomed into the growth engine of enrolment”, says Malefakis. Columbia’s two online programmes that replicate traditional programmes have not cannibalised their campus equivalents, he adds.“One of the real keys as to why online is growing is not just the price point but the opportunity cost for both learners and faculty.” Online students can study at their own convenience, in the evenings and at weekends, he points out. “Learning has become 24/7.”That said, the main challenge may not come from the rise of technology or increased competition from consulting and publishers, says Dominique Turpin, president of IMD business school in Switzerland. The dearth of academics who can teach executives is the biggest threat, he says.“The only way we can survive is to be innovative and relevant. You have to be close to the client,” he says. “If you ask the board members of IMD what worries them, it is where to get the faculty.”"
116;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-05-10T10:36:28Z;Top 50 US boardroom hoarders sit on $1tn in cash;Taxes and tepid economy stop companies from repatriating dollars;Just five US companies are hoarding nearly half a trillion dollars as the country’s tax code and a tepid global economy deter businesses from spending their overseas cash piles.Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer and Cisco are sitting on $439bn of cash — accounting for more than a quarter of the total $1.73tn being held by US groups, according to Moody’s Investor Services. The top 50 together hold almost $1.1tn, with the iPhone maker alone accounting for more than a 10th of the cash reserves.The Moody’s analysis showed 4 per cent growth in the cash on corporate balance sheets of the companies it covers, excluding the financial sector, over the past year. The growing cash piles underline the reluctance of boardrooms to repatriate money held abroad even as they tap debt markets to fund record spending on dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. Moody’s estimated that 64 per cent of the cash, or about $1.1tn, was held overseas, up from $950bn or 57 per cent a year ago.“There has been little progress toward corporate tax reform that would incentivise US companies to permanently repatriate funds held overseas,” said Richard Lane of Moody’s. Economists with Goldman Sachs said they saw such reform as “unlikely” to happen this year or next.Cheap borrowing costs have kept companies from dipping into foreign cash, as executives seek to avoid a tax bill on profits earned abroad. Instead, Oracle, AT&T, AbbVie and Microsoft have completed multibillion-dollar debt issuances ahead of a recent sell-off in Treasury markets, as investors prepare for the Federal Reserve to lift rates.That could change if borrowing costs rise. Activist shareholders continue to press companies to return cash — in the form of buybacks and dividends — on which S&P 500 constituents are set to spend $1tn this year.Boom in buybacks and dividend payments spurred by Apple and General ElectricContinue readingExecutives’ desire to buy into faster growing business areas has unleashed a wave of M&A activity, with total announced deals up 26 per cent to $1.4tn since the start of 2015, according to Dealogic.Capital spending has also climbed, up nearly 8 per cent to $937bn last year at non-financial companies rated by Moody’s. However, strategists say that growth will probably reverse, as energy companies slash spending after a rout in oil prices to protect shareholder returns and financial liquidity.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, US equity strategist with JPMorgan, noted that the technology and healthcare sectors had the highest cash balances abroad, adding that the status quo was “likely to prevail” as the odds of a deal being reached in Washington were quite low.“We believe US corporates continue to grow earnings at a high-single-digit rate with increasing corporate actions including higher buyback and M&A activity with or without repatriated cash,” he said.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
117;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-05-07T17:50:47Z;As rivals join it in the cloud, Salesforce faces need for reinvention;Founder Marc Benioff must switch from chasing growth to chasing profits;When you have done as much as anyone to build a new technology market from the ground up, what do you do for an encore?That is a question for Marc Benioff, Silicon Valley’s pre-eminent salesman of the past decade and a half. Salesforce.com, the company he founded at the tail-end of the dotcom boom, was the first to convince Wall Street that software-as-a-service, or SaaS, was a business worth backing. Now he needs a second act.A sign of Mr Benioff’s success is the catalogue of tech giants that have been talked about as potential buyers of Salesforce since Bloomberg reported a week ago that the group had been approached about a deal.Top of most Wall Street analysts’ lists have been rival enterprise software companies Oracle and Microsoft, with IBM and SAP also featuring. But it does not stop there. Amazon and Google have also been mentioned.After all, they have built cloud platforms for other companies to run their businesses on, so why not also sell cloud services that sit on top, like Salesforce’s customer management and marketing products?However, the sheer size of any deal — it would probably cost upwards of $60bn, based on the kind of revenue multiples seen in other SaaS deals — makes an acquisition unlikely. A person close to Oracle, the company that could achieve the biggest savings and revenue benefits from absorbing Salesforce, dismisses the idea, and the high price would make it financially challenging for others.All of this has confirmed the enviable position that Mr Benioff has staked out in the cloud — at a time when the old IT order is racing to catch up. But it has also highlighted the challenge he now faces.Salesforce’s financial model has got it this far, but it is reaching the end of the road. To join the ranks of the software giants will require taking the next step: moving on from being a hyper-growth lossmaker to a profit machine with above-average growth prospects.It was Mr Benioff who persuaded Wall Street to turn a blind eye to the losses of SaaS companies such as his. Salesforce keeps its spending on sales and marketing at slightly more than 50 per cent of revenues, fuelling growth but leaving plenty of red ink. True, it did squeeze out profits totalling $240m in the eight years to 2011, but that is dwarfed by the $780m of losses in the past four years.Growth is expected to fall below 30 per cent for the first time this year. That is still enviable for a company with more than $5bn of revenues. But with Microsoft, Oracle and SAP finally getting serious about the cloud and starting to show results from their internal investments, Salesforce has begun to appear in a different light. It is no longer the biggest fish in a small pond. Cloud revenues at Amazon and Microsoft are larger — and growing much faster.As growth moderates, Wall Street will want to see profits. To deliver steady gains in earnings per share, Salesforce will have to find a way to moderate its sky-high sales and marketing costs, while at the same time weaning itself off large stock grants to employees.It will also have to find new things for its own sales force to sell as it reaches for its next annual revenue target of $10bn. Forrester Research warned last month that the pressures of growth are likely to add to strains on its relationship with customers: it said that Salesforce would have to lock them into more — and bigger — contracts to meet its financial targets.Increasing sales efficiency in this way — by channelling more products through its existing sales organisation — will make the company look increasingly like Oracle, the company where Mr Benioff cut his teeth, and whose former top salesman, Keith Block, he recently hired.In another sign of how different the next phase of growth will be, Mr Benioff forged a partnership last year with Microsoft, a company that he had previously never hesitated to ridicule as the symbol of a dying software industry. Like Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s recently installed CEO, he now seems ready to look past the industry’s old battle lines.It is still a stretch to see this as the prelude to full-scale consolidation as the software world realigns around the cloud. But it does show that, for one of the industry’s most successful mavericks, the pressure to join the IT establishment is forcing an intriguing reinvention.richard.waters@ft.com
118;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-04-28T21:07:48Z;Oracle leads US corporate bonds sale surge;Raisings of $13.5bn to fund wave of share buy backs;Amgen and Oracle led a US corporate bond sales charge on Tuesday, raising $13.5bn to buy back shares as the market for company debt heated up again after the traditional earning season blackout period.Oracle reported earnings in March but saw its credit rating upgraded by one notch to AA- by Standard & Poor’s earlier this month, and decided to push the button on a large $10bn six-part bond sale this week, offering maturities ranging from seven years to four decades.The technology company led by Larry Ellison said in a regulatory filing that the use of the proceeds “may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future acquisitions”. The deal is the fourth biggest this year, after significant bond sales from Actavis, AT&T and Microsoft earlier in 2015.Amgen raised $3.5bn through the sale of bonds maturing in five, seven, 10 and 30 years. In addition to reducing some of its bank loans, the drugs group also said it planned to use the money raised to buy back shares.US share buybacks and dividends are forecast to hit $1tn this year, as companies continue to eschew investments in favour of returning money to shareholders.Much of the money has come from cash reserves bloated by fatter profit margins thanks to cost-cutting, but many companies have turned to bond markets to raise money for equity investors.Whether M&A related, share repurchase related or corporate finance related, there is a need for larger bites of fundingWhile this has caused some political consternation, the debt-financed buybacks have largely provided welcome fodder to bond markets that remain ravenously hungry for fresh supply.Issuance slows down in earnings season due to the mandatory information blackout period but now that most companies in the S&P 500 have finished reporting their latest results bond sales are expected to jump again.“It’s very normal,” said Ryan Preclaw, a strategist at Barclays. “Companies often tail off issuance even before the earnings blackout and then there’s a big rush afterwards . . . The first quarter was the best ever for gross supply, and demand is very robust.”This represents the best start to a year on record for both investment grade and junk-rated corporate debt sales, according to Dealogic, with $247.9bn of blue-chip bonds being sold and $132.2bn of high yield debt so far in 2015.Jonny Fine, head of US investment grade debt syndicate at Goldman Sachs, highlighted that a bigger proportion of bond sale volumes has been “jumbo” deals.“Whether M&A related, share repurchase related or corporate finance related, there is a need for larger bites of funding,” he said. “Large, liquid, jumbo, benchmark deals from large-cap, liquid, easy-to-follow credits are very much in the wheelhouse of corporate bond investors today.”The issuance splurge has not caused any indigestion yet. US corporate bonds have returned 2.7 per cent already this year, and the average yield stands at just 2.88 per cent.
119;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-03-20T23:23:44Z;Oracle tops the S&P 500 leaderboard;US markets nudge up in Fed aftermath;A rise in Oracle’s cloud-computing software and platform revenue, along with a dividend increase, helped the US software maker to lead the benchmark S&P 500 on Wednesday.Oracle said revenue from its cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service climbed 30 per cent to $372m in the fiscal third quarter.The California-based company has come under scrutiny in recent years as preference has shifted from traditional software sales to cloud computing.Software and cloud revenues rose 1 per cent to $7.2bn in the latest quarter, although the company said sales growth would have been 7 per cent if currencies were held constant.Chairman and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said the company was on track to generate more than $1bn in cloud business this year, roughly on par with a target set by Salesforce.com.“Oracle’s dominance in database, high-margin maintenance streams and ample resources to acquire should keep it competing for a long time but it is difficult to know whether Oracle will end up on the winning or losing side of cloud computing,” said Mark Murphy, an analyst at JPMorgan.The news came alongside profits that fell 3 per cent to $2.5bn, or 56 cents a share, in the three months to the end of February. Sales were largely flat at $9.3bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 54 cents a share on sales of $9.5bn. Adjusted earnings of 68 cents a share were in line with estimates.The strength of the dollar cut into the US software maker’s sales and earnings in its fiscal third quarter.Oracle also increased the dividend it pays on its common stock 25 per cent to 15 cents a share.Shares in Oracle, which have climbed 17 per cent in the past year, nudged up 0.57 per cent to $44.41 by the close.Adobe shares closed up 0.29 per cent at $77.36 after the company behind Photoshop and Illustrator products issued disappointing second-quarter guidance.It forecast sales in the range of $1.125bn to $1.17bn, shy of Wall Street consensus for $1.18bn. The company expects earnings in the range of 20-25 cents a share, lower than estimates for 27 cents a share.The forecasts accompanied Adobe’s first-quarter results, which eclipsed Wall Street forecasts.Profits climbed 80 per cent to $84.9m, or 17 cents per share, on sales that advanced 11 per cent to $1.1bn.Adobe, however, said it added 517,000 new Creative Cloud subscriptions in the quarter, short of forecasts for a 575,000 gain.FedEx shares fell more than 1 per cent to $172.04 after the express parcel service narrowed its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $8.80-$8.95 a share, from its previous forecast for $8.50-$9 a share.The company also reported third-quarter sales that came in short of Wall Street estimates.FedEx reported profits of $580m, or $2.01 a share, on sales of $11.7bn. Analysts on Wall Street had estimated earnings of $1.88 a share on sales of $11.8bn.US markets were stronger following the Federal Reserve’s decision to drop its ‘patient’ pledge on rates.The S&P 500 rose 0.90 per cent to 2,108.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.94 per cent to 18,127.65 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.68 per cent at 5,026.42.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
120;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle cloud services reach new altitude;Parts of cloud business double bookings and expectations;Oracle turned up the rhetorical heat on its main software rivals on Tuesday as it claimed to have seen a surge of customer interest in recent months in its new cloud services.Though still accounting for less than 6 per cent of its revenues, the cloud business was the centre of attention as the US database software company discussed a quarterly earnings report that was marked by the sharp decline in the euro.The US software company’s revenue, at $9.3bn, was broadly unchanged from a year before and below the $9.5bn Wall Street had expected, though Oracle said it would have risen 6 per cent had it not been for foreign exchange shifts.The company’s shares rose nearly 2 per cent in after-market trading as it also announced a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividends, lifting the annual payout to 60 cents a share.Like other established IT companies that have been hit by weakness in their core businesses, Oracle has sought to shift Wall Street’s attention on to its faster-growing cloud operations in recent quarters. Revenue from these services were up 29 per cent from a year before, to $527m, though Oracle said underlying customer demand was far stronger.“I was way too cautious and conservative,” Larry Ellison, chairman, said on a call with analysts after the earnings were announced. “Our cloud business is growing even faster than I expected.” As a result, he predicted that Oracle would overtake Salesforce.com, the biggest pure cloud company, by the end of 2015, a year earlier than he had previously said.Compared to an estimate of 50 per cent given less than six months ago, Oracle said it was experiencing bookings growth of more than 100 per cent for the platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service parts of its cloud business.The jump in cloud revenues at Oracle has been a long time coming. The company embarked on an ambitious plan nearly 10 years ago to rewrite all its software applications to run in the cloud, but has waited years for a pay-off. Justifying the protracted overhaul, Mr Ellison said it had left Oracle with a set of purpose-built services that were better suited to the cloud than arch-rival SAP.The attempt to reposition Oracle’s business for the cloud era also led to a jump in operating costs directly linked to its new services, with an 87 per cent increase in related expenses in the latest quarter. Safra Catz, co-chief executive, said this reflected the “build-out for the enormous . . . growth we anticipate”, and added: “We’re clearly growing faster than Salesforce, we’re nearly three times bigger than Workday now.”With the stronger dollar weighing on reported earnings, Oracle said its new software licence revenue – an important indicator of the future health of its traditional software business – had fallen by 7 per cent, but would have been flat in constant currency terms. Earnings per share were unchanged from a year ago at 56 cents, while pro-forma earnings – the measure by which Wall Street judges the firm – were flat at 68 cents, in line with the year before and analysts’ expectations.
121;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-03-15T18:02:17Z;Week ahead: Fed looms large;UK Budget, Israeli election and Iran talks expected to dominate the week;"The US Federal Reserve looms large over a busy week ahead.Investors will be scrutinising the next statement from the Federal Reserve as debate rages over when the central bank will raise rates. While investment banks for the most part expect an increase in June, markets continue to wager that it will not arrive until September or October.Outside Washington, attention will centre on the UK budget, Israeli elections and the next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. Below are a few of the main events to watch in the week ahead.Federal ReserveThe US central bank will hold a critical meeting this week after laying the groundwork earlier this year for the first rate rise since the financial crisis. Economists on Wall Street expect the Fed to remove the word “patient” from its policy statement on Wednesday, signalling that the first increase could come in the next few months. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed will testify following the release.UK BudgetGeorge Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers his final budget of this parliament on Wednesday; the country’s general election takes place in May. The budget may include tax cuts in an attempt to soften austerity measures before voters go to the polls in an election whose outcome is hard to predict.Israeli electionIsraelis head to the polls on Tuesday in a hotly contested election between Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Isaac Herzog, the centre-left opposition leader. Mr Herzog is the frontrunner and recent polls showed his alliance, the Zionist Union, three or four seats ahead in its attempt to lead the next coalition government in the Knesset.IranThe next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme begin in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday and are expected to last at least five days. Mohammad Javad, the Iranian foreign minister, will meet John Kerry, US secretary of state, and policy makers from the six world powers to seek an agreement before the self-imposed June deadline.EarningsThe US fourth-quarter earnings season has largely drawn to a close, with just three S&P 500 listed companies yet to report. In the coming week one of the remaining multinationals, Tiffany & Co, will report. First-quarter results will also start to trickle out, with figures due from FedEx, Nike, Oracle, Lennar and General Mills.Outside the US, BMW, Enel, Porsche, Cathay Pacific, Finmeccanica and China Mobile report earnings.The Week That Was, In Four ChartsThe slide in the euro accelerated against the US dollar in the latest week, prompting some investment banks to forecast that the two currencies will go to parity, as the European Central Bank unleashed its bond-buying programme. On Friday the euro dipped below 1.05 to the dollar, a 12-year low.The slide in the euro has provided a fillip for European corporates exposed to the US market; these groups must convert earnings abroad back into the bloc’s currency. That, coupled with the start of quantitative easing, has sent investors piling into European stocks as they exit the US.US equity markets found some comfort from the heady pace of buybacks, which when coupled with dividends surpassed the $900bn mark last year for the first time. The consistent buying of stock by US corporates reached $553.2bn in 2014, according to data from S&P Dow Jones indices.Financials staved off losses recorded by much of the broader market after the Fed did not fail any of the big US banks’ capital plans, paving the way for a rise in dividends and share buybacks. The approved programmes include double-digit dividend increases at Morgan Stanley, Discover Financial and Capital One.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"
122;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-03-11T16:29:51Z;Tech companies: obscured by clouds;Specialists need to be less fuzzy with their numbers;“That one’s a bunny.” “No, silly, it’s a bus.” Fighting over what clouds look like is a child’s pastime. Tech companies play a similar game with cloud computing. The migration from traditional, on-premise hardware and services to the cloud (software delivered over the internet) is a big deal for IBM, Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. Their shares and valuations swing with their cloud growth.Despite the importance of the cloud, disclosures about it are, well, cloudy. SAP’s cloud software and support revenues were €1bn last year. But the figure including cloud service — that is, consulting — was €1.3bn (and, of course, the distinction between support and consulting is crystalline). At Oracle, cloud software sales were $1.3bn in the past 12 months. Cloud infrastructure — memory and computing power as opposed to applications — get a separate line ($500m).Fair enough. The opacity rises from there. IBM highlighted $7bn in cloud revenue in its recent earnings release — but this includes items such as server hardware bought as part of a private cloud data centre, or services for building private cloud systems. Stripping those out and looking just at software, sales were $3bn last year.Meanwhile, Microsoft reports cloud revenues under the “commercial other” category — a hodge­podge. It gives an “annual run rate” for cloud sales specifically ($5.5bn). The run-rate number includes commercial Office 365 subscriptions, Azure, and Dynamics CRM. Yet it understates the impact of the cloud on revenues, because Microsoft sells server software that other cloud software vendors use.At Amazon, Web Services sales have been lumped under “other”, but happily revenues will be broken out next quarter. Those hoping for margins or product breakdowns for this huge business will have to wait. Google only mentions the word “cloud” once in its annual filing.Google and Amazon can afford to be vague. Cloud software is not their core business. For the others, the future is at stake. A clear picture of cloud sales, and ideally profitability, is especially important because some parts of the cloud (such as infrastructure) are low-margin, commoditised businesses while others (such as software) offer high margins and greater sticking power. Less cloudiness and more hard lines, please.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
123;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Apple investors eye $1tn valuation target;Bulls hold the reins but some recall other tech giants’ falls;Apple’s valuation has reached heights markets have never seen before, at least in nominal terms, with the iPhone maker’s market capitalisation eclipsing $770bn.Now worth more than the entire S&P 600 small-cap index, or two Berkshire Hathaways, the question for some investors is whether the Cupertino-based technology behemoth can even surpass the $1tn mark.Other technology groups, such as Microsoft and IBM, have enjoyed rocketing valuations only to fall to earth. Yet Apple bulls have thus far been in the ascendant, sending its shares to a new all-time high this week.Analysts, too, have taken the view that Apple will if anything go higher, lifting price targets at a heady clip. Goldman Sachs increased its target to $145 a share last week — worth $845bn based on current share counts. The highest target, at $165 from First Shanghai Securities, would see Apple’s market valuation rise to $960bn.Accelerating iPhone sales, rising earnings forecasts, the largest buyback and dividend programme in the US and the prospect of new products — including a car— have propelled Apple’s shares up 19 per cent this year, adding more than $110bn to its market valuation.By contrast, valuations for the next 10 largest businesses on the S&P 500 have dropped by $67bn this year, including $10bn-plus haircuts to ExxonMobil, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson.A $1tn valuation is “possible in the next couple of years, and the reason I think it has this potential is really because the multiple investors are willing to pay for [Apple] is expanding,” says James Gautrey, a Schroders portfolio manager.He adds: “This was always viewed as a consumer technology, boom-and-bust cycle type of company, like the Motorolas, Nintendos, Nokias. Right now, the innovation Apple is coming out with — payments, healthcare, Beats [music streaming] — those three parts for the consumer are really starting to lock people in.”Sales of the iPhone jumped 57 per cent from a year earlier to $51.2bn in the company’s first fiscal quarter, far surpassing Wall Street forecasts. The phone accounted for more than two-thirds of Apple’s overall revenues in the period and buoyed profits to record levels.Secular trends in the industry, including the shift to mobile computing, have also buoyed the company. “Apple’s iOS platform is the primary beneficiary of the shift to mobile computing, similar to the 1990s when client server applications were built on Microsoft Windows and Oracle platforms,” Deborah Koch, a portfolio manager of Northern Trust’s technology fund, says.This has prompted a re-rating of the company’s shares and earnings potential. Analysts now project sales in the company’s 2016 fiscal year will reach $237bn — 17 per cent higher than forecasts set a year ago. Next year’s earnings are expected to hit $9.26 a share, up 44 per cent from 2014 levels and 29 per cent higher than year ago consensus projections.“What’s propelling [Apple] and ultimately the driver of the stock is that the company is beating expectations,” says Andrew Slimmon at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.Apple’s valuation has remained compelling because of its growth, bullish investors add. The California company trades at 15.4 times 2015 earnings, below the 17.7 multiple ascribed to the broader S&P 500.Apple’s buyback programme— prodded by activist investor Carl Icahn — has also acted as somewhat of a floor on its share price. Last year the company spent more than $56bn on buybacks and dividends, 6 per cent of the $900bn S&P 500 constituents put towards such returns, S&P Dow Jones Indices adds. The company’s 1.4 per cent dividend yield, while lower than the 2 per cent offered from the S&P 500, has attracted investors searching for income as yields on the longest-dated US Treasuries hover near record lows.If you run a diversified portfolio and you don’t own Apple, you are taking a very big bet against it. That forces a professional investor into the stockTechnology analysts with Credit Suisse expect Apple to lift its capital return programme to $202bn through 2017, including $37bn in dividends. Ms Koch says that move will probably attract more value investors to the company’s stock as they seek out yield-bearing assets.Despite the gains, there remains a cautious spectre to the dialogue with investors, many of whom remember the company’s precipitous 45 per cent slide in 2012-13 as concerns flared that competitors were winning share.“While things look good now, they will at some point get into that funk again,” says Bob Doll at Nuveen Asset Management. “If you have confidence, it is where you can make some money stepping in.”The company’s brisk rise has, however, created a conundrum for investors benchmarked to the S&P 500. Apple represents 4.1 per cent of the market cap weighted blue-chip index, far more than any other constituent. Portfolio managers have had to hold at least that much to not be underweight the iPad maker, and those who have eschewed a position in the company have missed out on its gains. Any decline in the company’s shares would present a commensurate risk.Only five other companies have ever made up more of the S&P 500 in its history. IBM was the largest weight on the S&P 500 for six consecutive years, making up as much as 6.4 per cent of the index in 1985.Excluding Apple, the S&P 500 tech index would be up less than 1 per cent since the year began, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. The overall S&P 500’s gain would be 55 basis points lower.“If you run a diversified portfolio and you don’t own Apple, you are taking a very big bet against it. That forces a professional investor into the stock,” Mr Slimmon says.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
124;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-02-16T16:51:23Z;Infosys buys US software group Panaya;Deal worth $200m indicates CEO’s focus on more lucrative products;Infosys has bought US-based technology group Panaya in a $200m deal, marking the most significant step in chief executive Vishal Sikka’s drive to offer high-end software and boost the outsourcer’s growth.On Monday, the Bangalore-based group announced it had acquired Panaya, which was founded by an Israeli entrepreneur in 2006 but has its headquarters in California, in an all-cash deal based on an enterprise value of $200m.Panaya specialises in automation technologies, in particular those that can help large companies manage and upgrade complex software packages bought from the likes of US-based Oracle or German technology group SAP.Infosys’s move provides the clearest indication yet of the direction outlined by Mr Sikka since he took the helm of the group last June, having previously been SAP’s chief technology officer.Rather than focusing on its traditional software outsourcing business, Mr Sikka is pushing Infosys — India’s second-largest outsourcer by revenue — to develop more lucrative products in areas ranging from big data and cloud computing to artificial intelligence.Automating the way software is managed has been a particular focus for Mr Sikka as he tries to develop advanced services without adding to the company’s already sizeable headcount of 160,000 employees.In a statement, Mr Sikka said: “This will help amplify the potential of our people, freeing us from the drudgery of many repetitive tasks, so we may focus more on the important, strategic challenges faced by our clients.”Analysts were generally positive about the deal, saying that Panaya’s software could help Infosys to differentiate itself from domestic rivals such as Tata Consultancy Services, as they vie to win business in Europe and the US.“It seems like a good buy, and it will help them when they are talking to these big global clients,” says Sagar Rastogi, technology analyst at broker Ambit Capital in Mumbai.“It is a bit like if you have a lawn that needs to be mowed, and one guy comes up to you with an electric mower, and the other guy has only a sickle. Infosys wants to say that it has the electric mower.”Monday’s deal is likely to be the first of a series of acquisitions under Mr Sikka, who had said he planned to deploy more of his company’s $5.6bn cash reserves, as he tries to reverse its lacklustre performance in recent years.At the group’s most recent quarterly results in January, Mr Sikka also announced plans to begin investing in Indian start-ups, increasing the size of a previously announced technology investment fund from $100m to $500m.Infosys shares closed down 1 per cent at Rs2,282 after news of the deal, underperforming the main market in Mumbai, which ended the day flat.
125;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-02-02T00:11:50Z;The unsung pioneers of the information age;Flair of Intel’s Robert Noyce and vision of Douglas Englebart helped shape the tech market;If financial success were the sole measure of business genius, the computer age could lay claim to more than its fair share of the great figures of business history.Measured by the scale of their personal fortunes alone, it would be hard to deny those such as Bill Gates (Microsoft), Larry Ellison (Oracle), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), and Sergey Brin and Larry Page (Google) a place alongside the likes of John D and other Rockefellers or Andrew Carnegie from an earlier era. And few have succeeded as spectacularly in defining massive new markets as Steve Jobs of Apple, whose sequence of hits from the Mac to the iPad have helped shape the experience of computing for more than 30 years.The money alone, however, does not tell the whole story. The winner-takes-all nature of many tech markets has added to the outsized gains, magnifying the returns to those who are both smart and lucky enough to catch the first wave of each new era of technology. And even the ultimate winners have not always shown the surest business touch: Bill Gates did not believe there was good money to be made in selling operating systems until business partner Paul Allen persuaded him to charge for the software, rather than just giving it away.In particular, the catalogue of tech riches fails to take into account the vast impact of figures whose ideas shaped today’s tech markets and made later advances possible, even if they did not personally profit to the same degree. Some were visionaries who anticipated how rudimentary technologies would come to transform large swaths of business and society. Others built important businesses that laid the foundation for the giant fortunes that were to follow.For visionary brilliance, it is hard to top Douglas Englebart, the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) scientist who dreamt of making computing personal. Usually, technology development is an incremental affair, as researchers build on each others’ achievements to come up with an ultimate product. But with personal computing, Englebart had it all worked out, nearly 15 years before the first PC hit the market.Englebart is known primarily for inventing the computer mouse, but it was his vision of the way the elements of hardware, software and online service could come together that provided the first model for how today’s highly networked personal computing world might operate.In a demonstration, staged in San Francisco as long ago as 1968, he led an SRI team that gave a glimpse of the future: not just using a mouse to manipulate windows and text on a screen, but also using a network to collaborate and videoconference with people in a different location and showing how hypertext could make it easier to uncover information.It took a string of technical breakthroughs at Xerox’s research centre in Silicon Valley, as well as the creative genius of Jobs and the business relentlessness of Gates, to bring personal computing to a mass market. But it was Englebart who had shown what was possible.The PC age, meanwhile — along with much else that has followed — has relied on one underlying technology engine more than any other: the exponential growth in processing power that has come from packing ever more transistors on to a silicon chip. Robert Noyce, who played a key role in three pioneering chip companies, did as much as anyone to bring that about, as well as to build the culture of today’s Silicon Valley.The co-founder and first chief executive of Intel, Noyce has been overshadowed by others in the history of chip making. They include people such as his Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, whose name is enshrined in “Moore’s law” that predicts the rate of efficiency gains in chips, and by the swashbuckling Andy Grove, a later Intel chief executive who took the company from memory chips to world dominance in microprocessors.It was also Noyce’s misfortune to lose out to Texas Instruments scientist Jack Kilby, who was the first to come up with a design for an integrated circuit months before Noyce independently made his own breakthrough. Kilby went on to win the Nobel Prize in physics — although Noyce was later given credit for his own advances in the field.Yet it was Noyce who turned Intel’s breakthroughs into a world-beating business. After working at Shockley, the first silicon chip company in Silicon Valley, he was chief executive of the breakaway Fairchild Semiconductor before founding Intel. It was on his watch that Intel devised a new style in corporate management that helped shape the valley, giving up the normal trappings of a corporate hierarchy in favour of a can-do egalitarianism and informality.Figures such as Englebart and Noyce never enjoyed the same acclaim as the tech world’s multibillionaires. But they, and many others, still have a solid claim to being considered true pioneers of the information age.
126;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-01-25T22:00:47Z;Oracle shareholders turn up pressure on Ellison;Letter to SEC criticises software group chief’s ‘excessive’ remuneration and failure to engage;Larry Ellison, one of the US’s highest paid executives and co-founder of the Oracle software company, has come under renewed pressure from shareholders over his “excessive” remuneration and “unprecedented” failure to engage with investors.The Netherlands’ second-largest asset manager and one of the UK’s largest pension funds, will on Monday file a letter to Oracle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, outlining their corporate governance concerns.More than half of the group’s shareholders have voted against the executive compensation scheme in each of the past three years.Mr Ellison, who is executive chairman and chief technology officer and holds a significant interest in the group, reduced his total pay, including options, for 2014 to $67.3m from $78m in 2013, signalling that he is listening to his critics, but the shareholders say this is not enough.PGGM of the Netherlands and Railpen, the UK’s Railway Pension Trustee Company, say the company’s “lack of communication” has heightened their concern over pay, boardroom accountability and the independence of non-executive directors.It is rare for such groups to go public with criticism of a company they invest in, underlining their anger and frustration after four years of trying to engage with the board and company executives.In their letter to the company, they say: “As global investors, we believe that governance risk is particularly heightened in companies in which the founder serves as CEO or otherwise remains in a leadership role with the company.”The shareholders have written the letter on behalf of pension plans in the Netherlands and the UK with more than 2.8m members and $238bn in assets under management.Although the two groups have small shareholdings in Oracle, amounting to about $310m combined, or 0.16 per cent, they say their concerns are mirrored by other investors.One top-20 investor said: “There are niggles with Larry Ellison and Oracle over corporate governance and pay. On pay, there is an excessive use of share options, which we don’t like.”Catherine Jackson, senior adviser responsible for investment at PGGM, said: “Mr Ellison’s pay is excessive and so is that of other executives. But pay is just one issue. There is a concern over board accountability and whether it is independent enough to stand up to Mr Ellison. The lack of communication heightens this concern.”Deborah Gilshan, senior investment manager at Railpen, said: “Over the past four years, we have tried to set up meetings with directors, but we have been ignored. The company’s lack of communication is unprecedented. In all our years, we have never been ignored like this.”The two investors travelled to Oracle’s annual meeting in San Francisco in November to ask to see directors, but were rebuffed.Oracle declined to comment.Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw
127;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2015-01-06T17:16:17Z;Servers: off-brand demand;Server demand is growing, but that may not help big vendors;Last year was difficult for hardware. Big enterprise hardware stocks (such as IBM, Western Digital and Seagate) underperformed the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. Revenues have fallen and margins are under pressure. But in the server market — worth $50bn annually — things may be improving.Server sales are expected to increase significantly in 2015. There is growing demand from so-called “hyperscale” data centres used in cloud computing. In July a 2003 Windows operating system expires, boosting demand as these servers are replaced (60 per cent of the world’s servers are run on Windows). And new server chips such as Intel’s Grantley Xeon are driving upgrades. Data from IDC show that these trends are already having an impact: server vendor revenues in the third quarter rose 6 per cent from the previous year. Morgan Stanley recently raised its forecast for server demand unit growth next year to 10 per cent, from 8 per cent previously.The world’s biggest server vendors — HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco and Oracle, in that order — will all welcome some relief. But the biggest winners may not be big brands at all. Many “hyperscale” data centres buy servers and components from unbranded suppliers known as ODMs (original design manufacturers). ODM direct sales are growing more than 40 per cent annually, according to IDC, much faster than the big vendors. Price is one reason: Morgan Stanley says ODM servers tend to be less than half the price of branded competitors.The other challenge for HP, Dell, et al is that the biggest customers can do it themselves. Google designs and builds its own serv” programme. This is good news for ODMs such as Quanta, Wistron and Compal. But traditional server vendors could lose market share in the long run. Whatever happens to volumes, prices only go in one direction. Even if 2015 is better than 2014, hardware will remain a hard business.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
128;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-12-19T18:28:34Z;Hortonworks: Back to the source;Competition is on the way and Red Hat’s success will be a hard act to follow;Giving things away free can be a savvy business model. Like that glass of pinot noir at a wine shop, or the first free Uber ride. It gets trickier, however, in the tech sector: much of the industry is based on open-source building blocks (even Google). Yet as open-source systems are free to use, very little of the sector’s financial value is there.Today there is only one open-source company that is publicly traded and profitable: Red Hat. It provides customers such as IBM with support and services for Linux and other open-source systems. It has made a nice business out of this: revenue has grown every quarter for the past decade. Gross profit margins are 85 per cent. Subscription revenues rose 15 per cent last quarter. But it is still small, with annual revenues of $1.7bn.Now another open-source company is trying to follow. Hortonworks, which went public on December 12, sells support and services around Hadoop, an open-source data management system used in big data analytics. The company is lossmaking but growing fast. Its investors took a haircut before the IPO – the listing price was below the previous fundraising valuation – but they have nearly made it back, with Hortonworks’ shares trading 40 per cent above the listing price.Market enthusiasm could prove to be misplaced though. Red Hat succeeded because the market for Linux services is vast, it invests in new technologies, and it has high renewal rates for its biggest customers. For Hortonworks, the first condition is true, but the other two are unknown. The company is so young that most clients have not reached the end of their contracts yet.One thing that is certain though: competition is on the way. Two other Hadoop-based companies, MapR and Cloudera, are rumoured to be preparing to list. Unlike Hortonworks, both have proprietary systems. The trick is to know when to give products away free and when not to. Red Hat’s success will be hard to copy.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
129;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
130;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-12-18T21:47:35Z;Oracle: a chance of cloud;The tech group finally shows growth in this area, however long it has taken;"Oracle tries to make its earnings calls easy to understand. “We are just winning,” co-chief executive Mark Hurd explains. Oh, right. Soon, the company will be “number one in the cloud”, whatever that means. Less ambiguously, on Wednesday Oracle reported numbers that were better than expected after a few disappointing quarters. Revenues were up 3 per cent, while net income fell 2 per cent. New cloud bookings, at $170m, more than doubled from the previous year. They are expected to reach $1bn in the next fiscal year.Oracle has been slow to move its business into the cloud (founder Larry Ellison has even referred to the company as a “dinosaur” on occasion), and this has given a long head-start to competitors such as Salesforce and Workday. Oracle’s new cloud bookings are just barely making up the difference as traditional software licence sales fall (down 3 per cent in the past six months, compared with the previous year). Declining new software licences will translate into lower revenues from services and updates — where Oracle generates more than half of its revenues.It is good news that Oracle seems to be finally showing real growth in the cloud, however long it has taken. The question now is whether the company will enjoy economies of scale — and mass conversion of its current customer base — as it builds its cloud offering. Oracle is selling cloud services to its existing software licensees; this ability to integrate the cloud with old-fashioned on-site services could be a key advantage, Nomura thinks.Oracle has made successful transitions before — think of server databases in the 1990s — and may do so again. At 13 times forward earnings, it is cheaper than the other two big software vendors moving to the cloud: SAP and Microsoft. It is also growing more slowly though, despite $24bn in acquisitions over the past five and-a-half years. Winning, it appears, is quite a gradual process.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
131;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-12-18T19:21:07Z;Oracle on fire after success in the cloud;US stocks bounce back on gains for tech and battered energy;Oracle shares soared to their highest level since 2000 — the year the dotcom bubble burst — after the Silicon Valley company offered the most convincing evidence yet that it is adapting to the radical change in the way corporate customers buy software.Although Oracle’s revenues edged up just 3 per cent and profits dipped last quarter, the share price was electrified by signs of progress in its cloud computing division.Oracle is one of an older generation of software companies, including Microsoft, that built their fortunes selling annual software licences to business customers.That model is now threatened by the emergence of cloud computing, in which companies such as Oracle host software applications online and businesses pay for it as they use it.Richard Davis, a technology analyst at Canaccord, said Oracle was starting to convince Wall Street that it was serious about competing in the cloud.“We believe investor opinion on Oracle’s stock, which in our conversations ranges from indifference to dislike, will change for the better,” Mr Davis saidOracle’s cloud revenues surged 45 per cent to $516m in the quarter to November 30, persuading its famously competitive co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison to declare that its cloud revenues would eclipse those of rival Salesforce.com next year.Shares of Oracle climbed 9.3 per cent to $45.35, their highest level since September 2000.Rite Aid shares jumped 12 per cent after the US pharmacy chain raised its profit forecast for the year.The company said it expected full-year profit to be between $315m and $370m and revenue to be between $26.25bn and $26.4bn.The news came just three months after Rite Aid was forced to lower its guidance as generic drugs squeezed profitability at its core pharmacy business.The latest guidance puts earnings closer to the $298m-$408m level the company set out at the start of its fiscal year in June.Rite Aid, the third largest drugstore chain in the US, said while margins at its pharmacy business are still under pressure — they fell 228 basis points during the third quarter — higher prescription sales and a new agreement with McKesson, its main supplier, which lowered its drug purchasing cost, had helped take out some of the sting.Shares in Rite Aid, down 15 per cent over the past six months, rose 72 cents to $6.78 compared with a low of $5.39 at the start of December.Shares in convenience store operator The Pantry added 3 per cent to $36.44 after its Canadian rival, Alimentation Couche-Tard, swooped on the company in a deal worth $1.7bn including debt.The move will consolidate its position as one of the largest convenience retailers in North America.The two companies said they had agreed to a definitive deal under which Couche-Tard will acquire The Pantry for $36.75 per share in cash, a 27 per cent premium to The Pantry’s closing price on December 16, when reports of a potential tie-up first emerged.Hertz shares rose 6 per cent to $22.55 after Carl Icahn, the rental car company’s largest shareholder, raised his stake in the company to 11.3 per cent from 10.7 per cent.Mr Icahn revealed a stake of just under 8.5 per cent stake in Hertz in August and has since seen the departure of chief executive Mark Frissora and won three board seats at the company.Gains in the technology sector and a steadying of the battered energy industry underpinned a climb in the S&P 500 index of 2.4 per cent to 2,061.2 by the end of the US session. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.2 per cent to 4,748.4.
132;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle catches up in the cloud;Larry Ellison challenges Salesforce.com as results beat forecasts;Oracle shrugged off recent quarterly earnings disappointments as it beat Wall Street expectations for the latest period and reported an acceleration in revenue growth from its small but strategically important cloud services business.Larry Ellison, co-founder and chairman, used the pick-up in cloud growth to issue a rallying call, predicting that his company would overtake Salesforce.com, the largest independent cloud company, when measured by sales of new cloud services next year.“Stay tuned, it’s going to be close,” Mr Ellison said. “We’re catching up to them and we’re catching up to them very quickly.”Shares in the database software maker rose 3.5 per cent in after-market trading after it said that revenues in its latest quarter had grown 3 per cent to $9.6bn, ahead of the $9.5bn that had been expected. Pro forma earnings per share, at 69 cents, were in line with the previous year and slightly ahead of forecasts.Like other established IT companies, Oracle has sought to draw Wall Street’s attention this year to its cloud services businesses, as concerns have spread that customers are starting to move away from buying traditional hardware and software products.Revenue from cloud businesses rose 45 per cent in the three months to the end of November, to $516m, and accounted for more than 5 per cent of revenue, the company said.That marked an acceleration in cloud growth as Oracle has added “thousands” of new salespeople and engineers to expand the business, said Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-chief executive officer.The fact that Oracle had been able to hold its profit margin steady despite the investment reflected the strength of its business model, she added.Mr Ellison has stirred bitter enmities in the past to motivate his company, for instance taking aim at rivals like SAP and Microsoft.The focus of his attacks this year has shifted to Salesforce, headed for former top Oracle sales executive Marc Benioff, as well as Workday, a fast-growing company controlled by old personal rival Dave Duffield.Stay tuned, it’s going to be close. We’re catching up to them [Salesforce.com], and we’re catching up to them very quicklyThe Oracle chairman said that the $170m of sales of cloud services in the latest quarter, the second of its fiscal year, would grow to $250m by the fourth quarter and be “well over $1bn next year”.“The acceleration in the business bodes well for our future,” added Ms Catz. “We’re clearly growing faster than Salesforce and we’re three times bigger than Workday.”Like other US tech companies, Oracle’s reported growth in its latest quarter was held back by the recent appreciation of the US dollar. Leaving aside currency fluctuations, revenue would have grown by 7 per cent, it said. Based on formal US accounting rules, net income slipped 2 per cent to $2.5bn, or 56 cents a share, unchanged from the previous year.

Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.● It has been a difficult few years for Carpetright, Europe’s leading carpet seller. As well as a string of profit warnings, it has been forced to endure the sudden departure of its chief executive last year and the continued fall of its share price, which is down 40 per cent this year alone.The carpet specialist’s interim results will be a chance to try and persuade investors that it can turn its fortunes around. The results are new chief executive Wilf Walsh’s first and with Carpetright’s founder, Lord Harris, having retired as chairman in October, analysts will be looking for him to stamp his authority on the struggling company’s strategy.More than half of the company’s 460 stores in the UK have been modernised and like-for-like sales are up, but with discounting helping to drive sales, margins are down.In Europe, where Carpetright has 142 stores in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, the company is expected to report a profit in the period after reducing the rate of sales decline and better cost control.

Sales are expected to be $12bn, up 9 per cent from last year’s $11bn.Both FedEx and United Parcel Service, its main rival in the critical US domestic market, are benefiting from growing ecommerce deliveries to consumers. However, FedEx has so far avoided the kind of significant problems that dogged UPS last Christmas, when its systems became overwhelmed and it delivered many packages after December 25. Robert Wright● Oracle’s announcement of quarterly earnings will provide the latest chance to assess how well the giants of the IT industry are managing the transition to cloud computing.Like its main rivals, the database software maker has sought to put a spotlight on its fast-growing cloud efforts by disclosing revenues separately this year, even though the numbers remain small overall.Only around 5 per cent of its $8.6bn in sales in its most recent quarter came from selling cloud services, though the business was up 32 per cent, compared to overall growth of only 3 per cent.While the cloud growth rate will get disproportionate attention from investors, it will be sales of Oracle’s traditional software, including the latest release of its 12C database, that will underpin its business in the latest period.Wall Street is expecting revenues to rise around 3 per cent for the second quarter running, to $9.52bn. Pro forma earnings per share are expected to be down slightly from a year ago, at 68 cents, in the middle of the company’s guidance range of 66-70 cents. Richard WatersThe City of London will be looking to Dixons Carphone for a take on Black Friday trading and the outlook for Christmas when it reports its half-year results.After a flurry of sales at British retailers at the end of November, investors and analysts will be looking to see if this delivered incremental business or just brought forward sales that would have happened anyway.Other key talking points will be the outlook for Christmas as retailers are in the midst of the crucial holiday trading period and the delivery disruptions that have beset some retailers including CurrysThe results will be the first since the £3.7bn merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse in May, and the City will also be keen to know how the integration of the two businesses is progressing.

However, the bigger challenge — returning the group to growth — is as yet unmet. This week investors will see the first signs of whether Mr Chen’s plan to win back business customers is working.On Wednesday, the group will unveil its new BlackBerry Classic, the company’s fourth smartphone launch of the year, after the Passport, the Z10 and a Porsche-branded handset. Today it releases earnings for its fiscal third quarter, which are expected to show patchy progress.James Faucette, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, last month downgraded his forecasts due to his belief that the company will have made a larger chunk of its revenue from low-margin device sales rather than the more lucrative fees it charges customers to use its infrastructure.This “service revenue” has been steadily declining ever since Mr Chen joined the company, from $632m in the three months to the end of November 2013 to $424m in its most recent quarter. It now accounts for less than half of revenue.Mr Faucette estimates that BlackBerry has either been breaking even or losing money on sales of new handsets, prompting him to predict an adjusted loss per share of 5 cents.That, according to data from Bloomberg, is in line with the majority of analysts, who are pencilling in revenues of $956m for the quarter.

134;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-12-04T17:10:35Z;Return of the buyback extends US rally;Pace of capital return picks up in the third quarter after summer lull;Bullish equity investors have company.With stocks loitering in record territory, corporate America remains a major buyer of shares.One of the primary drivers of the ageing US bull market — share buybacks and dividend payouts — has hit the accelerator during the third quarter after an unexpected lull over the summer. Management teams have dedicated nearly $900bn to both forms of returns over the past 12 months, estimates from S&P Dow Jones Indices show.With many S&P 500 constituents sitting on large piles of cash and attracting the ire of activist shareholders, buybacks and dividends have gained prominence during the equity market’s impressive recovery since 2009. A longstanding practice and used to offset expiring employee options, buybacks have sparked criticism in recent years given the bumpy US economic recovery characterised by meagre earnings growth for workers.With the US equity market now on course for a third consecutive double-digit annual gain, the pace of buybacks has intensified and appears set to continue, suggesting many companies are focused on shrinking their outstanding share count at the expense of investment.“Buybacks have been a tremendous support for US equities,” says Orrin Sharp-Pierson, a strategist at BNP Paribas. Referencing the efforts of aggressive central bank policy, he adds: “It’s been like quantitative easing directly on equities, $40bn-$50bn per month.”Companies have been a key source of support in recent years as investors have stepped back from buying equities. Since the start of 2010, companies have spent $3.3tn on share buybacks and dividends, as the US economy has recovered and investors sought blue-chip names with stable and growing returns.Over the past five years, US investors have poured $301.5bn into domestic equity exchange traded funds, data from XTF.com shows. However, with redemptions of $411.1bn from US stock mutual funds over the same period, there has been a shortfall of more than $100bn between the two, according to the Investment Company Institute.“[Buybacks] have been a fairly powerful rising tide for stocks in that there has not been a lot of mutual fund money coming in,” says Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. “That has been offset by exchange traded funds (ETFs), but not enough.”This year, ETF inflows have reached $92bn through the middle of November, compared with a $44.7bn outflow in US equity mutual funds, Mr Colas notes.Apple has been the exemplar of share buybacks, returning more than $45bn to shareholders over the past 12 months — roughly on a par with share buybacks completed by IBM, ExxonMobil, Cisco Systems and Oracle combined — the data from S&P Dow Jones Indices show.The iPhone maker is not alone. The number of companies increasing buybacks is on the rise, with nearly a quarter of S&P 500 members reducing their share count by more than 4 per cent in the third quarter, up from a fifth during the first three months of the year.Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices, says the 4 per cent level is “significant” as the reduced share count affects price-to-earnings ratios.And share buybacks are likely to have quickened in November after the vast majority of the S&P 500 released quarterly earnings results— companies are required to pause buybacks by their own corporate Treasuries ahead of earnings reports.Goldman Sachs estimates roughly 25 per cent of all buybacks are completed in November and December.During the third quarter, companies spent roughly $238bn on dividends and buybacks, with the latter making up nearly 63 per cent of the total. The preliminary figure ranks second only to the first quarter of 2014, when company expenditures on the two reached $241.2bn.While the numbers could change as companies submit finalised quarterly reports with US securities regulators, at present they represent a 19 per cent jump from a year earlier and 3 per cent rise from the second quarter.An ageing capital stock and rising rates could temper debt-fuelled buybacks, like those undertaken by Apple, and a growing chorus of investors and strategists say management teams must begin to invest in growth over shareholder returns.“For US companies, the story is centred on a willingness to spend via capex, more M&A, and continued dividends and share repurchases,” says Julian Emanuel, a strategist with UBS, adding that he expects “capex to increase in 2015”.Without that investment, growth is likely to trudge along. Wall Street analysts currently forecast revenue to climb less than 4 per cent in the first half of 2015, slightly ahead of the projected 3 per cent rise in real GDP.“US equities are transitioning out of a recovery rally and into a period of lower returns as the benefits of margin expansion and share repurchases prove to be already priced in and a return of faster revenue growth becomes a prerequisite for another re-rating higher,” Barclays US equity strategist Jonathan Glionna says.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
135;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:00:27+0000;Ellison opts to defend America’s Cup in Bermuda;First time an American defender chooses finals venue outside US;The defence of sailing’s America’s Cup, currently held by Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, will take place off Bermuda, the organisers have announced.The venue for the final races of the 35th running of the event was confirmed by Harvey Schiller, the race’s commercial commissioner, at a press conference in New York on Tuesday.“The sailing conditions are near perfect,” he said. “The race course on the Great Sound [a horseshoe-shaped harbour at the southwest of the main island] is a natural amphitheatre with room for racing and spectators, amid a spectacular backdrop of islands and beaches.”As defending champion, Mr Ellison had the right to choose where the race would take place. This will be the first time in the event’s 163-year history that a US champion has chosen to defend the trophy outside US waters.San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago were also vying to stage the event, which will take place in 2017. The north Atlantic island, a two-hour flight from the US east coast, has a record of running world-class sailing regattas. Ìt also offers more attractive racing times for European television viewers than San Diego, its closest rival.The announcement of the venue is important for existing and potential teams as they seek to bring sponsors on board, design their boats and assemble the best crews.San Francisco was the setting for last year’s event, won in dramatic circumstances by Oracle Team USA. Inspired by Britain’s Sir Ben Ainslie, the Olympic gold medallist, Oracle overturned an 8-1 deficit to Emirates Team New Zealand in a thrilling climax to win the series 9-8.Jimmy Spithill, who skippered Oracle Team USA last year, said: “Bermuda will be an incredible experience for the spectators, both on-site and those watching the broadcast. And, for the sailors, it is going to be very challenging.”Sir Ben will lead his own team, Ben Ainslie Racing, this time round, aiming to become the first winner of a British-owned boat since the “Auld Mug” was first raced for round the Isle of Wight in 1851.The format requires him and other challengers to race each other in locations around the world. The winner of the series earns the right to face Mr Ellison’s team in Bermuda.In the challenger series Sir Ben’s team will face at least four outfits: Sweden’s Artemis Racing, Emirates Team New Zealand, Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy and Team France. Other teams from Canada, Russia, Greece, China and Japan have expressed interest, but none has confirmed. A proposed team from Australia withdrew in the summer.This first stage begins next summer off Portsmouth, England, before switching to Gothenburg in Sweden, and Bermuda. A total of 10 regattas will take place around the world in 2015 and 2016 before the main event, back in Bermuda.Mr Ellison, the third-richest American behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, is seeking a third straight victory. The billionaire co-founder of Oracle software beat the Swiss biotech billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi in 2010.Earlier this year he quit as chief executive of Oracle – he is now executive chairman and chief technology officer – and this may allow him to devote more of his time to sailing.Asked why he was so keen to win again, Mr Ellison said: “I realised after losing twice that my personality wouldn’t allow me to quit while losing. Then after winning the America’s Cup, I discovered my personality doesn’t allow me to quit while winning. I don’t smoke, but I do sail.”Volvo Ocean Race rescueIn a separate development, nine members of Team Vestas Wind had to be rescued on Sunday after the Danish team was forced to abandon its Volvo Ocean Race boat when it was grounded on a reef in the Indian Ocean.All nine were uninjured when their boat hit the reef in the Cargados Carajos Shoals in Mauritius. The team, led by Australian skipper Chris Nicholson, abandoned the boat before being rescued.The dangers of competitive sailing were underlined in 2013 when a member of the Artemis Racing team was killed in an accident while preparing for the America’s Cup. Andrew Simpson, another British Olympic gold medallist, was killed after his catamaran capsized in San Francisco Bay.Knut Frostad, chief executive of the Volvo Ocean Race, said it was not clear why the Danish boat had hit the reef. The team was the last of seven crews to announce their participation with just six weeks to go before the race began in Alicante, Spain.

But the ""Auld Mug” has never been won by a British crew.The bid is nearly halfway to its funding target, the team of sailors, designers and engineers being assembled. It is time for Sir Ben to tack again with a vengeance.Fourteen months ago, he jumped on board Larry Ellison’s beleaguered Oracle USA boat to pilot an extraordinary America’s Cup victory for the software entrepreneur’s team from 8-1 down, one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport.Oracle’s Cup defence is not until 2017, but there is precious little time for challengers to waste. The build-up begins on Tuesday when Portsmouth is declared one of the international venues for the preliminary America’s Cup series next year and in 2016.Sir Ben could have stayed with Oracle or joined another team. “It was a big decision whether to put this team together and lead it, or take the big pay cheque and go with one of the other teams,” he said.“But I’ve found if you want to achieve something you have to be able to take a risk in life. This is an opportunity to build something special and right a wrong. We have a very proud maritime heritage and the America’s Cup is the only bit that’s missing.”Sir Keith Mills, Lord Coe’s right-hand man at London 2012 and British sailing’s most passionate advocate, sees similarities between British sailing and British motorsport.Lewis Hamilton’s Formula One world title triumph prompted David Cameron to host a Downing Street reception on Monday night in praise of British engineering’s contribution to motorsport.A £12m sailing nerve centre for the America’s Cup bid is under construction at Portsmouth and Sir Keith wants a “Solent Strip” of supporting companies along the south coast to compare with the F1 cluster of businesses along the so-called “Motorsport Valley” around Oxford.“The businesses that spin out of McLaren and other F1 teams – that is very much what we have in mind for Portsmouth,” said Sir Keith.Siemens is among a group of commercial partners. The German industrial conglomerate is providing software technology for the design of the 62ft multihull vessels that will compete for the Cup in 2017.“These boats are nearly fully out of the water,” said Sir Ben. “Racing is much more about aerodynamics. Just as Lewis Hamilton needs a fast car, we will need a fast boat to have a chance of winning the cup.”He has big backers. The foundation of Google chairman Eric Schmidt is one. Shareholders include Sir Keith and Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone, and among board members are Linklaters chairman Robert Elliott and ex-BBC chairman Lord Grade.Investing in an America’s Cup challenge is high risk, even after new limits on boat technology to bring costs down. But the prize is huge, said Sir Keith.“Winning the America’s Cup means you become the commercial rights holder,” he said. “When Alinghi hosted the Cup in Valencia in 2007, it made €100m.”His Team Origin events company will host the two Portsmouth preliminary series and expects to make a profit from the weekends of racing.“Most of the investors look at it as venture money,” said Sir Keith. “Two or three of your ventures will be successful, two or three won’t and the ones in the middle will bump along the runway.”Additional reporting by Simon Greaves"
137;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-11-14T18:02:42Z;Amazon web services: prodigal sums;The company is a great retailer but it shouldn’t be a conglomerate;"Amazon’s shares have had a bad year. If Jeff Bezos wants to fix this, he need only utter these words: “Amazon’s retail and web services operations will, in time, be separate companies.” Admittedly, it is hard to claim that a company trading at more than 100 times earnings suffers from a conglomerate discount. Still, Amazon Web Services has grown up. Its overlap with Amazon’s core business is decreasing. Amazon is a great retailer. It should not be a conglomerate.Amazon said this week that revenues at AWS are growing at 40 per cent a year; the volume of data it stores is more than doubling. AWS has five times as much capacity as its next 14 competitors combined, and a million monthly users. Having got its start in commoditised infrastructure (storage and computing power), AWS has added fancier services which help retain customers and improve margins.One example is Aurora, a database engine that Amazon claims is five times as fast and one-tenth the cost of the leading competitor (cough, cough, Oracle). Gartner says Amazon’s premium customer support is better than most competitors. A long list of Fortune 500 companies and some 900 government agencies use AWS.Those burgeoning revenues appear to be about $5bn presently. If the spun-off AWS shares traded at the same multiple of revenues as its (much weaker) competitor Rackspace, it would be worth $17bn.A much higher valuation is easy to imagine. Even so, AWS loses money. Morgan Stanley thinks AWS’s operating margins are in the negative double digits.The losses are part of what makes a possible spin-off attractive, though. Separating AWS would make Amazon a much more profitable company. On its own, AWS would have to find a way to fund its losses.That may not be too hard. In the current climate, a fast-growing “cloud computing” company need only hold out its hand to get debt or equity financing.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
138;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-10-29T09:13:48Z;Next: weather-beaten Wolfson;Profit warning is the first from clothes retailer since 1998;The Bank of England has been quizzing insurers on how climate change affects them. It should have asked Next instead. Here, an unseasonably warm October has triggered a phenomenon as rare as ski jackets on a mild day: a profit warning from the famously cautious clothes retailer.Next has cut its central full-year guidance for pre-tax profits from £795m to £770m, compared with £695m last time. The warning is so unusual that the stock market darling will probably escape the accusation that it has used the weather as an excuse for buying mistakes. Its last profits warning was in 1998.All well-run companies have internal financial forecasts. Few publish them. Most quoted groups instead play Pin the Tail on the Donkey with analysts, prompting them to move numbers around until they look about right. Lord Wolfson, chief executive and Tory peer, is big enough to own his forecasting mistakes. So is Harriet Green, chief executive of travel group Thomas Cook.Lord W says he wants to share as much data with investors as possible. No kidding. Next has guided the market on profits no less than six times this year. Wednesday’s warning, which depressed the shares only temporarily, merely rebased expectations to where they stood in March.Market scribblers are, however, reduced to mouthpieces by profits guidance from companies, even as they cower beneath the impending blow of commission reform. They can at least have some fun fiddling with stock valuations, though even here Lord W plays a part by publishing a ceiling price for share buybacks. They will mostly conclude that given the strength of the business, a forward earnings multiple of 15 times represents decent value compared with Marks and Spencer at 12, or Debenhams at eight.The checklist for boardroom diversity just got longer. Your directors may embody prevalent ethnicities, genders and sexual preferences. But are any of them geeks?It is a topical question, given that computing is ramifying through every aspect of business like the roots of a mutant fungus. Banks bosses, for example, are quite giddy at the prospect of saving money by connecting disparate internal systems to each other and to customers.But can they tell a phablet from an Etch-a-Sketch? Or spot technological threats among numerous financial ones? Predictably, the boards of Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are crammed with bankers and accountants. The lack of digital natives is an oversight, since banks are becoming data businesses as much as money shufflers. Only HSBC has non-execs trained to take down hackers in unarmed combat, in the form of Safra Catz, president of Oracle, and Sir Jonathan Evans, former head of MI5.The more connected a company is, the easier it is for cyber criminals to riffle through its records, says Richard Horne, cyber security partner at PwC. For example, crooks stole 40m credit card records from US discount retailer Target after hacking its systems via those of an air-conditioning contractor.Elevating your chief technology officer to the board would be a little too close to putting the lunatics in charge of the asylum. But hiring someone else’s CTO as a non-executive director could help a company keep tabs on shared risks. The digi-Ned could also reality-check the sales pitches of cyber security consultants, for whom threats are always real, imminent and in need of costly remediation.British Sky Broadcasting has invested $7m in Whistle Sports, a content group whose stars include five trick-shot basketball players and a man dressed as a giant panda. What could possibly go right? Big businesses usually fail when they try to hang with the kids, just like their middle-aged bosses. The billions the City wasted on dotbomb businesses such as Boo.com memorialise that.However, BSkyB’s boss Jeremy Darroch has competitive reasons for donning a snapback and skinny jeans. Conventional broadcasters are losing viewers to the freelance video bloggers of YouTube. Alfie Deyes’ PointlessBlog is about as entertaining to oldsters as watching a bluebottle buzzing round a ceiling light. But it amuses millions of other so-called “millennials” turned off by professionally made telly.The awesome sauce purveyed by Whistle Sports is in “emerging” US sports such as skateboarding and Frisbee. BSkyB’s stake should give it a vantage point to spot trends it can incorporate into its own programming in hopes of recouping lost eyeballs. The group has made investments in small US tech businesses. With the convergence of TV, telephony and the internet proceeding apace, these give BSkyB wild card options.

139;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Fortune 500 companies spend more than $15bn on corporate responsibility;Drugs and technology groups take the lead in CSR, donating free medicines and software;US and UK companies in the Fortune Global 500 spend $15.2bn a year on corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, according to the first report to quantify this spending.The research, carried out by economic consulting firm EPG, found that there was a clear difference in how US and British companies approached CSR, but that on both sides of the Atlantic spending was dominated by only a handful of groups.In-kind donations, such as donating free drugs to health programmes or giving free software to universities, accounted for 71 per cent of the $11.95bn US spending on CSR.Oracle, for example, which is one of the biggest CSR spenders, grants its software to secondary schools, colleges and universities in about 100 countries.Cash contributions were just 16 per cent of the US total, with employee involvement and fundraising making up the remaining 13 per cent.In the UK, while donating goods and services in kind was the largest component of the $3.25bn CSR activity, it totalled just 46 per cent of the total. Employee volunteering and fundraising made up 34 per cent and cash contributions 20 per cent.Life assurance group Prudential involved employee volunteers in delivering an education programme to children in an impoverished community in central Jakarta.Drugs companies are particularly prominent in CSR activity, with Merck and Johnson & Johnson being among the six groups providing almost two-thirds of the US CSR spend, while London-listed AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline were two of the four companies accounting for more than three-quarters of the British total.Companies often prefer to direct their CSR activity to areas where they are familiar, and this appears to be a factor in why spending on health CSR far outstrips that on education.The study was carried out for “Business Backs Education” which is using an event in London today to step up its campaign to raise the proportion of CSR spending that goes on education from below 10 per cent to 20 per cent.Vikas Pota, chief executive of the Varkey Gems Foundation, the charitable arm of Gems Education which is involved in the campaign, says there is a particular concern about where educational CSR spending goes. “Not enough is being spent in priority areas such as Africa and Latin America,” he says.The study chose a narrow definition of CSR spending, with the aim of excluding corporate activity that was not genuinely philanthropic. But some academics believe that in doing so, the research missed the full scope of business social activity.“For example, a company might engage with education in terms of recruiting new talent in a way that these explicit numbers leave out of the story,” says Ioannis Ioannou of London Business School. “A company doesn’t want to build a school and then just throw money at it. Instead, it wants a model that is self-sustaining or even able to be scaled up.”The findings will give fresh impetus to the debate about how far companies can persuade investors to see the value in CSR activity.A survey last year of 1,000 chief executives by the UN Global Compact and Accenture, the consultancy, suggested that the landscape had become harsher. In 2013, 37 per cent of bosses said the lack of a clear link to business value was a critical factor in deterring them from faster action on sustainability – about twice the number who had cited the failure to identify such a link back in 2007.Mr Ioannou says there can be a wide range of investor reaction to sustainability initiatives, but sees some grounds for encouragement. “Transient investors may not care, but long-term shareholders increasingly see environmental and social governance as a key indicator in terms of investment.“Back in the 1990s, analysts might put a “sell” recommendation on companies with a strong CSR rating as they saw it as wasting investors’ money. But that negative impact has been neutralised in more recent years, and some analysts now view CSR activity more positively.”Mr Pota argues that provided CSR spending is aligned to the company’s business model, investors can see it is a matter of enlightened self-interest.“It’s a matter of how you articulate it to shareholders,” he says, adding that talking about it in terms of “global citizenship and sustainability” can help investors appreciate its value.

This followed a rise in its quarterly dividend by 5 per cent, to 85c a share, late on Thursday, a move that the company said reflected “continued strength and sustainability in our cash flow”.The stock has been hit by the effect on sales from a food safety scandal in China. The dividend lift matched that of the previous year, but was less than some analysts had expected and cast an “unfavourable light” on operating cash flow, according to Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Farmer.The restaurant chain boosted its total dividend by 10 per cent in 2012 and 15 per cent in 2011, before cutting it to 5 per cent in 2013.TransCanada, the Canadian company leading the Keystone XL oil pipeline project, rose as much as 3.5 per cent to a three-year high after Reuters reported on Thursday that the pipeline operator was being targeted by US hedge funds for a possible break-up. TransCanada declined to comment but said that it was “committed to acting in the best interest of shareholders”. The stock is 25 per cent higher so far this year.The Calgary-based company, the second-largest pipeline operator in Canada, released a statement on Friday acknowledging there was “significant trading activity” in its shares and that it is continuously “evaluating its approach to capital allocation”.Microsoft rose 1.8 per cent to $47.52 on news of a second round of lay-offs, eliminating 2,100 jobs of the 18,000 jobs it plans to shed.In July, the company’s new chief executive Satya Nadella unveiled the plans in response to its weak position in mobile technology. The cuts will eliminate 14 per cent of its total workforce.The cuts were spread over several location and countries, but included roughly 750 jobs in greater Seattle, according to local media. The company also announced plans to close its Silicon Valley research and development lab, which employs about 75 researchers.Oracle shares fell 4.2 per cent a day after Larry Ellison stepped aside as chief executive, although he remains as executive chairman and chief technology officer. At the same time as the executive reshuffle, the tech company reported weaker earnings than analysts expected. Oracle posted earnings of 62 cents a share for the first quarter, below consensus estimates of 64 cents a share.Healthcare information and service companies, Athenahealth and Cerner announced plans to join Epic Systems in developing applications for Apple’s mobile HealthKit, joining the to create wearable health management technologies.Shares in Athenahealth rose 4.1 per cent to $135.11, while shares in Cerner fared less well, initially rising as much as 2 per cent before paring back gains to trade 0.7 per cent lower at $58.52.Shares in Apple, were weaker at $100.96 on the day that the company began selling its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.Overall, US equity markets were mixed on Friday. After opened higher on optimism ahead of Alibaba’s record-breaking IPO, stocks pared gains and ended the day little changed. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent, at 2,010.42, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.1 per cent at 17,279.74. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 4,579.79.
141;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-09-19T14:31:22Z;Letter from Lex: ending a relationship;A week where companies considered the benefits and costs of a split;It has been a week for thinking about break-ups, and not just in Scotland. Over on the west coast of the US there has also been lots of hand wringing about the benefits of staying together and the costs of a split. In the end Calpers decided to ditch its 12-year relationship with the hedge fund industry, and will withdraw $4bn from a total of 24 hedge funds and six funds of funds.That was not the only relationship that came to a shuddering halt this week. Vladimir Yevtushenkov, an oligarch who previously had a decent relationship with the Kremlin, found himself under house arrest as part of an investigation into the alleged theft of assets in the region of Bashkortostan. Mr Yevtushenkov owns two-thirds of a conglomerate called Sistema. And Sistema owns four-fifths of Bashneft, Russia’s seventh-largest oil producer. The deteriorating relationship between Mr Yevtushenkov and the Russian authorities is bad news for both businesses.Bayer, the German pharmaceutical group, is also on the verge of a break-up. It has decided to float off its plastics operation, which accounts for about 29 per cent of its revenues. Return on capital in the plastics business is just 6 per cent, while Bayer’s other operations generate returns in the mid teens. So they should enjoy a higher valuation once plastics has gone. The move does, however, raise questions about whether the consumer health business should also be spun off.Meanwhile Nelson Peltz is hoping that US conglomerate DuPont will do something similar. He wants to split the chemicals business from the agriculture, nutrition and health businesses, and says that doing so would save $2bn to $4bn of operating costs. That sounds odd – demergers usually result in higher costs, not lower. And over at restaurant group Darden (owner of the Olive Garden chain), the activists of Starboard Value have come up with a turnround plan which involves separating the property assets and spinning off secondary brands.Sony also needs to think about which parts of its business it ought to keep, and which it should shed. It has announced a change of strategy for its struggling phone business, but if it cannot foresee rapid growth, then it should get out. The same thing goes for PlayStation.In the beer world, things were breaking up before they even got together. SABMiller made a tentative approach to Heineken, which was swiftly (a little too swiftly in our view) rejected by the Dutch brewer. But it was SABMiller’s shares that jumped when the news broke, not Heineken’s. The Anglo-South African brewer might now find itself prey for AB InBev, which has a good record in squeezing savings from acquisitions.Finally on Thursday came news that Larry Ellison is ready to start the process of separating himself from Oracle. It will be a long process though. Although he is stepping aside as chief executive, he is taking on a new role as chairman and chief technology office. Separations, in some cases, do not go very deep.Have a good weekend.Oliver Ralph, Deputy Head of Lex.
142;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-09-18T22:33:11Z;SAP buys software group Concur for $8.3bn;;SAP, the German software company, has agreed to acquire Concur, a developer of programs that help businesses manage travel expenses, in an $8.3bn deal that comes amid wider consolidation of global technology groups.The all-cash deal, which will rank as the largest in the software as a service sector, will see SAP pay $129 per share for Concur, a 20 per cent premium over Thursday’s closing price of $107.80.“The acquisition of Concur is consistent with our relentless focus on the business network,” said Bill McDermott, SAP chief executive.The acquisition is SAP’s biggest by value as it tries to remake its software business for the cloud-computing era.Like arch-rival Oracle and other established players, whose businesses were founded on selling software for companies to run in their own data centres, it is facing upheaval as customers shift their buying habits because of the internet.The German company has bought a string of other so-called software as a service companies, which run software for customers on their own servers and charge monthly subscriptions for access. They include SuccessFactors, which sells services to corporate personnel departments, for $3.5bn in 2011.The deal also represents something of a return to form for Frank Quattrone, the veteran Silicon Valley rainmaker whose investment bank Qatalyst advised Concur on the sale. Mr Quattrone took to Twitter within minutes of the deal being announced to claim credit for his work.The technology sector has experienced a strong period of dealmaking this year.While the headlines have been dominated by larger tech deals, such as Facebook’s $19bn purchase of WhatsApp, much of the dealmaking has been focused on the unglamorous but essential end of the technology sector.Semiconductors, in particular, have enjoyed a wave of consolidation, including Infineon Technologies’ acquisition this month of International Rectifier for close to $3bn. Last month, the FT reported that CSR, the UK chipmaker, had hired banks after receiving bid interest.
143;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle: new skippers;Ellison should not linger before sailing into the sunset;The downside to being an autocrat is the succession planning. Yet Larry Ellison, despite 37 years at the helm of his $182bn company, may pull it off: Oracle’s share price dipped just 2 per cent on the news he was stepping aside as chief executive. The truth is he’s not going anywhere just yet: like Bill Gates, he is likely to lurk for years. Mr Ellison will be Oracle’s board chairman and chief technology officer, while lieutenants Mark Hurd and Safra Catz become CEOs.What if Larry were to leave entirely? The company is in sound financial shape: Oracle throws off tons of cash, generating nearly $7bn in net cash from operating activities last quarter. Operating income was $3.8bn in the quarter, on $8.5bn in revenues – a healthy 44 per cent margin.That’s the good news. But the first quarter numbers also highlight much more challenging trends. Total revenue growth was just 3 per cent year-on-year, weighed down by shrinking hardware sales (thanks, Sun Microsystems) and a drop in new software licences. Oracle is in the middle of the tectonic shift towards renting (not owning) software delivered over the internet. The core business model of selling pricey on-premise database and applications licences to businesses is fading fast.Mr Ellison’s attempts to steer Oracle towards cloud services have led to mixed results. Despite steps in the right direction – the acquisition of Taleo and Rightnow come to mind – a mere $475m in sales came from the cloud and Saas segments last quarter. Even if growing quickly, that is just 5 per cent of overall revenues. And competition for assets is fierce: SAP paid a whopping $8bn for Saas company Concur Technologies on Thursday.As CTO, Mr Ellison will be responsible for overseeing software and hardware development. But is the 70-year-old titan the right person to lead Oracle’s cloud transition? With his succession in place, Mr Ellison should avoid hovering too long (as Mr Gates did at Microsoft). Sailing the yacht off into the sunset would be the perfect ending.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
144;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-09-18T20:58:40Z;Larry Ellison steps aside as Oracle chief;;Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle and the tech industry’s second-richest man, has stepped aside as chief executive of the US database software company to take on a new role as its chairman and chief technology officer.The move closely mirrors the decision 14 years ago by Bill Gates, long Mr Ellison’s arch nemesis in the software world, to hand over the reins at Microsoft while keeping control of its technical direction and taking charge in the boardroom.Oracle, whose stock market value of $182bn puts it second only to Microsoft, will be run instead by joint chief executives, an arrangement that remains extremely rare in corporate America.The leadership reshuffle comes as Oracle faces a seismic shift in business software markets as its customers shift to cloud computing. Some analysts immediately questioned the new arrangement, which cements Mr Ellison’s influence over the company’s technology strategy, even though he moved more slowly than some rivals in the shift to the cloud, hitting Oracle’s growth.In a sign of the race under way to remake the biggest business software companies, German software company SAP also on Thursday announced a deal to buy Concur, an expenses management company that has shifted its own business to the cloud, for $8.3bnThe news came as Oracle reported quarterly results that fell short of analysts’ estimates. Its stock price slipped 2 per cent in after-market trading as it reported revenues of $8.6bn, up 3 per cent, with pro forma earnings per share of 62 cents, up from 59 cents a year before.The new joint chief executives will be Mark Hurd, who was chief executive of Hewlett-Packard until he was forced out four years ago after an investigation into sexual harassment, and Safra Catz, a former investment banker and long-time Ellison dealmaker and lieutenant.“It’s the same people, nothing’s really changed – that’s not a good thing,” said John Rymer, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Quarter after quarter are quarter they continue to slide, they’re not making the transition quickly.”The two have worked as co-presidents since 2010. Mr Ellison sought to paint the move as one that would have little impact on the company’s operations, with the two new CEOs keeping their control over the same parts of the business they have overseen while presidents. “Safra and Mark will now report to the Oracle Board rather than to me,” he said.“I’m going to continue doing what I’ve been doing over the past few years,” Mr Ellison, who turned 70 last month, said on a conference call with analysts.Mr Ellison was one of the last founders to still be at the helm from the generation of technology companies that came to the fore in the 1980s and 1990s on the wave of client-server technology that preceded the rise of the rise of the internet. Mr Gates gave up his own executive role at Microsoft in 2008, while Steve Jobs, a personal friend and neighbour of Mr Ellison, died three years ago.A younger generation of founder-chief executives has since risen to prominence on the back of the internet, led by Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page and Jeff Bezos.Mr Ellison has a personal fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $51.3bn, compared to the $81.3bn of Mr Gates. Most of his wealth is tied up in Oracle, where he owns a quarter of the stock.The large pay packages he has received in recent years, averaging more than $70m, have sparked antagonism from some shareholders, particularly as Oracle’s growth rate has slumped. The company disclosed in July that it has slashed his annual share option award to 3m, from 7m.Mr Ellison’s interests outside Oracle, particularly in sailing, have raised questions at various times in recent years over the level of his involvement in the company’s day-to-day business. Last year, he skipped an appearance at the company’s most important customer event of the year at the last minute, as the boat that he had financed was preparing to race in the final stages of the America’s Cup.In a statement, Michael Boskin, the lead independent director on Oracle’s board, said that Mr Ellison had “made it very clear that he wants to keep working full time and focus his energy on product engineering, technology development and strategy”.

Lex hates this deal, as we detailed in a note last week. The broad point is this: Microsoft left the Ballmer era and entered the Nadella era as a company badly in need of a strategic identity. Mr Nadella seemed to be establishing one when he suggested the Xbox was not core. Now comes his first big deal. It’s for a gaming company. Argh.A few people have been in touch to disagree. They offer three arguments:Argument 1 is irrelevant to the question of strategy, which was our objection. Argument 2 bears thinking about. A future Lex note perhaps? Argument 3 I don’t know enough about to assess. Anybody have any thoughts on that one?
146;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle cuts Ellison’s share options award;;Oracle won muted support from shareholders and corporate governance experts on Tuesday after it cut the number of options it awards each year to co-founder Larry Ellison and other top executives.However, the concession looked unlikely to end all shareholder unrest, with the ALF-CIO, representing union pension funds, saying it would continue to press the company to tie executive rewards more closely to performance.The US software company’s pay practices, which consistently made Mr Ellison one of the best-paid American chief executives, had drawn mounting opposition from investors. Nearly 50 per cent withheld their votes when it came to re-electing members of the board’s compensation committee last year.Mr Ellison has been given options over 3m Oracle shares this year, down from 7m in each of the last seven years, according to a regulatory filing. Option awards to the US software company’s co-presidents, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, have also been cut back sharply, from 5m to 2.25m.“A move away from a sole focus on options is long overdue, but that was not the sole flaw in the company’s pay,” said a spokesman for CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds and has been a prominent critic.Full details of this year’s pay for Oracle’s executives will not be revealed until the company publishes its annual proxy filing, typically in September, leading CtW to question whether Oracle had cut the total pay package or simply changed the mix by reducing option awards.“The headline pay numbers for Ellison and other top executives have been simply excessive,” CtW said.Vineeta Anand, chief research analyst at the AFL-CIO, said the union group was “pleased” with the lower option awards but added: “We believe the company should instead award performance-vesting shares, and disclose the specific performance standards for those shares, in line with our shareholder proposal that we’ve filed at the company.”Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said it was a significant reduction. “Shareholder concerns have reached even the pinnacles of Oracle,” he said.However, Mr Elson still questioned whether the company needed to pay Mr Ellison as much.The value of options handed to Mr Ellison has averaged $77m in each of the last three years, even though he declined a $6.1m cash bonus he was entitled to last year because the company had not met its internal performance expectations.Critics argue that Mr Ellison’s personal stake in Oracle, currently valued at $47bn, should provide enough incentive without the need for any additional stock-related pay.“He has so much stock in the company, pay for him is irrelevant at this point – it became irrelevant a long time ago, except as a scorecard,” Mr Elson said. Another reason for paying large amounts to executives, to prevent them jumping ship to join a rival, was also irrelevant in Mr Ellison’s case, he added.In its proxy statement last year, Oracle said the options handed to its chief executive were “intended to further incentivise and retain him and align his interests with those of Oracle’s other stockholders”.Shareholders have used advisory “say on pay” votes in each of the last two years to register their disapproval of the company’s pay practices, and further shareholder action had already been set in train for this year’s annual meeting.Oracle also halved option grants this year to some other senior executives, with Thomas Kurian, head of product development, being awarded 2m this year and John Fowler, head of systems, 1m.Mr Ellison came third on the list of highest-paid chief executives compiled by labour group AFL-CIO last year, behind Charif Souki of Cheniere Energy, who was paid $142m, and Mario Gabelli of Gamco Investors, at $85m.
147;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-07-25T16:25:52Z;Visa falls after cut to sales guidance;Company points to Russia effect on cross-border transactions;Visa, which has found itself uncomfortably stuck in the middle of political wranglings between the US and Russia, was forced on Thursday to cut its sales guidance, a move that weighed on the company’s shares as well as those of rival credit card processors.The San Francisco-based company pointed to lower-than-expected cross-border transactions across a number of countries where geopolitical tension remains high, particularly Ukraine and Russia.Bryon Pollitt, the company’s chief financial officer, told analysts that while fourth-quarter revenues would rebound, they would be lower than anticipated earlier because of a drop-off in cross-border transactions and “unusually low levels of volatility across a broad range of currencies”.The company highlighted declining transactions between Russia and Ukraine with Europe, among other countries, for the dimmed view.Visa and MasterCard are also likely be hurt by a drive by the Russian government to establish a national payments system, which follows the suspension of services for customers of Russian banks affected by sanctions earlier this year.The comments on Russia came as the company reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $1.4bn, an increase of 11 per cent over the prior year.James Schneider, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, said the results were “disappointing” but that overall consumer spending would improve, lifting the company’s prospects.“We view this as a temporary phenomenon which is being driven by the simultaneous impact of lower international travel volumes in specific geographies, given regional unrest,” Mr Schneider said.Shares of Visa fell 3.58 per cent to close at $214.77, while MasterCard slipped 2.35 per cent to $75.75. American Express slid 1.31 per cent to $91.93.Pandora Media, the music streaming service, fell by more than a tenth as the company continued to rack up losses amid intensifying competition.The company, which has promised to spend aggressively on marketing to compete better with Spotify and Apple, said its loss swelled 70 per cent from a year earlier to $11.7m, or 6 cents per share.“Lack of near-term profits leaves shares vulnerable to shortfall in usage metrics, irrespective of Pandora’s clear success driving usage and ad share,” Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said.Pandora, however, said full-year sales would be above earlier estimates while earnings would range from 16 to 19 cents a share, slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Shares in the company, which counts 76.4m active users, slumped 10.34 per cent to end at $25.75.Wall Street wagged its collective finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Friday for spending that sent the world’s largest online retailer into the red last quarter.Shares in the company declined 9.65 per cent to $324.01.Amazon, which disclosed its second-quarter loss after the stock market closed on Thursday, said that some of the 24 per cent increase in spending last quarter came from investment in its cloud computing business, which competes with Microsoft and Oracle to host websites and store companies’ data digitally.Deckers Outdoor, the owner of the Ugg and Teva shoe brands, said its first-quarter loss was narrower than Wall Street estimates on strong consumer demand for its newer product lines as well as higher initial wholesale shipments heading into the fall.Sales rose 24 per cent from a year earlier to $211m in the three months to June 30. The company’s loss widened by a fifth to $36.8m, or $1.07 per share.Analysts with Jefferies lifted their view of the company to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ following the results. Deckers shares jumped 6.18 per cent to $90.50. Peer Skechers rose 0.17 per cent to end at $52.39.Overall, US equity markets slipped as geopolitical tensions continued to linger. Separately, a report from the Department of Commerce showed a better than expected improvement in durable goods orders in June, although figures for May were revised lower.The S&P 500 fell 0.48 per cent to close at 1,978.34 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.72 per cent to 16,960.57. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.5 per cent to end the day at 4,449.56.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
148;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-07-21T16:37:30Z;EMC rises on hopes Elliott will smoke out bids;Shares in data storage company climb on hopes of break up;Shares in data storage equipment maker EMC rose Monday on hopes that its new activist shareholder, Elliott Management, will smoke out a bidder for the company’s core business.Elliott, a hedge fund with a history of shaking up technology companies, is expected to meet EMC’s chief executive Joe Tucci in the next week to set out the case for a spin-off of its 80 per cent-owned subsidiary VMware and a sale of the storage businesses.The hedge fund has emerged as one of EMC’s top five shareholders after amassing shares and options that give it a stake of more than 2 per cent. EMC has a market capitalisation of $57bn.The investment counts as one of Elliott’s largest to date and comes just months after it sold out of EMC’s smaller rival, NetApp, where it successfully agitated for cost cuts and share repurchases.EMC shares were up more than 3 per cent in early trading.Elliott has already made contact with potential acquirers of the storage business, people familiar with the conversations said.Consolidation has swept through parts of the hardware market, raising expectations for more deals in the storage market as well. However, some potential buyers of EMC may be forced to sit on the sidelines should it come into play.Hewlett-Packard, which has been an active hardware acquirer in the past, is in the midst of repairing its balance sheet after earlier deals, and has turned its focus to software and services. Meanwhile Dell, which has also moved into storage as it diversifies beyond PCs, went private last year, robbing it of the chance to use stock to make large acquisitions.Oracle and Cisco Systems have also set out to build broader IT hardware divisions, though they may shy away from buying a traditional storage business that risks being disrupted by newer technologies from the likes of VMware.Mr Tucci, the architect of EMC’s strategy of running companies in promising new markets at arm’s length rather than integrating them, is due to retire early next year, which is why Elliott’s decided to move now.Mr Tucci’s approach has been credited with allowing VMware to grow unfettered, making it the most successful new software start-up since Oracle and accounting for the lion’s share of its parent’s stock market value. Elliott has told other EMC shareholders it believes the core business would be valued more highly as an acquisition target if VMware were separated.VMware recently expanded its strategy to compete in EMC’s core market, with a more modern software-based approach designed to reduce the need for storage systems like those sold by the parent.Ownership of VMware has caused friction in the past inside EMC. Pat Gelsinger, VMWare’s chief executive officer, described in a recent interview how his company’s willingness to partner with a rival storage company, NetApp, had brought complaints from some EMC salespeople.He credited Mr Tucci with allowing VMware to develop independently and not be hampered by its parent’s business priorities.VMware began including a line in its regulatory filings early last year that it would not take any actions that would hamper the tax-free nature of any future spin-off by EMC.
149;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-07-21T16:22:53Z;British America’s Cup team undeterred as Australians pull out;Ben Ainslie Racing to sail despite Team Australiachallengers of record or withdrawal;Britain’s Ben Ainslie Racing on Monday underlined its commitment to contest the next America’s Cup after Team Australia, the official lead challenger, withdrew at the weekend because of cost concerns.The team said it was disappointed at Team Australia’s “regrettable” withdrawal from the 35th event but remained supportive of the continued drive by Oracle Team USA, the defender, “towards a more commercial event format, along with a more sustainable future for this historic trophy”.BAR plans to bid to host two America’s Cup World Series events in 2015-16 at its new home in Portsmouth. Sir Ben Ainslie aims to win the trophy, or Auld Mug, for Britain for the first time in the event’s 163-year history. “We will continue our own preparations for the 35th America’s Cup and look forward to an exciting future,” it said.As Oracle’s tactician, Sir Ben was key to Oracle’s success at the San Francisco regatta last year. The UK government has granted more than £7m in funding towards the Olympic champion’s America’s Cup sailing team base in Portsmouth.Sir Russell Coutts, America’s Cup Event Authority chief executive, confirmed that Australia’s Hamilton Island Yacht Club had withdrawn its challenge for the 35th event, which is to be sailed in either San Diego or Bermuda – a decision on which is expected in October – in 2017.Bob Oatley, owner of the club, said: “Ultimately our estimate of the costs of competing were well beyond our initial expectation and our ability to make the formula of our investment and other commercial support add up. We are bitterly disappointed that this emerging team of fine young Australian sailors will not be able to compete at the next America’s Cup under our banner.”Hamilton Island, as challenger, represented all the other competing teams in talks with the holders of the trophy, after Oracle Team USA, funded by software billionaire Larry Ellison, retained it in San Francisco. Oracle won against New Zealand after coming back from 8-1 down in a dramatic finale.New Zealand’s challenge is partly government funded, and the other teams assembling bids include BAR, Italy’s Luna Rossa, and Artemis Racing, which represents the Royal Swedish Yacht Club. Artemis was challenger of record at the last America’s Cup.The organisers say they have agreed not to officially name challengers until the deadline on August 8. Teams must submit $1m to enter by then even though competition dates for 2015 might not be known until November, and details regarding the finals for 2017 will possibly not be released until the end of this year.The next contest will be sailed in new AC62 wing-sailed catamarans with a crew of eight, at least two of whom must come from the boat’s country.Australia won the America’s Cup in 1983, when it took the trophy from the US after the Americans had held it for 152 years. But this is the first time it has put up a team for more than a decade. Mat Belcher, Olympic gold medallist and voted 2013 world sailor of the year by the International Sailing Federation, was announced as skipper of Team Australia earlier this year.In the 34th America’s Cup, when San Francisco’s Golden Gate Yacht Club accepted a challenge on behalf of Oracle from Yacht Club di Roma, the Italians also pulled out, citing financial problems.
150;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-06-30T22:29:09Z;Salesforce.com at the crossroads;;Salesforce.com, the company that did more than any other to invent the software-as-a-service industry, is reaching a turning point.After years of rapid growth, it has a pressing need for the more evolved infrastructure, processes and rounded management team of the large company it has become. And with growth starting to slow, it is coming closer to a seminal moment: when investors will start expecting it to report real profits, and not just on a pro-forma basis. The appointment of a new chief financial officer on Monday is the latest sign that is preparing for the changes.Mark Hawkins, CFO of Autodesk for the last five years, made it clear that he thinks changes will be needed as Salesforce looks beyond the $5bn in revenues expected for this year. As a veteran of Dell and Hewlett-Packard at a time when those companies went through significant growth, he made much of his experience during an interview on Monday.“I am not new to scaling,” he said. “What works at $500m doesn’t work at $5bn – and what works at $5bn doesn’t work at $10bn.”Mr Hawkins, 55, replaces Graham Smith, 54, who announced his retirement earlier this year. It’s a smooth transition, but hard to escape the conclusion that this is the latest step in assembling a management team with more big-company experience to back up CEO Marc Benioff.Keith Block, a former head of Oracle in North America, was brought in last year to head sales. As one person familiar with Salesforce’s internal workings puts it: when a company gets to be this size, the CEO can no longer double as its salesman-in-chief – something that Mr Benioff has done admirably in his company’s first 15 years.Harder to handicap is what Mr Hawkins’ arrival means for the company’s financial strategy.Salesforce has thrived on the “jam tomorrow rather than jam today” principle: that it could deliver bottom-line profits at any time but there’s more value to be had from investing for rapid growth. Mr Hawkins wasn’t giving anything away on Monday, pledging “continuity” with the existing approach.“It’s difficult to grow fast and expand margins,” said Mr Smith, while claiming that the company has a “clear line of sight to [revenues of] $10bn” based on the markets it is already in.Some investors, however, have started to ask when this will translate into profits. And according to a person familiar with the board’s thinking, this is also a question that has been on the minds of the company’s directors.Lower stock-based compensation expenses in the coming years will help, said Mr Smith. But with acquisitions expected to play a big part in its continued expansion, he also warned that amortisation costs from deals could delay the move into profit under formal US accounting rules.“I would certainly be hopeful that by the time we get to $10bn we’ll be GAAP profitable,” he concluded.Whether investors will be prepared to wait that long is starting to loom as one of the big questions facing the company.
151;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-06-27T16:21:52Z;Big Data: welcome to the Matrix;Fast growth, a big market, and the chance of a buyout;If you haven’t heard, big data is everywhere. But not for investors: pure-play options are as rare as a glitch in the Matrix. You can place your bet on Splunk, a data cruncher with a market capitalisation 20 times revenues. Or Qlik, a Swedish business intelligence software company with 30,000 users and half a billion dollars in sales. Otherwise, try Tableau, which sells user-friendly visual analysis software and is doubling its revenues every year.Prospects are sunny: Gartner data shows that businesses spend $16bn a year on software for business intelligence and analytics, and the market grows 8 per cent annually. Incumbents – Oracle, SAP, IBM and SAS – collectively control about 60 per cent of the market, but they have not been growing as fast as the overall market. The type of software offered by Tableau and Qlik – “data discovery” – is the fastest growing segment, pulling in more than $2bn annually. And there’s room to grow further: a Gartner survey found only 8 per cent of businesses are using big data analytics at all.These companies are not perfect. Tableau’s net income is turning negative as it churns more money into marketing. Qlik’s revenue growth has fallen into the teens (shock, horror), and uncertainty looms over the launch of its next product, says UBS. Splunk – which says it can index any machine data in any format – has not yet figured out how to turn a profit.Owning all three might not be a bad bet. If they were combined into a single mythical company – let’s call it Tablunklik – the aggregate results would be impressive. Tablunklik would have revenues of more than a billion dollars and would be growing 40 per cent annually. Profits would be slim – with operating margin of 5 per cent last year – but at least they would exist. The price is more appealing after falling 30 per cent since March 1. The only problem is that remains expensive from the perspective of the big guys who might someday make an acquisition: Tablunklik’s market cap is more than $13bn. Down the road, Tablunklik will either succeed wildly, die spectacularly, or get bought. In two out of three scenarios, shareholders get a happy ending.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
152;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-06-23T21:32:54Z;BlackBerry rises on ‘meaningful progress’;;BlackBerry shares rose above $10 apiece for the first time since March after brokerage Evercore lifted its view as the company makes “meaningful progress” on its turnround.Analysts with Evercore increased their rating on the company to equal-weight from underweight, marking the first time in at least two years that three-quarters of investment banks have rated BlackBerry a buy or hold equivalent.The smartphone maker, which has turned its focus to software and its BlackBerry Messenger service, said last week that it had swung to a profit in the three months to the end of May compared with a loss a quarter earlier.“We stick to our call that we like BlackBerry’s plan, albeit late, but now acknowledge stabilising cash burn . . . and a good plan to hold on to the core subscriber base,” Mark McKechnie said.Mr McKechnie projects the company will grow BlackBerry Messenger to a $230m business and continue to win back corporate subscribers who had switched to other platforms including Good, which recently filed paperwork to float shares publicly.BlackBerry shares climbed 3.24 per cent to close at $10.85.Shares of Micros Systems rose 3.36 per cent to $67.98 after Oracle agreed to buy the company, which sells internet-based cash registers to retailers, for $4.6bn in cash.Micros investors will receive $68 a share, according to the terms of the deal.Like other, older, software makers, Oracle is having to rapidly adapt to an era of so-called cloud computing, in which customers receive software online and pay for it as they use it rather than on an annual licence model.Oracle shares rose 0.69 per cent to $41.10.The merger blitz on Monday was not left solely to the tech industry after Wisconsin Energy agreed to buy rival Integrys Energy for $9.1bn in cash, shares and assumed debt.The deal expands Wisconsin’s customer base – for both gas and electricity – into Minnesota and Michigan.Combined, the company will have about 4.3m customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota.Gale Klappa, chief executive of Wisconsin, will run the combined company and insisted on Monday that the acquisition would “create the premier regulated utility system in the Midwest”.The companies said the acquisition valued Integrys at $71.47 a share.Wisconsin, whose history dates back to the late 19th century, said the dividend of the combined company would be about 65 to 70 per cent of its earnings.Shares of Integrys rose 12.14 per cent to $68.35 while Wisconsin fell 3.45 per cent to $45.27.Lululemon advanced as speculation rose that the company’s founder could mount a bid to take the Yoga-apparel maker private.According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Dennis Wilson is working with Goldman Sachs as he debates launching a proxy fight for extra board seats.Mr Wilson may also partner with a private equity firm to purchase Lululemon outright.Shares in the Vancouver-based retailer rose 2.54 per cent to $41.25.Nordstrom was under pressure on Monday after broker Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the department store chain to neutral from buy.The investment bank, which expects overall discretionary spending to accelerate after the harsh winter, believes Nordstrom shares have outperformed and have little upside left.Nordstrom shares fell 0.53 per cent to $67.73.US equity markets ended the day flat after six consecutive advances despite better than expected manufacturing and home sales reports.The S&P 500 fell 0.01 per cent to 1,962.61 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.06 per cent to 16,937.26.

153;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
154;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle / Micros: solid premise;Larry Ellison has a flashy reputation, but a staid approach suits him well;It is easy to dismiss Larry Ellison’s acquisition strategy. His software stalwart, Oracle, is rooted in old-fashioned software licensing, but buys up the trendiest “software as a service” companies. The prices are high and the impact on Oracle’s growth is often modest. The $5bn purchase of Micros Systems, announced on Monday, does not fit that mould. Micros provides point-of-sale devices (card readers and the like) as well as software (mostly the licensed kind) to restaurants and hotels. But the licensing v SAAS debate misses what Oracle is doing: amassing a wide suite of applications, delivered any which way, across functions and industries.Micros software manages payments, reservations and worker scheduling at 330,000 locations worldwide. To Oracle that is 330,000 more places to sell Oracle software for, say, marketing or human resources. According to Wedbush, the purchase price of 13 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation compares favourably with the 18 times that NCR paid for Micros rival Radiant Systems in 2012.Despite news of the transaction leaking, Oracle did not announce it with its fourth-quarter earnings last Thursday. It reported soft revenue growth and its shares slid 4 per cent. However, after soft quarters in early 2013, Oracle shares have rallied 35 per cent in the past year. It now breaks out the results of its SAAS businesses that, while accounting for less than 5 per cent of group sales, are growing at double-digit rates (the core business was flat).Mr Ellison’s strategy is becoming clearer. Mix in sensible deals such as Micros among the riskier bets on high-fliers. Avoid massive transactions altogether. All the while, keep profit margins high and return billions in cash to investors. Mr Ellison has a flashy reputation, but a staid approach suits him well.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
155;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-06-23T17:34:38Z;Oracle buys Micros Systems for $5.3bn;;Oracle has returned to big acquisitions to try to rekindle its lagging growth, with the announcement on Monday of the purchase of retail technology company Micros Systems for $5.3bn.The deal will need to be followed by a further round of big purchases if the US business software maker is to avoid coming out on the wrong side of the cloud computing revolution, according to a growing chorus of Wall Street analysts.“Investors want to see Oracle make acquisitions – there’s a window of opportunity,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at FBR. “Otherwise the ultimate fear is that they will miss out and be a low single-digit growth company.”The all-cash price is the most Oracle has paid in an acquisition since it spent $7.4bn on Sun Microsystems in 2010. It represents a partial response to a recent acceleration in the shift in technology purchases by big customers towards cloud services, rather the on-premise software and systems that make up 97 per cent of Oracle’s business.Larry Ellison, chief executive, has tried to persuade Wall Street that the company already has a significant presence in cloud computing, using last week’s quarterly earnings call to claim the second-largest cloud applications software company, behind Salesforce.com. But a lack of growth in its core software business, which the company blamed on its customers increasingly preferring cloud services instead, unnerved investors.Micros sells point of sale systems and related technology in the retail and hospitality industry, making it the latest “vertical” acquisition to take Oracle deeper into a particular industry. In the nine months of its latest fiscal year, two-thirds of its $1bn in revenue came from services, with 21 per cent from point of sale hardware and the rest from software.The acquisition price, equivalent to $4.6bn net of the $650m of cash and short-term investments Micros had at the end of March, will leave Oracle with net cash of $10bn. With capacity to borrow at low rates, the company could do as much as $20bn of acquisitions in the next 12-18 months as it sought new sources of growth, with big data companies such as Tableau and Splunk, and security concerns such as Imperva, as potential targets, said Mr Ives.Oracle agreed to pay $68 a share in cash for Micros, a premium of 18 per cent to the price before news of a possible deal was first reported last week.Mr Ellison led the consolidation of the business software market in the middle of the past decade, cementing Oracle’s place as the second-largest independent software company by revenue, behind Microsoft. He has already pursued acquisitions of cloud companies, spending a combined $3.4bn on RightNow and Taleo more than two and a half years ago, though that has not been enough to make up for the lull in the rest of Oracle’s business.
156;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-06-20T15:57:45Z;Coach slides on store closure plans;US handbag maker’s move triggers price target cuts and downgrades;Coach, the venerable US handbag maker that has struggled amid intensifying competition, continued a three-day decline on Friday after the company said on Thursday it would close more than a fifth of its North American full-price stores.The move, which Coach says will cost as much as $300m and bring its mainline store base to roughly 268 locations, triggered at least 20 price target cuts on Wall Street and three downgrades.Chief executive Victor Luis said that the entry-level luxury handbag market had “shifted dramatically” and at times at an investor day alluded to the successes of Kate Spade and Michael Kors.“We have not put sufficient investments and resources behind our brand and fleet, and we have not demonstrated enough fashion innovation in an increasingly competitive category,” Mr Luis said.Analysts with Wells Fargo said the time it will take to complete the company’s transformation, which will also see Coach shift away from heavy promotions, disappointed the market.“Coach is attempting something very difficult in trying to transform its brand, reduce promotions, and attract new customers,” analyst Paul Lejuez said. “The most similar situation, in our view, is that of JC Penney.”Coach shares declined 3 per cent to $34.73 on Friday, taking its losses since the year’s start to 39 per cent.Rival Ralph Lauren rose 1 per cent to $155.57 while Kate Spade climbed 3 per cent to $39.20. Michael Kors was little changed at $88.60.Shares of Oracle, which makes servers, software and developed the Java programming platform, fell 4 per cent to $40.82 after the company missed expectations on two fronts in its latest earnings report.Sales climbed 3 per cent to $11.3bn, while profits fell 4 per cent from a year earlier to $3.6bn, or 80 cents per share. When adjusted for certain items, Oracle said it earned 92 cents per share.Analysts had expected Oracle to earn 95 cents a share on sales of $11.5bn. The company said it failed to ignite new software licence sales, which account for a third of net revenues.“While Oracle accounting is more conservative than many [‘Software as a Service’] peers . . . the low growth rate suggests that the ‘base’ of SaaS business such as 2012 and 2013 acquisitions Taleo, RightNow and Eloqua is underperforming its market,” Citi analyst Walter Pritchard said.Mr Pritchard also downgraded the company to neutral from buy.Darden Restaurants said on Friday that “legal, financial advisory and other costs related to implementation of [its] strategic action plan,” as well as the writedown of the value of some assets, dented profits in the quarter to May 25.The company, which is based in Florida, has been engaged in a high-profile battle with activist investors over how to generate more value from its businesses.Last month, Darden agreed to sell its Red Lobster chain to a private equity firm for $2.1bn, an agreement that riled several activist funds.Profits in the quarter tumbled 35 per cent to $86.5m, or 65 cents a share. Legal and advisory costs, as well as impairment charges, accounted for 19 cents of the drop. When excluding those costs, the company said it earned 84 cents a share, below Wall Street forecasts.Shares of the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse restaurants owner fell 4 per cent to $47.58.RadioShack, which lost almost $100m in the three months to May 3, fell 10 per cent on Friday to 92 cents, taking it below $1 for the first time in at least 30 years.At its height, RadioShack commanded a market value of more than $15bn – larger than retailers such as Nordstrom and Tiffany – and made more than $2.4bn in profits between 2000 and 2010.But a rapidly changing retail landscape, which has felled so-called big box electronics chains CompUSA and Circuit City, has pushed RadioShack’s market value below $100m.Gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson fell 9 per cent to $15.52 after the company forecast full-year earnings below Wall Street expectations.Overall, US equity markets coasted to new record heights. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,962.87 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.15 per cent to 16,947.08. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite inched 0.2 per cent higher to 4,368.04.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
157;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Oracle hit as growth rate disappoints;;An acceleration in the shift towards cloud computing contributed to weaker than expected results at Oracle in the latest quarter, sending the US database software company’s shares down by more than 6 per cent in after-market trading.However, Oracle executives tried to cast the results in a positive light as they put the shortfall down to accounting rules that prevented them from reporting the full benefit of cloud computing contracts sealed in the final quarter of their fiscal year.Wall Street had been hoping for an acceleration in Oracle’s growth rate as it emerged from a weak period for sales in its core software business. Its new, faster-growth cloud operations have also picked up to a level where they have started to make a more significant contribution to overall results.However, revenues for the latest quarter crept up by only 3 per cent from the year before, to $11.3bn, nearly $200m short of analysts’ forecasts. At the same time, sales of new software licences – an important measure of the health of the company’s underlying business – were unchanged from a year ago, at $3.77bn.Safra Catz, co-president and chief financial officer, attributed the softness in sales of new software to a preference among customers for newer cloud services. Accounting rules require some of the revenue from these longer-term contracts to be deferred until later years, depressing revenue in the short term.“I think we’re doing better in cloud than we expected, that has become extremely popular,” Ms Catz said. “As a result, we have less of a growth in new licence.”In an effort to persuade analysts to focus on its higher-growing businesses, Oracle reported its cloud revenues separately for the first time. Revenues from software as a service and platform as a service – the highest-margin parts of the cloud business – rose 25 per cent to $322m in the quarter, though they still represented only 3 per cent of overall revenues.Larry Ellison, chief executive, also tried to counter Wall Street’s fears that the cloud business will bring lower profitability than Oracle’s traditional software operations. Gross margins of 40-50 per cent are possible thanks to the company’s ability to use much of its own technology to run its cloud operations, he said. “We buy electricity and buildings, everything else we make,” he said.Oracle’s profits also fell short, with earnings per share of 92 cents on the pro forma basis analysts use to judge the company, compared to the 95 cents that had been expected. On a formal accounting basis, earnings per share were unchanged at 80 cents. The company blamed 2 cents a share of its earnings shortfall on a foreign currency loss related to Venezuela.
158;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-06-12T22:26:52Z;Taxing time ahead as offshore rules come under more scrutiny;;The OECD called it “ the golden age” of tax planning: a period in which multinational companies pushed ever more of their profits offshore and pushed their effective tax rates down.In the past eight years, this simple strategy has enabled some of the largest US corporations – including Oracle, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson – to cut their tax bills by a quarter, on average – while boosting their annual earnings by up to 24 per cent.But there are signs that both politicians and investors are increasingly questioning the merits of a tax regime that has made such savings possible.Earlier this week, the joint committee on taxation, which advises the US Congress, warned that American companies were incurring extra costs from keeping their profits outside the US. It cited research showing a “ballooning” of company balance sheets, as multinationals chose to borrow more for spending purposes, rather than repatriate their offshore cash and pay US tax on it.Investors are also starting to worry that the positive effect of tax-cutting strategies on companies’ earnings could go into reverse. Earlier this month, Luca Paolini, chief strategist of Pictet Asset Management, warned investors against complacency by pointing out that a quarter of international companies’ improvement in net margins had been achieved only by reducing their tax bills.Many technology and pharmaceuticals companies have been at the forefront of a 15-year push by US multinationals to earn more of their profits in tax havens and in low-tax jurisdictions, such as Ireland and Singapore.To measure this, the Financial Times reviewed the accounts of 14 cash-rich tech and pharmaceuticals companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Amgen, EMC, eBay, Eli Lilly and Medtronic.Between them, the 14 held $479bn-worth of cash and similar assets offshore – a little more than half of the $947bn of total offshore cash that Moody’s estimated was held by US non-financial companies at the end of 2013.By doing so, the 14 companies surveyed cut their tax rates by an average of 7.7 percentage points between 2004-06 and 2011-13. In the most recent period, they were, on average, taxed at a rate of just 10 per cent, down from 11 per cent in 2004-06. By comparison, average OECD corporate tax rates fell 3.4 points to 25.15 per cent over that timescale.A little more than 85 per cent of this average tax reduction could be attributed to the companies’ fast expanding foreign operations.Many of the companies point out that these apparently low foreign tax rates are not the full story. Investors, they say, are fully aware that they owe extra tax to the US – at a rate of up to 35 per cent – on any foreign earnings when they are brought back to the US.They are exempt only from reporting the “deferred” tax charge – reflecting the money they will ultimately have to pay the US – in their accounts for as long as they can prove the profits are being indefinitely reinvested abroad. And a company’s decision to indefinitely reinvest its cash overseas can be reversed, resulting in big increases in the reported tax rates. For example, eBay recently surprised the market by reporting a $2.3bn loss after recording a $3bn deferred tax liability, saying that it needed the “flexibility” to use foreign cash for US dealmaking.Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceuticals company, also bucked the trend of falling tax rates, after a 2011 change in its accounting treatment. It has provided for $6.6bn of deferred tax – nearly two-thirds of its total tax bill over the past three years. It was the only company surveyed by the FT to report a tax rate above 25 per cent for 2011-13, except for Apple, which also reports “deferred” tax on some of its offshore earnings.Regulators are now pushing some cash-rich companies to disclose more details of their offshore cash. Google recently had to explain to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it planned to spend up to $30bn on foreign acquisitions and technology rights, after it was challenged to describe its “specific plans” for reinvesting undistributed earnings.In addition, the SEC has called on some companies to explain why their foreign profits are “disproportionate” to their foreign sales. On average, the companies surveyed by the FT reported two-thirds of their profits outside the US but only half their sales. This followed an eight-year period in which foreign profits grew at nearly three times the pace of foreign sales – a trend similar to one identified by Harry Grubert, senior economist at the US Treasury. He warned that “profits, not sales, are being globalised” after discovering a 14 percentage-point increase in foreign profits at multinationals, as a proportion of the total, between 1996 and 2004.Last year, the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress, warned that the process was continuing as US companies moved more profits out of high tax countries, including the US, into “tax preferred” countries, such as Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.Some companies argue that relatively higher profit margins outside the US are to be expected, given the heavy research and development costs they incur in their home country, the cost of servicing US debt, the cost of their corporate headquarters and, in some cases, US litigation costs.David Lewis, vice-president of global taxes and assistant treasurer of Eli Lilly, says that it is “unremarkable” that the company’s reinvested earnings had more than doubled in a period when sales growth had only nearly doubled. “This doubling should be expected of a company that is growing throughout the world, especially in non-US markets,” he argues.Oracle, Johnson & Johnson and EMC declined to comment. Pfizer, Cisco, Qualcomm, Merck, Amgen and Medtronic did not respond to request for comment. Google made no formal comment and eBay said that it complied with all international tax rules. Microsoft and Apple referred to past statements in which they said that they abided by US and foreign tax laws – but believed they should be improved.‘Book tax’ more important than cash kindUS companies invest about 55 per cent of their near $2tn of foreign earnings in productive assets, such as factories and offices, according to academic research. But some of them have told researchers that they would bring more of this cash back to the US if they were not deterred by the prospect of high tax bills.Companies also say that the accounting rules create an incentive for them to designate their offshore earnings as “permanently reinvested” abroad, as this spares them from the need to earmark money in their accounts to pay future US tax bills.Academic studies have even found that so called “book tax” – the tax bill that is reported in a company’s accounts, but may vary from the “cash tax” amount that is actually paid – can influence share prices, executive bonuses and competitor analysis.Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California says: “Book tax is extremely important. It is the filter through which we see companies. It dominates corporate behaviour much more than cash taxes do.”Michelle Hanlon, a professor at MIT, says that her research shows that moving offshore and retaining cash there is at least in part driven by “the accounting for taxes that shows up on the financial accounting statements”, in addition to the real financial impact.
159;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-06-10T10:46:08Z;Britain launches bid for oldest trophy in sport;;The London 2012 Olympics’ feelgood factor was rekindled on Tuesday when details of a British challenge for the America’s Cup, the oldest continually contested trophy in sport, were announced.The official launch of Sir Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup team will see the UK’s most successful Olympic sailor spearheading the campaign for a 35th cup challenge, after guiding Larry Ellison’s Oracle crew to a comeback victory last summer in San Francisco.Sir Ben aims to win the trophy, or Auld Mug, for the first time in its 163-year history. It was announced at the launch event in the National Maritime Museum that he has enough private seed capital for the challenge, allowing it to move to the next phase of corporate funding to raise at least £80m to build a boat and team.He said on Tuesday the bid had sufficient backing from a team of private investors – as opposed to campaigns funded solely by wealthy individuals such as Larry Ellison’s Oracle crew – to appeal for commercial sponsorship.The next contest is likely to be in 2017. Possible venues for the cup’s finale include San Francisco, Chicago, Newport Rhode Island, San Diego or Honolulu.Among early investors for the British boat are Sir Charles Dunstone, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, and Sir Keith Mills, both backers of a previous bid to raise a team with Sir Ben.Sir Ben, the four times Olympic gold medallist, played a prominent role in Oracle’s comeback from 1-8 down to 9-8 winning defenders of the cup.Candidate ports to be the British base for his team are being studied. At the same time, a venue for a British 45ft catamaran racing regatta are being considered, Plymouth’s hosting of a successful 2011 event making it among the frontrunners.
160;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-05-11T19:04:56Z;Pressure grows on Oracle over Ellison pay;;Oracle is facing renewed pressure over the pay of its founder and chief executive Larry Ellison from investors who say the software company has ignored mounting shareholder concerns.A group of pension funds will this week submit resolutions to be voted on at Oracle’s annual meeting later this year demanding greater shareholder rights and more accountability over how executive pay is set.Mr Ellison is among the best paid executives in corporate America, with an annual options package whose value has averaged $77m over the past three years. A majority of shareholders have voted against the company’s remuneration policies in the annual advisory vote for two years in a row.“Oracle is one of the most recalcitrant companies when it comes to corporate governance, with a chief executive who acts not like a CEO but like a king,” said Vineeta Anand, chief research analyst at the AFL-CIO, the federation of trades unions, which is co-ordinating the pension funds’ actions.“Shareholders have a right to demand accountability and a fiduciary responsibility to seek to make changes when they don’t get it.”The deadline for shareholders to submit resolutions to the Oracle annual meeting, which will be held in the autumn, is May 23. Oracle did not respond to a request for comment.The Nathan Cummings Foundation will submit a proposal which, if approved, would mean that shareholder groups holding more than 3 per cent could nominate their own directors for election on the official ballot rather than having to pay for a separate one.Shareholders have a right to demand accountability and a fiduciary responsibility to seek to make changes when they don’t get itThe idea is to make it easier to replace directors, giving shareholders additional leverage in discussions with the board.Last year, up to 49 per cent of shareholders withheld their support in votes on the re-election of members of Oracle’s compensation committee, and only 39 per cent supported the company’s compensation policies.The AFL-CIO said Oracle had not responded to a letter last month asking for discussions on pay.In an exchange of letters with the campaign group Change to Win on the eve of last year’s shareholder vote, Dorian Daley, the company’s general counsel, set out its justification for Mr Ellison’s package, which she called “an extremely low price to pay to continue to procure the leadership services of the one of the world’s foremost pioneers in the field of information management technology”.This story has been amended since publication to correct that the lead filer of the proposal is the Nathan Cummings Foundation, not New York City’s public employees’ pension system
161;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Google victory against Oracle overturned;;A US appeals court on Friday overturned a Google victory against Oracle in a 2012 software case, setting the stage for a new courtroom showdown between the technology groups.The decision is set to revive Oracle’s claim for damages of as much as $1bn and will introduce a new uncertainty for Google’s Android operating system, which has become the world’s most widely used smartphone software platform.Oracle’s original case was based on claims that Android breached both patents and copyright protection in its Java technology. Java is widely used by mobile software developers to make sure their programs can run on many different handsets. The federal court in Northern California sided with Google, though Oracle appealed the copyright part of the decision to the Federal Circuit.The dispute arose after the companies failed to agree terms for a Java licensing deal. Google went on to replicate parts of the Java software anyway, so that developers would still find it easy to write apps to run on Android – a move intended to expand the appeal of the platform and increase its chances of rivalling Apple’s iPhone.In a decision released on Friday, the Federal Circuit ruled that the lower court had set the bar too high when assessing copyright standards, and that the software copied by Google deserved protection.The internet company and its supporters in the open source software world have warned in the past that granting copyright protection would have a widespread impact on the software industry.We’re disappointed by this ruling, which sets a damaging precedent for computer science and software development, and are considering our optionsThe case turned on APIs, or pieces of code that let programs run on top of operating systems like Android. By limiting the ability of others to reverse-engineer APIs, Google claimed that a decision in favour of Oracle would make it harder to create technologies that operate well together, holding back innovation.In hailing Friday’s decision, however, Oracle countered that greater legal protection for software code would boost innovation, not hamper it. “The Federal Circuit’s opinion is a win for Oracle and the entire software industry that relies on copyright protection to fuel innovation and ensure that developers are rewarded for their breakthroughs,” it said.Google said after the hearing: “We’re disappointed by this ruling, which sets a damaging precedent for computer science and software development, and are considering our options.”The case was referred back to the lower court to decide whether Google was entitled to a defence of “fair use”, which allows limited copying in certain circumstances. The 2012 case led to a heated face-off between the technology companies, with chief executives Larry Page and Larry Ellison both taking the stand to make their case.
162;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-04-07T21:01:59Z;Bucharest heads for recovery quicker than its neighbours;The poverty-stricken image of Romania is not mirrored in the capital;Mention Bucharest, and many in western Europe will recall the downfall of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989 and the poverty that engulfed the country as it struggled to shake off its communist past.But those images are from another era, says Adrian Barbu, 64, who regularly visits the Romanian capital, the city of his youth, as part of running his own Switzerland-based pharmaceutical consultancy.“In the villages maybe nothing has changed, but Bucharest is a different world. It’s really quite a westernised place now, with skyscrapers, malls, offices and hotels. It has the same level of luxury [on offer] as you might have in any west European city,” he says.It is a point of view shared by many in the commercial property sector.“The general image of Romania abroad, especially among those with no local record, is poor, but companies, and their people, that have actually worked here are generally happy,” says Gijs Klomp, managing director of JLL, the property consultancy, in Romania.He points to companies that, having made an initial investment, soon expanded further, on the basis of a favourable first experience. “We have Renault [the French carmaker], which bought the Dacia automotive plant, and subsequently invested heavily in Romania, including research and development facilities,” he says.Others include Hewlett-Packard and Oracle, technology companies that started in the country with small operations, but have grown to create “massive” shared service companies and R&D operations, he says. “As a rough estimate, based on their rented office space, Oracle and HP together must now have some 5,500 staff in Romania today,” says Mr Klomp.However, the improved environment in Bucharest did not help when the global crisis first took hold. Despite seeing fast growth in the run-up to Romania’s accession to the EU in 2007, the country went into a deep recession in 2009.The good news is that the capital city appears to be moving into a recovery relatively early, certainly compared with Budapest in neighbouring Hungary.JLL puts new delivery last year at 119,000 square metres. While barely a third that of 2009’s total, it is still 2.5 times the 2012 figure, and pushed the total office space through the 2m sq m level. With gross take up of 293,000 sq m last year, about a more than in 2012, overall vacancy rates decreased slightly to an estimated 14.4 per cent.With another 120,000-140,000 sq m due for delivery this year, the vacancy rate may creep upwards, Mr Klomp says, although take up is also expected to continue rising.However, several involved in the industry note that the global figures mask wide variations in the market.“Bucharest, maybe even more than other markets [in the region], shows a huge gap between prime, central locations, where vacancy rates are under 10 per cent, and the less favoured sub-markets, where a third of space can be vacant,” says Ingrid Gratzer, market researcher with Erste Group Immorent, the real estate financing and development arm of Austria’s Erste Bank.She points to the Pipera and Baneasa sub-markets, which had frenzied building activity earlier, but where today leasing is limited due to a lack of infrastructure. “The vacancy rates in these areas are the highest in Bucharest, at 35 per cent,” Ms Gratzer says.The sector is also complicated by the difference in the quality of the office space available. The Bucharest office of CBRE, the property consultancy, completely reassessed its classification system of the office market last year using a strict, 10-criteria evaluation method, which downgraded some 200,000 sq m of former class A – effectively modern – office space into lower categories. Accordingly, CBRE rates only 800,000 sq m as class A from the total 2.13m sq m of stock, with the remainder 1.33m sq m ranked as class B, and as the market recovers, it is the superior space that has seen the greatest demand.“There is substantial difference between the performance of class A [properties], which have an overall vacancy rate of 10.7 per cent, while for class B the rate exceeds 18 per cent,” says Razvan Iorgu, managing director CBRE Romania.The wide range of properties on offer means headline rents for class A stock vary from €18-€15 per sq m in the central business district to single-digit rents for class B space in less favoured sub-markets.However, despite the upturn, it is still a tenant’s market, says Mr Iorgu.“We estimate that, on average, net effective rents are 92-94 per cent of the headline figure, and with special attention given to anchor tenants or properties with a high amount of vacant space, the net effective can be down to 85 per cent,” he says.The investment market is also slowly picking up. JLL estimates investment last year at €330m – 20 per cent up on 2012 – with retail as the main focus of activity, accounting for 64 per cent of volume.“Office was only about 19 per cent of the total, with one building transacted with an initial yield of 8.7 per cent. Office is driven by a lack of suitable supply,” says JLL’s Mr Klomp.But, with economic growth hitting 3.5 per cent last year (boosted by a 5.2 per cent jump in the final quarter), the mood is becoming more positive.Banks, which had been acting very cautiously with regard to credit since 2009, have also become more open in the past year, says Mr Iorgu, with finance now available for the right projects, if well prepared.However, Romania still lacks adequate road and rail infrastructure if it is to fulfil its economic potential, says Mr Klomp. The government should do more, he adds: “They should provide a more stable political environment, including better, co-ordinated support for companies considering investments in Romania.”
163;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-04-04T16:39:01Z;Apple’s ‘holy war’ was a feud that made the Valley fertile;Rivalry may stem from vanity but it is often extremely effective. Jobs was a master;"A year before he died in 2011, Steve Jobs wrote a blunt description of Apple’s agenda. “ Holy war with Google” was the first point in his presentation to the company’s top 100 executives.Like other Silicon Valley founders such as Larry Ellison of Oracle, Jobs relished a feud. When his anger was provoked by an old rival such as Bill Gates of Microsoft, or a company he deemed to be getting in Apple’s way unfairly, such as Adobe, he let loose. Some competition was more than a business matter – it was personal.Mr Ellison often quotes a dictum he ascribes to Genghis Khan, the 13th-century Mongol emperor and warlord: “It is not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail.” His fights with rivals such as SAP, the German software company, are driven as much by pride as by corporate interest. “I’ll admit to it. Mea culpa. An awful lot of it is personal vanity,” he once told the television interviewer Charlie Rose.At least one of Jobs’s fights endures after his death. His email emerged this week in a prolonged court battle between Apple and Samsung over whether the latter had infringed Apple’s patent rights in its use of Android software. For Jobs, Google’s promotion of Android to compete with his iOS software was an infuriating betrayal.Rivalry may stem from vanity in the boardroom but it is often extremely effective – as Apple and Oracle show. The urge to beat the old foe has spurred on competitors such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Adidas and Puma, and Ford and General Motors, over decades. Like a sports derby between two teams from one city, it produces an emotional high. “Rivalries can be very productive because they push companies to raise their game and consumers benefit. They often promote innovation,” says Julian Birkinshaw of London Business School. “Jobs was the master of hyperbole and was good at stoking emotional excitement among employees.”A famous example of corporate rivalry is between the Italian sports car makers Ferrari and Lamborghini. Ferrucio Lamborghini was a tractor maker who complained to Enzo Ferrari about the clutch on his car. Ferrari is said to have responded that if he could do better, he should try – which Lamborghini then did.The fact that face-to-face competition boosts performance is well known in sport. A study in the American Journal of Psychology in 1898 found that cyclists went faster when racing against each other than when they tried to beat the clock alone. The author attributed it to “the power and lasting effect of the competitive stimulus”.Gavin Kilduff, a professor at the Stern School of Business in New York who studies corporate rivalry, has found that it flourishes in similar conditions to sporting contests – when companies are close to each other geographically, are well-matched, and compete repeatedly. Like sports teams, they form a relationship.Silicon Valley companies meet these conditions, which may account for the proliferation of spectacular rivalries. They also tend to be founded and run by entrepreneurs such as Jobs or Mr Ellison, who do not divide the personal from the corporate.Rivalries can also have a dark side. In one study, Prof Kilduff found that contests between rivals in Serie A, the Italian football league, produced more foul play, as measured by the number of red and yellow cards. Players became less law-abiding in the face of an old enemy.In another experiment, Prof Kilduff and others “primed” people for rivalry by asking them to imagine an old competitor. It made them likely to agree with statements that were “synonymous with amoral action, sharp dealing, hidden agendas and unethical excess.”Prof Kilduff argues that we have a fundamental need to compare ourselves with others who we see as similar. “It may lead to a preoccupation that goes beyond what is strictly rational,” he says. “It can promote scandalous and unethical behaviour, the kind of thing that blows up.”One of the most notorious cases of rivalry blowing up was the “dirty tricks” campaign waged by British Airways against its rival Virgin Atlantic.In a 1993 libel case, BA executives admitted to stealing Virgin’s confidential data, calling its customers to tell them their flights had been cancelled and circulating rumours about the health of Richard Branson, Virgin’s boss.That kind of behaviour can be disastrous but even at a more mundane level, rivalry may lead executives astray. A company that is relentlessly focused on an old rival may compete with it very efficiently but ignore the fact that a new one is sneaking up. It can become blinkered to the true threat by its obsession with the past.Indeed, the astute boss switches rivals when necessary, forgetting about the competitor that used to obsess him and turning his ire on another. Jobs was a master of this. “Apple was almost founded against the evil enemy being IBM, then it migrated to Microsoft and then it became Google,” says Prof Birkinshaw.The point of his “holy war” presentation was to identify a new enemy for Apple’s elite – one of its former friends. Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive, sat on Apple’s board until 2009, when Google’s adoption of Android turned it into a competitor. Jobs promptly turned this betrayal, as he saw it, into a grudge match.Behind the lurid language and the emotional outbursts lay an entirely rational calculation. His company was likely to perform best if it had an enemy to fight. Its senior executives would work harder, its engineers and designers would be more inventive. The trick was not to be too fussy about who that enemy was.john.gapper@ft.com

164;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-03-28T19:03:44Z;Rothschild’s lesson in how not to tweet a business dispute;The stakes are usually too high to make it worth indulging in rancour, writes Jonathan Ford;It is not uncommon for business relationships to dissolve in acrimony. Most do so discreetly. Very few end up in a public slanging-match on Twitter with each side openly berating the other.But Nat Rothschild has never allowed himself to be boxed in by convention. So this week the British banking heir shared with his 400 followers on the social media website his distinctly low opinion of Aga Bakrie, the Indonesian businessman.The occasion was the restructuring of Bumi, a London-listed investment vehicle created by Mr Rothschild. Floated in 2010 this had subsequently merged with the Bakrie family’s Indonesian mining business.It was from the start an unhappy cohabitation, being marked by accusations from Mr Rothschild about poor governance and financial irregularities. And last week it broke up, with the Bakries buying back their coal mines in return for cancelling their shares.Having lost money on the venture and experienced the humiliation of being slung from the board for his pains, Mr Rothschild was in no mood to let bygones be bygones.“Thanks for buying back a worthless pile of turd,” he commented tartly, before launching into a string of personal insults. Mr Bakrie’s father, the politically powerful clan patriarch, was an “evil genius”. As for the son, whom Mr Rothschild seemed to imply he was addressing because Aga was the only one of the Bakries he could find on Twitter, the “word on the street” was that he was “extremely DUMB”.Now, Mr Rothschild is not exactly the shy and retiring type when it comes to taking people on in public. The last target of his public ire was George Osborne, now UK chancellor, whom he upbraided in 2008 for embarrassing his pals Lord Mandelson and the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, by revealing the extent of their acquaintance. Indeed, such is his lust for combat of this sort that one could forgive his public relations aides were they periodically incapacitated with ulcers.But behind the invective, Mr Rothschild was striving to make a point. He believes passionately that the Bakries manipulated the situation at Bumi to their own advantage. “No family has done more to blacken Indonesia’s investment climate than yours,” he tweeted at Mr Bakrie.True, he may no longer be able to recover some of his losses directly from the Bakries now that they have disengaged from Bumi and retreated to their Indonesian fastness. But one must presume he hopes that such accusations may hit home, raising the family’s cost of capital and hurting their business interests.Whether Mr Rothschild is wise to pursue an all-out vendetta is another matter. Mr Bakrie seemed unfazed, tweeting laconically at his antagonist: ‘“Dumb’ I believe that is the word that has been associated most with you by most of the people I have met.”Many might agree with the Bakrie scion that Mr Rothschild does himself little good picking at such wounds. Casting aspersions about the bona fides of former business partners is a dangerous game.As Meg Whitman, Hewlett-Packard’s chief executive, has found, such rows can end up defiling both sides. Her public battle with Mike Lynch, Autonomy’s founder, over who is to blame for the huge losses the US company took on its British software purchase is both an embarrassment and a distraction. Mr Rothschild, who once described the Bakries as a “huge positive” for Bumi investors, should take note.Bumi’s original purpose, for which he raised £707m from shareholders, was after all to create value by applying western governance standards to mineral extraction companies located in some of the wilder emerging markets.Mr Rothschild was rewarded richly for bringing the Bakries to his investors. His own losses, while painful, are far smaller than those suffered by others. If he picked a wildly unsuitable partner, as he is now keen to advertise, then some of the blame must attach also to him.Such considerations explain why most business people avoid open warfare. The stakes are too high to make it worth indulging in rancour and recrimination. When problems arise, the objective must be to preserve value, not to squabble over the fixing of the blame.Open rows do occasionally happen, of course. But these tend to have a stylised quality, such as the to-and-fro of insults that tend to accompany takeover bids.Feuding can also be a form of self-promotion. Certain businessmen see it as part of their company’s business model to twist their competitors’ tails. Michael O’Leary, the loud-mouthed boss of Ryanair, has built an identity for the low-cost airline by mounting public attacks on its rivals. Oracle’s Larry Ellison is known for his jibes against rivals such as Microsoft and SAP.But public fights where real blood flows are somewhat rarer. There was of course the famous “dirty tricks” battle between Richard Branson and British Airways in the 1990s. Mavericks such as the British entrepreneur Tiny Rowland kept vicious disputes going for years.But Mr Rothschild is not another Mr Ellison or Rowland. He is neither playing games nor promoting himself. His is the pique of a man thwarted who is used to getting his own way. In a way it is magnificent, but it will not get investors their money back. And ultimately it is not how business is done.jonathan.ford@ft.com
165;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-03-19T16:25:33Z;Investors lose faith in Oracle after profits miss expectations;;Oracle, Larry Ellison’s business software maker, was shunned after its profits fell short of Wall Street forecasts.Revenues for the quarter to the end of February came in at $9.31bn, shy of investors’ expectations of $9.36bn, as it faced increased competition from companies selling software online. Oracle shares fell 0.75 per cent to close at $38.55.However, analysts at Citigroup said that, beneath the disappointing headline were signs of progress. Oracle’s database software “continued to grow ahead of most large-cap tech franchises, heading into the strongest part of the product cycle”, they said.In contrast, US chemicals maker Dow Chemical, which has been under pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb, was in demand. Chief executive Andrew Liveris raised the total value of the businesses it is seeking to sell to a range of $4.5bn to $6bn, up from $3bn-$4bn earlier. Dow shares eventually gave up earlier gains to close at $49.61.Oracle and Dow stood out on a listless day for US stocks, with the S&P 500 little changed at 1,860.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also struggled for direction, drifting to end 0.70 per cent lower at 16,222.17. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.59 per cent, to end at 4,307.60.First Solar, the largest US manufacturer of solar panels, recorded the biggest rise on the S&P 500. Its shares, which have been volatile during the past 12 months, surged 20.57 per cent to $69.40 after it struck a bullish tone on future profits. At an investor day, First Solar told investors it would earn between $4.50 and $6.00 a share in 2015, up from a projected $2.20-$2.60 this year.US aerospace company Boeing found itself in favour as it secured an $830m order for 737s from Comair, a South African low-cost airline. Boeing shares, which were the best performers on the Dow in 2013, climbed 1.45 per cent to end at $122.24Hedge fund group Och-Ziff was under pressure after disclosing that its financial results could take a hit from a Department of Justice investigation into alleged corruption in Libya. Och-Ziff had disclosed late on Tuesday that the DoJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission were scrutinising its relationship with the Libyan Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund. Its shares, which have gained 40 per cent in the past 12 months, fell 3.45 per cent to $13.71.Although Facebook is the third-best performer on the S&P 500 over the past 12 months, the shares of Renren, the owner of a Chinese social network, were out of favour on Wednesday. Its US-listed shares tumbled 9.81 per cent to end at $3.40 after a revenue forecast for the current quarter fell short of forecasts. Renren said it would generate between $23m and $25m this quarter, shy of the $30.1m analysts had forecast.Shares of FedEx, one of the world’s largest delivery companies, weakened after it cut its full-year earnings forecast. The Atlanta-based group pinned the blame on the weather, which it said has had a “significantly more pronounced” impact than in previous years.Despite the warning, FedEx reported a jump in quarterly profits thanks, in part, to a cost-cutting programme.Shares in General Mills, which also blamed the frigid US winter for weak quarterly earnings, escaped punishment. The company, which makes Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice cream, stuck to its full-year profit forecast. The shares rose 0.6 per cent to $50.74.
166;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-03-19T01:08:05Z;Oracle shares drop as earnings disappoint;;Oracle on Tuesday displayed further signs of the sluggish growth that has disappointed investors in recent quarters, reversing its recent share price rally in after market trading.As the company reported revenues and earnings that fell short of expectations, chief executive Larry Ellison and other executives sought to shift Wall Street’s attention to newer parts of the company that are seeing stronger growth.Oracle’s stock has suffered for several quarters from concerns that it is losing out to a new generation of database and business applications software companies whose businesses are based on the cloud, rather than technology customers run on their own premises.In an analyst call, Mr Ellison said the US business software company was still in the process of hiring specialist sales teams for the new cloud-based services that have the best growth potential.“We have a new set of competitors, and we need a specialist sales team that’s used to competing with Amazon,” he said. “We’re lining up against all our new competitors and making sure we have sales capacity as well as a new set of products.”Among its newer products, Oracle said that sales of its own cloud applications software were up 25 per cent in the quarter, reaching $300m, while bookings grew by 60 per cent. It also reported a 30 per cent increase in sales of “engineered systems”, or hardware sold with its software pre-installed, which helped its overall hardware revenue record an 8 per cent advance, to $725m.The return to growth in hardware marks an end to the long period of contraction following Oracle’s acquisition of Sun Microsystem, which reflected a cutback in low-margin, standardised systems. With engineered systems now accounting for more than 30 per cent of hardware sales, Mr Ellison called the recovery “absolutely sustainable”.Oracle reported overall revenues of $9.3bn for its latest quarter, a rise of 4 per cent from the previous year, while earnings per share inched up by 3 cents, to 68 cents. However, the figures fell short of Wall Street’s hopes, with analysts forecasting revenues of $9.36bn and earnings of 70 cents a share.Together, revenues from new software licences and subscriptions from cloud services rose 4 per cent in the quarter, the third in Oracle’s fiscal year, to reach $2.4bn. The result in this closely watched indicator of the company’s business was below Wall Street expectations.The shares initially fell 6 per cent on news of its earnings on Tuesday, though the loss was later pared back to 3.5 per cent.
167;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-03-18T22:56:10Z;Oracle: false profits;Mediocre figures suggest malaise won’t fully lift anytime soon;Larry Ellison is a champion boater having just led Team USA to a stirring comeback in the America’s Cup. He also happens to have his very own Hawaiian island. And yet he still continues to charge ahead as boss of Oracle. Judging by Oracle’s third-quarter results he may be considering spending more time on those alternative pursuits.Once again, the lumbering database software pioneer disappointed on sales growth – software licenses grew just 5 per cent and contributed to an earnings miss of 2 cents. Shares fell 4 per cent in late trading. The absolute figures are hardly dreadful – Oracle is still large and profitable in ways the hotshot upstarts that are challenging it can still only dream. But the mediocre results suggest the malaise engulfing Oracle won’t fully lift anytime soon.Oracle would argue that its results appear weaker than they should. If currency impact from Venezuela and elsewhere around the world were excluded, earnings would have been in-line with expectations. More importantly, its cloud software sales were up 25 per cent showing that it is competing with more nimble start-ups. Also, Oracle’s beleaguered hardware unit that stems from the Sun Microsystems deal showed revenue growth of 7 per cent.Even with the repeated disappointments of the last year, Oracle shares are still up 5 per cent in that time. It hasn’t kept up with Nasdaq, which is up 30 per cent, but it is ahead of IBM and Cisco whose shares both trade below their levels from last March.The bull case for Oracle is that it finally has momentum in the cloud and that it will benefit from easier comparisons in coming quarters. At 12 times forward earnings Oracle is about where it was valued a year ago. It is neither cheap nor pricey and so current shareholders could do worse than to continue on. As will undoubtedly Mr Ellison.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
168;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-03-10T21:29:04Z;Adapting consumer apps for business use;;Since Apple opened the first online app store in 2008 – a year after the launch of the iPhone – consumer apps running on smartphones and tablets have become part of the IT infrastructure that people rely upon every day.More recently however, consumer apps and cloud-based services have found their way into companies often riding on the back of the BYOD (bring your own device) trend. Typically these consumer apps are easier to use and more intuitive that their corporate counterparts, but they can also pose security and other challenges.I asked Rob May, chief executive of Backupify, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company that specialises in providing corporate back-up services for software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, about what he calls the ‘enterprisation’ of consumer apps. Here is an edited version of the conversation.What is the ‘enterprisation of consumer apps?’Employees are bringing their own devices to work, and for a while now we have been focused on how to break down the walls of the enterprise to allow for consumer-friendly applications.Many have referred to this movement as the “consumerisation of IT,” and it includes everything from corporate time sheets accessible via a personal smartphone, to major changes in IT infrastructure such as migrating from traditional, installed software to consumer-friendly SaaS applications like Google Apps.What we are seeing now is a paradigm shift as more consumer and cloud-based SaaS applications have made their way into the enterprise. With employees starting to manage their own IT (downloading free applications and using their personal email for work activities), chief information officers and other IT administrators are increasingly looking to take back the reins, turning their attention to making sure these applications are enterprise-grade when it comes to security and data protection.Consumer applications were not created with enterprise needs in mind. They are not secure (for the enterprise), difficult to manage, and often quite the headache when it comes to migration.Can you provide some examples?Consider a company that decides they want to implement Google Apps across the board for all employees. While the solution is cost effective and helps to support collaboration between employees, there is a lack of data protection.Documents in Google Apps are not automatically backed up and if a rogue employee decides to delete files, a third party add-on application erases some key data, or a new intern unknowingly alters an important document, there is no way of getting those original files back.Another example is Dropbox. Think of all the companies whose employees are using Dropbox for file sharing. While Dropbox is incredibly easy to use and cheap when compared to on-premise servers, its format can lead to data being stored in silos.Instead of being accessible across the organisation, individual employee documents begin to be split up, making it difficult for IT managers to locate information after that employee leaves the company. This pushes enterprises to evaluate what security and processes need to be applied. The result is the ‘enterprisation of consumer apps.’What is driving the trend?When employees started bringing in their own devices to work (the whole BYOD movement), those devices had personal applications downloaded on them. With more and more employees applying consumer apps for their business needs, we started to see a growing wave of acceptance from the enterprise.Companies that decided to embrace the BYOD trend were forced to figure out how to ensure security throughout the organisation while still allowing employees to work on the applications they were most comfortable with. The huge explosion in cloud services also is a driver.The enterprise today is turning to cloud to answer many of their data storage and even data processing needs. From accounting to sales, IT buyers are more apt to consider cloud options because of an increased perception of security and huge cost savings potential.How does this fit in with cloud?A recent Forrester report stated that the average number of different SaaS applications that companies expect they will use in 2014 is 66. It is no surprise that cloud is becoming increasingly present in the enterprise as it offers cost benefits while improving efficiencies.We are still operating, however, in an enterprise cloud ecosystem that is siloed. Accounting information stays in QuickBooks, sales data stays in Salesforce and hundreds of documents across departments reside in Dropbox, Google Apps and the like.In the next five years, we will start to see these separate entities merging. Enterprises are realising that letting data live in several different cloud services (many of them consumer-focused) puts their ownership of that information at risk, and in someone else’s control.As cloud continues to expand as the means of data storage and processing, the enterprise will move toward a single pane of glass model – where one application allows them to access and manage the data from multiple SaaS applications.The result will be the emergence of a whole new crop of applications designed to facilitate this single platform. Not only will this platform link to various APIs (application programming interfaces,) but it will also support various storage engines, allowing an even more cohesive cloud ecosystem.Are there security implications for companies?Security continues to be a huge focus for companies that are working on integrated consumer applications. Often consumer applications are not up to par with enterprise security standards and as a result, many cloud apps must come with their own set of customised data protection and back-up processes.SaaS applications that might fall into the “enterprise-grade” including Salesfoce and QuickBooks still come with challenges. Chief information officers need to figure out how to continue to own corporate information across platforms – including personal smartphones, tablets and laptops – and ensure those cloud services have the same security as on-premise solutions.How should these concerns be addressed?Fortunately, several solutions exist that allow IT managers to apply enterprise grade security and protection to SaaS applications. Our company, Backupify, offers cloud-to-cloud back-up for these kinds of applications to ensure organisations have a second, independent copy of all their information in the cloud.There are also other vendors out there, like CloudLock, CipherCloud, and Perspecsys that help to secure cloud data. The key for chief information officers and other IT managers when addressing this new challenge of cloud applications and the blend of consumer and enterprise-grade apps, is to ensure they have complete ownership of their data and can manage it all in one place. This single viewing pane is not only helpful when it comes to data analysis: it also helps solve migration issues.What challenges do enterprises today face in the cloud? Is it still considered a risk?The ironic thing about cloud today is that it’s actually in many ways safer than on-premise solutions. In order to get an enterprise application off the ground and adopted in the enterprise, solution-providers must ensure they meet regulated standards and understand every detail of their cloud vendor’s security. The challenge, however, is that more often than not, the cloud service provider controls the data within their applications.Most of the time, this is not a problem. These applications often work flawlessly and always have the information enterprises need, when they need it. Until that one time when they don’t.What many enterprises are learning, and sometimes the hard way, is that most SaaS applications do not have options to back up and protect their data. If a rogue employee decides to delete files before they take off on their last day, or an unknowing intern corrupts a file while trying to get through their to-do list, often the business is left empty-handed, with no copy of that information on file.This is one of the most frustrating and potentially damaging issues with the cloud and as more and more enterprises adopt SaaS applications, it will be one that each will have to overcome to ensure they are successful.As a result of the explosion in cloud computing, some market leaders are emerging. What companies do you think have the best outlook?Box is probably the cloud company I would bet on. Launched in 2005 and now eyeing an IPO, the company embodies the cloud movement. I see Box completely overtaking Oracle over the next 20 years and continuing to eat up a sizeable piece of the enterprise market.Box understands the future of the enterprise will be in the cloud, and has built a company around that idea. Companies like Oracle are instead chasing the trend, trying to force square pegs into round holes and coming up short.Google is another powerhouse that will continue to do well in the cloud market. Enterprises, universities and even entire countries are adopting the Google App platform, and as the most innovative company in the world, there is no doubt in my mind they will succeed in becoming a major player in the cloud ecosystem of tomorrow. They are already much more successful than most people realise, because their enterprise business success is overlooked because of their search business.
169;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-03-06T12:00:41Z;Spare a thought for Silicon Valley’s rust belt;More cost-cutting to come at suppliers of corporate technology;Shrinking revenues. Stagnant share prices in the midst of a stock market boom. Doubts that some will ever see significant growth again.Spare a thought for Silicon Valley’s rust belt. While younger companies riding the social media, cloud and mobile waves are all the rage on Wall Street, large parts of the tech industry are in a funk.Think of these as the metal-bashers of the internet boom. As tech moves on, they risk being stranded with out-of-date products and bloated workforces (often made up of older, pensionable employees).Companies missing out on the stock market party include some of the biggest suppliers of corporate technology, including IBM, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle. Microsoft and Intel have also been left behind by the rise of mobile.Surging growth in emerging countries bailed out their ageing product lines for a while, but even that support has now gone. Taken as a whole, the revenues of these six tech giants actually went into reverse in their latest financial years, falling 1.5 per cent. A lacklustre recovery is projected to turn that back to growth of only 2.5 per cent by 2015.This represents a significant change in their prospects. In the four years to 2010, their combined revenues grew 30 per cent despite a blow to demand from the 2008 financial crisis. The following four years, by contrast, are expected to show growth of only 9 per cent.Most have at least managed to maintain a good earnings record, thanks to cost-cutting and share buybacks. As the Financial Times reported last year, some creative accounting to hide supposedly “one off” costs has also helped to lift profits.IBM has become the acknowledged master of squeezing blood from a stone. Wall Street is expecting its 2015 revenues to be a little more than $100bn, below the level they hit in 2008. Yet earnings per share over the seven-year period are projected to show growth of 120 per cent.The earnings magic no longer captivates stock market investors, however. IBM’s shares are off 9 per cent over the past year, compared with a 22 per cent rise in the wider stock market.There are two ways to view this. One is cyclical: investors are hooked on growth. They may be willing to pay extravagant premiums for that now, but come the downturn, the defensive nature of stocks like IBM could come back to the fore. Given the massive investments customers have made in their products, suppliers of business IT can usually count on service and support contracts that last for years.The other view is structural. The shift of computing to the cloud is as significant as the client-server revolution that accompanied the rise of the PC. It poses a particular threat to companies that sell hardware or handle large corporate IT integration projects. On-premise IT installations are going out of fashion.For the established IT players, dragging their heels as they followed customers to the cloud seemed to make perfect sense. They could prolong the returns from older products and still be in place for the bulk of the cloud business when the time came.However, this approach could be painful. The point of moving to the cloud, after all, is to slash the unit costs of computing. It is a highly deflationary exercise to simply take a customer’s existing applications and workloads and move them across.Making the most of this transition requires inventing new applications and mastering new business models that were not possible before. Simply trying to play catch-up against Amazon, with its significant scale advantages and tolerance for low profit margins, is not a comfortable place to start.Some of the mature IT players are better positioned than others for this transition. Oracle’s shares have rebounded as Wall Street has grown more confident that it can repurpose its traditional software business – or at least buy up promising growth companies, as it has before.Others also seem to have acquired a new sense of urgency. IBM recently set its sights on selling computing capacity in its data centres direct to customers, in a direct attack on Amazon. Earlier this year, it came up with ambitious plans to turn its advanced Watson question-and-answer computer into a cloud service that can tie in with other companies’ applications.Yet for a company with annual sales of $100bn, it will be hard to move the needle on revenues. New businesses like this take time to develop: a large and hungry sales force requires feeding now.That suggests there is much more cost-cutting to come before the IT rust belt companies can hope for a return to meaningful growth.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Editor
170;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-02-26T18:54:10Z;AB InBev: another round?;The brewer struggles to expand faster than world growth;"Name the company: $40bn or so in sales. Dominant in its core markets, its products have been the industry standard for decades. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are at a staggering 40 per cent of sales. Return on equity about 25 per cent. More free cash flow than earnings. Much of the free cash goes to acquisitions.Shame about the growth, though. Of late, organic growth has come from price increases and fiddling with the product mix. The company is so dominant that it struggles to expand faster than the global economy. And one worries that customers are looking for cheaper alternatives.In truth, this is not one company, but two: Oracle, which sells business software, and AB InBev, which sells beer. The gag is not that companies in very different industries can have broadly similar financial profiles; it is that such similar financial profiles come at very different prices. Oracle is yours for 13 times next year’s earnings. It’s 19 times for AB InBev. The argument can go a step further. In the long term, acquisitions are central to the growth prospects of both. But Oracle’s pipeline of targets stretches to the horizon. In software, the new products that young companies develop regularly expand the addressable market (think of, say, conferencing software). But it is conceivable that for AB InBev, big acquisitions will become increasingly hard. Beer-market growth is – roughly – a function of population growth and the increase in disposable wealth per capita. Indeed, the list of target companies big enough to be material for InBev is already pretty short.So buy Oracle, short AB InBev? The case against this pair is simple. As Bernstein has pointed out, Mexico and Brazil, two of AB InBev’s three key markets (the other is the US) have been growing below their 10-year trend in the past year or two. If you think these markets will return to trend, organic growth will return and AB InBev is worth the price. If you believe the growth of the 2000s was the aberration, put down that beer.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
171;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-02-06T17:16:40Z;Snowden leaks derail Oracle’s Hollywood dreams;;The fallout from Edward Snowden’s revelations about the National Security Agency has reached Hollywood after Oracle asked for its brand to be scrubbed from a film about spies and espionage.Oracle, the database software group, had originally paid to have its brand featured in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, which stars Chris Pine and Keira Knightley – one of the many product placement deals that have become lucrative for Hollywood studios.But after Mr Snowden leaked details last year about the NSA’s mass surveillance of electronic data – including its ability to monitor Silicon Valley technology companies – Oracle got cold feet, said several people close to the situation.The request for its brand to be erased was made in the final stages of the film’s editing. Oracle declined to comment on why it asked to be taken out of the film, which was released in the US last month.Skydance Productions and Paramount Pictures, which produced the film, also declined to comment.Oracle has a family connection to Hollywood. Skydance, which co-produced Jack Ryan, is run by David Ellison, the 31-year-old son of Larry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire founder.Oracle was not charged for the re-edit but it did not get back its original fee, which ran to several hundred thousand dollars, said people familiar with the matter.The cost of placing products or brands in films or television programmes can range from thousands to millions of dollars, depending on their prominence. Product placement revenue has become an important means for filmmakers to offset production costs.The market has boomed as brands seek new ways to reach consumers and viewers that watch far fewer television commercials. The most recent figures available show that global product placement spending in film and television rose almost 12 per cent in 2012 to $8.25bn, according to PQ Media, a research firm.July 2013: With Edward Snowden still in Moscow waiting to see if he can one day get asylum in a Latin American state, FT editor Lionel Barber talks to diplomatic editor James Blitz about how the concerns over surveillance have damaged the US/Europe relationshipOracle’s withdrawal from the Jack Ryan movie bucks a Hollywood trend, in which tech companies have been among the most visible brands in movies in recent years. Google’s Mountain View headquarters was the setting for the critically panned comedy The Internship while James Bond’s recent cinematic outings have featured Sony Vaio laptops and Sony phones – a consequence of Sony Pictures co-producing the Bond films.Backed by money from his father, the younger Mr Ellison has co-produced several movies alongside Viacom’s Paramount studio, including World War Z, Star Trek: Into Darkness and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.David Ellison’s sister, Megan, has also made a splash in Hollywood with her own company, Annapurna Pictures. Like her brother, she is also backed by Larry Ellison but has focused on edgier, independent movies, producing critically acclaimed hits such as The Master, Zero Dark Thirty, Her and American Hustle.Her and American Hustle were both nominated for the best picture Oscar in next month’s Academy Awards.
172;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2014-01-21T19:03:28Z;Mounting cash piles an embarrassment of riches for tech companies;;A growing number of big US technology companies are heeding the call from Wall Street to hand more of their excess cash back to shareholders. But that does not look likely to stop a huge build-up of liquid reserves that has already left the sector with a cash mountain of historic proportions.By the middle of last year, the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few tech winners had left just six companies – Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Oracle and Qualcomm – with more than a quarter of the $1.5tn held by US non-financial corporations, according to rating agency Moody’s.With nearly $150bn in its coffers, Apple alone was sitting on close to 10 per cent of corporate America’s cash.Behind this build-up lies a boom in profits in an industry that often displays winner-takes-all characteristics and where capital needs are usually low. Apple’s spending on plant, equipment and acquisitions has used up just 10-15 per cent of its operating cash flow in recent years. Even Google, at the peak of a spending surge three years ago that unnerved Wall Street, was investing little more than a third of its cash flow on building out its network.Alongside the strong cash generation has been a habit of hoarding, caused partly by an innate conservatism in a sector where fortunes can reverse quickly. Steve Jobs, who had his own brush with bankruptcy, paid out nothing at all in dividends and buybacks, even though Apple generated $55bn in free cash flow in his final three years at the helm.But as the cash mountains have grown, a second factor has assumed even greater significance. Due largely to tax avoidance strategies that have made it possible to book profits in low-tax countries, much of the tech cash is held offshore. Rather than return it to the US to pay dividends or fund buybacks and incurring an extra tax charge, most tech companies have preferred to wait – and lobby in Washington – for a tax holiday.Some, such as Cisco, have purposely set out on a series of foreign acquisitions to use the cash in a tax-efficient way, though the scarcity of potential targets has limited its effectiveness.This has left the tech companies looking increasingly constrained. Apple paid out $33bn to shareholders last year – and had the proportion of its cash sitting offshore jumped 8 percentage points, to 76 per cent. Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm have also had big increases: some 94 per cent of Microsoft’s $81bn is now outside the US.Of non-financial companies in the S&P Global 1200 index, just 8.4 per cent hold 50 per cent of the cashExplore graphic“Given many are cash rich, the attraction of cash proceeds from a sale of an asset is less attractive than a few years ago, as attractive alternative use of proceeds is increasingly an issue for the recipient,” says Mervyn Metcalf, of boutique investment bank Dean Street Advisors.The embarrassment of riches has become a contentious issue on Wall Street. Applying a normal earnings multiple to the after-tax returns on cash produces much less in stock market value than the face value of the cash holdings, says Stuart Francis, head of technology banking at Barclays. As a result, he adds: “Excess cash can be a boat anchor on valuation.”Even Apple has not been immune from the growing pressure, though activist Carl Icahn has reduced his call for the amount of cash to be returned to shareholders by two-thirds, to $50bn.Even without direct pressure, more tech concerns have started to show a greater readiness to earmark their future profits for dividends or buybacks. In November, Qualcomm pledged that it would return three-quarters of its free cash flow to shareholders. Fellow chipmaker Texas Instruments went one better, saying earlier in the year that it hoped to distribute all of its free cash flow.Caught between Wall Street pressure to distribute more of their money and the realities of the tax code, some have turned to borrowing to fund their cash needs. Last month, Microsoft led the way, adding to its existing $14bn of debt as it turned to the capital markets to borrow $8bn more.With activist shareholders increasing their pressure on the most vulnerable, low-growth tech companies, there is likely to be considerably more debt coming, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody’s.One result is likely to be a weakening of balance sheets across the industry. Chip company Altera was among the first to confront this, announcing last year that it would issue $1bn of debt – and promptly had two notches taken off its credit rating.Yet for the biggest tech companies, there is still plenty of room for manoeuvre. Apple could raise another $20bn-$50bn in debt before its ratings come under pressure, according to Moody’s. That makes it likely that 2014 will be a year when both cash and debt levels soar in the tech world.
173;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;SAP: softly, softly;Disappointing fourth-quarter earnings add to questions over valuation;"Why would anyone buy SAP at the current €61? The German software company’s earnings, out on Friday, were a bit of a let down; sales of its new Hana database software were light. The numbers add only a little force to the question, though. The issue is the valuation.If one wants to own a big, slow-growing, highly profitable business software company, one is available for about 12 times earnings. It is called Oracle. For SAP, one must stump up 16 times. That is a significant difference.Two companies in the same industry, with similar growth rates and returns on capital should trade at similar multiples. SAP has had a revenue growth edge in recent years, but that has been eroded; both companies now grow in the low single-digits.Capital return policies differ. Both are aggressive acquirers, but Oracle, in the past year or two, has been returning much more cash to shareholders, through buybacks.This leaves strategic issues, and for old-fashioned sellers of software licences, that means software as a service. Here, more similarity: both companies are growing their cloud offering quickly, but they remain small relative to their licence businesses. Cloud sales account for about 4 per cent of SAP’s revenues; 3 per cent for Oracle.Portfolio managers with Europe-only mandates have relatively few choices among large tech companies, other than SAP. But global fund managers would – one would think – arbitrage this difference away.A more subtle issue is the companies’ different niches. In Enterprise Resource Management, SAP has dominant market position and it is almost irretrievably entwined with customers’ operations. Arguably, this is less true in Oracle’s traditional focus, the database, where IBM is a fierce competitor. The market may be betting that SAP’s cash flows will prove more stable.Both companies may be cheap: both, certainly, have multiples that reflect modest expectations for growth. And returns on capital are high, leaving plenty of scope for returning cash. Nonetheless, SAP’s higher valuation leaves it less room for error. The market expects it to deliver more, over time, than it did this quarter.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
174;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Apple, Google and Facebook are latter-day Scrooges;Why are the most successful companies on the planet acting like misers in a Balzac novel?;All across the world companies have in recent years been hoarding cash, nowhere more so than in the US. For at least a decade and a half, cash has progressively increased its share of the American corporate balance sheet, to the point where US quoted companies have turned into the Scrooges of the global economy. According to research by Juan Sánchez and Emircan Yurdagul of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, their cash hoard had reached almost $5tn by the end of 2011.Such is the scale of this cash pile that the US corporate sector must have been partly responsible for the surge in demand for safe assets and the decline in interest rates that fuelled the US housing bubble. Yet American business has been spared the opprobrium heaped on excess savers such as China, whose official reserves top $3.5tn. There is nonetheless something fundamentally different about the US corporate cash pile compared with those of, say, China and Japan, where burgeoning corporate sector savings have increasingly fuelled global imbalances.Corporate savings consist of depreciation and retained earnings. For much of the past 20 years the Chinese government has urged state-owned companies not to distribute profits, which would help push up retentions. In the absence of developed financial markets, companies are more reliant, too, on internal financing. For its part, Japan is a mature economy in which investment opportunities are insufficient to absorb the country’s domestic savings.In contrast, corporate miserliness in the US is driven by the technology sector. I calculate that the combined cash and liquid investments of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Cisco, Oracle, Qualcomm and Facebook now top $340bn, a near-fivefold increase since the start of the millennium. What differentiates these tech companies from most of the other businesses that contributed to the American corporate cash nest egg is that they have little or no borrowings. In the case of Apple, the build-up of liquidity from $24.5bn five years ago to $129.8bn today would have done credit to the Sorcerer’s Apprentice.This extraordinary penchant for saving has been antisocial in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when the world was suffering from deficient demand. With many billions of corporate dollars pouring exclusively into money market funds and bonds, the existing fiscal and regulatory bias against equity investment in the US will be given a new twist. Such behaviour also leaves us with a paradox. Why are the most successful and innovative companies on the planet acting like misers in a Balzac novel during a dramatic technological revolution that is leading to the digitisation of virtually everything? How can there be inadequate investment opportunities to absorb all this money, much of which earns a negative real return?In fact we have been here before. In the 1930s John Maynard Keynes worried that the economy was hostage to the volatile instincts of businessmen. Money’s function as a store of value appeared problematic to him because it allowed entrepreneurs to retreat from investing when confronting uncertainty. And he railed at the capitalist system’s reliance on “the love of money” as he put it, to drive economic growth.Today it is not individual entrepreneurs who are gloating over their cash. It is more a kind of corporate narcissism. Yet fear and uncertainty have undoubtedly played a part in causing a conspicuous acceleration in saving since the financial crisis. And in a fast-moving globalised market the flexibility that cash affords in the ultra-competitive technology sector matters.The precautionary motive is not the only spur to cash consciousness. Corporate governance may be a factor. Apple, Microsoft and Google are immune from the discipline of hostile takeover. Many technology companies have a two-tier voting structure that allows founding entrepreneurs to enjoy voting control with a minority of the capital, so they are under little pressure to raise payouts – although the shareholder activist Carl Icahn hopes to squeeze more out of Apple, where he recently bought a stake.Some argue that because a majority of the cash is held outside the US, taxation is at the root of it. Certainly, tough US tax rules on bringing money home provides an explanation of why cash is not repatriated, but surely not why it goes uninvested. The world’s investment opportunities are not, after all, confined to the US.The most plausible reason for this corporate thriftiness is surely that information technology, social networks and the rest are driven by human, not financial, capital. Those such as Google or LinkedIn are the very opposite of capital-intensive and the parts of the industrial process that are capital-intensive at Apple or Microsoft are substantially outsourced. This chimes with the fact that the biggest cash hoarders are large research and development spenders.Such companies resort to the equity market chiefly to provide an exit for venture capitalists or to acquire a currency for takeovers. And they can reasonably argue that it is inappropriate for the owners of financial capital, which is especially abundant in a world of excess savings, to have all the control rights in the corporation when human capital drives growth.With recovery, the precautionary motive is set to wane, but in this brave new world America’s technology wizards will still be condemned to spew out cash that they cannot absorb in business investment. It is a novel quirk in the workings of late capitalism.john.plender@ft.com
175;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-12-23T16:56:13Z;Technology stalwarts: vintage value;Margins at IBM, Cisco and Oracle still have benefits;Lumbering technology stalwarts IBM, Cisco and Oracle cannot wait to bid 2013 farewell. The best share price gain was just 10 per cent: the worst, a 6.5 per cent fall. Dull performance reflected revenue growth below already muted investor expectations. The silver lining could be that those expectations may have finally reset to a realistic level. These companies still have formidable earnings power and generate loads of cash.The excuses were plentiful for IBM, Cisco and Oracle. We heard that marketing teams dropped the ball, corporate tech spending was weak and that emerging market growth had abruptly halted. When the dust settles, aggregate revenue for the trio in 2013 is expected to fall 2 per cent. The 2014 outlook is not much better.The simple reality is that their products are not that special any more. Software can be cheaply rented, and even be substituted for hardware. The Bessemer Cloud index, a composite of high-flying software upstarts, is up more than 40 per cent this year. The three elder statesmen have spent $25bn on deals since 2011, hoping to keep pace with the newcomers.The current forward P/E multiples for IBM, Cisco and Oracle are all between 5 and 20 per cent below their median multiples since 2011. That seems fair, but when those P/E multiples are adjusted for forward growth (the PE/G ratio) only IBM is at a discount to its average. Cisco and Oracle trade at a 10 per cent premium to their median historical PE/G ratios.Whatever correction remains to occur at Cisco and Oracle, their size, profits and cash flow should not be dismissed. Each has an operating margin above 20 per cent. They have spent $80bn on dividends and buybacks in the past three years, all feats that upstart rivals may never achieve.

176;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
177;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-12-20T18:17:48Z;Oracle to buy Responsys for $1.5bn;;Oracle has announced an agreement to pay $1.5bn in cash for marketing technology company Responsys, in its latest bid to become a more substantial force in the fast-growing cloud software business.Shares in Oracle and SAP, the leading suppliers of traditional business software applications, have underperformed this year at concerns that they are losing out to new software-as-a-service companies like Salesforce.com and Workday, leading to a round of recent acquisitions.Oracle said this week that its bookings from selling cloud services had risen 35 per cent in its latest quarter and would be one of its important sources of growth in 2014.The Responsys purchase also reflects rapid consolidation in online marketing software, as some of the biggest software companies race to add new technologies that support their customers’ social media and mobile marketing campaigns. Other deals this year have included Salesforce’s $2.5bn purchase of ExactTarget and Adobe’s $600m acquisition of French-based Neolane.Shares in Marketo, another cloud marketing firm that went public this year, jumped 9 per cent after the Oracle deal was announced on Friday, valuing the company at $1.4bn, as Wall Street anticipated more consolidation.Responsys automates marketing efforts for companies that sell direct to consumers, with most of its revenues coming from email campaigns. The field has become one of the most competitive in the field of software-as-a-service.Rob Brosnan, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Responsys could face pricing pressure in the email marketing business in future. However, he said the deal would add an important element to Oracle’s existing “capable but otherwise moribund” marketing technologies.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, has earned a reputation for avoiding high-priced deals during a decade in which he has been the software industry’s most active acquirer. By contrast, the $27-a-share in cash he has agreed to pay for Responsys represents a relatively large premium of 38 per cent to the company’s closing share price the day before.That is roughly double the premium that Oracle paid in its other big cloud software purchases, such as the $1.5bn acquisition of RightNow, a call-centre automation company bought in 2011, and the $1.9bn purchase of human resources company Taleo in 2012.Shares in Responsys had already more than tripled this year before news of the Oracle deal broke, echoing a broader rally that has turned software-as-a-service companies into some of the most highly valued tech companies on Wall Street. The deal valued Responsys at seven and a half times its expected revenues this year, below the 10-12 times revenue at which many SaaS companies are trading.
178;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-12-18T23:29:50Z;Oracle ends bad run as hardware losses pared;;Oracle ended a run of disappointing quarterly earnings reports on Wednesday, as the US database and applications software group said that its revenues and earnings had topped modest Wall Street expectations for its latest quarter.The latest figures were helped by a reduction in losses from hardware sales, which have been a drag on results since the acquisition of Sun Microsystems nearly four years ago.Mark Hurd, co-president, said that hardware sales had slipped 3 per cent but that the business was on track in the current quarter to record its first period of growth since the acquisition, as Oracle shifts its focus to more profitable engineered systems that involve selling machines already integrated with the company’s software.Compared with downbeat comments after recent earnings reports, Oracle’s executives struck a far more positive tone about a revival of its growth and profit margin prospects in the quarters ahead.Larry Ellison, chief executive, said that the company’s 12c database, the next version of its flagship product, had produced “more interest than any database in recent memory”, pointing to healthy demand next year and in 2015.The Oracle boss also predicted continuing improvements in operating profit margins as the company benefited from a rising share of more profitable hardware systems, as well as a growing dependence in its software division on higher-margin licence renewals.He said that cloud-based applications– a market in which Oracle has been playing catch-up– also looked set to deliver higher margins than traditional software sales.Recent earnings reports from the company had been overshadowed by weak economic conditions in some of its main markets, as well as uneven performance as it pushed through an overhaul of parts of its sales force.The weakness has raised fears that Oracle is losing out to a new generation of fast-growing start-ups that are better positioned for the new cloud computing markets.For the most recent quarter, to the end of November, Oracle reported revenues of $9.3bn, an increase of 2 per cent, compared with the $9.2bn analysts had expected. Pro-forma earnings per share of 69 cents were at the top end of the company’s forecast of 64-69 cents and more than the 67 cents projected by Wall Street. Based on formal accounting rules, net income fell 1 per cent to $2.55bn, or 56 cents a share.Despite a stronger performance in the US and Europe, the quarter was still weighed down by weakness in Asia, where software sales dropped by 10 per cent in constant currencies.
179;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-12-17T00:51:17Z;When Barack meets Eric, Sheryl, Tim, Dick and Marissa;;President Barack Obama will meet technology leaders on Tuesday morning for a two-hour discussion about everything from the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance programme, to how the industry can address income inequality.Big name tech executives from the eight companies which called on the US government to stop the spy agencies collecting such vast amounts of communications data will be pressing their case home “aggressively”, according to a spokesperson for one of the companies.These leaders include Eric Schmidt from Google, Sheryl Sandberg from Facebook, Tim Cook from Apple, Dick Costolo from Twitter and Marissa Mayer from Yahoo. But the guest list is much broader, from telecoms execs from AT&T and Comcast, to Shervin Pishevar, an Obama fundraiser and founder of start-up fund Sherpa, and even Chad Dickerson, the chief executive of Etsy, the online marketplace for handmade goods.But while pushing for reforms to restore trust in technology is top of the executives’ agenda, Obama has other priorities. He wants to seek ideas from those experienced in running websites to help save his own, the healthcare exchange Healthcare.gov, which has suffered from a very shaky roll-out. A White House official said the meeting will “discuss progress made in addressing performance and capacity issues with Healthcare.gov and how government can better deliver IT to maximize innovation, efficiency and customer service”.With Google and Oracle already among the technology companies who last month committed engineers to help the project, the White House could be asking for more computer geeks on the ground, or looking slightly beyond the immediate problems to how to better deliver large IT projects in the future.The White House also said the president will be discussing ways to partner with the tech sector to grow the economy, create jobs and address income inequality and social mobility – issues which Obama is trying to drive home in almost every meeting. Talks with the tech sector are most likely to focus on education or immigration.Obama recently promoted Code.org’s “Hour of Code” which called on high school students to spend an hour learning to programme computers, telling them it was important to keep America on the cutting edge.“Don’t just buy a new video game, make one. Don’t just download the latest app, help design it. Don’t just play on your phone, program,” he said.Before the NSA revelations, the industry’s most fervent lobbying was for immigration reform. Many of the companies represented at the meeting have leaders or founders who support FWD.US, the pro-immigration reform lobby group, including Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn. Frustrated by the barriers to hiring in-demand programmers from abroad, the technology industry has become a vocal critic of the immigration laws, while reforms have stalled in Congress.As Silicon Valley becomes a target of protests in San Francisco for pushing up rents and alienating locals – with demonstrators blockading a private commuter bus full of industry employees last week – the meeting could also be a chance for the executives to show they are engaged with wider issues across the country. Rather than, as Business Insider claimed “living inside a bubble of tone-deaf arrogance”.

Kohl’s slid 8.1 per cent to $53.56 after the department store chain reported weaker-than-expected results.Shares of the textbook publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which emerged from bankruptcy last year, rose as much as 33 per cent on their initial public offering price, valuing the company at about $2.23 billion. The stock finished 32.2 per cent higher at $15.86.Among new media companies, Yume shares surged 32.5 per cent to $8.48, as the online advertising company reported a smaller-than-expected third-quarter loss on Wednesday and forecast current-quarter revenue well above expectations as advertising customers increased by 45 per cent.The company reported loss of 3 cents per share on revenue of $36.2 million. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 9 cents per share on revenue of $34.5 millionTyco International shares added 2.4 per cent to $37.60 after the fire protection and security company reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat analysts’ estimates due to higher demand for its services. The company also said it was acquiring fire protection services company Westfire.SolarCity shares jumped 4.3 per cent to $56.23 after analysts at Robert W. Baird & Co raised their rating on the solar panel installer to “outperform” from “neutral”, citing the launch of solar asset-backed securities. SolarCity priced the securities on Wednesday.The analysts said that the move distinguished SolarCity as one of the most innovative public solar financing companies. They said the company could offer more such securities as it looks to lower its cost of capital.In the freight sector, Eagle Bulk Shipping slumped 29.3 per cent to $3.31, after the dry bulk shipper reported a bigger-than-expected third-quarter loss, hurt by lower time-charter rates.The company said it would not be able to meet some payment obligations if charter rates fell further, or it was unable to cut costs, or if it recorded more losses on some investments. Eagle Bulk said it was evaluating asset sales, and equity and debt financing options to raise cash.US stocks finished broadly higher on Thursday, holding gains from late in the previous session ahead of the Wednesday release of remarks from Federal Reserve chair nominee Janet Yellen.Following Wednesday’s close at record highs on the S&P and Dow, market sentiment was hurt by “the reality of Cisco and Walmart”, said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.Ms Yellen’s remarks, released on Wednesday after the market close, were perceived by the market as dovish and supportive of the policies that have helped the S&P 500 rally 25.6 per cent so far this year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 15,876.22, the S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent to 1,790.61, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent, to 3,972.74.Futures barely reacted to data showing the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000. Claims for the prior week were revised to show 5,000 more applications than previously reported.Overseas, data showed the euro zone economy grew at a slower than expected 0.1 per cent rate in the third quarter, which could hurt appetite for equities.
181;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-11-08T21:04:42Z;Nissan and TAG Heuer release smartwatches;Devices seek to impress by doing more than telling time;Heuer and Rolex launched the Carrera and Cosmograph Daytona watches, respectively, in 1964. Almost 50 years later, these watches are still regarded as quintessential timepieces for drivers.The Heuer was a straightforward chronograph, while the Cosmograph was more sophisticated thanks to a tachymeter scale engraved on its bezel, enabling the wearer to calculate distances and average speeds over a given time.Each watch is still available in a form similar to the original – but next to the latest driver’s watch from Nissan, they both look last century. The Japanese company is the first car manufacturer to join a fast-moving smart watch trend by introducing a product designed specifically for drivers of its high-performance Nismo sports cars. The watch will connect a driver directly to the vehicle to provide real-time biometric data.The Nismo watch, unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show this autumn, promises to monitor vehicle efficiency with average speed and fuel consumption readings, access on-track performance data, capture information about the driver via heart rate and brainwave monitors and connect to the car using a Bluetooth smartphone app. It can pick up tailored messages from Nissan headquarters, track and rate the user’s performance across social media sites – and tell the time.“Wearable technology is fast becoming the next big thing and we want to take advantage of this sort of innovation,” says Gareth Dunsmore, the car maker’s European communications manager.The Nismo watch joins other new-generation smartwatch offerings from Samsung, Pebble and Sony that are predicted to take off in the next year. Apple’s rumoured and potentially game-changing iWatch may launch in 2014, though as yet there is no certainty that it even exists.Surely the makers of more conventional, less technologically versatile wrist wear are concerned? Apparently not.According to the Deloitte Swiss Watch Industry report released in September, 42 per cent of brand executives regard smart watches as no threat. Only 6 per cent regard them as a threat to sales of watches in the SFr500-SFr1,000 ($556-$1100) bracket and 3 per cent think smart watches could jeopardise sales of timepieces costing more than SFr1,000.Their confidence will no doubt have been buoyed by rumours at the end of last month that, according to leaked documents, 30 per cent of Samsung customers who bought a £299 Galaxy Gear Smartwatch returned it. The watch tells the time and date, can be used to make and answer telephone calls and to view text and email messages when used in conjunction with a Samsung smartphone.All the same, some luxury brands, which might appear to be rooted in clockwork, are dabbling in smart watch technology. One is TAG Heuer, which developed a smart watch specifically for the crew of the victorious Oracle Team USA for this year’s America’s Cup yacht challenge.According to Stéphane Linder, chief executive, this was a one-off foray that does not presage the creation of a commercial product.“Smartwatches are clearly interesting, but I regard them more as a threat to makers of entry-level pieces costing a few hundred Swiss francs than to the sort of watches we make,” says Mr Linder.“A luxury mechanical watch is a status symbol and a beautiful piece of craftsmanship which people buy to keep for the long term – unlike most electronic devices which are quickly superseded, sometimes within a matter of months.”Mr Linder does concede that fewer young people are interested in buying mechanical watches.“In the past, people in their late teens and early 20s were often given a watch by their parents. Now they are more likely to be given an iPhone or iPad which, of course, tells them the time,” he says.“What we are finding, however, is that, as soon as young people enter their professional lives, they go back to traditional watches. Wearing one is all part of being dressed properly.”Similarly, Roger Smith, independent watch maker from the Isle of Man who creates only 10 watches a year at an entry price of £95,000, believes the old-fashioned clockwork timepiece has nothing to fear from the forecast invasion of the smart watch.“If anything,” says Mr Smith, “one of the main reasons people choose to buy a watch from us is because it is a traditional product made in a traditional way.“They are invariably trying to get away from technology, so the last thing they want is to look down at their wrist and see that someone has sent them an email.”——————————————-Sporting applications: Plain sailing with instant access to dataThis year’s America’s Cup yacht race saw competitors sailing $10m, 72-foot, carbon fibre catamarans that were the most technically advanced boats ever used for the event.Technology was not, however, confined to the vessels. Oracle Team USA’s sponsor, TAG Heuer, developed its own form of smart watch in the form of an ultra-intelligent, extreme version of its Aquaracer 72. It gave each crew member instant access to crucial race condition data, in real time, through a range of embedded systems customised for each sailor’s specific tasks and wirelessly linked to the boat’s on-board computers.The first watch to be designed purely for a sailing team, it weighs just 108 grams and features a large, 51mm face which can be read at a glance. A high contrast LED screen displays constantly updated information about the boat, including its speed, foil balance, sail pressure and true wind speed, direction and angle, all relayed from “captors” located around the boat.Although TAG Heuer made 50 examples of the watch, none will be made commercially available.
182;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-11-01T17:59:39Z;Say on pay: shaking off the yoke;Avarice is a sin and so is envy. Prudence is a virtue;In a sermon delivered on a boat bound for America in 1630, the Puritan John Winthrop argued that God made some people rich and others poor so that “He might have the more occasion to manifest the work of his Spirit . . . upon the wicked in moderating and restraining them, so that the rich and mighty should not eat up the poor, nor that the poor and despised rise up and shake off their yoke.”For today’s tastes, Mr Winthrop was a bit too much in favour of yokes. But he had no idea how inequality would blossom where he was heading. What might Mr Winthrop have made of Larry Ellison, chief of Oracle, for example? Mr Ellison has shown restraint in not buying poor people and eating them up. But he has accumulated a $40bn fortune, and spends his pile with flash. Mr Winthrop would have disapproved. It is harder to say how he would judge Oracle’s shareholders, who did a bit of rising up this week, voting to reject Mr Ellison’s pay package.The vote is non-binding, but sends a message. Mr Ellison, who had the Christian humility to forgo a cash bonus for the year because Oracle failed to hit internal targets, was to be paid a mere $80m or so in stock option grants. Non-Puritans will fail to see the problem. The grant comes to a (non-cash, after tax) expense of just a penny or so a share and puts Mr Ellison in the same boat as shareholders – both want the shares to rise. Yes, Oracle’s shares lag behind the wider market and technology companies over one year and five. But Mr Ellison runs a complex company that generated $13.5bn in free cash flow last year.There is nothing wrong with Mr Ellison’s wealth. But there are two reasons to worry about this sort of compensation. First, the dynastic wealth bosses of big companies can now hope to earn makes it rational for them to aim for sheer corporate size over strong returns on capital or to shareholders. Second, stock options risk making managers too concerned about the stock price and thus inclined to favour share-moving, near-term profits over productive, long-term reinvestment. Some argue that this incentive has already harmed the global economy. Avarice is a sin and so is envy. Prudence is a virtue.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
183;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-10-30T19:49:22Z;Finding flaws with $80m to get executives out of bed;Software company’s board must tread carefully over compensation;If you were worth nearly $40bn, what would it take to get you out of bed and off to work every morning?According to directors of the board of Oracle, the magic number is somewhere in the region of $80m a year. That’s the value of the average compensation package they’ve handed co-founder and chief executive Larry Ellison over the past half-decade.Shareholders in the database software company will on Thursday pass their verdict on their company’s pay practices. A protest vote under the non-binding “say on pay” rules is almost a given.More serious will be if a significant number of votes at Thursday’s annual meeting are cast against compensation committee head Bruce Chizen and other non-executive directors.Starting more than a decade ago, Mr Ellison led a consolidation of the business software industry that left Oracle’s shares handily outperforming the wider market. His sure touch has worn off in the past two years, however, with Oracle’s stock flat compared to the 45 per cent rise in the Nasdaq. And since March this year it has turned downright ugly: two bad quarters in a row have pushed Oracle down 5 per cent at a time when the market is up 22 per cent.It’s at times like these that shareholders are apt to find the flaws in overgenerous executive compensation plans. At Oracle, that isn’t hard to do.The company admits to paying “significantly above the average” but claims compensation is tied closely to performance. Yet with Mr Ellison’s pay almost entirely in the form of options, his rewards are largely tied to movements in the wider stock market.Since July of 2008, for instance, Oracle’s shares have risen nearly 60 per cent, compared to a 70 per cent increase in the Nasdaq Composite, of which it is a part. Yet options handed to the CEO during that period of underperformance have a current value of $302m.Over this time, Oracle’s board went along with an arrangement that had been in place for several years, dating back to a time when Mr Ellison used to propose his own pay level for the compensation committee to approve.The annual allocation of 7m options has remained constant. But a change in valuation methods forced by new accounting rules has cast things in a different light, turning what once looked like a moderate deal (Mr Ellison’s 7m options were valued by the company at $24m in 2006) into something more conspicuously extravagant (the average value of the 7m options over the past three years has been $77m).If Oracle’s board decides it needs to act next year to rein this in, it will need to tread carefully. One consideration will be to maintain the pay ladder that has Mr Ellison at the top.The company’s two presidents, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, have been paid about $45m each a year over the past three years, with engineering head Thomas Kurian getting nearly $35m. If curtailing Mr Ellison’s handouts leads to squeezing those packages then it could backfire: Mr Hurd, a former CEO of HP, has been talked of as a possible boss of Microsoft, though he has said he does not plan to move.There is also the thorny question of how much Mr Ellison actually needs to be paid to get him to keep coming to work. With a quarter of Oracle’s stock, it might seem that he already has plenty of reason to keep showing up at the office.Other companies with senior executives sitting on paper billions often consider that enough of an incentive. Steve Ballmer’s pay, for instance, has averaged only $1.3m over the past three years – though few in the tech world hold Microsoft up as a model of anything at the moment.At 69, Mr Ellison is the last of a generation – the founder-CEOs from the early days of the client-server era of computing.As he showed during his successful defence of sailing’s America's Cup last month, he has extracurricular activities that are more than capable of distracting his attention: on the eve of one key race, he failed to show up for his most important public appearance of the year, a keynote speech at Oracle’s biggest customer conference.For a few tens of millions of dollars, most Oracle investors won’t want to push things too far. But at $1bn for the top four executives over the past five years, they would be forgiven for wondering if their company’s executive compensation plan is really giving them value for money.Richard Waters is the Financial Times’ West Coast managing editorrichard.waters@ft.com
184;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-10-27T13:07:31Z;Mark Hurd, Oracle co-president;The former college tennis star has rallied after being forced out as HP chief executive;"Mark Hurd bounds in to the meeting room flourishing a deal. The announcement that Oracle will deliver human resources software for BT is a little thin on detail. The only indication of its value is that it is a “multimillion pound” contract. But for Oracle’s salesman-in-chief, it is the latest proof of his dynamism.“I’m very excited about this deal,” he declares. “It’s almost 90,000 [BT] employees. This is exciting. It’s all cloud-enabled software. A big, big deal for us.”Dressed in a navy suit and light blue shirt, the tanned, athletically built Mr Hurd, 56, looks the epitome of the buttoned-down executive. But Oracle’s co-president has had a tumultuous few years.Three years ago he was forced out as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard following allegations of sexual harassment; an internal HP investigation cleared him of breaching the company’s policy on harassment but found that he had filed inaccurate expenses.Describing Mr Hurd’s dismissal as the “worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs”, Oracle’s chief executive Larry Ellison hired him to a role overseeing its global field operations, including marketing and sales.We meet in a wood-panelled room at the Four Seasons hotel, a temple of anonymous opulence just off London’s Park Lane. There is a table set with coffee and biscuits, which he ignores in favour of a Starbucks latte slurped from a tall takeaway cup.●Born: 1957, New York

But Mr Hurd usually rises between 4.30am and 5am, and gets to Oracle’s offices in Redwood City, California, by 7.30am.He is frank about the addictive quality of executive life. “I think when you’re in these jobs, or in this industry, you never completely unwind. People that tell you they do are probably …probably pulling your leg a little bit.“I was at a meeting early this morning, came out and it must be midnight, 12.30am on the west coast, Larry [Ellison] is emailing me. All the guys that are in this are wired to sort of do this all the time.”He has been rumoured to be in the running to replace Steve Ballmer as chief executive of Microsoft. His response: “I’m not leaving Oracle.”Oracle is the world’s biggest software company after Microsoft. But the leviathan is at risk of being stranded by the shifting tide.Instead of relying on Oracle’s databases, servers and related software, business customers are increasingly switching to services delivered over the internet.A business model based on upfront sales, with guaranteed revenue from licensing and maintenance contracts, is under threat as customers opt for web-based – also known as cloud – services with less predictable pricing.The key message of Mr Hurd’s UK visit is that Oracle is moving with the times. “We’ve had good growth in our cloud business,” he says, with cloud subscription revenues for this year in excess of $1bn. The company’s cloud business is growing at a faster rate than its licence revenue, he says, although “from a lower base”. His upbeat message is a little undermined as he talks of weak demand across the sector. “We tend to feel better and better about [our] results when we see results from our competitors.”He admits some customers are fretting about the security of cloud data after Edward Snowden’s National Security Agency revelations. “There are going to be countries who say we don’t allow data outside of the country,” he says. But he maintains that Oracle cloud data are “very secure”.Oracle is one of the contractors behind Healthcare.gov. The rollout of the US government health insurance exchange has been a confusing and frustrating experience for many Americans because of baffling error messages and slow page loads. Asked about this, he says: “Listen, our software is working as advertised.”Mr Hurd has a record in executing successful corporate turnrounds. He implemented ruthless cost-cutting at HP. One of his first acts there was to cut 10 per cent of the workforce, about 15,000 employees.The cost-cutting drive underpinned five years of growth in profits at HP. When he was ousted in the summer of 2010, nearly $10bn was wiped from its stock market value in minutes.That said, Mr Hurd helped establish HP’s reputation for lousy acquisitions, saddling it with hefty writedowns on his purchases of both Palm and Electronic Data Systems.His dramatic departure was the latest episode in a soap opera of boardroom dysfunction at the company, including a spying scandal in which HP accessed journalists’ personal phone records.Asked what lessons he draws from the episode, he hesitates and asks to go off the record while thinking aloud. I switch my voice recorder off. He glances at the other one on the table. It belongs to Oracle, but gets switched off too while he gathers his thoughts.When the recorders go back on, he offers this analysis of corporate malfunction: “When you’re part of leadership it’s about the company first, it’s about the people in the company, and then about you.”He speaks deliberately, emphasising each layer of this hierarchy with a jab of his fingers. “So when you’re in these leadership positions, it’s a lesson to learn – it’s not about you, it’s about the company and making sure the company succeeds, and whenever that code sort of winds up in the wrong order, issues arise.”The desire to compete and win has deep roots. The son of a financier, Mr Hurd was educated at a prestigious private school in New York, then won a tennis scholarship to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he studied business administration.The pressure to achieve sporting and academic success required a fierce attention to time management. “I think it’s hard being an athlete in college,” he says. “I have a lot of respect for kids that go to school and they play sports and get a degree while they do that. It’s why I recruit so many of them.”At college he dreamt of playing tennis professionally, but he gave it up “when I couldn’t win enough”. To make a living in tennis, he says, you have to be in the top tier.“There are a lot of people that were [playing tennis] at my level – and you could go out on the tour, scrape by, and be out there a while. And I made a commitment to myself early that I’d give it a try fast. If I couldn’t pop, meaning get to that top tier relatively quickly, I would get a job.”It is little surprise that he picks the enduring Roger Federer, left, as his favourite player.The interview done, he is on his feet and off, shaking hands and whirling away out of the room to address staff in London, to meet more clients, to strike more deals."
185;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-10-25T17:53:31Z;The Everything Store, by Brad Stone;A suitably industrious account of how Jeff Bezos and Amazon swept all before them;"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, by Brad Stone, Bantam Press RRP£18.99/Little, Brown RRP$28, 384 pagesSeventeen years ago, as Jeff Bezos’s Amazon.com raised $8m in venture capital at a valuation of $60m – it now has a market capitalisation of $150bn – a 23-year-old temporary worker in its Seattle warehouse mislaid his car.Christopher Smith was working so furiously around the clock as Amazon grew that post piled up unopened in his apartment and he forgot he had left his Peugeot in a no-parking zone. When he finally opened his mail, he found several parking tickets, a notice that it had been towed away, and a letter telling him that the car had been sold at auction for $700, and he owed $1,800 in unpaid fines.Amazon was then a tiny company, started in Seattle by an intensely driven, scarily bright 31-year-old who had been working at a Wall Street hedge fund called DE Shaw & Co when he spotted the potential of the internet. He had the idea for an online retailer that could become the digital equivalent of Montgomery Ward, the mail-order and department-store business. He called it “the everything store”.It says something that one of Bezos’s first ideas for its name was Relentless.com (which still takes you to Amazon if you type it into a web browser). His unbounded drive and ambition has pushed his company through doldrums, diversions, failed ideas and a near-death financial crisis to become something remarkably like the outfit he first envisaged at DE Shaw.The outlines of the Bezos story – the drive west from Texas to Seattle with his wife MacKenzie in his father’s Chevrolet, the decision to start out with an online bookstore, his weird, booming laugh – are familiar. Anyone who wishes to dig deeper must penetrate the force field of secrecy that Bezos, a teenage Star Trek fan, erects to frustrate his competitors and shape his image.Brad Stone, a technology journalist who first covered Amazon in 2000, has done a remarkable job in The Everything Store, in a way that Bezos would appreciate – by working very hard. He has talked to many of those who knew and worked with Bezos from the early days, and even tracked down his biological father, who was divorced by his mother when he was a baby (Bezos is his stepfather’s name).“I thought he was a little bit crazy,” confesses one early employee. He is referring to a time when Amazon was offering 1.5m titles for sale on its website and had 40 books in its warehouse, but it is a fair assessment. Bezos mixes acute intelligence (and affability when relaxed) with touches of the psychopath. Not for nothing do Amazon executives call his screaming fits “nutters”.Stone recounts one incident when Bezos publicly humiliated a senior executive by calling Amazon’s number to check the man’s assertion that its phones were being picked up promptly. “Bezos took his watch off and made a deliberate show of tracking the time. A brutal minute passed, then two …Bezos’s face grew red; the vein in his forehead, a hurricane warning system, popped out”.All of this, however, was to a purpose. Bezos was building a company that broke the rules of retailing – for example, by allowing hostile reviews of products that it sold. He was thinking and pushing his way into a world that he had envisaged in theory but had to forge in reality.“Jeff does a couple of things better than anyone I’ve ever worked for,” one executive told Stone. “He embraces the truth. A lot of people talk about the truth, but they don’t engage their decision-making around [it] …The second thing is that he is not tethered by conventional thinking …he is bound only by the laws of physics. He can’t change those. Everything else, he views as open to discussion.”“Physically, I’m a chicken. Mentally, I’m bold,” is Bezos’s self-assessment. His formidable appetite for risk-taking has been necessary since Amazon’s success was far from assured. Stone recounts how Bezos, discussing the book, asked him: “How do you plan to handle the narrative fallacy?” He meant the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s term for the urge to weave a simple story from complex events.Amazon was so overstretched by explosive growth at first that it could easily have collapsed; many of Bezos’s initiatives, such as his effort to build an Amazon search engine, have failed and been shut down; the company could have run out of cash in the dotcom bust of the early 2000s. Yet he made enough good decisions and executed them well enough to shrug the rest off.As with other entrepreneurs, it is a bit of a mystery where this talent and focus sprang from. Discussing Bezos’s separation from his father, Stone notes that both Steve Jobs of Apple and Larry Ellison of Oracle, two other technology founders, were adopted and “the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed”. He moves swiftly on, perhaps fearing a narrative fallacy.Bezos’s boldness did not simply create a new type of retailer. He has also been fearlessly long-term in his outlook, keeping Amazon’s margins low and its profits small at best while expanding its revenue base, from books into other physical goods and, with the Kindle, into digital information. It took a long time for investors to grasp the scale of his ambition.Bezos has shaped Amazon so forcefully, with such attention to detail, that it is uncertain how well the company can outlast him. The culture is eccentric, with meetings starting in silence as everyone reads a memo on the topic. With their tight discipline and reluctance to stray from the script, its executives behave like members of a cult.Yet Bezos created a company with sufficient momentum to knock over and digest everything in its path – book stores, speciality retailers, publishers. It is as hard to block as its founder.John Gapper is the FT’s chief business commentator"
186;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-10-24T11:28:31Z;Dassault Systèmes spins off US unit as shares take hit;;Dassault Systèmes announced it is to spin off its US sales and services subsidiary while warning that changing customer habits would weigh on sales in the fourth quarter.Europe’s second-largest software company by market capitalisation, which competes with SAP and Oracle, said that customers were deciding to rent rather than buy software. Other clients have been delaying spending entirely, hitting quarterly numbers.The news pushed shares in the group down 2.5 per cent to €84.79 in Paris trading on Thursday.“Third-quarter results reflected a convergence of events with the common thread of a weak macro environment,” said Bernard Charlès, chief executive of Dassault Systèmes.“While customers are taking more time to evaluate investment decisions, their needs for delivering superior product experiences and transforming their business are stronger than ever.”Revenue in the third quarter of €499m was below the previous target of €520m. The miss had been flagged in a profit warning last week.Dassault Systèmes, whose biggest shareholder is French businessman Serge Dassault’s family-run holding Dassault Group, this month shifted its low-end estimate for fourth-quarter revenue from €565m to €555m.It also announced the sale of Inceptra, its sales and services subsidiary in North America, via a management buyout, adding that the proceeds would boost fourth-quarter results.Earlier this week, SAP, the German software group and European market leader, reported strong results but cautioned that if exchange rates remained at present levels, growth in software and related service revenues could be about 5 percentage points lower than expected.The weakening of emerging market currencies is set to be a drag on third-quarter earnings across Europe, not just in the software sector.Air Liquide, the French maker of industrial gases, reported third-quarter sales on Thursday that missed analysts’ estimates as a strengthening euro offset growing demand. It reiterated its forecast for profit growth in 2013, however.Last month Unilever, the consumer products group, warned that currency moves as well as an emerging market slowdown would weigh on quarterly sales growth.Elsewhere in Paris, stronger-than-expected sales in its engine services division on Thursday pushed Safran’s revenues up 9.7 per cent in the third quarter. The French aerospace group reaffirmed targets for the year.
187;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-10-22T18:11:16Z;VMware: virtually no excuses;Results provide ray of hope for growth at tech heavyweights;"Every large technology vendor has busily invested billions in hot areas, such as cloud software, to arrest declines in their legacy businesses, from personal computer operating systems to databases. Thus far this year, those bets are not paying off in sales growth (see: IBM, Oracle). But VMware’s latest results, reported on Tuesday, beat expectations and sent its shares up 3 per cent, providing a ray of hope that tech’s heavyweights have some growth left in them.VMware pioneered server virtualisation – a technology that allows server computers to host multiple software applications. Virtualisation creates serious efficiencies in data centre infrastructure. The company grew rapidly and its shares rose fivefold between 2009 and 2012. But as virtualisation reached saturation, the growth trajectory levelled off. Before its latest results, VMware’s shares this year were off by a fifth.At the same time, VMware had been investing in virtualisation for networking (typically the domain of hardware vendors) as well as cloud capabilities.In the third quarter just reported, VMWare’s software licence revenue jumped an unexpected 17 per cent. Most of that is concentrated in its core virtualisation. But nearly a third of bookings were in the form of ELAs, enterprise licence agreements, which are multiyear commitments; VMware believes customers want these deeper relationships to get access to their newest products.Even with the bump, VMWare’s share price is still more than 10 per cent off its high for the year. Its price to free cash flow per share multiple of 15 times is down nearly a fifth from its peak in 2013. After the latest results, investors may have to accept that the company has a new growth peg. And VMware’s big peers may have just lost an excuse for their own sluggishness.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
188;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-10-16T00:45:27Z;Oracle headed for executive pay showdown;;Oracle looks to be headed for a showdown with shareholders at its annual meeting on October 31, after two influential investor advisory firms on Tuesday recommended a protest vote against the company.ISS and Glass Lewis, which advise institutional investors how to vote their stock at company meetings, called on investors to withhold support for a number of directors over the company’s pay practices, among other issues.The recommendations followed Oracle’s claim, in a proxy statement ahead of the meeting, that “significant changes to our executive compensation program were not warranted”. That is despite a majority of shareholders at last year’s annual meeting voting against its pay practices, largely due to high stock option awards made to chief executive Larry Ellison.ISS called on investors to reject all seven of Oracle’s independent directors, along with chairman Jeff Henley, while voting to reappoint the three executives on the board – Mr Ellison and presidents Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. Glass Lewis, meanwhile, called for the rejection of five directors, including Ms Catz.Both firms also recommended shareholders vote against the company’s pay practices, though such votes are not binding.Mr Ellison, who owns 25 per cent of Oracle’s stock, has received annual compensation averaging $84m in each of the past three years, based on the valuation of options handed him by the company.
189;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-09-26T17:02:01Z;Winner takes all;Having won the America’s Cup, Oracle should change it;Unlike the Olympics, the most important thing about the America’s Cup is not taking part but winning. In the first race in 1851, Queen Victoria watched America of the US finish ahead of 15 British yachts. Victoria is reported to have inquired about the identity of the runner-up. “Ah, Your Majesty, there is no second,” was the legendary answer. Losers, it seems, might as well be consigned to Davy Jones’ locker.The New Zealand crew that lost this week to Oracle Team USA has learnt the hard way how cruel the quest for the Auld Mug can be. Having amassed a seemingly unassailable 8-1 lead in the first-to-nine series, the New Zealand syndicate lost eight consecutive races. Oracle, the software powerhouse, retained the trophy it had won in 2010, completing one of the most remarkable comebacks in sporting history.For all the thrill of the high seas, there are lingering doubts about the format of the America’s Cup. Traditionally, the race was contested by smaller, single-hull boats. Over the past decade, billionaires such as Larry Ellison of Oracle and Ernesto Bertarelli, his arch-rival from Switzerland, have moved to pricey, hyper-fast catamarans. The 100 Guinea Cup, as it was known in 1851, has become the £100m race. The aim is to transform sailing into a more television-friendly product. But costs have become so insane that only four boats could take part in this year’s contest, compared with 10 or more not so long ago. The small number of countries represented has reduced the global appeal of the event and may make it harder to attract sponsors in the future. There are also safety concerns about the yachts’ excessive speed. In May, Andrew Simpson, the British Olympian, died after his catamaran, Artemis, capsized.The America’s Cup winner-takes- all rules give the holder the right to pick the format of the next series. Mr Ellison may decide to stick to the high-cost model he has championed and clearly finds exciting. With a deciding race in prospect, he declined to attend his keynote presentation to the Oracle OpenWorld corporate event, prompting a walkout from the hall.Yet, unless he lowers the costs, the Oracle boss may struggle to find new challengers. Grant Dalton, manager of New Zealand, has left a question over whether his team will compete at the next contest. Of course there is always the option of a race between two of Mr Ellison’s own boats – say Oracle A and Oracle B. The antitrust authorities should be on notice.——————————————-Letters in response to this editorial:America’s Cup should add to its gain with an annual series / From Mr David H ClarkeFormula One of sailing will upset many / From Mr Martin Falkner
190;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-09-26T08:21:16Z;US mall owner Simon Property leads rush for euro bond deals;;Simon Property, the biggest owner of malls in the US, is as American as apple pie. Its newest bonds are decidedly not.This week, the Indianapolis-based real estate company began selling €750m ($1.02bn) of euro-denominated seven-year bonds. It is the latest American corporation to opt to sell debt in Europe, taking advantage of market conditions in an economy that has only just begun to emerge from recession.American companies including Wells Fargo, Ford Motor, DirecTV, Oracle and Microsoft have all sold euro- or sterling-denominated bonds in recent months.Selling bonds in those currencies may now be cheaper for some US companies than issuing dollar-denominated debt. The deals also allow them to tap eager European investors, while also sourcing the euros needed to help finance asset purchases and investments in the region.“It’s in some part due to the stress that the whole European region has been under,” said Ken Chang, a managing director in debt capital markets at Barclays. “There have been opportunities to make acquisitions in the region at more opportunistic prices. That creates a [euro] funding need.”Simon Property, for instance, has snapped up a 29 per cent stake in Klépierre, a French company which owns shopping centres in France, Italy and Spain. The mall operator has also invested in McArthurGlen, which owns designer outlets around Europe that sell discounted Armani, Burberry and Dolce & Gabbana clothing.Offering bonds into the European market has also become more attractive for US companies as the cost of converting euros into dollars has tumbled dramatically in recent months.The one-year euro-US dollar “basis swap” has dropped from negative 106.5 basis points in late 2011, to negative 8.25bp this week. That means that traders are still willing to pay a premium for dollar funding, but much less of a premium than during the depths of the eurozone crisis.At the same time, selling euro-denominated debt allows companies to tap a market that many bankers describe as undersupplied in terms of bond issuance. The vast majority of company debt sold in Europe still comes in the form of loans, as opposed to bonds that tend to dominate corporate issuance in the US.Verizon had initially planned to sell euro- and sterling-denominated bonds as part of its record-breaking $49bn offering earlier this month, according to people familiar with the transaction. But the telecoms company chose to issue only in dollars after receiving more than $100bn of orders for the bonds, disappointing European investors who had been eager to grab a slice of the historic deal.Still, a host of other well-known American corporates have issued euro-denominated bonds recently. They include McDonald’s, tractor maker John Deere and tobacco giant Philip Morris.“It’s getting much more competitive for most and in some instances it’s already slightly cheaper [for US companies to sell bonds in Europe],” said Mr Chang at Barclays.
191;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-09-26T03:37:22Z;Ellison team storms to America’s Cup victory;;The US boat funded by Oracle boss Larry Ellison pulled off an improbable and dramatic victory in San Francisco Bay on Wednesday afternoon to win the America’s Cup.The defeat of a New Zealand boat backed by Emirates Airline capped the closest showdown in the 162-year history of the race, the oldest continually contested trophy in sport. The Oracle Team USA boat overcame a seemingly insurmountable 8-1 deficit in the first-to-nine series to win in a final showdown.It also brought 11th-hour vindication for Mr Ellison and the city of San Francisco, after months of criticism in the run-up to the 19-day event. The death of a sailor during qualifying events led to accusations that Mr Ellison had pushed the technology too far in his ambition to turn a once gentlemanly ocean sailing event into a spectacle capable of capturing a large TV audience.The races were contested in 72ft catamarans with rigid wing sails capable of travelling at up to 50 knots. The high costs of mounting a challenge, estimated at around $100m, resulted in only three boats taking on Mr Ellison in his home waters, compared to the 10 or so that normally contest the event. The lack of international representation also cut into attendance at the event, which typically attracts a flotilla of private yachts, and threatened its international TV audience.“It’s no secret that these boats are expensive and we want to get more boats competing next time,” Mr Ellison said at a press conference after the race. However, he defended the radical change of boat design, calling the regatta “the most magnificent spectacle I’ve ever seen on the water”.Mr Ellison refused to disclose how much he had spent to win the cup for a second time, but said: “It costs about the same to win as to lose. It’s certainly better to win.”Some estimates put the Oracle boss’s spending at up to $200m, and his total costs in the four America’s Cup tournaments he has contested at almost $500m. The Oracle team retained the trophy after its previous victory in 2010.Grant Dalton, manager of the New Zealand team, said the changes to the boats had made the regatta “too expensive”, and left a question over whether the country would compete at the next America’s Cup.“Obviously Oracle has done something pretty amazing with the technology, and that would be pretty scary for other teams” in the future, Mr Dalton said.Mr Ellison is worth $41bn, according to Forbes magazine, making him America’s third-richest man behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.After a difficult few years for the yacht building industry, buyers, sellers and brokers are hoping for better times aheadThe Oracle boat lost the start for the second race in a row on Wednesday but won back the lead halfway through the course after a drag race past Alcatraz Island, going on to win by 44 seconds.The winner-takes-all finale had been set up after Oracle pulled off seven straight victories to force a deciding contest. The fightback was masterminded by four-time British Olympic gold winner Sir Ben Ainslie.The New Zealand crew had been within one race of victory for a week, but had been thwarted by a resurgent Oracle and a series of races postponed by unfavourable wind conditions.The cup underwent a transformation from the last contest three years before and, despite early misgivings, has drawn shoreside crowds in San Francisco and big television audiences, with a quarter of New Zealanders regularly following the fortunes of Dean Barker and his men in the challenger boat over an unprecedented two and a half weeks of racing.The winner earns the right to decide the format and venue for future events.Monohull boats were the standard craft used in more than 100 years of America’s Cup racing, but Sir Russell Coutts, Oracle Team USA chief executive, disposed of tradition this year and promised to deliver a regatta that would appeal to the “Facebook generation” rather than the “Flintstones generation”.It costs about the same to win as to lose. It’s certainly better to winMr Ellison put the reversal of fortunes midway through the race series down to changes to his team’s boat and racing techniques that were designed to push its bow lower down in the water. That had enabled it to move faster on the upwind legs of the races, he added – the stage at which it had overtaken the New Zealand boat on the final two races.The catamarans race at speeds three and four times faster than monohulls and can reach up to 50mph, planing on one or both hulls out of the water on hydrofoils.Mr Ellison’s sailing ambitions have clashed in recent days with his responsibilities as chief executive of the world’s second-biggest software company. More than 60,000 IT managers and others have descended on San Francisco this week for Oracle OpenWorld, the customer event that has become the biggest convention in the city’s annual calendar. With a deciding race in prospect, Mr Ellison failed to appear for his keynote presentation on Tuesday evening, prompting a mass walkout of attendees from the hall.

It also drafted in British Olympian Sir Ben Ainslie as tactician for his cup debut to turn round its fortunes.The US team has won 10 races in all but was penalised two points before the regatta began for illegal modifications to its smaller 45ft catamaran in the warm-up series.In winning the final race, Oracle has recaptured the 162-year-old America’s Cup for the third time, and first time since losing to Switzerland’s Alinghi in 2003.

194;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Change of format for television prices out teams;Efforts to attract an audience beyond sailing have helped makde the event too expensive;Larry Ellison’s grip on the America’s Cup may be finally loosening. Three years after his BMW Oracle team won sailing’s most prized trophy off Valencia, the software billionaire’s defence has been crumbling under the weight of Emirates Team New Zealand’s impressive challenge.The homegrown New Zealand outfit remains just one race victory away from beating Oracle Team USA and its star-studded crew after two weeks of competition off the San Francisco coast.Oracle has, however, staged an impressive fightback from 8-1 down, inspired by Olympic champion Ben Ainslie. With a further two races later on Tuesday, the score stands at 8-6, with the first to nine the winner.Losing will be painful for the Oracle chief executive, although it may be of some comfort to know he has injected renewed vigour into the 162-year-old event. Some observers, however, also hold him partly responsible for the event’s descent into acrimony and the exclusion of all but the super-wealthy.Partly because of its history, the America’s Cup is a sporting contest of global repute. First raced off the English coast in 1851 between the best British yacht and a schooner from the New York Yacht Club named America, the contest has always attracted entrepreneurs and industrialists.From Sir Thomas Lipton and Sir Thomas Sopwith to the Vanderbilts from the US and Australian tycoon Alan Bond, the cup has always found individuals willing to sink time, effort and most of all money into the pursuit of sporting glory on the seas.But its reputation has been sullied in recent years and sponsors have drifted away, as have many of the teams. Much of the damage was caused by an unedifying legal battle involving Mr Ellison and Switzerland’s Ernesto Bertarelli, heir to the Serono pharmaceutical company and cup winner in 2007 in Valencia.The 33rd edition of the cup, a grudge match in 2010 between Oracle and Mr Bertarelli’s Alinghi team, went Mr Ellison’s way. The defending champion has the right to set the specifications for each edition of the race, and Mr Ellison has set about changing the tone of the event, most of all in constructing an event to attract an audience beyond sailing.“Fundamentally, this series has been designed as a television product,” says Richard Simmonds, joint managing director at Sunset+Vine, a supplier of sports programming to broadcasters.The cup was traditionally raced in single-hull boats out at sea. But Mr Ellison championed a change of format involving fast, multihulled boats racing closer to the shoreline, with the San Francisco coastline an enticing urban backdrop this time round.The 34th edition pitted two catamarans racing at speeds of up to 30 knots, with the boats often tipping dangerously on their side to gain maximum racing thrust. At times they looked like they were flying above the surface of the water.Television viewers were given data on boat speeds and direction of currents, while on-board cameras and microphones showed close up the frantic efforts of the crews to jibe and tack. “It is exciting to watch and it has captured imaginations,” Mr Simmonds says.But to sailing traditionalists, some of the beauty of the cup has been lost. The main criticism is that the modern version resembles nothing more than a drag race, the artistry of sailing sacrificed on the altar of speed.Warnings about the risk of excessive speeds came horribly true in May when British Olympian Andrew Simpson was killed after his boat, Artemis, capsized during the Louis Vuitton Cup, the play-off that determines the America’s Cup challenger.Stephen Barclay, chief executive of the America’s Cup Event Authority, which organises the race, says rule changes following the fatality have done much to improve safety. But he is unapologetic about ruffling the feathers of the sport’s purists.“We do not want to disenfranchise sailing’s aficionados,” he says. “But in this world, where a lot of attractions and sports are thrown at you, to retain interest you must be doing things to effectively grow your audience.”Sailing, he adds, must compete in a wider US sports market. “When you mention the America’s Cup, it opens doors. The problem is no one knows anything about it after that,” Mr Barclay says. “Our objective is to have it sit below the top four [US sports] but to be well recognised.”From a global perspective, the America’s Cup needs strong international competition.But the cost of building vessels to achieve such high speeds has priced out many teams. The Louis Vuitton Cup was meant to attract a host of teams, but only three entered.Sir Keith Mills, who masterminded London’s bid to stage the 2012 Olympics, has long dreamt of bringing the cup back to UK shores. But his ability to raise funds for a British challenge has been curtailed by the extortionate costs. “They changed the format after the deepest economic recession in history and came up with one that meant unless you were prepared to spend north of $100m you shouldn’t even bother,” Sir Keith says.While acknowledging the quality of the racing and TV product, Sir Keith insists the event needs to be more accessible.“This America’s Cup has been a big mistake,” he says. “If the object was to get more teams engaged, to expand the audience and bring in more sponsors, then it’s had the completely reverse effect. It has emerged as a sport for billionaires.”Mr Barclay does not disagree: “We need to look at reducing the costs.”Sir Keith hopes that the New Zealand team, if they win, will look to retain the gains that have emerged from this series of races while injecting some much-needed competition. “We’ve got to make it successful for teams, sponsors and fans,” he says.
195;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-09-20T22:46:18Z;US hopes still afloat as Oracle clings on;;Software billionaire Larry Ellison started the weekend still clinging to the hopes of a return on the hundreds of millions of dollars he has sunk into the America’s Cup, after a less well-funded New Zealand boat came tantalisingly close on Friday to wresting the sailing world’s most prestigious trophy from his grasp in San Francisco Bay.By the end of the week, the pitting of Mr Ellison’s private fortune against the corporate sponsorship and better organised team of the challenger had made a classic sporting duel out of an event that had threatened at one point to become a debacle.However, with the New Zealand team heavily tipped to win, the outcome still looked likely to quieten the critics who have complained that the 162-year-old event has become a plaything of the super-rich.The two-week event in San Francisco was masterminded by the Oracle co-founder as a showcase for a new style of high-speed, fixed-wing catamaran sailing. It proved too expensive even for the well-heeled elite that normally fights over the tournament, however, with only three boats eventually entering the competition. The event was also marred by the death of a sailor in practice earlier in the year after a boat broke up, raising questions about whether Mr Ellison has tried to push sailing technology too far in his hopes of winning a big TV audience for the event.The New Zealand team may have spent around $70m, compared to a budget of more like $200m for Mr Ellison’s boat, according to Mark Turner, a former competitive sailor who pioneered the new style of racing that Mr Ellison emulated.Despite the huge budget gap, the New Zealand boat, with Emirates Airline as lead sponsor, won six of the first seven races, putting it in a dominant position in the first-to-nine series. Oracle was further hampered by a two-race penalty after one of its boats was tampered with in an earlier race.Since then, however, Oracle has won four of the last six races, making the competition the most balanced for years in what is usually a one-sided event.The struggles of the Oracle boat – and the mishaps in the lead-up to the tournament – have provoked schadenfreude from Mr Ellison’s enemies in the sailing world.“Larry Ellison must have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and he is being humiliated in his home town,” Sir Keith Mills, the British businessman and sailing enthusiast who helped bid for and organise the London Olympics, said ahead of Friday’s racing. No fan of the Oracle tech mogul, Sir Keith has complained that the America’s Cup has been turned into a trial of speed to be contested only by the super-rich. “He is feeling pretty peeved,” he added.One race away from defeat, however, the Oracle boat was saved on Friday by light winds, after a race that New Zealand was set to win exceeded its 40-minute time limit – the reverse of an earlier race that was abandoned due to high winds with the New Zealand boat also in front. The Oracle boat came from behind in a second race later in the day to stave off defeat and push the sailing into the weekend.Known in the tech world for his highly competitive instincts, Mr Ellison is America’s third-richest man with a personal fortune of $41bn, according to Forbes magazine. He made three previous challenges, resulting in a victory in the last competition in 2010 that gave him the right to bring the competition to California and set his own rules.
196;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-09-18T22:27:37Z;Oracle navigates choppy earnings outlook;;Oracle issued a downbeat financial forecast late on Wednesday, despite a return to modest growth in its latest quarter after a weak first half of the year.The company’s outlook pointed to continued softness in the demand reported recently by a number of big IT players and took more than 3 per cent off Oracle’s stock price. The shares were trading at about $32.80 in after-market trading.Two successive quarters of flat revenues had stirred worries among investors that Oracle risked missing out on much of the shift in corporate IT spending towards cloud computing.Oracle executives indicated that the company was expecting revenues in its current quarter, which ends in November, to be between 1 per cent lower and 2 per cent higher than the year before, or $9bn-$9.28bn. Wall Street had been expecting $9.41bn.It also forecast pro-forma earnings per share of 64-69 cents, compared to analysts’ estimates of 69 cents.Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-president, blamed the weak forecast on the comparison with a very strong quarter the year before and hinted that it might turn out to be a conservative outlook. “We just have to execute and we have to avoid any other economic deterioration,” she said. “We have an opportunity to do significantly better.”However, Mark Hurd, the company’s other president, blamed the outlook squarely on a broader weakness in IT demand. “We read all of our peer’s results. To be very blunt, they’re not very good,” he said. “We see what’s out there. We’re trying to be prudent.”For the quarter ending in September, Oracle reported 2 per cent revenue growth, to $9.4bn, with net income rising 8 per cent to $2.19bn. Pro-forma earnings per share reached 59 cents, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 56 cents, on a lower tax charge.
197;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-09-18T18:04:49Z;Microsoft: a hard sell;Stockholders are betting the core businesses will be surprisingly stable;"Why would anyone bother owning Microsoft? At the company’s analyst meeting on Thursday, its leaders should keep the question in mind.The case against the shares is simple: Microsoft’s operating system, office and server software businesses derive their competitive advantage from the centrality of the personal computer in the lives of consumers and businesses. The PC is getting less important, fast. And Microsoft’s valuation doesn’t reflect this. The shares trade at 11 times this years’ earnings and a free cash flow yield of 9 per cent. Cheap? Those figures look a lot like those for IBM and Oracle, the other gigantic clanking technology relics. But it is hard to argue that they face mortal threats to rival Microsoft’s.Those who hold the stock are betting that the core businesses will be surprisingly stable, and that investors will reap the rewards. That second point is important. They will want to hear not just a survival strategy – Microsoft’s ironclad commitment to mobile devices and to making their software available “over the cloud” are evidence that such a strategy is in place – but a strategy for making investors richer.Two changes would help. First: a major pruning of the online services division, including a shutdown of the Bing search engine. The division lost $1.2bn a year ago, and its role in propping up the core is obscure. Second: a commitment to returning more capital with dividends and less with buybacks. The recent increase to the dividend is a good step. But last year, the dividend/buyback mix was about 60/40; 90/10 would make more sense. In theory, capital distribution policy leaves a company’s value unchanged. In practice, an aggressive dividend programme would signal that Microsoft will be managed with sustainable cash flow in mind and that management is appropriately modest about its ability to evaluate when its own stock is cheap (it has done a terrible job in the past).Many companies think too much about rewarding investors. Few would argue this is Microsoft’s problem.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"

199;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Lessons from Lehman: ‘Don’t Panic’;Investors who stayed in stocks and junk bonds can afford a smile;Warren Buffett is not called the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ for nothing.‘Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful’ is good investment advice looking back at the turmoil of September 2008.The demise of Lehman Brothers five years ago marked the start of a truly fearful six months for investors. Only in March 2009 had risky asset prices fallen far enough for bargain-hunting buyers to begin picking up equities and lower-quality bonds.On the anniversary this weekend of Lehman’s collapse, those investors who stayed the course in equities and junk bonds can afford a smile. The S&P 500 index has gained 50 per cent.They have done well, though alternative bets made in 2008, such as buying a New York City taxicab medallion, have done even better.Even buyers of certain commodities and US government and investment-grade bonds are sitting on handsome gains, in spite of a retreat across many asset classes from their post-Lehman peaks in 2010 and 2011.The questions facing investors now, though, are very different. A sharp rise in bond yields and steep losses across emerging markets point to a world where the risk of rising interest rates – as the Federal Reserve starts to withdraw emergency stimulus – will be the greatest source of volatility.Art Steinmetz, chief investment officer at OppenheimerFunds, says smaller investors face a rude awakening, as rising interest rates trigger declines in the value of their bond portfolios. “They have spent the past five years preparing for 2008,” he says. “The next crisis is clearly visible: rising interest rates.”Certainly, any appraisal of the investment landscape today is influenced by the repercussions of Lehman’s collapse. Those include not just the financial and economic turmoil that followed, but the supporting role played by the Fed since 2008 that only now appears set to start shrinking.The Fed and other central banks have undertaken extraordinary measures, such as the successive rounds of “quantitative easing” that suppressed interest rates to offset a savage deleveraging in the private sector and stimulate lending.Yet, for all the vast sums of money spent by the Fed under QE, the end result has been a lacklustre economic recovery marked in the US by high unemployment.Indeed, the major consequence of QE and near-zero interest rates has been the shift among a generation of retail investors into bonds. For much of the five years since Lehman, that move has proved lucrative. But the gains have masked risks.They [investors] have spent the past five years preparing for 2008. The next crisis is clearly visible: rising interest ratesMr Steinmetz says investors who have put as much money into bond funds as they did into growth stocks in the late 1990s “are overpaying for safety, and the only thing that is certain is that won’t meet their retirement goals”.As the Fed prepares to take the first step towards normalising interest rates, equities may now be poised to eclipse debt. But when it comes to deciding between bonds and equities, much still depends on whether the Fed’s stimulus efforts will finally translate into a robust economic recovery.“In a growing economy, the equity market will deliver a higher longer-term performance, but with greater volatility than bonds,” says Ashish Shah, head of global credit at AllianceBernstein. “Bonds are boring, but will provide income and equities will be where you get your excitement and higher longer-term gains.”Mr Shah estimates that, over the next five years, holders of junk bonds should expect 6 to 7 per cent annual returns. “Over the next five years we won’t see the kind of returns produced since 2009, given today’s starting point for asset prices.”Stronger economic data would go a long way towards easing concerns that companies’ earnings are too elevated and simply reflect cost-cutting and share buybacks, action that has masked tepid revenue growth for the S&P 500 index.Jay Mueller, senior portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management, says corporate profits have bounced back sharply since Lehman, unlike the economy and employment. “But the question I ask is: how much longer can corporate profitability outperform the economy? We are not seeing impressive top-line growth.”Commodities were seen as an alternative home for investors keen on assets that were uncorrelated with bonds and equities or which offered a good hedge against inflation.However, they have proved to be neither since Lehman. In fact, they moved in close alignment with other asset classes until the past year, while fears that QE would lead to runaway inflation have so far failed to materialise.The Dow Jones-UBS commodities index is down about a quarter on a total return basis since Lehman.The price of Brent crude oil is nominally higher, at about $113 per barrel, but investors without oil tank leases would have lost 16 per cent as they rolled futures contracts from month to month. Gold is up 73 per cent, but down 30 per cent from its peak two years ago.Douglas Hepworth, executive vice-president at Gresham Investment Management, says fears about inflation have not gone away. If anything, investors are now more worried about the effects of price rises than the need for diversification.“What’s happened in the last five years has been a trade-off of consumer debt for government debt. So does inflation show up? Odds are pretty good.”When so much uncertainty still surrounds the economy and Fed policy, trying to gauge the future performance of asset classes is extremely difficult. But the period since 2008 shows that being fearful is not necessarily the answer.Mr Steinmetz says Oppenheimer is trying to persuade clients to “peek out from under the blanket” and shift large parts of their savings into equities, where the last four years may only be the start of the rally.
200;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Google ‘ground-scraper’ London HQ to be King’s Cross centrepiece;;"Google has been granted permission to build its ambitious London headquarters, which will include a running track and roof-top swimming pool, just days after one of the city’s largest redevelopments was called in for a planning review by the government.The 920,000 sq ft “ground-scraper” will form the centrepiece of the King’s Cross regeneration scheme and will allow the internet search group to centralise all of its London offices.News of the permission comes the same week that the planned £1.5bn redevelopment of the Shell Centre on the South Bank was called in for a last-minute review by government ministers.The project, one of the highest-profile developments since the start of the financial crisis, comes after a string of deals involving technology groups, including Skype, Oracle and Amazon, seeking to take up office space in the UK capital. Google’s London staff are split between two offices in Victoria and one in Holborn.The move will allow it to house all London staff under one roof. It plans to keep its office in Manchester.The group came under fire last year when a parliamentary select committee accused it of “immoral tax avoidance”.Google also operates Campus, a seven-storey centre in Shoreditch that offers work spaces to technology and media start-ups as part of London’s Tech City project.Simon Allford, a partner at Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, the architects for the project, said the building would “articulate a conversation between the world within and the city beyond”.Technology, media and telecoms companies have branched out from the heartland of Old Street during the past two-and-a-half years and into the City of London, the West End and beyond.Major deals last year include News International’s plan to move into the “Baby Shard”; Skype taking 88,000 sq ft at Waterhouse Square; Weber Shandwick, the communications group, signing for 65,000 sq ft in the same building; and Oracle acquiring 22,000 sq ft at 1 South Place.TMT companies are on course to absorb an additional 1.2m sq ft by 2014, an area twice the size of the Shard, London’s tallest skyscraper, according to a recent study by BNP Paribas Real Estate.The demand, if it materialises, will provide a tonic to London’s commercial property landlords, who are suffering from declining uptake from various other sectors."
201;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
202;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-08-23T18:55:25Z;Microsoft: web search;Next leader will be asked to ‘fix’ stagnant but solid business;On the news that Steve Ballmer is to step down as chief executive of Microsoft, let us acknowledge Bill Gates’s genius. Why? For founding the company that led the personal computing revolution? Sure – but also for his impeccable timing in departing as CEO in 2000 while the company was on top (note he would remain involved). Mr Ballmer’s departure within the next year, announced on Friday, comes at a less glorious moment for Microsoft.It is unclear if Mr Gates saw the gathering storm clouds when he left to pursue saving the world. In 2000, Apple was a moribund PC maker. The trendy mobile devices were BlackBerrys and Palm Pilots. The leader in internet search was Yahoo. Companies and consumers bought software from Microsoft and Oracle only through licenses that required pricey upgrades every few years.Of course, during the next decade Apple eventually invented devices that marginalised PCs, while Google not only developed a better search engine but also the leading mobile device platform, Android. Salesforce.com demonstrated that software can be efficiently rented and delivered over the internet instead of sold in a box.Microsoft tried to step up its game by introducing its game consoles, server software, tablets, phones and cloud platforms. It also bought Skype for $9bn and tried to buy Yahoo for $45bn. But these bets were either too little, too late or just badly muffed.The conundrum though for the third person to sit in the CEO perch is not that Microsoft’s business is in terrible shape. Revenue in 2012 was nearly $80bn, up from about $20bn in Mr Ballmer’s first year as boss. Its cash balance sits also near $80bn. Since 2004 (post-internet bubble), Microsoft’s total shareholder return is 58 per cent. Consider that Intel’s return over that time is -11 per cent.Rather, shareholders seem to want big change anyway (say, exiting the consumer segments). Pumping the business for cash flow is great but insufficient. So good luck to the next leader, who will be asked to “fix” a stagnant but solid business. IBM and Apple were on the scrap heap just before their resurrections. But they had a key advantage over Microsoft today: nothing to lose.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
203;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Tech executives facing up to hard realities of the cloud;Staying ahead of this storm front is challenging even industry giants;Technology revolutions have a habit of devouring their own children.There has never been a clearer case in point than the coming of the cloud, the great deflationary force of modern business computing. The centralised infrastructure of cloud computing threatens to turn the once high-value hardware and software components of IT systems into standardised commodities. Staying ahead of this wave is a challenge, even for the industry’s giants.A fascinating test will be the fate of VMware, the most successful business software start-up since Oracle. The server virtualisation technique that VMware perfected – tricking a computer into thinking it’s actually several different machines, which allows several applications to run at once and makes more efficient use of the hardware – turned out to be one of the first steps towards the pooling of computing resources on which the cloud depends.But what happens when server virtualisation runs its course? With an estimated two-thirds of the market accounted for, and Microsoft giving away its own version of the software free of charge, the cloud has started to look a more hostile environment.Under Pat Gelsinger, the former Intel chief technologist who took over a year ago, VMware has now chosen to double down instead on what it knows best: making the basic building blocks of cloud computing operate more efficiently. The virtualisation trend that turned the server market upside down is now threatening to subvert the other sectors of IT – networking gear and computer storage – and VMware wants to lead the charge.That puts companies such as Cisco and EMC in the line of fire, alongside those that have struggled with negligible or non-existent growth: IBM, HP and Dell.It has been tempting for companies like these to blame wider macroeconomic issues for their sluggish performance – as Cisco did after posting weak results last week. But it’s hard to escape the feeling that they are increasingly on the wrong side of a technology shift that favours a new generation of disruptors.Adding an extra twist to the VMware story is its majority ownership by EMC. Is the largest storage maker really prepared to see its core market eaten away by its own subsidiary? Mr Gelsinger’s response is: “If you don’t eat your own children, somebody else will.”Tech executives relish this kind of talk. However, when the crunch comes, few believe that their shareholders will stomach the hit to sales that such disruptive behaviour implies.EMC, at least, has a strong incentive to actually follow through. Its stake in VMware is worth $29bn – a large slice of its own $53bn stock market value.But is there an even greater deflationary force, though, waiting in the wings?Amazon.com, which is fast turning into the most feared deflator in techland, was once mocked by the heavyweights of business computing for its rush into the cloud, selling capacity in its own data centers. According to what was, until recently, received wisdom, big companies would never trust their most valuable data and important business processes to a “public cloud” service like this.It now turns out that the rest of the business tech world was wrong: the convenience and cost advantages are so great that even big companies have overcome their qualms. According to Gartner, Amazon now has five times as much cloud computing capacity in use for its customers as its next 14 rivals combined.Companies such as VMware and IBM, having initially turned their noses up at the idea that they needed to build public clouds of their own, are racing to add this as an option. They cling to the hope that “hybrid clouds” are a halfway house that play to their strengths, as customers look to move their IT workloads seamlessly between their own systems and “overflow” networks operated by others.Much of the money to be made in this new world comes from the software needed to manage the more complex infrastructure. Yet the high ground of cloud management software only has room for a handful of players. Meanwhile, the profit margins in technology markets – in server, networking and storage hardware, and in the software on which these machines depend – face remorseless compression.VMware has recently shown signs of traction in the cloud management business and is expected next week to outline more details of its own new public cloud service.Like others facing up to the new realities of the cloud, however, it is very much a work in progress.Richard Waters is the Financial Times’ West Coast managing editorrichard.waters@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
204;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-08-13T01:13:28Z;Larry Ellison sees dismal prospects for Apple without Jobs;;"Count Larry Ellison among the Apple bears. The Oracle chief executive, who has described himself as one of Steve Jobs’ closest friends, told CBS News that the iPhone and iPad maker’s prospects are dim without its “brilliant” co-founder.Talking to Charlie Rose in an interview to be aired on Tuesday morning on the US broadcaster, Mr Ellison said that Jobs was “our Edison… our Picasso”. “He was an incredible inventor,” he said.Asked what would happen to Apple without Jobs, Mr Ellison said: “We already know. We conducted the experiment. It’s been done.”Apparently referring back to the time when Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, before returning when it hit dire financial straits in 1996, Mr Ellison used his finger to draw a stock-price chart rising and falling as he said: “We saw Apple with Steve Jobs. We saw Apple without Steve Jobs. We saw Apple with Steve Jobs. Now,” he continued as he drew the chart lower, “we’re going to see Apple without Steve Jobs.”Mr Ellison’s personal loyalty to Jobs, and the fact that he runs an enterprise IT business not a consumer electronics company, may lead some to question his views. But they are nonetheless timely, coming as Apple prepares to unveil its latest set of iPhones and iPads.The rumour mill is heating up, with AllThingsD reporting over the weekend that the new iPhone 5S, and most likely a cheaper, colourful “5C” variant, will be launched on September 10. Previous Apple timetables suggest that the smartphones will go on sale at the end of the following week, on Friday, September 20.That would allow a full week of sales before the end of Apple’s quarter and financial year on September 28, giving some in the market hope that the next results will be more exciting than last quarter’s humdrum performance; Apple closed 2.8 per cent higher at $467.36 on Monday evening.Also on Monday, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal both reported what many Apple watchers have expected for months: that the next 10-inch iPad will look a lot like its smaller sibling, with a similar screen, size and weight as the iPad mini. Bloomberg suggested that the iPad mini will also come with a high-resolution Retina Display when it is updated before Christmas.The device leaks follow a story on Fox Business News late last week that Apple’s board is concerned about the pace of innovation under current chief executive Tim Cook. The FT reported last month that the iWatch, expected to be Apple’s first foray into a brand new product category under Mr Cook, will not emerge from the Cupertino labs until next year."
205;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;SMEs to be given greater share of government IT contracts;;Big technology companies risk losing share of the £7bn market for government IT projects under a shake-up in Whitehall procurement to promote smaller rivals.The Cabinet Office wants to loosen the grip of an “oligopoly” of large suppliers, such as BT, Microsoft and HP, in a bid to save money and spur innovation.Fewer than 10 IT companies account for 70-80 per cent of all government business, with Capgemini, Fujitsu and Oracle also understood to be among them.Bill Crothers, the government’s chief procurement officer, said this “unhealthy” situation was shutting out some of the country’s most innovative companies because they could not afford to participate in long, expensive procurement processes.Under a new, speedier process, about 50 companies will be preselected to bid for work.The Office of Fair Trading recently said it was investigating whether “barriers to entry” were stifling competition in the market for IT services to the public sector.A government target that 25 per cent of central government business should be awarded to small and medium-sized enterprises by 2015 is far from being met, although direct spending with smaller companies grew from 6.5 per cent in 2009-10 to 10 per cent in 2011-12.Efforts to reduce reliance on a small number of big players were highlighted last month when it was announced that G4S and Serco, two of the biggest outsourcing groups, would not be awarded new work until existing contracts had been reviewed following allegations of overcharging for electronic tagging of criminals.While acknowledging “scepticism” among smaller suppliers about prospects of a bigger role, Mike Bracken, director of the Government Digital Service, pointed out that Britain had a particular strength in digital media and creative work.“Most of these companies just look at government and say the whole process of dealing with us is so difficult and time consuming and costly that we probably won’t bother.“And so our best, most innovative companies have . . . been excluded from a very large supply chain, and that’s crackers.”Mr Bracken said some large IT companies had built “outstanding track records” serving the government but warned that their business models must change.“We’re not against those companies in any way, but we will not be buying multimillion-pound proprietary, closed technology systems over several years from anyone.”John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the initiative but highlighted research showing that only about a fifth of businesses had bid for public sector contracts in the past year. “There is still more work for government to . . . get small businesses in the best position to bid for work.”
206;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-08-01T17:31:51Z;Tech M&A – technical difficulties;Groups must pursue deals and reward investor patience;Bloated technology mainstay X buys sexy, high-growth, no-profit upstart Y for an outrageous price. Latest example: Cisco Systems last week shelling out $2.7bn for security software maker Sourcefire. Cisco paid eight times Sourcefire’s forward revenue (no need to even broach profitability multiples). The deal is no different from others that the likes of Oracle, Microsoft and IBM have struck in recent years to buy their way into the latest mobile, cloud, virtualisation trend.A couple of billion is a trifle for these juggernauts. Yet shareholders are right to wonder: why is it not more valuable if mature market leaders instead just returned more cash to us? The correct response: do both. If the curse of being a tech giant is the constant threat of being disrupted, then the privilege is having the firepower to spend billions on M&A to remain relevant while rewarding shareholders for their patience.In the case of Sourcefire, Cisco’s logic is reasonable. Cisco has a strong network security business and Sourcefire can help it become the sector leader. It will be years before we know but in the meantime the deal’s near-term return on capital is dreadful (even if earnings will not drop much). For the rope to go after such value-crushing, if necessary, deals, Cisco owes its shareholders an olive branch. The good news: Cisco and its peers have, indeed, spent billions more on dividends and buybacks relative to M&A. However, cash balances are excessive and growing. And all have dividend yields below 3 per cent, so it is reasonable to return more cash.The Dell imbroglio is instructive. Its dissident shareholders smartly point out that the PC maker has spent $8bn so far to remake itself, but to little avail. Dell’s best course may be to turn to software. But the dissidents’ recapitalisation idea declares that Dell has enough cash flow and borrowing capacity to both invest and reward shareholders. With a fully-priced takeover offer on the table, the recap is wrong for Dell. But it remains a template for the other ageing tech giants.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
207;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-08-01T11:21:41Z;SEC investigates IBM’s cloud revenues;;IBM has admitted it is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over how it reports revenues from cloud computing.“In May 2013, IBM learned that the SEC is conducting an investigation into how IBM reports cloud revenue. IBM is co-operating with the SEC in this matter,” the world’s largest IT company by revenue said in its quarterly results filed with the regulator on Wednesday.An IBM spokesman said that the company’s reporting of cloud revenues had been “the result of a rigorous and disciplined process”, and that the information provided had been “consistently accurate”.Leading IT companies, including IBM, SAP and Oracle, are emphasising their growth in fast-expanding cloud services, which promise recurring subscription revenues and, some believe, lower costs.IBM does not break out its cloud revenue figures in its results, but said on its latest call with analysts that cloud services had grown 70 per cent year on year in the second quarter of 2013.Some observers have in the past criticised the vague numbers on cloud revenues given by tech companies.The company is aiming to generate $7bn in annual revenue from cloud services by the end of 2015, although it has said that only $3bn will constitute new revenue, as opposed to transfers from existing services.Last year IBM’s overall sales were $107bn.Accounting for IT revenues has long been controversial, with debate over how revenues should be categorised and when they should be recognised.Criminal investigations into how Autonomy, the Cambridge software company sold to HP for $11bn in 2011, accounted for its software revenues are under way in both the US and the UK. Autonomy’s former executives have denied wrongdoing.New accounting standards on revenue recognition – which PwC, IBM’s external auditor, has called “one of the most important and complex challenges facing companies today” – are also being debated.In a further indication of IBM’s interest in cloud, the company revealed that it had paid about $2bn in a deal completed last month to acquire Softlayer Technologies, which IBM called “the world’s largest privately held cloud computing infrastructure company”.
208;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-07-18T23:42:20Z;Tech sector: don’t jump to conclusions;Each group disappointed the market for its own reasons;If big tech is a bellwether than we are in store for a rocky remainder of 2013. That’s what the latest quarterly earnings from the titans Google, Microsoft, Ebay, Yahoo, Intel, Microsoft, SAP, IBM and Oracle show. Yet each disappointed the market for its own reasons – secular shifts, weakening end markets, unrealistic expectations – so do not look for a single unified theme either for tech or the broader market just yet.Intel and Microsoft are being ravaged by their well-documented exposure to PCs. At Intel, PC chip revenue was down 8 per cent and Microsoft’s Windows division saw its revenue fall 6 per cent when excluding deferred revenue. The enterprise software vendors SAP, IBM and Oracle should seemingly be more secure given that they are embedded in corporate data centres. But, with their girth (each has annual sales of more than $20bn) along with upstarts that rent cheaper software to customers, it is difficult to see how these veterans can achieve meaningful growth. IBM’s shares rallied this week simply because it raised profit guidance by 1 per cent.And what about the internet coterie of eBay, Yahoo and Google? Ebay’s done a fine job of transforming into a diversified retailer but it is looking abroad for growth and with economic weakness in Europe and Asia, it had to lower its outlook for the rest of the year. Yahoo’s shares keep rallying despite persistently declining ad revenue. This is what happens when one is prescient enough to invest $1bn in a Chinese e-commerce company potentially worth $100bn. And Google? Its shares have dipped 5 per cent when it had the temerity to increase revenue at a modest 19 per cent. Reflect on that. A $300bn company growing at nearly 20 per cent. A reminder why Google must not be lumped with these relative slowcoaches.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
209;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;US corporate borrowers return to market;Big companies break dry spell in new dollar-debt issues;Large US corporate borrowers are coming back to the debt capital markets, taking advantage of a pause in a sell-off in bond prices, which has pushed benchmark interest rates to multiyear highs.Companies including General Electric Capital Corp, Oracle, Allegheny Technologies and Realty Income broke a dry spell in new dollar-debt issuance and together sold more than $9bn in bonds this week, according to Standard & Poor’s LCD.The burst of activity follows a collapse in issuance at the start of the third quarter as record outflows from funds investing in fixed income assets spooked borrowers.However, the better tone in the US Treasury markets in the past couple of days, which saw the yield on the 10-year note ease 12 basis points, encouraged borrowers to test investors’ demand for new securities.Companies also rushed to raise funds ahead of the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June meeting, and a speech by chairman Ben Bernanke on the US economy later on Wednesday.Analysts said the return of large, high-grade borrowers may pave the way for more bond offerings in coming days and push this week’s total sales of investment grade debt to $15bn. Electric utility Southern Power and Canada’s Bank of Nova Scotia were expected to sell debt by the end of the session.“These companies are trying to beat any potential spike in volatility,” said Adrian Miller, director for fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.“The backlog of new sales was piling up, Treasury yields eased a bit and these are mostly high-grade, high-quality names,” he said. “They jumped at the opportunity.”While most of the new securities sold this week rose in secondary markets, borrowers had to pay significant new-issue concessions and higher absolute costs than in previous offerings, according to S&P LCD data.Sales of junk-rated debt remain scant, with only one offering by action-brands company Quicksilver, being announced so far this week.“Large, high-grade names with offerings that include floating-rate tranches, won’t have much difficulty in finding buyers,” said Mr Miller. “But the situation in the high-yield market is still a bit more complicated.”Since the start of May, when Mr Bernanke said a stronger economy may prompt fewer bond purchases, Treasury yields have risen from 1.68 per cent to a peak above 2.75 per cent on Monday.The move in corporate bonds was also sharp. Average yields on investment grade US debt rose nearly 70 basis points to 3.42 per cent this week as sales of new securities dwindled. Junk-bond yields surged more than 2 percentage points to stand at 6.6 per cent on Wednesday, according to Barclays indices.
210;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-07-08T11:51:32Z;Italians refuse to sail in opening race of America’s Cup regatta;;The 34th America’s Cup challenger series started bizarrely in San Francisco on Sunday with one team racing itself in the first race as Italy’s Luna Rossa sat it out in protest at a rule change it claims puts it at a disadvantage.Emirates Team New Zealand sailed the course alone to win the first of several Louis Vuitton Cup matches. The winner of this three-team Louis Vuitton Cup challengers’ series will take on Larry Ellison’s Oracle Team USA for the America’s Cup in September.Luna Rossa’s failure to turn up for the midday race was another disappointment for fans and organisers of a “summer of racing”, in a controversial sailing of the regatta in AC72 wing-sailed catamarans dictated by the American defenders.With the cost of the AC72s pushing the outlay for fielding a team beyond the £100m mark, the number of teams involved has plummeted to just four from the 12 originally expected by the defenders and organisers.Luna Rossa, backed by Prada chief executive and team principal Patrizio Bertelli, and the New Zealanders are contesting boat design changes imposed by organisers after the death in May of British Olympian Andrew Simpson. An international jury is considering the arguments but a formal hearing was not expected until Monday.Dean Barker, New Zealand skipper, said after Sunday’s “race” that he was disappointed with the Italian refusal to sail while Luna Rossa skipper Max Sirena said taking part in the opening race would have signalled approval of the rule change.Crowds were thin when the New Zealand yacht completed the course alone, skimming the water on its hydrofoils at speeds that touched 42.8 knots, or 49mph (79kph).Mr Ellison had hoped to attract far more teams to the 162-year-old contest and build a larger TV audience with racing close to shore and enhanced TV coverage while pushing boat design to extremes.Sweden’s team Artemis is still struggling to get a second AC72 ready to enter the contest later in the summer but said on Friday it may be forced to leave the field if the rule changes are rolled back.The Italians and New Zealanders have refused to accept rule changes relating to the rudder elevators, the wing devices attached to the rudders at the stern of each hull. They are challenging race director Iain Murray’s authority to change these rules.
211;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-07-02T18:08:38Z;SAP / Oracle: cloud chasing;SAP can only interpret Oracle’s latest dig as flattery;"Two things you can count on from an Oracle earnings release these days: weak software revenue growth and a potshot at a rival. Oracle’s first-quarter release did not disappoint. Software licenses grew by just 1 per cent but, hardly chastened, Oracle said its cloud revenue for the year, projected to be $1bn, would exceed that of the upstart Workday and nemesis SAP combined. But, with SAP’s shares beating Oracle’s of late – since 2012, SAP’s shares are up 32 per cent, twice Oracle’s increase – SAP can only interpret Oracle’s teasing as flattery.In the most recent quarter, SAP delivered total software revenue growth of 23 per cent, with its cloud segment increasing revenue by nearly 500 per cent. But beyond the numbers, SAP has generated buzz around the hottest software trends. Its “in-memory” HANA database analytics platform is the fastest growing software product in history, SAP brags, while the $7bn Sybase acquisition moves the German company into mobile software.SAP does seem to be outrunning its rival; that does not mean it is going particularly fast. SAP says that 2013 revenue from HANA will be €700m, up 70 per cent annually, and total cloud subscription revenue will double to €750m. Total software revenue, though, is approaching €5bn, which means that its old-fashioned software license business is growing in the mid-single digits at best. And the €1bn cloud revenue in 2013 and €2bn expected by 2015 comes from pricey acquisitions – Ariba and SuccessFactors together cost $8bn. Oracle spent just $4bn on cloud-related acquisitions for at least the same amount of revenue. Ironically, then, the valuation gap between the two (SAP’s forward earnings multiple is 16 to Oracle’s 12) may come down to hardware. Oracle’s $8bn millstone, Sun Microsystems, has brought persistent double-digit revenue declines.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
212;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Smoke on San Francisco water for America’s Cup;;For decades, an almost mystical allure has attracted buccaneering billionaires, boat designers and leading sailors eager to contest one of the world’s most prestigious races.But when the battle for the 34th America’s Cup kicks off in San Francisco next week, just four boats will be competing, amid a storm of concerns about safety, cost and spying in what has traditionally been seen as the most august of gentlemans’ sports.Three teams will race largely untested, state-of-the-art wing-sailed 72ft catamarans during the summer to decide who should challenge 2010 winner Oracle Racing for the trophy in September.Normally, the 162-year-old event is held too far out to sea for onshore spectators to see much, but this year’s compact course puts the action inside the Golden Gate Bridge, between Alcatraz and the waterfront of Fishermans’ Wharf, with the promise of strong winds and challenging conditions.Hopes were high for millions of visitors to the city and an increased television audience. “It’s one of the best – if not the best – sailing amphitheatres in the world. Not only is it beautiful, it is reliably windy,” Tom Ehman, the America’s Cup authority spokesman, told Reuters.But while a field of about 10 could have been expected for a cup series, the high costs involved – about £100m a boat – have deterred teams from entering this year. Just four boats will compete.The tragic death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson last month, when his catamaran capsized, has heightened concerns about safety and stability. There will be just five 20-minute races, instead of 21. As a result, organisers have had to refund some spectators.Artemis Racing, the team that Simpson was training with and led by Iain Percy, will enter the race at a later stage. Grant Dalton, head of Emirates Team New Zealand, has accused Artemis Racing of using the fatal accident to its competitive advantage. They can get away with it, he told the New Zealand Herald, because so few teams are competing. Italy’s Luna Rossa is the third challenger.Artemis chief executive Paul Cayard described Dalton’s remarks as “public insults which are out of line and unsportsmanlike”.In the wake of the accident, regatta organisers want larger, heavier rudder elevators to prevent boats from capsizing, but some of the competing teams say the smaller ones are more competitive. This decision faces a possible legal challenge.It’s one of the best – if not the best – sailing amphitheatres in the world. Not only is it beautiful, it is reliably windyThe Artemis accident was not the first in the campaign build-up. In October, Oracle’s boat capsized and was swept under the Golden Gate Bridge. The waves smashed the 131ft mainsail, which looks and performs like an aircraft wing. The syndicate had to wait for four months until a new wing sail arrived from Auckland, New Zealand. This accident alone caused £8m worth of damage.The use of a largely untested boat has also added to safety concerns. The twin hull AC72 was introduced by Oracle, the 2010 winner, and will be used by all competitors. Its 40m wing-sail and hydrofoils force the hulls out of the water, allowing it to plane at extremely high speeds of up to 40 knots. A better racing range is five to 30 knots, so that competition can go ahead in most wind conditionsThe design highlights how the race has evolved into an ultra high-tech, high-cost sport. Mono-hull boats were the standard craft for more than 100 years until American Dennis Conner introduced a catamaran in 1988. The multihulls resurfaced in 2010 when the Swiss defenders Alinghi built a 90ft catamaran, but it was outclassed by Oracle’s rigid-wing trimaran.The search for advantage by any means necessary is not unique to recent races, nor are angry exchanges between rivals. In 1895 Lord Dunraven lost his honorary membership of the New York Yacht Club after accusing its team of cheating by moving ballast into the middle of its hull under cover of darkness.Challenging times are prompting innovation in the yachting worldIn 1986, Dennis Conner, who won the cup four times and lost it twice, accused New Zealand of cheating when it built its 12m boat of fibreglass instead of aluminium.More recently, Oracle software billionaire Larry Ellison accused Swiss pharmaceuticals billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli of imposing rules designed to give the Swiss team an advantage. And Mr Ellison’s son David has produced a documentary The Wind Gods, narrated by British actor Jeremy Irons, in which Berteralli is portrayed as a born wealthy individual ruthlessly trying to beat fair-minded self-made Ellison.So great is the desire to win that some competing teams resort to espionage. In November, New Zealand tested a new foil while an Oracle spy boat lurked near Auckland dock.

Modern analytic techniques, including examinations of “big data” – the mass of information generated by all kinds of commercial and other activities – expand this concept by asking questions of both internal and external information almost as soon as, and in some cases even while, it is being generated.Companies are using these tools to improve business efficiency, spot trends and opportunities, provide customers with more relevant products and services and, increasingly, to predict how people, or machines, will behave in the future.For example, General Electric’s customers are using its Proficy Monitoring & Analysis Suite, an integrated set of software for industrial data management and analytics, to monitor equipment and process data to improve performance.GE’s Proficy Historian HD, one of the six software modules in the suite, lets companies store very large data sets in a Hadoop cluster (many machines running open-source software Hadoop that can handle massive amounts of unstructured data) and then run advanced analytics on huge amounts of data to improve performance, troubleshoot problems, and predict and prevent failures in machines such as turbines or jet engines.“We use the software ourselves in our own monitoring and diagnostics centres to manage trillions of dollars in asset value,” said Brian Courtney, general manager of GE Intelligent Platforms’ Industrial Data Intelligence Software group.The market for business intelligence, corporate performance management and analytics applications and performance management software – much of it provided by the “big five” of SAP, Oracle, IBM, SAS and Microsoft – has grown rapidly. Spending totalled $12.3bn in 2011 and grew about 7 per cent last year, according to research company Gartner.Many companies use business intelligence software to provide their senior executives, sales staff and other managers with access to key performance indicators such as costs, sales and margins.Among the leading trends in the market for business intelligence software is the increasing call for screen-based visualisation tools, such as dashboards, to make financial and other data more accessible to executives on the road via smartphones and tablets.“We saw a new way to engage with people and democratise data,” says Quinton Alsbury, founder of Roambi, which provides mobile business intelligence visualisation software for iPhones and iPads.Pret A Manger, the sandwich retailer, uses Roambi in the UK to augment its traditional business intelligence software and has provided 70 field and regional managers with iPads. Staff can carry out stock takes while they are on the move instead of leafing through a 200-page paper file, or they can monitor kitchen production while standing on the shop floor.Similarly, SiSense’s Prism 10X software is designed for companies that have outgrown Microsoft Excel and need an integrated analytics suite capable of handling huge volumes of data without having to rely on the IT department for assistance.Perhaps the most dramatic trend has been the move from data mining and warehousing – the use of powerful software to interrogate stored information – towards big data. “The origins of data warehousing lay in data sets which, at that time, were immediately relevant to business problems,” says Duncan Ross, director of data science at analytics provider Teradata.“Specifically, this comprised data that could be put into tables of rows and columns and linked in a relational form.” By its nature, this limited the types of data being stored mostly to highly structured forms.While they are still a part of big data analytics, much of the information being tapped is unstructured. This may include data from social media, about weather, geography, mobility, from sensors and many other data sets that can enhance understanding.Using Facebook data, Japanese online and catalogue retailer Nissen was able to glean detailed insights into customer likes, dislikes and buying motivations. Teradata’s Mr Ross says: “By linking this external data with its established internal data, [companies] are effectively broadening their window on the wider world.“Each time more data are added, this window grows larger, affording the business a clearer view of the market.“This allows them to test ideas and make better decisions and predictions. Crucially, it can also enable them to break away from small, incremental improvements towards innovations that will transform their business.”For companies and other organisations at the cutting edge of big data analytics, the main goal is to be able to use the intelligence gleaned from analysing large volumes of information to predict and anticipate future trends.Leading US banks such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America, consumer goods companies such as Coca-Cola and 3M, and retailers including Walmart are all using big data analytics to improve the running of their business models and to anticipate changes in demand before they actually occur.Scott Schlesinger, senior vice-president and head of business information management for the technology consultancy Capgemini in North America, says: “Predictive analytics can turn poor business decisions, made using haphazard guesswork, into well thought out and successful business decisions that improve performance.”He also warns that to use predictive analytics tools well, an organisation must first know what information it needs, and devise “a proper information and business process strategy that drives and [delivers] efficiencies across the organisation”.Eddie Short, head of data and analytics at management consultancy KPMG, sounds a similar cautionary note. “Three years ago, some commentators suggested that data would become the new currency of business, almost on a par with capital and labour,” he says.“Since then, information has clearly moved to the core of most organisations’ operations, but questions remain about how to extract real value because the journey from traditional business analytics to [data becoming a] business enabler requires organisations to fundamentally rethink how they collect, analyse, distribute and monitor data,” Mr Short adds.“In my view, three years from now it will be the businesses that have answered these questions by combining their hunger for data with an appetite to match it with the needs of their businesses that will win the day and become masters of their own data.”
214;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-06-23T14:57:27Z;Oracle moves to embrace cloud upheaval;;Oracle will this week lay out plans to move deeper into the cloud-computing market, as Wall Street worries that the US software company’s traditional business is being disrupted by a technology transition that is bringing a new wave of start-ups to the fore.The announcements are set to include partnerships with Microsoft and Salesforce.com, two of Oracle’s biggest rivals, in a sign of how extensively the upheaval caused by the move to cloud computing is changing the tech landscape.Oracle’s stock price fell more than 9 per cent on Friday after it revealed that growth in its sales of new software licences had all but stalled. Claims by Oracle executives that macroeconomic issues had caused the shortfall were widely dismissed, even by analysts who retain positive forecasts for the company.“Oracle has a growth problem with its core licence business” as the technology market moves to new suppliers of cloud technologies, Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura who rates the company a “buy”, wrote in a report to investors.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive officer, promised news this week of what he said would be a “startling” series of partnerships, including those with Salesforce and Microsoft, to put Oracle technology at the heart of their own cloud operations.Mr Ellison claimed that Oracle was already second only to Salesforce in the market for cloud-based applications. However, he said that a more important feature of the cloud business for his company would involve selling a new version of its database software to act as the platform for other companies that sold cloud applications or infrastructure.Some analysts questioned whether Oracle would be able to rekindle its slumping growth by moving into these newer markets, since this would mean abandoning the high upfront revenues from traditional sales of software that customers run on their own computers in favour of the lower prices and drawn-out subscriptions of selling a service over the internet.“There are equivalent or better technologies out there at much lower price points,” said Peter Goldmacher, an analyst at Cowen in San Francisco. As a result, Oracle is facing one of the inevitable transitions in the tech world “where the young disrupt the old,” he said.The outspoken Mr Ellison has claimed in the past that the rise of cloud computing, which involves the centralisation of computing functions, does not represent anything new for the tech world. By last week, however, with his company announcing disappointing earnings, the rhetoric had changed completely and Oracle executives were at pains to stress the headway their company had made in the cloud market.Commenting on the deals that he hopes will show that Oracle is repositioning its business, Mr Ellison said: “These partnerships in the cloud …will reshape the cloud and reshape the perception of Oracle technology in the cloud.”
215;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle: enjoy old age;There comes a time when you have to accept you are no longer a growth stock;Listen, Oracle, it’s not as if we’re not in awe of what you’ve done. You’re a legend. We’ve all got Oracle stories. Heck, half the guys who run tech companies now grew up watching you whip the competition quarter after quarter. But there comes a time when you just have to accept are not a growth stock any more. Calm down, I hear what you are saying. You are a cloud software company now – you invented the cloud, for goodness sake. Your cloud products are growing at 50 per cent and produce $1bn a year in revenue. Those integrated hardware/software products are growing at 45 per cent.We love that stuff – we really do. But please, be realistic. The cloud is all of 3 per cent of sales. Your hardware business is still shrinking fast, OK? It is time to take a hard look at yourself. Revenue growth has averaged 1 per cent over the past seven quarters. Your forward price/earnings ratio has not broken 13 times in a year and half. You have missed expectations on the top or bottom lines three times in the last year or two. Thursday’s miss had your stock down 8 per cent. You’re a value stock now, old buddy. Set expectations low and beat them.Moving to the New York Stock Exchange is perfect for you. That’s where you legends belong. It’s like the Senior Tour. And it’s great that you are doubling your dividend – but it will still leave you with a yield of just 1.6 per cent. At your age? With your cash flows? It’s time to think about 3 per cent at least. That’s a better idea than your big buyback plan. Look at the how much good $100bn of buybacks over 10 years have done Microsoft. You want to trade like a young man again? Those little growth businesses are never going to move your valuation up. That’s not how it works – unless you’re prepared to resort to surgery. But you’re not ready for a break-up. Better to enjoy your old age. You’ve earned it.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
216;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle disappoints on software sales;;Oracle disappointed Wall Street with weak revenue growth for the second quarter in a row on Thursday, as the US business software maker registered an increase of only 1 per cent in a key measure of new software sales.Larry Ellison, chief executive, blamed economic weakness in parts of Asia and Brazil and claimed the shortfall had not been caused by competitive weaknesses in any of Oracle’s products.The company’s executives also sought to counter concerns among some investors that Oracle has been losing out to fast-growing competitors that sell “cloud” software, arguing that it was second only to Salesforce.com and that most of the new 500 salespeople hired in recent months were focused on this area.However, the reassurances failed to prevent an 8 per cent decline in the company’s shares in after-market trading in New York as Wall Street worried that Oracle would continue to face slowing growth in the absence of big acquisitions and with growing competition from cloud start-ups.The lacklustre revenue picture came in the company’s important fourth fiscal quarter, which typically brings in around 40 per cent of its total new licence revenues for the year.The stock price fall came despite an announcement that Oracle’s board had doubled the quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share, lifting the dividend yield to 1.45 per cent, and authorised $12bn in additional share buybacks. Oracle also said it was moving its stock listing from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange.Wall Street had been anticipating a bounceback in Oracle’s latest quarter after it registered a surprising decline of 2 per cent in new software licence sales in the three months to the end of February. Though only accounting for about a quarter of total revenues in that quarter, new licence sales are an indicator of the strength of new business the company is attracting and a guide to future maintenance and support revenues.In the fourth quarter ending in May, Wall Street had been expecting new licence growth of 5 per cent, to about $4.2bn, compared to the $4bn the company reported.Oracle president Safra Catz called the sales shortfall “extremely disappointing” and said it had been caused by a 7 per cent decline in Asia and the Pacific region. Overall, Oracle reported revenues of $10.95bn, unchanged from a year before and below a consensus analyst forecast of $11.1bn. On a pro-forma basis, net income fell 1 per cent to $4.1bn, or 87 cents a share, in line with expectations.
217;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-06-05T20:28:35Z;Salesforce’s revenue rain from marketing cloud;;Salesforce.com shares were back in positive territory on Wednesday – closing up 0.5 per cent at $37.95 – after an 8 per cent fall the previous day caused by its decision to spend $2.5bn on its biggest acquistion to date – ExactTarget.Salesforce, whose CRM ticker name is an acronym for its business – customer relationship management, came to the market nine years ago as the leading exponent of a new way of working. Companies would subscribe to its online service through the internet cloud rather than run traditional software on their local machines.Anyone who invested in Salesforce in June 2004 will have few concerns about Tuesday’s fall, with the shares still at more than three times its $11 IPO price.Businesses quickly took to the idea of software-as-a-service and revenues boomed, rising from less than $100m in its 2004 fiscal year to an expected $4bn for the 2014 year.Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive, has moved the company beyond helping salespeople follow up leads online, making Salesforce a platform for other services and adding social elements such as the Skype-like Chatter service.His latest buy will help Salesforce compete in another area: “ExactTarget gives Salesforce almost immediate leadership within the e-mail marketing arena as well as strong footholds within growing segments including marketing automation and mobile marketing,” said Stifel Nicolaus analysts in a note on Wednesday.Mr Benioff says the marketing cloud is a $100m business that could become a $1bn business and few will doubt his assessment based on the former Oracle executive’s ability to grow Salesforce’s revenues exponentially to date.
218;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-05-27T15:41:27Z;Technology executives could be the next public enemies;Like big banks, technology companies are protected by a bubble of their own making;"About a year ago I was in San Francisco’s Pacific Heights, gazing down at the Golden Gate Bridge from one of Larry Ellison’s many spectacular homes. The Oracle chief executive wasn’t there – he had lent the house out for a reception. In any case, he would be the last person to apologise for enjoying the fruits of his success. But the view from technology executives’ balconies is getting stormier. After banks and bankers, could they be next to feel the sting of a populist backlash?It sounds unlikely. For the tablet-toting, smartphone-stroking, Amazon-and-Googling masses – you and me, in other words – to attack companies that provide the products and services we love would be a case of biting the data feed they hand us.But consider these rumbles: politicians on both sides of the Atlantic attack Apple, Google and Amazon for their tax arrangements; commentators take Silicon Valley’s wealthy to task for the growing economic inequality in northern California; activists worry about ill-protected privacy, dirt-cheap labour and energy-inefficient server farms; antitrust regulators circle closer.Like banking, technology is ubiquitous and its benefits often taken for granted. Executives and engineers are highly paid and unafraid to reinvest their wealth in real estate, cars and luxury goods. Forget Wall Street – “after decades in which [the US] has become less and less equal, Silicon Valley is one of the most unequal places in America”, wrote George Packer in a withering recent analysis in The New Yorker. Like big banks, tech companies are protected by a bubble of their own making – literally in the case of Amazon, which is planning a trio of biospheres for its new Seattle headquarters – and their representatives often exude a sense of entitlement and an overconfidence that technology can solve the world’s problems.Technology companies do have some clear advantages over banks. They start with what Laurence Evans, who oversees Edelman’s annual Global Trust Barometer, calls a brand “halo”. Technology regularly tops the list of the most trusted industries and has done since the survey started 13 years ago. Even before the financial crisis, banks never rose above the middle of the ranking. Users have an intimate involvement with their iPhones and Samsung Galaxys they will never have with their current accounts or mutual funds. Crucially, technology companies do not stand accused of bringing down the global economy.One Silicon Valley entrepreneur I contacted last week said it was “a stretch” even to imagine a backlash. I’m not so sure. Technology executives could shrug off the first gentle jabs at their superiority, as financiers did in the years before the credit crunch bit in 2007-08. But they would do better to act now.Instead of doing as the banks did – closing ranks and deploying battalions of lobbyists to crush dissent – their first priority should be to ensure their products continue to serve customers’ needs. The challenge from new competitors and innovations is a big incentive for technology companies, unlike the banking oligopolies, to go on improving. But still, the temptation to take users for granted, or exploit them – say, for their personal information – is high.So they must also share their wealth and react early to any perception of excess. Some founder-billionaires, having sweated to build a technology business, may justifiably claim they have no obligation to direct their earnings to good causes. (Others, such as Mr Ellison himself, have made pledges to give away much of their wealth to charity.) But the populist wave of anger at banks and bankers was, and is, fuelled in part by envy. It makes sense not to aggravate that.Technology executives should keep listening, and keep talking. Tim Cook may not have satisfied critics when he was grilled by the US Congress last week about Apple’s tax affairs but he was a model of calm and reasonableness.Finally, stay clean. The risk is that technology titans’ undoubted success will breed complacency, which begets arrogance, and can lead to actual wrongdoing. Big Tech has huge advantages over High Finance when it comes to defending its reputation. So its leaders should adopt a new slogan, borrowed from Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer’s declaration to fans of Tumblr, the blogging platform her company has just bought: “We promise not to screw it up.”andrew.hill@ft.com"
219;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Google chief touts utopian ambitions;Tech vision where ‘being negative is not how we make progress’;Google I/O is the search company’s annual opportunity to flaunt its scale and ambitions.While last year its sci-fi headset Google Glass took centre stage at the San Francisco event, this year’s attempt to bring forward the future included a voice-activated search engine that can understand pronouns and other nuances of natural human speech.Alongside an array of improvements to its media store, social network and maps, Google executives showcased new search tools that aim to “answer, converse and anticipate” their users’ needs.“The perfect search engine is the Star Trek computer,” said Larry Page, Google’s chief executive, who answered questions from the audience for half an hour, despite detailing problems with his vocal cords earlier this week.The voice-search service looks like a bid to leap further ahead of Apple’s virtual assistant, Siri. But Mr Page said he didn’t see Google’s innovations in quite such competitive terms, espousing a vision for a more co-operative technology industry.“In every story I read about Google, it’s about us versus some other company or some stupid thing,” he said. “I don’t find that very interesting. We should be building great things that don’t exist. Being negative is not how we make progress.”Alongside other problems he sees as holding back innovation, such as the tech industry’s gender imbalance and the need for more science and engineering graduates, Mr Page criticised the likes of Microsoft and Oracle for putting financial gain ahead of what he styled as Google’s more utopian ambitions.“We need inter-operation [things working with each other], not people milking off one company for their own benefit,” he said in response to a question about web standards. “We certainly struggle with people like Microsoft.”But Mr Page raised eyebrows when answering a question about how to overcome this “negativity”.“There are many exciting things you can’t do because they are illegal and not allowed by regulation,” he said. “That makes sense – we don’t want the world to change too fast.”Technologists should have some safe places where we can try out some new things and figure out the effect on society and people without having to deploy it on the whole worldNonetheless, Mr Page said he wished there was a “small part of the world” where such laws did not apply, akin to the anarchic Burning Man festival, held in the Nevada desert every August.“Technologists should have some safe places where we can try out some new things and figure out the effect on society and people without having to deploy it on the whole world,” he said, citing the limited progress of Google Health as an area where regulations constrained his ambitions.“In my long-term world view, hopefully our software understands deeply what you are knowledgeable about and what you’re not, and how to organise the world so the world can solve important problems,” he said. “People are starving in the world because we are not organised enough to solve that problem.”For now, however, Google is focusing its engineers on more quotidian challenges. One new feature of Google+ helps people to organise their digital photos, for instance by scanning for the faces of a user’s family members and automatically prioritising them in an album.Although Mr Page might not like the competitive comparison, Apple and Facebook rolled out similar face-recognition technology almost two years ago.
220;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;America’s Cup to proceed despite sailor’s death;;The America’s Cup organisers have confirmed that the yacht race will go ahead this year despite the death of British sailor Andrew Simpson when the Swedish entry Artemis capsized last week while training in San Francisco Bay.Preparations will continue while officials and followers of the oldest competition in international sport that is still contested await the findings of a committee reviewing the competition and inquiries by the police, coastguard and race authorities. The independent safety review will run alongside the police inquiry.Tom Ehman, vice-commodore of Golden Gate Yacht Club that backs defending US champion Oracle, said all four teams were continuing with plans for the regatta, scheduled to start with the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series from July 4 to August 30. They are expected to resume training on Thursday.Iain Murray, the regatta director who will lead the review into the death of the 36-year-old Olympian, defended the superfast AC72 boats. “They have exceeded all expectations,” he said, insisting that they “can certainly sail in those conditions” on the choppy seas of San Francisco Bay. “We can manage the expectations . . . and look at all times at the safety of the crew.”The Artemis accident was the second involving the AC72 (22-metre) boats being trialled and tested for the cup that can reach 40 knots (46mp/h, 78km/h). In October, Oracle’s 11-man crew escaped injury after a wing sail collapsed in the bay, causing an estimated $8m damage. Many observers have suggested the AC72s are overpowered and uncontrollable in certain conditions.The teams contesting to challenge Oracle are Artemis, Italy’s Luna Rossa challenge and Emirates Team New Zealand. The America’s Cup starts on September 7.“If Artemis or any team at any time withdraw we’ll have to reassess and reorganise,” Mr Murray said.The event was reshaped to appeal to a mass television audience after Larry Ellison, American software billionaire, won the right to host this year’s cup by defeating Ernesto Berterelli’s Alinghi catamaran off Valencia in 2010 in a 90ft trimaran with a 223ft wing-sail.The six-strong committee reviewing the accident is an independent body, working for the regatta’s race management, which was established by the competitors.In addition to Mr Murray, it includes Sally Lindsay Honey, twice Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year who led a review last year into the deaths of five sailors in the boat Low Speed Chase in the Full Crew Farallones Race off San Francisco. She is the wife of Stan Honey, the cup’s technology director. Also on the review panel are John Craig (US), Chuck Hawley (US), Vincent Lauriot-Prévost (France) and Jim Farmer QC (New Zealand).Captain Matt Bliven, US coast guard, whose authority must issue a permit for the event, said: “Regardless of whether the incident happened last week or not, we’d still be evaluating the process.”Lieutenant Jon Lane, from the service, who has 10 years experience as a marine casualty investigator, will liaise with the panel.
221;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-05-14T23:08:55Z;US earnings: irrational dreariness;A look at the fundamentals of individual stocks makes rally seem indiscriminate;First-quarter reporting season is nearly past and, for US companies, it can be summed up thus: more of the same, only drearier. Sales growth for companies in the S&P 500 will come in a bit shy of 1.5 per cent, according to S&P Capital IQ – even lower than the draggy average rate for the previous four quarters, 3.8 per cent. Well-managed, bellwether companies missed sales expectations: ExxonMobil, IBM, Oracle, Caterpillar, Pfizer and so on. Companies are still squeezing out operating leverage, and earnings growth in the first quarter was about 7 per cent – better than the previous few quarters but hardly strong.Analysts, accordingly, are cutting 2013 targets. Yes, estimates for the fourth quarter of 2013 and for 2014 remain cheery. But who cares? On Wall Street, the claim that things are going to be better in six months is as obligatory and as well grounded as the “good” in “good morning”.Yet the market churns higher. The cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is above 23, against its historical average of 16 and right at its 1901 and 1966 peaks (next and final stops: 1929, then 2000). The combination of wobbly fundamentals and zippy prices has murdered short sellers. If one had bought the 30 most shorted stocks in the S&P 500 at the start of the year, as measured by the proportion of total shares shorted, one would be up 28 per cent, 11 percentage points ahead of the index itself. Much of the outperformance has come from volatile and financially unsteady companies such as First Solar, Netflix, AMD and Best Buy.This rally has been described as defensive, because sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples have done well. Loose monetary policy and low interest rates are often cited as the key support. Reassuring thoughts, but be careful not to zoom in. Looking at the fundamentals of individual stocks makes the run-up seem indiscriminate and irrational.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
222;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-05-12T21:25:20Z;Book review: ‘Focus’;A positive or negative world view can shape reality, a new book argues. Emma Jacobs reviews ‘Focus’, by Heidi Grant Halvorson and Tory Higgins;"Focus: Use Different Ways of Seeing the World to Power Success and Influence, by Heidi Grant Halvorson and Tory Higgins, Hudson Street, RRP£17Focus will help you sell a pension, manage your employees, raise your child­ren and get a second date. If that does not go so well, it will also show you how to dump a suitor.Uncovering how people focus is the secret. The book, written by Heidi Grant Halvorson and Tory Higgins from Columbia Business School’s Motivation Science Center, draws on social psychology and explores how to identify, change and use focus to get the desired results.Motivation, they write, has two forms: focus on promotion or on prevention. People can either be “focused on what they already have, or on getting even more. Promotion focus is about maximising gains and avoiding missed opportunities. Prevention focus is about minimising losses, to keep things working.”To illustrate these divergent motivations the authors describe two people who embody the characteristics. Sceptical and cautious, Jon is determined not to make mistakes. Immaculately dressed, he speaks with precision and his work is flawless. Jon is focused on prevention. Meticulous in his projects, he is the person you go to if you want a piece of research. Before marrying his wife, he was single for a decade.On the other hand is creative, innovative Ray. Before he met his wife, he would fall in love every two months – the same time it took him to do his laundry. Promotion-focused, he is relentlessly cheery. If Jon sees his glass as half-empty, Ray’s is spilling all over his shirt.Some cultures, the authors say, have a bias towards being more focused on promotion or prevention. Americans are more promotion-minded: they idolise innovators such as Steve Jobs, the late founder of Apple, and rule-breakers such as the environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich. On the other hand, east Asian cultures place more importance on prevention. “These are the cultures that gave us Confucius, who praised family loyalty and respect for elders, self-sacrificing Kamikaze pilots and demanding Tiger Moms.”They even divide bosses into two groups, where Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle (“When you innovate, you’ve got to be prepared for everyone telling you you’re nuts”) is focused on promotion, and Andrew Grove, former Intel chief executive (“Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive”) is obviously on the side of prevention. The authors argue that viewing prospective employees through the prism of prevention/promotion is better than the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, because that analysis does not predict performance.Once you understand that the world is divided into prevention and promotion, argue the authors, you know how to become an effective influencer. Understanding an audience’s motivation helps advertisers, companies and public bodies to target their message. Promotion-minded people love to try new restaurants or new iPhones, paint their homes in new colours; prevention-minded people prefer to stay with what they know.The key, however, is to frame products and messages in a way that fits with consumers’ outlook. For example, by selling a food supplement in a positive way (“Enjoy life! Supranox helps you do that”) or a negative way (“Don’t miss out on enjoying life! Let Supranox be a part of your daily routine”) will appeal to different segments of the population.It is a persuasive argument, punchily written with lots of case studies. However, this book will either appeal or repulse depending on one thing: whether you are someone who believes you can divide the population into two types.On this I have to declare a bias: I don’t."
223;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-05-08T18:46:39Z;Inside Business: cloud hangs over old guard of business software;Future structure of market could hit established players;"How profoundly will the new computing platform loosely known as “the cloud” disrupt the business software empires of companies like SAP and Oracle?SAP went on the offensive this week, with the news that it would start running software for its customers in its own data centres. Hasso Plattner, SAP’s chairman and the man with the best claim to the title of Europe’s software visionary, called it the biggest thing from the German company since its flagship business applications software put it on the map 20 years ago.If SAP is right in thinking that companies are ready to move wholesale to new services such as this, the switch could be very big indeed.One customer, Coca-Cola, has more in-house computing resources at its disposal than Saleseforce.com, the biggest of the pure “cloud” players, according to SAP executives.Moving faster than its main rivals might make it look as if SAP is staying one step ahead. But the future structure of the cloud computing market could threaten the old guard of business software.The danger for the likes of SAP is that the market will split. On one side, this would leave a small number of large-scale cloud platform players – companies like Amazon and Microsoft that run the computing infrastructure on which the new cloud-delivered applications depend.On the other side, riding on these platforms, a wave of new cloud application companies is working hard to infiltrate through the cracks left by the monolithic software suites of companies such as SAP.The trick for these new companies has been to find a way to appeal to end users directly, rather than the IT specialists or business managers who have made corporate technology decisions in the past.Michael Crandell, chief executive of software start-up RightScale, describes this as “rogue IT” – or the even less wholesome-sounding “IT leakage”.Step one is luring workers with a free version of an application they will find useful in their jobs. Step two, when enough have been hooked, is persuading their bosses to start paying for extra features and services to make the technology more manageable.Besides RightScale, companies that follow this pattern include Optimizely, which allows users to trial new services for their customers; Asana, a collaboration tool for teams of workers; and Zendesk, a customer support service for help desks.Peter Fenton, a partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, which has funded all four, compares this to the Southwest Airlines approach to competition.The upstart airline succeeded not by stealing customers from the established carriers, he says, but by creating a new market. It lowered fares to a point where travellers moved from Greyhound buses or started taking trips that they wouldn’t have made before.Companies such as SAP clearly have significant advantages in this battle. Their customers are careful about allowing their corporate data to seep out on to networks beyond their control. And they have made a huge sunk investment in their existing systems.However, younger companies without ties to old IT are freer to build on a new computing architecture – a worrying sign for the old guard of the software industry, since these should be their customers of the future.Also, corporate managers are learning fast how to adapt to the so-called “consumerisation” of IT, which promises more rapid adoption of technologies with productivity-enhancing potential.SAP knows it has to respond to these changes. Mr Plattner worried publicly this week that his company’s prices are too high. And the German company has set its sights on eventually getting its software in front of 1bn end-users – a feat that would pull it out of the backroom of corporate IT and put it on a par with mass-market technologies such as Facebook and the Windows operating system. For now, that is a far-off ambition.Running applications for customers in its own data centres is the necessary first step, according to Mr Plattner. It promises to give SAP a direct connection to office workers for the first time, creating a feedback loop through which it could learn more about how its technology is working in practice and make faster headway in improving usability.SAP still has a lot to learn in the new world of cloud services. Mr Plattner – who has sought to bring a new sense of urgency to a company he has described as at risk of becoming moribund – must be hoping that it won’t be another 20 years before the results are apparent.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast managing editor"
224;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Inside Business: Real innovation needed to juice returns;Jobs’ scorn of financial engineering may have led him to neglect his company’s mounting cash pile;What would Steve Jobs have made of the latest steps taken by the heirs to his iEmpire? The very idea that financial engineering might be part of the answer to Apple’s stock market funk would have been anathema to the great innovator. But that is what it has come to: like the rest of Silicon Valley, Apple is beating a path to the bond markets to juice its returns.It is deeply paradoxical that companies swimming in cash should have become some of the best customers of Wall Street’s fixed income desks. Oracle and Cisco have about $80bn of cash and investments between them – but they also have $36bn of gross debt. What started for those companies as a way to pay for big acquisitions has since become an addiction. That Apple should think of borrowing when it has about $145bn of liquid assets at its disposal might seem even more surprising. Details, for now, are scarce, but the debt plan is part of a modified financial strategy – including an extra $50bn in extra stock repurchases – that Apple hopes will finally lay to rest the “shareholder-unfriendly” stigma under with which it has long struggled.The financial engineering has two attractions. One reflects the usual benefits that come with higher leverage: a lower tax bill thanks to tax-deductible interest payments, along with, in theory, greater returns for ordinary shareholders as debt is used to retire some of the company’s equity. More importantly, though, tech companies have had to resort to borrowing as an indirect way to tap their stranded offshore cash mountains.Some 71 per cent of Apple’s cash is sitting in foreign climes: using that money for things like share buybacks or dividend payments would mean first bringing it back to the US, incurring a tax charge of up to 35 per cent. Borrowing avoids that and puts off the evil day when the cash has to be brought home. The odds against Washington granting some sort of tax holiday for repatriations like this, as it did in 2004, seem long, but companies such as Apple can afford to wait and hope.The lack of financial flexibility from offshore cash is only likely to worsen. In its last financial year, three-quarters of Apple’s excess money piled up abroad. This is partly a product of the (entirely legal) tax avoidance that is now built into the business models of the big tech concerns. It is pragmatic – if inconvenient – to accumulate profits in jurisdictions where tax rates are lower. Oracle and Cisco each have approaching 85 per cent of their cash outside the US, forcing them to mount massive borrowing programmes to meet domestic needs. Microsoft, with an even bigger share of its financial reserves offshore, first turned to the debt markets in 2009 and now carries $14bn of debt.Even “don’t be evil” Google can see the merits of lowering its tax bills with some fast financial footwork. It turned to the bond market two years ago.On the sort of scale that Apple looks likely to borrow, however, the benefits to shareholders may only be marginal.The numbers may look large, but paying out about $30bn a year is a sop that won’t make a big dent in Apple’s finances. It is roughly two-thirds of the company’s free cash flow – roughly what Microsoft has been paying out in the last few years. It will do nothing to prevent further increases in Apple’s mounting cash pile.A more radical stance, if chief executive Tim Cook truly believes that Apple’s shares are undervalued, would be to pay whatever tax is due and bring back some serious cash to use for buybacks. That is what Michael Dell is proposing to support a buyout of his company, and what some on Wall Street have been prodding Microsoft to do to offset the fact that stock market investors have fallen out of love with the PC.A look at Microsoft’s share price history since it first “got religion” about shareholder value would be sobering for Mr Cook and his colleagues in Cupertino, however. It is nine years since Microsoft took the plunge, with a $32bn special dividend payment – at the time a far bigger slice of its reserves than Apple is planning to distribute now. Its shares have been range-bound ever since and currently stand less than 10 per cent higher.Mr Jobs’ scorn of financial engineering may have led him to neglect his company’s mounting cash pile for far too long, contributing to his successor’s discomfort now. But his oversight was understandable. For Apple investors, the only real questions are how the company manages the margin erosion around its existing blockbuster products as competition grows more intense – and when the product geniuses led by Sir Jonathan Ive can come up with another one.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast managing editorrichcard.waters@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
225;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
226;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;MySQL team face rival of their own invention;;A European team of software engineers who sold their start-up to Sun Microsystems for $1bn is to be reunited under a merger that will pit them against their original creation, now owned by Oracle.Michael “Monty” Widenius developed MySQL, a database technology for organising large amounts of information, in 1995.MySQL was wildly successful and became the world’s most popular open-source database technology. It played a pivotal role in establishing Europe as a stronghold for the open-source movement, in contrast to big US companies with proprietary technology.Early customers for the free MySQL software included Google, Yahoo and Facebook. As the numbers of customers grew, companies started paying for some services, creating revenues for MySQL.The Sweden-based business was planning to float in 2008 but was snapped up by Sun Microsystems in January that year for $1bn. Sun was in turn bought by Oracle in 2010 for $7.4bn.Oracle, Microsoft and IBM together hold 85 per cent of the database market in terms of sales.But MySQL’s ownership by Oracle, which makes money through its own proprietary databases, proved unpopular with the open-source community, who say they were not allowed to contribute in the same way. Mr Widenius and his team soon left and created MariaDB, another open-source database now being used by Twitter, Facebook and Wikipedia.Many of the original support team for MySQL also left to found SkySQL, which sells services and support to companies that want to use MariaDB.Helsinki-based SkySQL announced on Thursday that it has agreed to merge with Monty Program Ab, Mr Widenius’ company, thus reuniting the original development team behind MySQL.The companies would not disclose commercial terms, but Patrik Sallner, SkySQL chief executive who will become chief executive of the merged company, said it was “mostly share based”, with Monty Program employees becoming shareholders in SkySQL and Mr Widenius holding a non-executive director role at SkySQL.The merged company aims to provide a rival product to Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, while preserving the open-source spirit of allowing free access to the underlying technology for anyone to use or build on.“I’m ensuring that the MariaDB project will remain ‘open source forever’,” Mr Widenius said, adding that MariaDB was named after his second child, and “who doesn’t want the best for their children?”They face a big challenge, however, in making MariaDB, which has been downloaded 1m times, as big a commercial success as MySQL, which is being used by tens of millions of companies worldwide.“We will be doing a lot of new feature development and moving it forward,” Mr Sallner said.
227;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Earnings cloud for surging US stocks;;Company profits are a cornerstone of equity market performance but the record run for US stocks is set to be crowned by a distinctly poor earnings season this month.It is a disconnect that suggests earnings and the recent spate of profit warnings from companies led by FedEx, Oracle and Delta are being overshadowed by the Federal Reserve’s massive bond buying.The Fed’s policy suppresses bond yields, making equities look far more compelling for investors than debt securities.Based on forecast earnings the equity market has an implied yield of 7 per cent, well above the return on bonds. Earnings need to come in above forecast to meet those expectations.But heightened profit expectations for the rest of 2013, notably the final three months, look very lofty.Based on recent history, they are set to slide as summer beckons, particularly should the economy repeat its recent pattern of a spring slowdown.The unexpectedly weak March jobs report released on Friday has only heightened concerns that another spring slump is under way.The creation of only 88,000 jobs last month – well below the consensus forecast of 190,000 – weighed on the S&P 500 index, with the market backing further away from its record close of 1,570.25 set on Tuesday.“Analysts tend to overestimate corporate earnings by about 4 per cent to 5 per cent on average and they tend to assume that the back half of the year is always when the good news comes,” says Jonathan Golub, US equity strategist at UBS. “But as the year progresses, the earnings estimates inevitably come down.”Since 2010, earnings expectations for the fourth quarter at this stage of the year have been far too bullish with actual results ultimately arriving much lower, according to FactSet.Analysts currently expect full-year earnings for the S&P will hit a record $112 per share in 2013, up from $104 last year. But, some say that forecast looks too rich.“We believe 2013 earnings estimates will weaken further and forecast full-year earnings of $103 per share,” says Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.“The good news is that we ultimately see earnings growing later this year and into next. The bad news is that the consensus estimates are too high,” he adds.The lofty aspirations for earnings looks particularly fragile given the recent weakness in US economic data and a pick-up in company profit warnings.But a notable feature of this year’s equity rally has been its defensive nature, suggesting that many investors fear a slower economy or simply view the rise in equity prices since January as a function of the Fed’s liquidity.“Investors have to shrug off earnings and focus on the huge valuation difference between equities and bonds,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Economically sensitive areas such as industrials, technology and materials – sectors that are seen as barometers for global growth and usually provide the fuel that powers bull markets – have lagged behind the overall S&P 500.The best sectors have been healthcare, consumer staples and utilities – areas of the market that consist of high dividend-paying and defensive stocks.Defensive-oriented stocks within the large-cap Russell 1000 index have outperformed more dynamic members not just this year so far but for the past year, three- and five-year periods.This defensive posture also reflects the disappointing guidance from companies with the ratio of negative to positive pre-announcements rising close to the peak seen during the first quarter of 2009.Moreover, companies in the S&P that are dependent on international sales may start indicating tough going from the eurozone and slowing momentum in many emerging markets.Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Citi, says the July reporting season looms as being the time when companies address the improbability of a European economic rebound in the second half of the year.“A hiccup in markets is quite likely this summer, just not yet,” he says, adding: “We would expect new record highs to be achieved first.”While the recent weakness in data and pullback in equities suggest the Fed will keep pumping money into the financial system, renewed strength in the S&P 500 requires defensive-oriented investors to rotate into cyclical sectors.This underlines the importance of company guidance about the coming quarters when they start releasing first-quarter results in the coming weeks.Ultimately, earnings will matter for the equity markets and their slow growth rate means the S&P 500 may struggle to achieve new highs.“The important takeaway is that the last year came in at $104 for the S&P and this year it’s projected to come in about three to four per cent better,” says UBS’s Mr Golub. “That means we are stuck in a really uninspiring and unsatisfactory earnings environment.”Mr Ablin adds: “Earnings do matter and, relative to profits, revenues and the economy, the stock market in my view is a little overvalued.”
228;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-03-26T23:18:50Z;Information services: Better accounting systems offer richer forecasting resources;The need to share data is one factor driving the use of more analytics, says Stephen Pritchard;When businesses first started to invest in information technology in the 1950s and 1960s, the finance director was usually in the driving seat. The early computer systems were installed to carry out tasks such as accounting or running the payroll. But the chief financial officer is no longer the main user, let alone the sole custodian, of business data.“When businesses first started putting in [manual] control systems 100 or so years ago, they measured the flow of goods, then cash, then information,” says Frank Buytendijk, a research vice-president at industry analysts Gartner.“Even over the past 20 years, the chief financial officer owned the management information systems. But now it’s marketing driving a lot of innovation.”The finance function, Mr Buytendijk suggests, is moving from its role as owner or controller of data to a consumer of information. But, he points out, finance and accounting systems now offer richer tools for forecasting, analysing and reporting data, with finance teams able to do more of their daily forecasting and planning without exiting their finance or enterprise resource planning [ERP] software.Companies such as Oracle and SAP have invested heavily in business intelligence applications, in part to boost those capabilities. And it is becoming easier to export data from financial systems, either to a cloud-based application, or even just to look at the numbers in Microsoft Excel.But for larger, and more complex businesses, most finance directors will need to bring data into a specialist business intelligence tool, either for their own use or so a business intelligence specialist can carry out the analysis. Larger firms continue to invest in these specialists, sometimes setting up a business intelligence competency centre, to meet the board’s need for more accurate and timely analysis and forecasting.“Chief financial officers had large amounts of information in ERP systems, but because of their complexity it wasn’t accessible to the business,” says Peter Lumley, a business intelligence expert at PA Consulting. “There is a need to visualise what the data are telling them.”The need to share more key business data with the wider business is one of the drivers for finance departments to make more use of analytics. The chief financial officer should be providing a “sanity check” for the wider business, according to Tony Baer, a principal analyst at Ovum.Often other business units’ forecasts or analysis are not cross checked against the company’s financial records, nor any decisions tested for their impact on the cash position.The subprime mortgage crisis in the US is an example of the risks of putting market share ahead of profitability. Using business intelligence to give more people in the business access to finance-based data can only help.Mr Baer says chief financial officers remain heavily involved in decisions about where a company should invest and finance teams need to look at wider ranges of data. He says: “Chief finance officers are widening their view point, looking at macro trends and looking for signals.”Investment decisions will be made in light of financial data, but also customer and supplier information, even third-party data sources or data from social networks.Fortunately, industry analysts point out that the range and quality of business intelligence and analytics tools is improving, with more sophisticated algorithms, more powerful computers and techniques such as in-memory databases speeding up analytics.Finance directors might not always need real-time information but quicker reporting and the ability to run multiple “what if” scenarios, without heavy investment in IT, is improving decision making. Analysis tools are also becoming easier to use, with the growth of visual analytics and applications designed for tablet computers in particular making it easier for senior managers to view reports and drill down into the data.But some barriers remain. Variable data quality, and the difficulties of creating a single master data record, can hamper the finance director’s ability to use a wider range of data. Finance analysts are trained to deal with highly accurate data from systems of records. Making use of new data sources and big data can mean dealing with incomplete or less accurate figures. This requires finance directors to change their approach.According to Leo Sadovy, a former vice-president of finance who runs the performance management division of SAS, an analytics software vendor, just about 15 per cent of companies are carrying out “transformational work” with business intelligence. In a large number of finance departments they are still trying to improve their ability to handle the basics, such as management reporting.Businesses, he says, are also held back by a lack of statistical knowledge, as well as by issues of data integrity. Paul Dennis, an adviser at the Corporate Executive Board (CEB), a member-based body, says the question of skills becomes even more acute as finance teams start to use more powerful tools to draw on a wider range of data. Improved analysis tools and better visualisation are important, he says, but so are the people.“If you are going to invest to make more of data, it makes sense to have the expertise in place,” he says.
229;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-03-26T23:18:49Z;New IT tools aid evolution of finance chief’s role;The job of minder of the company books is changing to a more strategic one and fresh analytics software can help, reports Paul Taylor;"Traditionally, the role of a chief financial officer has been to look after the company books using spreadsheets and finance modules built into enterprise resource planning (ERP) suites from the likes of SAP, Oracle, NetSuite and others.But that role is changing and now often includes helping to define corporate strategy and oversee the transfer of business to digital platforms.“Based on our research, it is clear the chief financial officer role at today’s leading companies is evolving,” said a study by Ernst & Young published last year. “Alongside their traditional mandate to provide financial insights and analysis, chief financial officers describe a greater involvement in supporting and even developing strategy, guiding key business initiatives.”Rado Kotorov, chief innovation officer for Information Builders, a business intelligence provider, says: “The role is changing due to the growing importance of data assets in the process of revenue and profit generation …Keeping tabs on information is no longer enough. To be successful in today’s economy, organisations need to treat their enterprise data as an investment.”Significantly, when asked by Gartner and Financial Executives International, 44 per cent of chief financial officers said their influence over IT investment had increased since 2010.“The chief financial officer’s growing role in IT decision making is not primarily around cost management; rather, it’s related to making sure it’s a key strategic enabler, and ensuring that IT is in step with other efforts,” said Gartner.Steve O’Neill, chief financial officer of northern European operations at EMC, an IT services company, says: “As the individuals who are most often tasked with the stewardship of our own corporations, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that we keep abreast of this fast-moving environment to maximise the benefits and minimise the potential risks.“We can no longer absolve ourselves from engaging in this technological revolution and assume others within IT, legal or management have covered all the bases from an operational risk and reward perspective.”While he admits it is not necessary for every corporate finance chief to understand the intricacies of implementing a particular IT strategy, he says: “I would challenge a chief financial officer to have at least a working knowledge of IT to enable them to make informed investment decisions for their business and to weigh up the pros and cons and risks and rewards of chosen IT strategies.“Understanding the [overall] picture will enable you to make much more informed business and investment decisions and leverage new opportunities, while minimising your exposure to previously unaccounted-for business risk.”Forward-looking finance chiefs argue that while they need IT tools to monitor and run the finance function, manage risks, ensure data are secure and assist them in their role as strategic advisers, they also need a basic understanding of IT trends such as cloud computing, data sets so large they can become impossible to manage (big data) and the influence of mobile devices. This will enable them to work with IT leaders to use technology to the best effectKate Butler of Russell Reynolds, an executive recruitment firm, says: “We have seen a demand trend for chief financial officers who have already led transformation projects.”She says that while a deep understanding of finance is usually still a requirement, a growing number of candidates have backgrounds in consultancy and MBAs. This shift is also reflected in the IT tools they use.Although many still prefer to use simple spreadsheets to pose “what if’” questions, many now also use more sophisticated software and cloud-based tools including business analytics, demand forecasting and big data.Miss Butler says: “The use of data and analytics at a corporate planning level is straining big organisations. Where chief financial officers previously had 18-24 months to build a strategic plan, now they have a reduced planning cycle of 4 weeks, forcing them to constantly adjust financial forecasts. That puts a huge strain on them.”Fortunately for executives, not only have the main vendors of ERP tools rapidly expanded their finance offerings to meet such requirements, but a variety of relatively young specialised software and services companies, many of them cloud based, have also developed products targeting treasury and finance departments.For example, SAP has launched a fraud management package built on its Hana platform designed to let enterprises in industries such as insurance, banking, healthcare, utilities and in the public sector detect, investigate, analyse and prevent irregularities or fraud in sectors where the sheer amount of data may allow them to go unnoticed.Examples of executives who have turned the new breed of tools to their advantage can be found in many different sectors.Jared Waterman, director of financial planning at Pandora Media, the internet radio company, faced a problem because of the growth of the business. “One of the biggest challenges was bringing structure, infrastructure and analysis to key areas of the business,” he says.To accomplish this, Pandora built its entire financial system, including long-range planning, current month performance, cash flow, headcount and other key metrics, using Anaplan. This is a cloud-based modelling and planning platform that includes an in-memory data processing engine, which allows information to be processed more quickly by those needing it.Pandora is now integrating the system across the company via tools such as dashboards and pushing the data across other departments.“Anaplan allows us to work with most of the ﬂexibility that Excel allows but in a structured manner so we can collaborate on a model in real-time,” says Mr Waterman.Meanwhile Fred Jezouit, vice-president of finance and treasurer for US-based Southern States Cooperative, an agricultural supply business, is using big data analytics tools offered by a company called Alteryx to drill quickly into company data and extract vital information. “Our business is highly dependent on seasonal changes that impact inventory,” he says“The main challenge was identifying the root causes of our slow-moving product, which was eating up working capital that could otherwise be used for business growth.“Alteryx gave us insight into seasonality trends for each of our stores as well as predictive modelling capabilities to help ensure we had the right amount of product available at the right time.”In six months, the co-operative’s retail division has kept revenue of seasonal products constant while carrying 31 per cent less stock. That translates to a $20m change in stock levels, and allows more working capital to be freed up to develop other projects and products that will improve revenues and aid growth.Mr Kotorov of Information Builders says: “Data are a company’s greatest asset, and often the most underutilised. Big data in particular holds vital power for the chief financial officer, as it gives new context to financial and operational data.“The latter provide status on what has happened, but big data provides the ‘why’ – and this is why it offers such potential for learning and innovation.”"

For the week, the S&P registered a decline of 0.2 per cent, breaking a run of three consecutive weekly gains.FedEx incurred a weekly loss of 9.7 per cent to $98.48 after the package delivery company cut its full-year forecast in the wake of third-quarter net income dropping 31 per cent.That weighed on the Dow Transportation Average after it touched a record intraday peak on Tuesday.Transports slipped 1.5 per cent this week, trimming their 2013 gain to 16.4 per cent, still handily beating the major US indices.Oracle dropped 12 per cent to $31.98 for the week after the software group reported fiscal third-quarter results late on Wednesday that missed forecasts.The company blamed execution issues and a slower ramp of new sales capacity.Among the major S&P sectors this week, consumer staples led with a gain of 2.1 per cent while financials lost 1.5 per cent while materials dropped 2 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 0.6 per cent higher at 14,512.03, having touched a new intraday record high of 14,546.82 earlier this week. That left the blue-chip barometer a fraction lower on the week, its first such loss in five weeks.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7 per cent to 3,244.99, for a loss of 0.1 per cent since Monday.The first-quarter earnings season kicks into gear next month and could determine whether the S&P 500 can break its 2007 closing high of 1,565.15.The estimated earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies during the first quarter is minus 0.7 per cent, according to FactSet.“While analysts expect little if any earnings growth for the first quarter of 2013, they do predict earnings growth will rebound to double-digit levels in the second half of 2013,” said John Butters, analyst at FactSet.James Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel, said the S&P remains on track to break its 2007 high, citing the momentum of money coming into the market for dividend paying and value stocks.“People that need income are looking for stocks that provide them with an actual cash flow yield,” he said.But with uncertainty swirling in the eurozone over Cyprus and with fiscal policy in the US, equities could struggle for momentum in March.“These increased risks are likely to cause stock markets to struggle in the near term and prompt profit taking after the strong gains thus far in 2013,” said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investment Advisors.Among other shares in the earnings spotlight this week, weaker guidance from Guess saw its shares drop 7.5 per cent to $25.09.A strong fiscal fourth-quarter and higher dividend for Williams-Sonoma boosted its shares by 10.7 per cent to $49.83.Adobe booked a weekly rise of 3.8 per cent to $42.97 after its first-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share exceeded a forecast of 20 cents.Shares in General Mills rallied 4.1 per cent to $48.15 on the week after its fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat a forecast of 57 cents.
231;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Dell/Blackstone: the key points;Even those who argue over sweetheart deal will back ‘go-shop’ process;"Mark Hurd would bring plenty of experience to the table as a chief executive of Dell. He can boast stints at large technology hardware stalwarts like NCR, HP and now Oracle. There is, however, one gaping hole in the resume of Mr Hurd and the other head honcho candidates: the $4bn stake in the PC giant held by founder Michael Dell. And that means Blackstone, which has reportedly approached Mr Hurd about the job, has a $4bn financing hole to fill. Actually, it is more like a $6bn chasm, since competing bidders would have to offer, say, $15 a share (versus the $13.65 Mr Dell’s team has offered) to increase the overall value of the deal to shareholders.The good news is that dissident shareholders like Southeastern Asset Management, which insists that the current bid undervalues Dell, can put their money where their 13Ds are and join the Blackstone bidding group. Still, Southeastern’s 8 per cent stake is about half of Mr Dell’s; some $4bn of incremental funds still need to come from somewhere. The Dell management group already had secured $16bn in debt for their deal (including $2bn from Microsoft). The lead financial sponsor, Silver Lake, committed just $1.4bn of equity. Blackstone could find more cash by selling assets, but exploring that option highlights just how hard it is to make the pieces of the puzzle fit.Even those who argue that Michael Dell is getting a sweetheart deal on price will find it hard to quarrel with this “go-shop” process, the procedure to elicit better offers, judging by Blackstone’s efforts ( convenient timing, given the litigation around private equity collusion).

232;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-03-21T20:50:38Z;Wall Street lower on eurozone fears;;"US equities resumed declines on Thursday after the S&P 500 traded near a record high in the previous session, with sentiment hit by weak earnings and guidance from Oracle and as attention focused on uncertainty in the eurozone.The broad measure of US stocks closed 0.8 per cent lower to 1,545.80 with all main industry sectors in the red, led by technology and materials.The pullback came after the S&P 500 settled within seven points of its 2007 record closing high of 1,565.15 on Wednesday, with investors buoyed by the US Federal Reserve affirming aggressive monetary easing until unemployment is significantly lower. Weekly jobless claims data on Thursday suggested March payrolls would expand by more than 200,000.“These data suggest improvement in underlying labour market conditions and corroborate the stronger payroll gains seen recently, plus 205,000 on average over the past four months,” economists at RBS Securities said.But investors also watched events in Cyprus, after the European Central Bank said emergency funding for the country’s banks would be suspended on Monday if no agreement was reached on a bailout plan. European shares headed lower, weighing on US equities.The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session down 0.6 per cent at 14,421.34, while the Nasdaq Composite led the benchmarks with a loss of nearly 1 per cent to 3,222.60 as technology shares took a hit.After markets closed, shares in Nike jumped 8 per cent to $57.92 in extended trading after reporting earnings per shares that were slightly higher than analysts’ estimates. The company said fiscal 2013 third-quarter saw revenues from continuing operations rise 9 per cent to $6.2bn, or 10 per cent excluding currency changes.Earlier in the session, Oracle fell 9.7 per cent to $32.31, after the software group reported fiscal third-quarter results late on Wednesday that missed forecasts. The company blamed execution issues and a slower ramp of new sales capacity.“We are always sceptical of Oracle having execution issues as we consider execution a core competency, with rigorous sales processes and multiple levels of deal inspection,” analysts at Macquarie said. “This time we believe it is more plausible given the many changes brought about by co-
president Mark Hurd.”Jabil Circuit reported a 9 per cent slide in fiscal second-quarter earnings, on the back of higher costs associated with its purchase of Nypro in February. Shares in the electronics maker, whose biggest customer is Apple, slid 4.5 per cent to $18.60 as it also downgraded its third-quarter outlook. Shares in Apple see-sawed throughout the session but closed 0.2 per cent higher to $452.90.Guidance from Guess saw its shares slide 7.1 per cent to $25.03. The clothing retailer reported better fourth-quarter earnings but revenues were lower, while the outlook for first-quarter earnings was cut.Shares in KB Home rose 2.6 per cent to $22.14. The homebuilder said its first-quarter net loss shrank to $12.46m, or 16 cents a share, better than a forecast loss of 22 cents a share. Net orders for new homes rose 40 per cent. Elsewhere in the sector, shares in DR Horton fell 2.1 per cent to $24.89; PulteGroup dipped 1.9 per cent to $20.99; while Lennar Corp slid 2.3 per cent to $42.40.A downgrade of Juniper Networks by FBR Capital to “underperform” put pressure on the network supplier, which declined 2.2 per cent to $18.87.In contrast, an upgrade for Dover Corp from Goldman Sachs, saw shares in the manufacturer of specialised products initially rise to as high as $73.67. But they later pared gains to end the session 1.3 per cent lower at $72.39.Oppenheimer raised Yahoo to “outperform” and the stock rose 3.5 per cent to $22.87.Other stocks on the move included Newmont Mining, the gold miner, which gained up 2.8 per cent to $41.51, while Red Hat fell 0.4 per cent to $50.99."
233;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-03-20T23:14:14Z;Oracle: software glitch;Company blames execution failure for disappointing results and predicts swift return to growth;If Oracle results give the temperature on the corporate IT market then that market may be sicker than previously believed. Oracle reported results that were unsurprisingly poor on hardware systems (down 23 per cent, the same as the previous quarter). But more surprisingly, new software licences, an indication of corporate optimism, fell 2 per cent after the company had guided to high single-digit growth. The company cited execution failure rather than hiding behind any macro weakness or portfolio shortcomings and has (naturally) predicted a return to growth in the next quarter on the software side (no such luck in hardware).Oracle has been an active software acquirer in the past two years, post-Sun acquisition, spending $7bn on various plays on the splashiest trends in software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications (Rightnow, Taleo, Eloqua) and most recently a play in network equipment (Acme Packet). But $7bn is just pocket change for Larry Ellison when Oracle’s market cap exceeds $150bn. And after all that, cloud revenue was only $238m of a total $2.3bn of software sales. The market, as it should, keeps watching the core database business.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
234;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-03-20T22:16:01Z;Weak software and cloud sales hit Oracle;;Shares in Oracle fell more than 8 per cent in after-hours trading as the business software bellwether reported quarterly revenues and earnings below Wall Street’s expectations alongside a cautious outlook for its most significant quarter of the year.The report, for the three months ended February 28, will come as a blow to investors who were hoping that corporate technology spending was returning to growth, although Oracle blamed currency fluctuations and a “lack of urgency” among new recruits to its sales force for the miss.Safra Catz, chief finance officer, told analysts that the company was “not at all pleased with our revenues this quarter”, adding that it “didn’t help” that its fiscal third quarter ended a day before the March 1 US public spending cuts deadline.“There’s no really new news on the economy,” she added.Oracle has hired more than 4,000 people to its sales force in the past 18 months and Ms Catz said the company had “more work to do” in training them. However, some sales agreements that had slipped into the fourth quarter have “already closed”, she added.For the fourth quarter, traditionally Oracle’s biggest sales period, Ms Catz said that total revenues could shrink by 1 per cent or grow as much as 4 per cent, a range below Wall Street’s expectations. Additionally, the company faces a potential decline in hardware revenues ranging between 13 and 22 per cent in reported dollars, pushing back an expected recovery in the former Sun Microsystems business.Oracle’s total revenues for the third quarter fell 1 per cent to $8.96bn, below the $9.38bn Wall Street had expected, while net income was flat at $2.5bn.Third-quarter sales of Oracle’s new software licences and cloud subscriptions, seen as a leading indicator for future performance, fell 2 per cent from the previous year to $2.3bn, rather than the increase the company had predicted.Hardware sales, which have been falling for some time in the aftermath of its 2009 acquisition of Sun Microsystems, also came in below expectations, dropping 16 per cent from the previous year.Although Larry Ellison, chief executive, acknowledged that a promised fourth-quarter turning point in hardware sales was now expected in its fiscal first quarter, he said: “Next year will be a big growth year for our entire hardware business.”Oracle said the strong dollar had put downward pressure on sales and profits, after a similar warning at September’s underwhelming results. New software licences and overall revenues would both have been flat after adjusting for currency fluctuations.Earnings per share came in at $0.65, adjusted for certain items, and were up 5 per cent, but just below analysts’ consensus forecasts of $0.66.Oracle continued to make large acquisitions to bolster its business, paying $2.1bn last month to buy Acme Packet, a provider of security communications technology, as it strives to move further into cloud computing.Oracle shares were 8.2 per cent lower after the New York close at $32.83, having ended the day flat at $35.76. The stock has climbed about 11 per cent over the past six months.Also weighing on Oracle’s shares was a Fortune report that Blackstone, the private equity group, had approached Oracle president Mark Hurd about a potential leadership role at Dell.Blackstone is one of several companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Icahn Enterprises, that are considering counterbidding against Michael Dell, the PC maker’s cofounder, and Silver Lake, the private equity firm, who want to take Dell private.Fortune reported that Blackstone is considering recruiting Mr Hurd, former chief executive of HP, as Dell’s chief executive if it makes a bid and Mr Dell leaves. A Friday deadline has been set for would-be Dell counterbidders, none of whom have commented on the reports.

236;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Microsoft joins the Friday afternoon hack confessional;;There seems to be a sea-change underway in the willingness of companies to admit when they have been the victims of cyber attacks. More have been coming forward, even when they appear to have no legal obligation. But the timing and nature of the disclosures differs greatly.Take Microsoft’s apparent admission that it has succumbed to the same attack that has hit several other big tech companies. Compared even with Apple, traditionally the tech industry’s most secretive company, its disclosure was both late and light on detail.In fact, “disclosure” almost feels like too strong a word for the statement that Microsoft put out on Friday afternoon, traditionally a time for burying news you don’t want to see widely reported in the media. Take this rather startling opening line:As reported by Facebook and Apple, Microsoft can confirm that we also recently experienced a similar security intrusion.Not only does Microsoft hide behind the troubles of its rivals, it doesn’t even admit the nature of the attack to which it has succumbed. Does “similar” mean “same”? A spokesperson says no further details are forthcoming.Facebook, by contrast, gave an admirably detailed account of how the computers of some of its employees were compromised after visiting an online forum for mobile app developers. The malware took advantage of a flaw in Java: after Facebook reported the problem, Oracle brought forward a scheduled series of patches for Java by more than two weeks.After a report by Reuters, Apple also said that malware spread through “a website for software developers” had taken advantage of “a vulnerability for the Java plug-in for browsers” to hit some of its employees’ machines.And Microsoft? While not disclosing what actually happened, it didn’t miss a second opportunity to take a jab at a rival, highlighting the fact that Macs were among the machines infected:During our investigation, we found a small number of computers, including some in our Mac business unit, that were infected by malicious software using techniques similar to those documented by other organizations.A further difference concerns timing. Twitter was the first to own up at the start of this month, though it also appears to have been the only one of the companies whose users were affected by the attack, with up to 250,000 accounts at risk. Earlier this week Microsoft was still refusing to respond to questions on the subject, before belatedly putting out a statement with this vague explanation:Consistent with our security response practices, we chose not to make a statement during the initial information gathering process.So should customers be worried by the vulnerabilities that have been exposed? It’s hard to tell. Microsoft concludes with a line that makes this all sound like business as usual. It’s clearly meant to be reassuring – but when you stop to think about it, it doesn’t offer much reassurance at all:This type of cyberattack is no surprise to Microsoft and other companies that must grapple with determined and persistent adversaries.Still, at least there is no evidence that customer data was compromised. This round of hacks will go down as a warning shot. It will be interesting to see how the disclosures change the next time around – particularly if the outcome is less benign.
237;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-02-21T20:03:57Z;Oracle races to plug holes in Java;;A series of cyber attacks in recent weeks on companies including Apple, Facebook and Twitter has exposed pervasive flaws in one of the computing world’s most widely used pieces of software, according to security experts.The vulnerabilities in Java, which is included in most personal computer and smartphone browsers, has left its owner, Oracle, racing to plug what have come to be seen as the biggest holes in the defences of personal computers and smartphones amid a rising tide of cyber attacks.“Right now using Java is a nightmare, Oracle just hasn’t been able to patch all the holes,” said Jaime Blasco, head of research at AlienVault, a security company. Criminals and others trying to break into corporate or government systems have laid siege to Java, seeing it as the easiest current point of attack, he and other security experts said.In a highly unusual step last week, Apple admitted that laptops used by some of its developers had been infected by malicious code planted by attackers who had exploited a flaw in Java. That followed similar announcements from Facebook and Twitter, and is the third serious problem with Java to have received widespread publicity within the last year.The gathering crisis has forced Oracle to launch a concerted effort to repair the flaws.In one of the widest-ranging efforts of its kind, the US database software company released fixes for some 50 different problems at the start of this month, only to follow up with another five fixes two weeks later. It is also planning to issue extra emergency fixes in April, along with a further previously scheduled upgrade in June. Software companies usually keep the frequency of such fixes to a minimum since they force companies to upgrade all their workers’ machines with every change.Oracle’s problems are similar to those faced by Microsoft in the early 2000s, when a proliferation of security holes in Windows XP meant that an unprotected PC user could expect to be infected with a virus within seconds of connecting to the internet, said Kevin Mahaffey, co-founder and CTO of Lookout, a mobile security company.Oracle took control of Java with its acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010 and problems with the software have been deeply ingrained for years, according to people familiar with the code.Yet as fast as flaws have been identified and repaired, new ones have been exposed. “It’s been one critical bug after another,” said Chris Eng, vice-president of research at VeraCode, another security company. People looking to attack computer systems have been able to “stockpile” and have launched attacks as soon as old holes are plugged, he said
238;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-02-18T16:31:12Z;Taking care of talent;One of the fastest growing business software segments is human capital management;As competition for critical resources intensifies, managers, employees and job candidates are demanding more from human resources.Human capital management (HCM) software is designed to help companies manage workforces dispersed around the world, improve human resource processes and enhance employee satisfaction while improving efficiency and generating cost savings.HCM is an umbrella “software/cloud services” category that includes recruitment, talent and performance management, training and career development, as well as the payroll function.In fact, the HCM market has emerged as one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing segments of the enterprise software market and has been reshaped by a wave of merger and acquisition activity over the past 18 months.Recruitment software companies and performance management companies have invested and merged to become talent management companies. Talent companies have invested to become bigger talent companies, and three of the largest enterprise software groups – SAP, Oracle and IBM – have entered the market by acquiring three of the biggest talent management companies – SuccessFactors, Taleo and Kenexa – for $3.4bn, $1.9bn and $1.3bn respectively.Within the broad HCM category, recruitment applications help an employer identify the best internal or external candidates for a role and process their application, removing the need to engage expensive recruitment agencies and headhunters.Meanwhile, human resource management software (HMRS) is designed to help companies organise, staff and pay their global workforces, and typically incorporate self-service capabilities as well as tools for the HR department and administrators.Finally, talent and performance management tools enable managers to set specific goals for an individual employee to make a direct contribution to company objectives – the launch of a product, expansion into a new territory or targeting a new customer demographic, for example.“Achieving your goals and objectives depends on the quality of people in your organisation,” states Workday, the fast-growing, cloud-based software supplier that claims its Workday Human Capital Management is the only application that unifies HR and talent management into a single system.Josh Bersin, founder of Bersin by Deloitte, a specialist HR market research firm that became part of Deloitte Consulting this January, says the growth in demand for the talent management software – and the surge of M&A activity associated with it over the past 18 months – underscores the growing importance of the HCM segment.“As businesses around the world expand in 2013, they will face a growing shortage of talent and leadership,” Mr Bersin said in his annual market review. “This will drive an accelerated need for business agility, career development and talent mobility programmes, leadership development and re-engagement of the workforce.”It turns out that strong talent management is also good business. Companies with superior talent management practices generate 26 per cent more revenue per employee than their peers, according to Deloitte. In today’s complex and global organisations, the right talent management system can make all the difference.Not surprisingly, therefore, a broad swath of companies have adopted new HCM systems and social media tools such as LinkedIn to recruit and retain their best employees. For example, Aviva, the insurance group, is implementing Workday applications, while Taleo’s customers include Hyatt, the hotel group, and SuccessFactors serves Kimberly-Clark, the personal care products company, and American Airlines.“Nearly every major business is challenged with shifting talent and business towards emerging markets, while grappling with talent shortages globally – all while improving the engagement, retention and development of their workforces,” says Bersin. “In this environment, high-performing chief human resources officers will provide a laser-like focus on high-value areas that empower and foster teamwork.”Adding to the market’s complexity, Mr Bersin notes that the HR technology industry continues to undergo significant changes. Cloud-based HR systems, now available from many of the largest vendors in the market, integrate payroll, HRMS, talent management and analytics processing into a single service.Global spending on these complex systems is anticipated to grow 22 per cent to nearly $4bn this year – almost double the growth rate of 12 per cent last year.“In 2013, technology innovation is anticipated to accelerate as mobile tools and social recruiting systems make obsolete many of the HR systems in place,” Mr Bersin says. “New tools will empower employees to find experts, share information, manage their careers and become more interlinked.”Mr Bersin adds that the market for consulting and integration services is also growing. “Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, Cognizant and many smaller consulting firms have built large practices to help companies select, implement and integrate these products into the corporate infrastructure.”But, like other analysts, Mr Bersin also cautions: “Our research does show that talent management software does not create talent management.”It seems there is still a need for companies to modernise continuously and rethink the way they hire, train, manage and engage people.
239;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-02-15T23:22:58Z;Facebook admits it was victim of hackers;;"Facebook has admitted it was targeted by hackers two weeks after Twitter revealed it had experienced a similar security breach.Facebook said it discovered the attack last month, when several employee laptops running Java software were infected with malware. Oracle, which owns Java, issued a fix to Facebook and other companies on February 1.The social network published a blog post telling users of the attack on Friday, before a three-day holiday weekend in the US.“Facebook was not alone in this attack,” the blog said. “It is clear that others were attacked and infiltrated recently as well.”Facebook said the attack, which it described as “sophisticated”, happened when a group of employees visited a mobile developer website. That website was compromised and allowed a computer virus to be installed on the employees’ laptops.The company said it was a “zero day” original attack, meaning it exploited a vulnerability that had not been identified before.The social network said it had told law enforcement agencies and that a “significant investigation” was under way.The attack was similar to the one on Twitter. The microblogging site sent a notice to users on the afternoon of Friday February 1 and reset passwords for 250,000 users whose email addresses and passwords may have been affected.Facebook did not return calls or emails from the Financial Times on February 1 asking whether it had been affected by a security breach.Facebook said it had found no evidence that user data were compromised, though it could not guarantee with certainty that they had not. It made no recommendations to users to change passwords.Shuman Ghosemajumder, vice-president of strategy at Shape Security and a former member of Google’s security team, said there were three approaches to informing users of a security breach: immediately after an attack, even if details were unknown; wait until an exhaustive investigation was complete and then inform users; or the middle road, which was what Facebook had taken, of carrying out an initial investigation before informing users.The benefit of this approach, Mr Ghosemajumder said, was that it gave companies a chance to observe hackers in action, and gather more information about how they were operating, before they knew the company was on to them.“If you announce to the world that you discovered this, then the attacker knows and they can change their behaviour,” he said."
240;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Activists keep tech sector on its toes;;The last time David Einhorn, the hedge fund activist behind Greenlight Capital, tried to nudge a large and venerable technology company into action, his pleas fell on deaf ears.In May 2011 he urged Microsoft’s board to sack Steve Ballmer, the company’s longstanding chief executive. “Ballmer does not care what Wall Street thinks and maybe that’s a good thing,” said Mr Einhorn, but “his presence is the biggest overhang for Microsoft stock”.Mr Ballmer remains in place, suggesting that the west coast still thinks investors in general – and the money men of Wall Street in particular – are a necessary evil to be tolerated, not indulged.Now Mr Einhorn is going after Apple, where he is trying to persuade the iPhone maker to set aside more of its $137bn cash pile for investors. The record suggests that the tech world has been highly receptive to the urgings of activists.Since 2007, when the veteran corporate raider Carl Icahn became one of the first to target tech by buying up stock in Motorola Solutions, the struggling mobile phone maker, there have been 70 different activists involved in technology companies, according to Activist Insight.Mr Icahn fought a battle to install a nominee on the board and agitated for a split of the company that finally occurred in 2011. Then, as he pushed for the company to sell its valuable portfolio of patents, Google turned up to buy one of the two new companies, Motorola Mobility, for $12.5bn.Mr Icahn also emerged a hero in 2008, when he forced Larry Ellison, head of software group Oracle, to raise its offer price for BEA Systems.The great majority of activist positions since 2008 – 71 per cent according to Activist Insight – have at least made money.In part, this reflects the rapidly changing nature of the technology business, where companies can rapidly swing in and out of favour, as well as the lack of takeover defences at most tech companies.One verteran banker says “a lot of tech companies grew up without a proper capital structure”, and are now being forced into behaving like more mature companies in other industries.Elliott Management, the $20bn hedge fund run by Paul Singer that is making a $2.3bn offer for Compuware, has acted as a stalking horse to flush out buyers in the past, teaming up with technology-focused private equity groups.For instance, Elliott took part in the buyout of MSC Software by the Symphony Technology Group in 2009 after initially trying to buy the company itself.More conventional agitation tactics have also worked on tech companies. Thomas Ivey, a partner at the law firm Skadden, says that “activists tend to win more than they lose when they run or threaten to run a short slate” – the attempt to elect directors to the board without pushing for control.For instance, Ralph Whitworth’s Relational Investors took a stake in L-3 Communications and agitated for a break-up, leading to a $2bn spin-off.Mr Icahn stepped down from the board of Yahoo in 2009, where he had tried to push the group into the arms of Microsoft, but last year Dan Loeb picked up the baton. The head of the hedge fund Third Point joined the Yahoo board after a letter-writing campaign that questioned the veracity of the chief executive’s CV, which led to his departure.Even where activists have failed in their explicit goals, the market reaction can help them out. Starboard failed to win a board seat at AOL, but the share price nearly doubled in the process.But some attempts at activism remain very much a work in progress. Mr Whitworth was invited on to the board of Hewlett-Packard too late to affect the hardware company’s purchase of UK software group Autonomy, but well before the consequences of that takeover caused the share price to collapse.Mr Einhorn faces significant opposition to his idea that Apple issue preferred stock as a novel route to access its cash hoard, with both of the main corporate governance advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis, in opposition.But it is another sign of tech maturity. The veteran banker says that he talked to Steve Jobs several times about returning cash, but “he believed giving cash back to shareholders was ridiculous.”The banker says that only works so long as the share price goes up. “Founders have a hard time accepting that.”Apple though has a share price in the doldrums and a new chief executive, Tim Cook, who said this week that he is “seriously” considering returning more of Apple’s $137bn cash hoard to investors. Like most activists, Mr Einhorn can still come out ahead – even if he does not get exactly what he wants.
241;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-02-04T22:34:41Z;Wide losses on Wall Street include Gannett;;US equities suffered their largest drop of the new year, pulling back sharply from multiyear highs after a broad sell-off on Wall Street sent all 10 major sectors on the S&P 500 lower.The day’s woes were exacerbated by resurgent eurozone worries and disappointing economic data that showed US factory orders in December picked up at a slower-than-expected pace.The data contributed to a lingering sense that country’s economic recovery may not be as strong as some had suspected, a theory that has gained traction amid several recent disappointing economic releases.Overall, the S&P 500 dropped 1.2 per cent to 1,495.71.The losses were most severe among cyclical sectors that are tied heavily to the country’s economy with consumer discretionary, financial and information technology stocks among the day’s biggest losers.Shares in Gannett, the international media and publishing company, were among the weakest on the day and lost 6.7 per cent to $18.51.Before trading began on Monday, the company said strong television advertising sales and an extra week in the quarter helped boost its results for the three months to December 30.Still, the declines put the stock as the worst performer on the S&P consumer discretionary index, which dropped 1.2 per cent. High-end luxury jeweller Tiffany was next, falling 4 per cent to $62.17.Yum! Brands lost 6.2 per cent in after-market trading as the fast-food chain operator said sales in China fell in the fourth quarter. Shares in the company had lost 3 per cent to $63.94 during the day’s trading session.As stocks fell, a measure commonly referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, soared 13 per cent to the 14.68 level.The CBOE’s Vix Index, which measures implied market volatility, touched its highest mark since the start of the year.The declines extended the other two major US benchmarks. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 1.5 per cent to 3,131.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 13,880.08.Among Wall Street’s largest banks, Morgan Stanley fell the hardest and lost 2.7 per cent to $22.88. The broader industry measure of financials declined 0.9 per cent and was dragged lower by losses among insurance companies.Meanwhile, shares in Jefferies closed flat at $19.95 even as Moody’s said high levels of executive compensation at the US investment bank could hurt its credit rating.McGraw-Hill dropped 13.8 per cent to $50.30 as a report said the US Justice Department is expected to file a civil fraud lawsuit against its Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency controlled by the company.Shares in Moody's Corporation, another rating agency, fell 10.7 per cent to $49.45, although it was not expected to be named in the S&P suit.Energy sector stocks lost 1 per cent as benchmark crude prices retreated. Nabors Industries, the land drilling company, declined 3.6 per cent to $16.25.The paring back of recent gains for stocks came as strategists continued to encourage investors to move into riskier assets, including equities.The benchmark S&P 500 enjoyed its best January since 1997 last month and was up more than 6 per cent heading into the day’s trading session.David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said: “Selling bonds and buying stocks remains our top US portfolio strategy recommendation.”Others were more cautious but in broad agreement. “The bottom line is that, even with slow global growth, until the world gets a little scarier, equities are likely to continue to outperform fixed income investments,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.Shares in Herbalife fell heavily as the day’s trade began after fresh speculation arose that the nutritional direct seller was under a possible investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission.The company’s shares, which have been under pressure since hedge fund manager Bill Ackman unveiled in December his argument that the company was a pyramid scheme, finished 1.3 per cent higher to $35.54.Oracle shares lost 3.1 per cent to $35.10 as the enterprise software group said it would acquire Acme Packet, a wireless communications services company, for $2.1bn. The deal values shares in Acme Packet at $29.25, a 22 per cent premium to its closing price on Friday.Dell shares lost 2.6 per cent to $13.27 as multiple reports suggested that a deal to take the computer maker private was imminent.
242;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-02-04T16:41:42Z;Oracle expands cloud operations;;Oracle is buying Acme Packet, a provider of secure communications technology, for $2.1bn in cash as it boosts its offering to businesses in the internet cloud.The Silicon Valley company said it would pay $29.25 a share for the Nasdaq-listed company – a 22 per cent premium to its closing price on Friday. Taking out Acme Packet’s cash, Oracle said it was paying $1.7bn.It described its latest acquisition as the leading global provider of session border control technology, which enables secure and reliable connections over Internet Protocol networks.“The addition of Acme Packet to Oracle’s leading communications portfolio will enable service providers and enterprises to deliver innovative solutions that will change the way we interact, conduct commerce, deliver healthcare, secure our homes, and much more,” said Mark Hurd, Oracle president, in a statement.Oracle has spent $40bn on 70 acquisitions since 2005, according to Bloomberg data, as the database software and hardware company reshapes itself to deliver more services over the internet.Analysts at Evercore Partners said in a note: “Oracle’s proposed purchase underlines their commitment to expanding their presence in the mobile carrier market and the potential of the mobile broadband market.”They said the purchase price seemed reasonable and could be at least $0.01-$0.02 accretive to earnings per share in its 2014 fiscal year.Acme Packet’s board unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close in the first half.Its shares rose 22.4 per cent to $29.29 in morning trading in New York on Monday. Oracle shares were down 1.6 per cent at $35.61, but have risen 22 per cent over the past year.Andy Ory, Acme Packet chief executive, said: “Together with Oracle, we expect to provide customers with purpose-built, innovative solutions to accelerate the deployment of all-IP networks and help deliver a consistent experience across all services, devices and networks.”
243;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-02-02T01:16:46Z;Twitter hit by ‘sophisticated’ hackers;;A quarter of a million Twitter accounts may have been compromised in what the social networking company said was an “extremely sophisticated” hacking attack that may also have targeted other websites.In a posting to its site late on Friday afternoon, Twitter said it had reset the passwords of 250,000 users after detecting “unauthorised attempts to access Twitter user data”.The information involved included email addresses and encrypted versions of passwords. The attack appears to have affected many of Twitter’s earliest users, including some of the company’s investors and employees.“This attack was not the work of amateurs, and we do not believe it was an isolated incident,” wrote Bob Lord, Twitter’s director of information security.“The attackers were extremely sophisticated, and we believe other companies and organisations have also been recently similarly attacked.”Affected users have been emailed with instructions to reset their passwords and warned to be vigilant for “phishing” attacks from emails or websites disguised to look like Twitter’s own.Mr Lord referred to the recent vulnerability in Java, a widely used software plug-in, which was uncovered two weeks ago. The US Department of Homeland Security believed that the risks of Java exploits were so high that it recommended it be disabled in web browsers. Apple and Mozilla issued updates disabling Java in their browsers.This week, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal said they had been targeted by hacking attacks believed to have originated in China.Oracle, which owns Java, on Friday issued a “critical patch update” for the software.In a blog post, Oracle said it had decided to accelerate from a planned release in two weeks’ time because of an “active exploitation in the wild” of one of the vulnerabilities.Mr Lord said Twitter had discovered “one live attack” in progress, which it was able to shut down “moments later”, a countermeasure which may have prevented more users from being affected.He also reminded readers to use a strong password, with at least 10 characters – “more is better” – and a mixture of upper and lower-case characters, numbers and symbols.“Using the same password for multiple online accounts significantly increases your odds of being compromised,” he said.Twitter said its investigation into the attacks was continuing.
244;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-02-01T00:02:32Z;Owner of O2 arena in bidders’ sights;;An Australian shopping centre operator, a Los Angeles bank chief executive and a Qatari quasi-sovereign wealth fund are among those expected to submit bids of $5bn-$8bn for Anschutz Entertainment Group, owner of London’s O2 arena, as early as next week.Philip Anschutz, AEG’s billionaire owner, put the real estate and entertainment group up for sale in September and is said to be asking for about $10bn. AEG’s assets include the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the O2 arenas in London and Berlin and stakes in US sports groups, including the Los Angeles Lakers.People involved in the auction said Westfield, the Australian shopping centre operator, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and hedge fund manager now running OneWest bank, Qatari Sports Investment and other groups were vying with or could partner with others involved in the process.These include Guggenheim Partners, the California private equity investor, and Colony Capital, the Los Angeles real estate investment group. Wealthy individuals, including Patrick Soon-Shiong, the Los Angeles pharmaceutical billionaire, and Larry Ellison, the Oracle co-founder, have also been reported to be interested in AEG.Qatari Sports Investment, a fund linked to the Qatari royal family, was expected to join forces with Colony, two people familiar with the auction said. Tom Barrack, Colony’s founder, has real estate and entertainment expertise and close ties to Qatar, having sold the Paris Saint-Germain football team to Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund in 2011.AEG’s size and mix of assets initially led to uncertainty about how many bidders could afford a $10bn offer. Two people close to potential bidders said their valuations were in a $5bn-$8bn range. AEG’s annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are about $300m, they said, which alone might support debt of about $2.5bn-$3bn.However, Mr Anschutz and his advisers at Blackstone are said to have steered bidders to look more widely at AEG’s cash flow, hard assets, trophy properties and development potential when valuing the company. These factors could support a premium price and $5bn-$6bn of debt, some people in the process said. Westfield, run by Frank Lowy and his family, owns the Stratford City shopping centre next to London’s Olympic Stadium. Last year it sold regional US malls and other assets to free up capital.Guggenheim has been seen as a strong contender because of its deep pockets and its recent $2bn purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers.Joint bids could help to reduce an individual bidder’s outlay and combine financing with expertise, but any partnerships would need the blessing of Mr Anschutz and Blackstone.AEG has permission for a new stadium in downtown Los Angeles which is expected to attract a National Football League team. Other development opportunities include the area around its Berlin O2 arena.An AEG sale could be the largest deal in sports and entertainment since Comcast bought half of NBCUniversal from General Electric in 2009.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan
245;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-01-23T18:39:17Z;Cloud and big data push boost SAP;;SAP on Wednesday said its momentum had “never been stronger” as it forecast continued double-digit growth this year, helped by its move into big data and the cloud.The German business software maker said full-year software and software-related services revenue would increase 11 to 13 per cent in 2013 on its preferred non-IFRS measure, while full-year operating profit would climb to €5.85bn-€5.95bn from €5.2bn last year, when higher investment hit SAP’s margins.The company reported revenues of €16.2bn on the IFRS measure, up 14 per cent year on year and slightly ahead of the company’s guidance.The world’s third-largest software maker by market capitalisation achieved almost €400m in sales for Hana, its data-crunching technology that can be used in everything from risk profiling to energy smart meters. Half of those sales came in the last quarter of 2012, and the group expects sales to reach up to €700m in 2013.Hana is a key part of SAP’s push into cloud and mobile computing, where it hopes to keep pace with rivals Oracle and IBM. Last year it acquired SuccessFactors and Ariba, two multibillion-euro acquisitions.Operating margins fell 9.2 percentage points compared with 2011 to 25.1 per cent.Jim Hagemann Snabe, co-chief executive, said the 2011 comparison was distorted after a legal dispute with Oracle cost less than the company had expected. Using a non-IFRS measure, which excludes such costs, its operating margin was down 1.1 percentage points compared with 2011.Asked about growth in the company’s core business of software and analytics, Mr Snabe said cloud, Hana and mobile products would generate new customers. “At the end of the day, software and analytics is still what runs companies. What is happening is that is being revitalised by these new technologies.“How we allocate that [growth] you can debate, but clearly it brings us more users and that was not the case before. Hana allows the core products to run in real-time and that makes the core very, very attractive.”Daud Khan, an analyst at Berenberg, said the Hana sales were impressive, and that the 2013 guidance numbers appeared cautious when compared with the bravado of the management.“If you extrapolate the stuff they are saying, either they are being conservative about the numbers or overconfident on the rhetoric,” he said.The company reported earnings per share of €2.37, down from €2.89 in 2011. SAP’s shares closed up 2.4 per cent at €59.20 in Frankfurt.
246;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-01-23T18:21:57Z;Computing innovation powers SAP’s makeover;;The transformation of Germany’s SAP over the past two years has been nothing short of dramatic. Until recently, the world’s largest maker of business software by sales was seen as an unexciting if fundamental pillar of global commerce whose dominance was on the wane. Now investors are starting to believe that its best days lie ahead.More than 60 per cent of global transactions touch an SAP system. Yet by the time the economic crisis hit it was becoming clear that the company – one of Europe’s few global tech success stories – had failed to invest sufficiently in innovation. It risked irrelevance as applications moved into the cloud and on to mobile devices, a process that accelerated the rise of challengers such as Salesforce.com.The company responded in 2009 by raising fees, which enraged its customers, and by cutting jobs as profits declined. Morale hit rock bottom.Following the departure of chief executive Léo Apotheker in February 2010, a hydra-like leadership structure has refocused the company on innovation and customers. Twelve straight quarters of double-digit growth in sales of software and related services suggest they are doing something right.New co-chief executives Bill McDermott, a tanned media-savvy American salesman and Jim Hagemann Snabe, an introverted, intellectual Dane are supported by Vishal Sikka, an Indian whose technological expertise has made him a highly-influential figure on SAP’s board.Meanwhile, Hasso Plattner, SAP’s visionary chairman and the chief architect of its hugely successful flagship software system some 20 years ago, became more hands-on in developing products. He brought with him a new invention.Developed partly by a team of PhD and Masters students at a computer science institute that he founded in Potsdam, “Hasso’s new architecture” soon became known simply as “Hana” and is widely considered to be one of the main catalysts for SAP’s reinvention.“I said if SAP cannot do this then SAP will sooner or later vanish, SAP has to do it,” Mr Plattner explained.Hana is SAP’s solution to the exponential growth of complex data and the desire of organisations to exploit this information in fields ranging from banking to healthcare and retail.SAP claims Hana enables businesses to run complex reports which used to take several hours in just a few seconds, because Hana’s computing takes place directly in the ­memory chip of the computer, rather than on a separate hard disk.Originally sneered at by Larry Ellison at big rival Oracle, Hana is now being taken seriously by SAP’s competitors. Oracle has its own Exalytics in-memory product and Microsoft is expected to launch one by 2015.“I enjoy that [Mr Ellison is] not smiling and I know there’s a weekly meeting [at Oracle] that has the word ‘Hana’ in it,” Mr Plattner says. “Put yourself in the shoes of the CEO of Oracle. What would you do when you see this freight train Hana coming? You have to do something.”Mr Sikka, who helped steered Hana’s development and refers to the database as “my little girl” sees it as a springboard for the company’s “intellectual renewal”.He says: “This is more than a database, it’s a platform for our future, a platform for everything that we do.” But Mr Sikka is also clear that SAP needs to change the way it does business – not just its technology.“We deliver products now in 90-day cycles, and even in weekly cycles. In the past we used to have 18 months delivery cycle . . . The clock-speed on everything has been dramatically upgraded,” he explains.Earlier this month SAP announced that Hana would also support its ­business suite – the cash cow management software that still accounts for a big chunk of revenues.But SAP’s rapid growth last year came mainly from the three areas that it believes will help it to pass €20bn in sales by 2015: cloud, mobile and database computing.SAP was lagging behind its rivals in mobile and cloud but has made a series of acquisitions to snare talented personnel and catch up. In 2010 it bought Sybase, the mobile software specialist, for $5.8bn and has since spent a combined $7.7bn on SuccessFactors and Ariba to strengthen its cloud business.“[People] want information but we do not want to wait longer than three seconds. You do not start a ­programme on your phone and wait for 30 seconds, nobody does that,” Mr Plattner, said. “Now you understand why we acquired mobile technology, we have to be everywhere on every single device.In the short term, these huge investments, increased R&D spending and a big jump in the number of employees have crimped SAP’s earnings growth.Analysts describe Hana as a “potential game-changer” but argue it may take time for the company to convince customers it is worth buying a new database and that this process will not, as SAP promises, be disruptive.The company must also keep its foot on the throttle as it seeks to move into the cloud.“SAP can’t afford to be slow or ignore new technology. The question is will SAP become an IBM or another Hewlett-Packard?” asks Carter Lusher at Ovum, the consultancy, in reference to the executive turmoil at HP and its underspending on R&D.“There’s no guarantee that SAP or any technology vendor will be successful in five to 10 years, especially if it does not invest in innovation.”SAP’s Mr Plattner, as one might expect, is more optimistic: “We have made a major change that enables us to go forward at a much higher speed than the last 10 years.“I see now a clear future for SAP for the next five to 10 years”.
247;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-01-21T20:11:47Z;Dell to test Silver Lake’s skills as ‘undertaker’;;"In Silicon Valley, where investors worship at the altar of growth, Silver Lake Partners is an unusual animal.“They’re the undertakers of the technology industry,” says one prominent Valley venture capitalist, expressing a common disdain locally for the profits the buyout house has wrung out of mature parts of the sector.Now, with its plan to take struggling PC maker Dell private in the biggest ever tech buyout, Silver Lake is about to put to the test its 14 years of experience in conjuring profits out of buying companies that have missed the tide of tech history.Applying the techniques of the buyout business to the tech sector has turned the California-based group into one of the most successful large US private equity houses, though it has also had some bumps along the road.Its third investment fund, a $9.6bn pool of money raised in 2007, has made a net annualised return of 17 per cent as of the end of September, according to a letter sent to one of its investors. Silver Lake insiders have made substantially more: before fees and carried interest – the share of profits kept by the firm – the gross return on its 2007 fund is 26 per cent, according to the investor letter.The returns help to explain why, at a time when some other buyout groups are struggling to raise large funds, Silver Lake has already hit the $7.5bn target for its latest fund and may add more before closing the round, according to a person familiar with its capital-raising.The potential Dell bid, worth as much as $25bn, at a time most believe that the PC maker “is both on the wrong side of history and of technology,” as one rival buyout executive puts it, highlights the approach that has characterised Silver Lake’s deals.Founded by a mix of financial and technology specialists – Oracle executive David Roux, tech banker Jim Davidson, Blackstone executive Glenn Hutchins and tech investor Roger McNamee – its counter-intuitive plan to bring private equity to bear on tech at the height of the dotcom bubble made it one of the few to specialise in the industry.Its best-known deals have, like Dell, involved companies with well-established positions in their markets. The 2000 buyout of disc drive maker Seagate put Silver Lake on the map by producing a return of five times its investment. The acquisition of internet communications company Skype returned 3.1 times the investment in only 18 months.Others in private equity claim to see little value in taking Dell private. “It is fairly valued,” says another private equity executive. “It has already been through major cost-cutting. What would we do that Michael Dell hasn’t already done?”Greater experience in a single sector makes it more willing to back such deals, according to the Silver Lake’s supporters. “I used to think a single sector fund was risky,” says Mark Bradley, who formerly headed Morgan Stanley’s advisory practice dealing with private equity firms and is one of the co founders of San Francisco based banking boutique, DBO Partners. “But they have deep, deep sector expertise and phenomenal contacts.”The returns have not been even. Silver Lake’s first fund brought its investors a net annual return of 25.1 per cent, according to figures published by Calpers, the California teachers pension fund. But its second fund has netted only 10 per cent, thanks to underperformers like Sungard Data Systems, at the time the largest tech buyout.Weaker investments in its latest fund include small stakes in Zynga and Groupon, made shortly before those companies’ IPOs and subsequent share-price collapses.If Silver Lake pulls off its attempt to lead a Dell buyout, it will cap the rise of a new generation at the firm – something few private equity houses beside Warburg Pincus have been able to manage. Of the founders, only Mr Davidson remains fully active, according to people who know the group.In their place, a new group of younger executives have come to the fore and will share in a bigger share of Silver Lake’s profits than the founders: Egon Durban, responsible for the Skype deal; Ken Hao, who led the investment in Chinese commerce company Alibaba; Mike Bingle and Greg Mondre.Whether a Dell deal, if completed, turns out to be a Seagate-like success or a flop like Sungard will go a long way to determining if Silver Lake’s new generation of dealmakers inherit the role of preferred undertakers to Silicon Valley."
248;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Google to build £1bn UK HQ in London;;Google has completed a £1bn deal to build a new UK headquarters on 2.4 acres of disused land behind King’s Cross Station, underlining the global technology industry’s commitment to London.The internet search group confirmed on Thursday that it would start building a new 11 storey office block on the site, which it would use to consolidate operations from its existing offices in London. The land was acquired from the Kings Cross Central Partnership.The deal, one of the most valuable property transactions in the UK since the start of the financial crisis, follows a string of high-profile moves by technology groups, including Skype, Oracle and Amazon, to take up office space in the UK capital.Matt Brittin, vice-president for northern and central Europe at Google, said: “This is a big investment by Google, we’re committing further to the UK – where computing and the web were invented. It’s good news for Google, for London and for the UK.”Google’s London staff are currently split between two offices in Victoria and one in Holborn. The move will allow the company to house all London staff under one roof. The company plans to keep its office in Manchester.The group came under fire in November, when a parliamentary select committee accused it of “immoral tax avoidance”.Google also operates Campus, a seven-storey centre in Shoreditch that offers work spaces to technology and media start-ups as part of London’s Tech City project.Simon Allford, a partner at Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, the architects for the project, said the building would “articulate a conversation between the world within and the city beyond”.Technology, media and telecoms companies have branched out from the traditional heartland of Old Street during the past two years and into the City of London, the West End and beyond.Major deals last year include Skype taking 88,000 sq ft at Waterhouse Square, Weber Shandwick, the communications group, signing 65,000 sq ft in the same building, and Oracle acquiring 22,000 sq ft at 1 South Place.TMT companies are on course to absorb an additional 1.2m sq ft by 2014, an area twice the size of the Shard, London’s tallest skyscraper, according to a recent study by BNP Paribas Real Estate. The demand, if it materialises, will provide a tonic to London’s commercial property landlords, who are suffering from declining uptake from other sectors.GM Real Estate, DTZ and Savills acted for the King’s Cross Central Partnership.
249;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-01-11T00:17:37Z;Java flaw poses malware threat to PC users;Call for software to be disabled until a fix developed;A serious flaw in the Java software found on most personal computers could expose the machines to being taken over by malicious attacks over the internet, the US agency responsible for policing such vulnerabilities warned on Thursday.The vulnerability has already been used to mount attacks, according to security researchers, prompting calls for PC and Mac users to disable Java on their computers until a fix has been developed.The flaw in Java, a free piece of software distributed by Oracle and used to enable features of certain websites to run on all machines regardless of operating system, was highlighted by US-CERT, part of the Department of Homeland Security.“This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems,” the group warned.Jaime Blasco, research manager at AlienVault Labs, an antivirus company that was alerted to the problem, described it as a critical flaw that would hit “every single system and every single user”. The nature of the vulnerability made it “very easy to exploit and trick the system,” he added.Oracle, which took over control of Java with its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, typically releases software fixes for such vulnerabilities in between a week and a month, making it essential for computer users to act more quickly to disable the software, Mr Blasco said.Oracle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.So-called “zero-day exploits” such as those uncovered on Thursday are among the most damaging for computer users, since they involve flaws that have already been used to mount attacks before they have been identified by security professionals or the software companies concerned.In a bulletin warning of the security flaw, US-CERT said it was “unaware of a practical solution to this problem” and advised computer users to disable Java in their browsers.The vulnerability was first identified by an independent researcher known as Kafeine, who reported it to the agency while also writing about it on his blog. Such public disclosure can be controversial since it alerts malware writers to flaws before computers can be properly protected.However, this flaw appears to have already been widely known among the criminals and others who prey on unprotected computers, according to security researchers. Four different malware “kits” – collections of vulnerabilities that are sold to wrongdoers – have already been found that include reference to the Java flaw, Mr Blasco said.
250;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2013-01-10T23:44:22Z;SAP takes on Oracle with database move;;SAP took direct aim at arch-rival Oracle’s core database market on Thursday as it announced that it had recast its main business application software to run on its in-house database.Though widely expected, the move came sooner than most industry analysts had anticipated and marks an aggressive attack at a time when SAP’s high-speed database, Hana, is still in its early stages.Hasso Plattner, SAP co-founder and chairman of its supervisory board, cast the move as a generational shift in the German software company’s technology, on a par with its launch of the R/3 enterprise resource planning system that transformed the big-business software applications market two decades ago.“If SAP cannot do this, SAP will sooner or later vanish. SAP has to do this,” Mr Plattner said. He also predicted that the tight integration of applications and database would help the German company move much faster than it had in the past 10 years, “when we did not exactly know where the world [was] going and what we should do”.The technology underlying Hana stores a company’s data in a computer’s main memory rather than a separate disc system, making it available for more rapid processing and analysis.The so-called in-memory system makes it possible to do instant analysis of real-time data while also simplifying IT architecture and reducing cost, making it a transformational technology for business executives, according to SAP executives.In a sign of how in-memory technology is coming to assume a central position in the rivalry between the world’s biggest software companies, SAP’s database has drawn public scorn from Larry Ellison, Oracle’s outspoken chief executive.“The Hana in-memory machine is like really small,” Mr Ellison said at an Oracle event in October, claiming that a rival technology from Oracle performed better.Mr Plattner, Europe’s best-known software entrepreneur, on Thursday cast Mr Ellison’s comments as an attempt to slow the momentum of “the freight train called Hana”, adding: “I enjoy that he is not smiling.”The leap in speed and performance claimed for Hana has made it one of SAP’s fastest growing new products in years.However, many potential customers are still only at the stage of testing the technology, leading to a longer than expected sales cycle that is likely to have left SAP with lower Hana sales in the final quarter of 2012 than many investors had been expecting, according to analysts at Barclays,SAP’s attempt to carve out a central role for an in-memory database signals the final stage in the fragmentation of its once close relationship with Oracle.Mr Plattner, who personally championed the development of Hana inside SAP, said the company’s applications would continue to run effectively on databases from Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, which are used by 40,000 SAP customers.“We do not abandon the database vendors who have carried us the last 20 years. Customers have a choice,” he said.
251;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-12-30T14:25:28Z;Oracle takes to cloud with buying spree;;Oracle went on a belated buying spree of “cloud” software companies in 2012, despite earlier denunciations by chief executive Larry Ellison of the internet-based market as a fad.The latest spate of deals echoes the aggressive strategy Mr Ellison set out on a decade ago, when he turned Oracle into one of the biggest application software companies with a relentless round of acquisitions.Of the 11 purchases announced by Oracle this year, all but one have been for companies that belong to a new generation of applications providers, delivering their technology as a service over the internet rather than selling software for customers to run on their own servers.Oracle’s dealmaking marks a belated response to a wave of demand from customers for cloud-based technology, according to software analysts. “They dragged their feet as long as they could,” said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura. “There’s a bit of a land-grab going on in this market right now.”The outspoken Mr Ellison once denounced talk of the cloud market as “gibberish”. But asked two months ago whether he had a new appreciation for the business, he said: “I don’t accept the notion I didn’t get the cloud. I think I invented it.”The Oracle boss personally provided the initial financial backing for Netsuite, one of the first so-called software-as-a-service companies, and currently owns nearly 46 per cent of its shares.Oracle first revealed its interest in cloud acquisitions 14 months ago with the $1.5bn purchase of RightNow, a maker of call-centre automation software. Since then it has been on a spree, capped by the $871m purchase last week of Eloqua, a marketing automation company.That deal will cement Oracle’s position as one of the top three players in the cloud business alongside Salesforce.com and SAP, according to Mr Sherlund.Arch-rival SAP has been even more aggressive than Oracle, with the purchases of Success Factors and Ariba for a combined $8bn. But after years of development delays, Oracle’s own suite of Fusion applications also include cloud-based options.The consolidation of the cloud software market is likely to follow the same pattern as the earlier client-server market on which Oracle first rose to prominence, said David Hilal, an analyst at FBR. While the market currently supports many small companies selling services designed for individual business applications, a wave of deals is likely to leave only a small handful of bigger and more diversified companies standing, he predicted.The transition to selling cloud-based software, which generates annual subscriptions rather than the big upfront payments paid for traditional business software, will depress revenues and earnings growth in the short term, analysts warned. However, Wall Street investors have grown comfortable with this new business model, pushing the value of pure software-as-a-service company Saleseforce.com to $23bn despite reported revenues of only $3bn this year.
252;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-12-19T21:42:42Z;US equities decline after two-day rally;;FedEx shares rose despite a late afternoon sell-off across Wall Street as the global delivery service said a decline in profits for its latest quarter was less severe than feared.Shares in the company, which said year-on-year net profits fell 12 per cent to $438m in its fiscal second quarter, rose 0.9 per cent to $93.20.The results, although better than forecast by many analysts, were hindered by ongoing weakness in the global economy, the company said.Fedex also said its quarterly performance was adversely impacted by the effects of superstorm Sandy, which battered the US eastern seaboard at the end of October.Jim Corridore, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the company’s ongoing cost-cutting efforts would help improve its profits headed into next year. But he warned that a shift in customers away from its lucrative express shipping services was expected to continue.Fedex shares have risen 11.6 per cent so far this year, slightly underperforming US equities over the same period.The S&P 500 was largely muted for much of the day before decliing sharply in the session’s final minutes. The benchmark fell 0.8 per cent to 1,435.81 as politicians wrangled over details on a deal to avert the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax hikes. The losses marked the end of a two-day rally for stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 13,251.97 while the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.3 per cent to 3,044.36.All 10 industry groups on the S&P 500 closed in negative territory, with the utility and telecoms sector indices experiencing the biggest declines on the day.Shares in homebuilders, some of the top performing stocks this year amid a modest US housing recovery, declined as fresh housing data showed new home starts for November came in below consensus forecasts.Lennar Corp was 1.1 per cent lower to $39.27, KB Home fell 2 per cent to $16.66 and DR Horton declined 0.7 per cent to $19.95.Shares in Herbalife, the nutritional supplement direct seller, dropped 12.1 per cent to $37.34 as reports said Bill Ackman, the activist investor, is expected to deliver his thesis behind a short position in the company at an event in New York on Thursday.US-listed shares of UBS, the Swiss bank, lost 1.2 per cent to $16.56 as it agreed to pay $1.5bn to regulators in the US and Europe to settle allegations related to manipulations of Libor interest rates.Oracle rose 3.7 per cent to $34.09 as the company that sells software, hardware and services beat analysts’ expectations for sales growth in its latest quarter.“Oracle is unusual in that it has had four prior quarters of modest to no growth on an organic cost and currency basis, so with very easy comparisons, the bar has been set pretty low,” said Rick Sherlund, analyst at Nomura.Knight Capital, the electronic trading and market-making company, gained 5.4 per cent to $3.51 as its board approved a takeover by Getco, a high-frequency trading firm.The deal, which will create one of the biggest trading companies in the US, values Knight at $1.8bn and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2013.Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, said: “We view this as a positive for Knight’s shareholders based on the deterioration in Knight’s business and share price following a catastrophic trading glitch.”JC Penney, the troubled US retailer, rose 3.5 per cent to $20.88 as it hired a former executive from Abercrombie & Fitch, another US retailer geared at teenage customers, as it attempts to transform the layout of its stores.The company’s shares have lost 40.6 per cent from the start of the year. Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch fell 2.4 per cent to $47.83 on the day.
253;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Software and cloud boost Oracle;;Oracle reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, boosted by an end-of-year shopping spree by its business customers.The Silicon Valley company, which sells software, hardware and services, reported a 17 per cent rise in new software licence revenues and cloud software subscriptions.Total revenues grew 3 per cent to $9.1bn in its November quarter, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $9.01bn. Earnings per share of 64 cents were up 18 per cent and beat forecasts of 61 cents. Net income, excluding some items, rose 12 per cent to $3.1bn.“We have had a really excellent quarter,” Safra Catz, chief financial officer, told an analyst conference call, citing how Oracle had exceeded its guidance.However, it faced easy comparisons with the year-ago quarter when it reported a big miss, blaming delays in finalising big purchases that happened late in the quarter. This time, “folks want to close deals” in November and December, said Ms Catz.Asked about the effects of fiscal cliff budget talks in Washington, she said customers wanted to continue to spend their own budgets.“We are having an absolutely wonderful December so far, so what’s going on in Washington, I don’t know who it’s necessarily influencing today.”Oracle shares rose nearly 1.6 per cent to $33.40 in after-hours trading on the news.The company gave guidance of 1 to 5 per cent in revenue growth for its third quarter and earnings per share of 64 to 68 cents. It predicted 3 to 13 per cent in software licence and cloud revenues, but hardware product sales would range from a 10 per cent fall to flat revenues.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, sought to justify the $7.5bn acquisition of Sun Microsystems three years ago in his comments to analysts. Sun has proved hard to digest and is responsible for continuing hardware sales declines.“Sun has already proven to be one of the most strategic and profitable acquisitions we have ever made,” he said, referring to its contribution with Java software and the development of high-end hardware such as its Exadata and Sparc SuperCluster products.He said the hardware business had de-emphasised low-margin products such as commodity servers and a “downsizing” of it had just about finished.“We’re about to start growing our hardware business. In Q3, we will be turning the corner and in Q4, we expect top-line growth,” he said.Oracle reported $34bn in cash on hand at the end of the quarter and said it had bought back 350m shares over the past 12 months for $10.2bn.It is paying an accelerated dividend this month for the second, third and fourth quarters totalling 18 cents a share. The move is seen as pre-empting a possible increase in tax on dividends in the US next year.

255;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-12-04T19:57:49Z;Republicans in capital gains tax fight;;Republicans in the House of Representatives are fighting tax increases on capital gains and dividends, ruling out investment income as an acceptable source of additional revenues in increasingly urgent talks to avert the fiscal cliff.The debate on investment income highlights the difficulty in finding common ground in the talks – with less than a month to go before the US economy is otherwise walloped by a $600bn mix of annual spending cuts and tax hikes that could tip it back into recession.“We are opposed to raising rates on investment income,” one senior aide to House Republican leaders told the Financial Times, narrowing the window for compromise with Democrats and Barack Obama on taxes, a critical front in the negotiations.The part of the negotiations relating to capital gains and dividends, which are currently taxed at 15 per cent, are being watched closely on Wall Street, where anxiety is growing about the possibility of a tax hike.In a pre-emptive strike, Walmart and Oracle have issued early dividend payments and others such as Costco are making special payouts. In addition, Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, is preparing to sell up to 1m stock options in the global exchange operator, according to a securities filing.The US president wants to raise nearly $250bn over the next decade from hiking rates on capital gains and dividends. These measures were part of the Obama administration’s opening bid to Republicans last week for a $1.6tn revenue target.John Boehner, the Republican House speaker, countered this week with his own offer to avoid the fiscal cliff, including $800bn in new revenue. But Republicans have said this money should come from curbing deductions and tax breaks, rather than allowing Bush-era tax cuts on ordinary income to expire for the rich, as Mr Obama is demanding. The House Republican aide said higher taxes on investment income was also excluded from their offer.Mr Obama said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday that Mr Boehner’s proposal was “still out of balance”. The president added: “if we’re going to protect middle-class families, then we’re going to have to have higher rates for the wealthiest Americans.”A compromise between the two sides on investment income could conceivably lead to a modest hike in capital gains and dividend taxes. But if no deal is reached at all, the impact could be much greater, with tax rates on capital gains rising to 23.8 per cent and those on dividends increasing to 43.4 per cent.The tough line taken by House Republican leaders is in contrast to a greater openness by other Republicans, especially in the Senate, to higher taxes on capital gains and dividends.But what actually is a fiscal cliff and what does it mean for the US economy?“Before this is all over with, there’s lots of machinations: there’s capital gains, there’s dividends, there’s all kinds of ways of looking at this and I think cooler heads will prevail,” said Bob Corker, the Republican senator from Tennessee, on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday.But House Republicans argue that higher tax rates on capital gains and dividends, unless offset by lower tax elsewhere, could be just as damaging to the economy as increasing tax on ordinary income.“I think that any increase in capital gains and dividends rates without a commensurate decrease in marginal rates is destructive to economic vitality and therefore is an unwise idea, “ Tom Price, a senior congressman from Georgia and chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, told the FT. “Capital gains and dividend income have been allowed to be taxed at a lower rate because it is believed to be a stimulus for investment and increasing economic vitality and jobs. I don’t think that that belief has changed,” he added.Even a big concession by Republicans on investment income may not be enough to overcome the bigger divide on the taxation of ordinary income, since Democrats and Mr Obama are likely to continue to insist on the expiration of Bush-era tax rates on the wealthy.“Recognition that we must raise rates on the highest income Americans stands today as the critical key to unlocking the door to a bipartisan budget agreement,” said Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council and a top aide to Mr Obama, on Tuesday.
256;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-12-04T00:26:15Z;Oracle to pre-pay $867m dividends;;Oracle said on Monday it would pre-pay $867m worth of dividends that would otherwise not have fallen due until 2013, making it the latest US company to accelerate the distribution of cash to help shareholders offset some of the risk of higher taxes.Among the biggest beneficiaries of the move will be Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder and chief executive, who will receive a one-off payment of $205m from his stake in the database software group. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Oracle said Mr Ellison “did not participate in the deliberation or the vote on this matter”.The announcement follows a spate of special dividend payments by other US companies as politicians in Washington debate how to avoid the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that would be forced by the fiscal cliff. Higher taxes on dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at 15 per cent, are among the ideas proposed in some quarters.Costco last week announced a special dividend of $3bn to its shareholders to beat the end-of-year deadline that would bring automatic tax rises if a deal in Washington is not reached.The accelerated Oracle payment could save Mr Ellison more than $30m, if the lower tax rate instituted by the Bush administration is reversed. The software company said it would pay a dividend of 18 cents a share for stockholders of record on December 14, with the payment being made on December 21.Referring to the distribution as an “accelerated” payment, Oracle said it would not make the usual regular quarterly payments it would have made over the following three quarters as a result.A number of other US companies whose directors own a significant amount of stock, putting them at risk from higher tax rates, have also announced one-off dividends in recent weeks, including Franklin Resources, Wynn Resorts and Werner Enterprises.
257;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Controversy follows ex-Autonomy chief;;With a fierce competitive drive and barely concealed impatience, Mike Lynch has long been the champion for a generation of UK technology entrepreneurs – even if his abrasive style has made enemies along the way.That standing was cemented last year when he netted $800m from the sale toHewlett-Packard of Autonomy, the software company he had founded nearly 20 years before. The deal showered the sort of wealth on the Cambridge technology entrepreneur that is normally only found in Silicon Valley.On Tuesday, however, Mr Lynch, 47, was forced to bring his energy to bear on a highly unusual public campaign to protect his corporate legacy. While other business executives accused of multi-billion-dollar accounting irregularities typically hide behind their lawyers, Mr Lynch spoke out openly.“There is a part of the HP management that would like to blame other people for failures,” he declared to the Financial Times in a characteristically abrasive riposte to the accusations being hurled at him from California. “They ought to look to themselves.”Mr Lynch, who formed his first software company in 1991 with two friends after taking a PhD at Cambridge University, has never been one to shy away from a fight. At times, that has raised questions about his management style – particularly when he has took aim at stock market critics of his former company.One industry analyst, who did not want to be named, said that it had been a red warning flag for the City when Mr Lynch had become so vehement with critical analysts.Mr Lynch said on Tuesday that he had been completely open with analysts. “Autonomy held conference calls every quarter with analysts who included many bulls and many bears. Both were allowed to ask questions. Analysts would raise many issues, other analysts would respond and the market would take its view.”Daud Khan, a technology analyst, said he had had repeated run-ins with the company in 2009 when he questioned its revenue accounting techniques as part of his work for JPMorgan Cazenove.The company responded with what Mr Khan described as “bullying . . . I was banned from meetings. They tried to prevent publication by writing letters to compliance officers . . . I always felt that I was on the right track”.Mr Lynch denied that Mr Khan was banned. “We didn’t ban people from meetings. It was an open process,” he saidMr Lynch, 47, was also drawn into an embarrassing row with Oracle’s Larry Ellison at the time of the HP acquisition. Mr Ellison revealed that Autonomy had sounded Oracle out on a potential deal, claims Mr Lynch denied until Oracle published notes from the meeting online.It was the Autonomy boss, however, who had the last laugh. A company started with £2,000 borrowed from a man he had met in a Soho pub had pulled off a sale that shocked HP’s own shareholders in its generosity.Only eight months after the HP deal, Mr Lynch was ousted by Meg Whitman, HP’s new chief executive, following disappointing sales for the Autonomy business. A number of Autonomy staff, who left HP shortly before or at the same time as Mr Lynch, complained of a stifling corporate culture at the US company, which they said had been the reason for the poor results.Mr Lynch, who is planning to launch a new investment business in the UK, said his plans would not be derailed by the allegations.“When we finally get to see what is behind [HP’s accusations] it will be cleared up pretty quickly,” he said.George O’Connor, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said it would be unfortunate if HP’s allegations besmirched the UK tech sector as a whole. Apparently siding with Mr Lynch in his battle to defend his reputation, he added: “For me, it’s a story about HP.”Additional reporting by Duncan Robinson and Brooke Masters
258;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;New generation of outsourcers rises in India;;The southern Indian city of Bangalore is widely known as the world’s outsourcing capital, a global IT hub where the likes of Infosys and WIPRO pioneered offshore software development.But now a newer generation of Indian businesses are beating the city’s more established players at their own game – while the fastest-growing among them is not based in India at all.Earlier this month Cognizant Technology Solutions – which is headquartered in New Jersey, although most of its operations are in India – posted results that again exceeded estimates, confirming its rising status in India’s $100bn IT sector.While many competitors struggle as clients in recession-hit North America and Europe trim spending, the Nasdaq-listed group promised revenue growth of at least 20 per cent this year, just under twice the sectoral average.And with revenues of $1.9bn between July and September the company, which was spun off from US business data provider Dun & Bradstreet in the mid-1990s, surpassed Infosys for the second consecutive quarter, putting it on course to become the country’s second-largest IT exporter by revenue in 2013.On the surface Cognizant provides much the same services as its rivals, winning more than half of its income helping large businesses develop and use heavy-duty software applications, often made by the likes of Oracle or SAP.But Francisco D’Souza, the group’s 43-year-old chief executive, says Cognizant’s success also stems from a decision to focus resources on fewer sectors.“We have consciously chosen to serve a small number of clients, meaning our footprint is narrow and very deep,” he says, noting that the company earns around two-thirds of its income from work in just two sectors, financial services and healthcare.Analysts say it also benefits from a second factor: good salespeople. IT outsourcers need to excel both at “hunting” for business and “farming” existing clients for new projects, says Ankur Rudra, an IT analyst at Ambit, a Mumbai-based brokerage.Cognizant has been particularly good at both, in part because it targets profit margins of just 20 per cent – a lower level than rivals such as Infosys, but one that allows its management to offer sweeteners that tempt clients to outsource more business.Crucially the company, in common with other faster-growing outsourcers such as India’s HCL Technologies and US-based Accenture, has also been able to combine the various IT services it offers into more flexible packages, which appeals to cost-conscious blue-chip clients.“Cognizant is trying to do something different,” says one senior IT specialist at a global company familiar with the major Indian groups. “With most of them it is like dealing with an army. They save you money by offering standardised bits of kit at huge scale, but they aren’t good at customising . . . Cognizant doesn’t have that same command and control mentality.”Even so, the company admits luck has also played a part in its rise: demand from its big healthcare and finance clients has held up despite weak growth in North America, while only around 15 per cent of revenues come from Europe, making it less vulnerable to the eurozone slowdown than rivals such as Tata Consultancy Services, India’s leading IT group by sales.Mr D’Souza says the challenge now is to ensure growth in other parts of the world, and that is why he is scouting for acquisitions in both France and Germany, while establishing offices in Asia and Latin America – emerging markets where India’s outsourcers are yet to have much success.At the same time he and others in the industry also face increasingly stiff competition from a new generation of companies, like Salesforce.com, which use the internet to make outsourcing ever cheaper and more flexible.“The whole industry is going to come under threat with the rise of ‘software as a service’ online,” says Vineet Nayer, chief executive of HCL Technologies. “All of the Indian companies want to be the first to turn what we do into a utility model, where people pay just for what they need.”Is Cognizant in time planning to overhaul TCS, and perhaps even threaten IBM, the world’s largest IT services group? Mr D’Souza demurs, saying he tries to avoid talk of league tables. “Globally this industry is still very fragmented, ” he says, with plenty of room for everyone to expand.“What you’ll get is organic revenue growth that is higher than our key competitors,” he adds. It is a pledge that has Bangalore’s outsourcers on notice.
259;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-11-14T15:57:09Z;Sources of wisdom;;Learning from others is a big part of any MBA programme. But this learning is not limited to the professors and fellow students. There is another valuable source which I didn’t fully appreciate until beginning my programme. The source I’m talking about is the wider business community as a whole.In the 15 months of my MBA to date I’d estimate that I’ve met more than a hundred people in various fields external to the business school. This has typically been through speaker events, however on many occasions experienced executives are happy to meet just to give advice based on their own experience. Getting access to this wealth of advice is no mean feat and something which is only really enabled by the fact I am studying for an MBA.Some of my personal highlights from the London Business School speaker events have been as varied as hearing from the great British adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes through to people that have created billion-dollar global brands such as Gene Simmons from the rock band Kiss.But there have been many meetings more directly related to the career paths I am perusing (not that I’ve completely ruled out trekking to the North Pole or forming a rock band as career options just yet!)In this blog I wanted to talk about a recent meeting I had with one of the leading venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, Sequoia Capital, to learn more about what they do.With my fellow MBAs Ralf Metzger and Nikhil Gangaraju, we went to the Sequoia office to meet a partner Bryan Schreier. Those unfamiliar with venture capital may not be aware of the success Sequoia have had investing in start-ups over the past few decades. In the 1970s and 1980s they were busy backing companies such as Apple, Cisco and Oracle. In the 1990s they invested in Paypal and Yahoo, while 2000’s highlights include Google or LinkedIn. More recently names such as Airbnb, Dropbox and Kayak make up a part of their portfolio. When you think about how these companies have changed the world it really is astonishing to find out how Sequoia has supported each of them. The opportunity to sit down with Bryan and learn more about how they work with their portfolio companies is an education that is very difficult to obtain from a textbook.During the meeting we had the chance to discover what it is that Bryan looks for in potential investments, what it means to be on the board of a company such as Dropbox and talk more generally about how start-ups scale and construct large organisation structures in relatively short periods of time.It was an excellent meeting and in my experience this willingness by executives to meet students is something that they are happy to do because they appreciate the value of an MBA and respect the investment that students are making by going to business school.At this key breakpoint in my career having this type of support is proving invaluable in helping me to navigate the choices ahead of me and for that I am very grateful.
260;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-24T22:09:39Z;EMC / SAP – falling tide;Data storage growth’s ebb has been unmistakable;"EMC released worse than expected results on Wednesday, with sales growth below 10 per cent for the first time in years. The company cut full-year targets, but no one seemed to care. The stock ended the day almost flat.Investors in the $50bn US data storage company must have seen the disappointment coming. Yes, companies that sell information technology to businesses have been good investments in recent years. If there are three basic kinds of customer (individuals, companies and governments), “enterprise IT” companies sell to the kind with the strongest balance sheets. The biggest names in the industry – IBM, Oracle and SAP – have all easily outperformed the S&P over the past half decade.All the same, the growth slowdown has been unmistakable in third-quarter results released before EMC’s. IBM’s revenues sank, even in its best business, software. Microsoft’s business software division slowed sharply between the second and third quarters. And so on. Some companies have done better than others, of course. The most remarkable is SAP, which also reported yesterday. Its revenues, excluding currency benefits, grew 13 per cent and it tweaked its sales targets up a bit. It is clearly slowing less than global peers. One reason it has managed to defy the falling tide is that it is a pure software vendor.Software investments, in general, offer customers better returns over short periods than hardware or hybrid hardware/software “solutions” offered by companies like EMC. And, as Bernstein Research has pointed out, SAP has developed something of a sub-speciality in software products that offer quick returns – cash or inventory management tools, for example. SAP, in other words, may be succeeding by going after customers too frightened about the global economy to make any long-term bets. Good for them; dreary news for the rest of us.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
261;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-22T17:48:18Z;GE acts to counteract ‘fiscal cliff’ fears;Group refinances $5bn in bonds to strengthen balance sheet;"General Electric, the US industrial group, said it had refinanced $5bn of bonds reaching maturity early next year to avoid any market turbulence ahead of a possible looming “fiscal cliff” of tax rises and spending cuts.Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said the company had been strengthening its balance sheet to prepare for the risk of “choppy” conditions early next year if automatic tax increases and sharply lower spending come into effect as a result of the failure of Congress to agree on a budget deal.Unless Congress can agree on a deal to prevent them, the prospect known as the “fiscal cliff” will take effect in January, threatening to tip the US back into recession.This month GE sold $7bn of bonds, in the parent company’s first such sale for almost five years, refinancing $5bn of debt maturing next February.Mr Sherin said: “We issued it in October so we don’t have to worry about what happens if the fiscal cliff is not resolved. If it’s choppy, we are prepared.”The company was battered by the financial crisis in 2008-09, losing its triple A credit rating and being forced to cut its dividend.GE’s moves in the debt market are closely watched by other companies, bankers say, and its effort to strengthen its liquidity is likely to be followed.Edward Marrinan, head of macro credit strategy at RBS Securities, said: “It’s hard to fault GE for engaging in what appears to be an opportunistic risk management exercise ahead of uncertainties presented by the fiscal cliff.”With interest rates at historic lows and strong investor demand for high-grade corporate debt, markets are attractive for large financially stable companies seeking to borrow.The yield on the Barclays US Corporate Investment Grade Index reached a record low of 2.66 per cent on Friday.Large corporations last week sold $26bn in investment grade bonds in the US market, according to Dealogic, the information service. It was one of the strongest weeks for issuance this year, as borrowers sought to lock in low rates ahead of any potential increase in market volatility.Among the companies launching large bond deals were Oracle, the software company; United Healthcare, the insurer; and Xstrata, the Switzerland-based mining group.In its first deal in more than two years, Oracle sold $5bn at some of the lowest yields ever recorded in the corporate bond market. The company said the proceeds would be used to refinance existing debt and fund share buybacks.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie"
262;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-21T21:22:09Z;Technology groups snap up City offices;;The declining importance of banks in the City of London office market will be highlighted by figures published on Monday revealing that technology-based businesses have become the largest buyers of new floor space in the Square Mile.Technology, media and telecoms (TMT) groups leased 931,000 sq ft of City office space during the first nine months of the year. The figure, an increase of 40 per cent over the same period in 2011, compares with 620,000 sq ft taken up by banks, according to data from Knight Frank, the property services company.Banks have matched falling staff numbers and pressure to cut costs by moving to cheaper business districts, such as Canary Wharf. TMT groups, meanwhile, have outgrown the restricted space of the fringe office markets around the City and have snapped up a quarter of all leases signed in the Square Mile this year.James Roberts, head of commercial research at Knight Frank, said: “This is part of a global phenomenon, as we are seeing rising TMT demand being reported in Chicago, New York, Dublin, and Berlin, as well as London.”“The City is emerging as a focus point as it has the transport, telecommunications, and power infrastructure to support this growing sector,” he added.As well as its convenience, rental levels in the City have remained more affordable than other central London office markets.Since the middle of 2009 – the nadir of the commercial property market – rents in the City have risen from £42.50 per sq ft to about £55 today. In contrast, Covent Garden rents have risen from £45 per sq ft to £65, while Mayfair rents have gone from £65 per sq ft to £95 over the three years. The result has been to push many non-financial companies into the City.Major deals this year include Skype taking 88,000 sq ft at Waterhouse Square, Weber Shandwick, the communications group, signing 65,000 sq ft in the same building, and Oracle acquiring 22,000 sq ft at 1 South Place. Google, meanwhile, this month signed a £550m deal to build a new, 700,000 sq ft UK headquarters next to Kings Cross station.TMT companies are on course to absorb an additional 1.2m sq ft by 2014, an area twice the size of the Shard, London’s tallest skyscraper, according to a recent study by BNP Paribas Real Estate. The demand, if it materialises, will provide a tonic to London’s commercial property landlords, who are suffering from declining uptake from other sectors.
263;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-11T23:24:51Z;Workday raises $637m ahead of debut;;Workday, a HR software provider, has raised $637m in what is set to be the biggest technology initial public offering since Facebook’s troubled listing.In a sign of interest for Workday’s offering, the company has priced the offering at $28. Workday had said earlier this week that it was expecting to sell its shares for $24-$26, above the initial level of $21-$24.The equity offering would give the company a valuation of $4.5bn when it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.A successful start to trading would cap a dramatic comeback by Dave Duffield, Workday’s co-founder, who lost his last company, PeopleSoft, to a hostile takeover by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in 2004.Unlike most cloud-based software companies, which started out by selling to small businesses, Workday aimed from day one at multinational companies, giving it a foot in the door of a much bigger market and putting it on a collision course with software giants such as SAP and Oracle.“It just seems to be the right delivery model at the right time,” said Paul Hamerman, software analyst at Forrester Research. “A lot of big companies are becoming fatigued by keeping their systems up to date.” Workday should also see more growth as it moves further beyond human resources software into financial and other applications, he added.Other indications suggest that demand for business technology companies remains robust after smaller “software as a service” IPOs enjoyed large gains in their first months on public markets this year.ServiceNow, a cloud-computing management resources company, has nearly doubled since it priced its shares at $18 and raised $241m from its IPO in August.The business technology sector has managed over the past year to outshine other tech IPOs, which have had mixed results. Some of the biggest names in the broader tech sector, such as Facebook, Groupon and Zynga, have declined heavily amid investor scrutiny.Workday plans to sell 22.75m shares and is expected to use the proceeds to expand its business. Using a dual-class share structure, Mr Duffield and Aneel Bhusri, co-chief executive, will own about 67 cent per cent of the voting power in the company after it goes public.The company is backed by Greylock Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital fund. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are the lead underwriters for the offering.
264;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-09T21:41:36Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street sell-offs;;Technology stocks, including Apple, led a Wall Street sell-off, with most of the sector’s heavyweight names dragging the rest of the market lower in a volatile trading session.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent to 3,065.02.“We may be seeing a psychological sell-off in the broader market based on what’s been going on with Apple,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.“It’s a pattern we’ve seen before, when the company’s stock tends to sell off after a product release. The momentum on Apple has been so negative over the past week, it will be important to see how investors react going into the holiday season.”Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, dropped as much as 1.8 per cent but recovered somewhat to close 0.4 per cent lower at $635.85.The stock is now 9.4 per cent lower from its peak of $702, reached on the day its iPhone 5 was released internationally.Microsoft shares fell 1.7 per cent to $29.28 and Google lost 1.8 per cent to $744.09. In an effort to avoid an antitrust war with Brussels, the search group offered to label information from its in-house services that are included in its search results pages.Amazon shares fell 3.1 per cent to $250.96 after news reports that Walmart began testing same-day delivery from its own stores, directly challenging the world’s largest online retailer.Oracle, the software group, was also hit badly, down 1.7 per cent to $30.65.Shares in Netflix, the subscription video service, were down 10.85 per cent to $65.54 after analysts at Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “buy”.Analysts said that with the 31 per cent rally in the past two weeks, “the risks outweigh the reward heading into the third quarter”.The stock gained more than 10 per cent during the previous session after analysts at Morgan Stanley said it was undervalued.Research In Motion, the BlackBerry maker, was another big loser, down 5.3 per cent to $7.80. The stock rebounded off its record lows recently after the company said it added 2m new subscribers during the third quarter.Intel shares fell 2.7 per cent to $21.90 after analysts at Nomura downgraded the chipmaker’s stock, saying: “Shares have tracked the direction of gross margin over the past decade. And thus far in 2012 that trend has continued.”In broader markets, US equities fell sharply ahead of results from aluminium producer Alcoa and from Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut – both seen by investors as setting the tone for the third-quarter earnings season.Most analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to have declined during the quarter as the global slowdown took its toll.The S&P 500 index fell 1 per cent to 1,441.48, retreating from its multiyear highs reached last week. Nine of 10 major sectors were in negative territory, with only energy registering modest gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 13,473.91.Alcoa shares closed 0.1 higher to $9.13 but rose 0.5 per cent in after-hours trading after the aluminium producer beat analysts’ expectations.

265;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-08T20:03:31Z;Cisco cuts ties with ZTE after Iran sales;;Cisco said it had cut ties with ZTE after an internal probe revealed that the Chinese company had sold Cisco’s equipment to Iran.Sales of US technology products to Iran have been banned by the US government, but ZTE is understood to have sold Cisco internet routers to the company that controls the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI).Reuters revealed this year that such sales were taking place, a report that led to international investigations by both companies, as well as investigations by the US Commerce Department, a congressional committee and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Cisco, which has been in a distribution agreement with ZTE for the past seven years, confirmed on Monday that it now had “no current relationship with ZTE”.ZTE was a reseller of Cisco equipment in Asia, excluding Japan, and the Middle East.ZTE, which is predominantly owned by Chinese state entities, said it was “highly concerned with the matter and is communicating with Cisco. At the same time, ZTE is actively co-operating with the US government about the probe regarding Iran. We believe this issue will be properly addressed”.The break with Cisco came as ZTE, together with Huawei, was named as a threat to national security by a US congressional intelligence committee. The two have been barred from supplying equipment to US government networks.Last month, both ZTE and Huawei were criticised by the US House of Representatives intelligence committee for allegedly stealing trade secrets from US companies, such as Cisco and Motorola, and for posing security threats to critical US infrastructure. Executives from both companies denied the claims at the committee hearings.Cisco has had a rocky relationship with Huawei and ZTE. The US internet infrastructure group filed a lawsuit against Huawei in 2003 for copying its intellectual property but dropped the suit a year later.Reuters said ZTE supplied other US-based technology to Iran, including HP computer parts and printers, Microsoft Windows software, Dell flatscreen monitors, Oracle database products and Symantec antivirus software.ZTE reported a steep drop in profits for the June quarter. It blamed the 85 per cent fall in net profits year-on-year on the eurozone crisis and poor consumer demand, but analysts in the industry said blocks on supplying equipment to countries were taking their toll.
266;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-05T18:30:45Z;Software’s gunfighter is out for revenge;Workday’s founder has ridden successive waves of technology, writes Richard Waters;Ask anyone in the software business about Dave Duffield and, sooner or later, they will say the same thing: even if he is not driven entirely by revenge, it is right up there among his motivations. Wealth and ego have turned today’s software and internet billionaires into larger-than-life figures and in this world, the script inhabited by Mr Duffield reads like a Jacobean revenge tragedy or a spaghetti western.The object of his fixation: Larry Ellison, America’s Cup winner, number six on Forbes’ list of the world’s richest people and a man whose presence has cast a baleful shadow across the path of many a software entrepreneur before. Having lost his last business to Mr Ellison’s Oracle after a heated takeover battle, Mr Duffield is bent on clawing his way back to the top.A Californian now on his fourth start-up, Mr Duffield may be little known outside the technology sector, but he can lay claim to one of the software industry’s longest winning streaks. If things go to plan, he will next week secure a second billion-dollar windfall with the initial public offering of Workday, the HR software provider and his latest company.At 72, he is also proof that not all up-and-coming software billionaires are in their twenties, wear hoodies or were weaned on the internet. That Workday’s stock market debut is the biggest since this spring’s Facebook debacle– and that it marks a swing in Wall Street favour away from hotshot consumer internet concerns towards more staid tech companies that sell to businesses – is fitting.The origins of Mr Duffield’s first big killing lie in PeopleSoft, which he cofounded in the 1980s at the already advanced age of 47. The company, which made software for human resources departments, was eventually ripped from his grasp in 2004 after an 18-month fight.Oracle’s $10.3bn acquisition of PeopleSoft was to launch software’s “selfish decade”, as some leading companies in what was still a young business turned to acquisitions to become global powers, says Steve Lucas, a senior executive at SAP, the German software group.Like an old gunfighter, Mr Duffield, already at an age when most people have retired, did not take long to plot his comeback. No matter that, with three children from his first marriage and seven more adopted with his second wife, he had more than enough to keep him busy. Within months he had reunited with PeopleSoft protégé Aneel Bhusri to set up Workday, doing the same business – with a twist. Rather than ship its software directly to customers, Workday sells internet access to its technology, joining a new wave of so-called cloud computing companies that is reinventing business technology.Even Mr Duffield’s supporters were wary about the motives for his comeback. “My first thought was, if you’re after revenge, make sure you dig two graves first,” says Marten Mickos, a software chief executive who discussed a partnership soon after Workday was founded.“Part of his strategy appears to be a ‘Get Larry’ strategy, there is an animus,” adds Zach Nelson, boss of NetSuite, a software company that counts Mr Ellison as its controlling shareholder. But Mr Nelson warns: “If your business strategy is driven by getting Larry, you should be careful. Larry gets people very exercised about him, while he stays focused on the business.”Yet Mr Duffield, an engineer who began his career at IBM before striking out with his first start-up in the 1970s, was not about to lose to his nemesis a second time. As he told the FT before filing to take Workday public, he had no intention of exposing one of his companies to the acquisitive Oracle boss again.Using the sort of dual-class voting structure made popular in Silicon Valley by companies such as Google and Facebook, he and Mr Bhusri issued themselves special stock through which they control two-thirds of Workday’s shares. The company is now headed for an IPO that will value it at $3.85bn, if it hits targets set last week, valuing Mr Duffield’s stake at a cool $1.75bn.Unusually for the insular world of business software, where infighting and professional jealousies rule, there are few who begrudge him his success. That has much to do with his reputation as one of the few empathetic managers in an industry better known for tyrannical bosses who use fear and greed to drive their developers to heights of productivity.At PeopleSoft, Mr Duffield used a touchy-feely approach to win over his staff, in the process creating a cult of personality. After Oracle bought PeopleSoft, he pledged $10m of his own money to help workers who were laid off. “Not every high-tech CEO likes people that well – some of them don’t like people at all,” says Mr Mickos.Mismanagement and rounds of lay-offs at PeopleSoft while Mr Duffield was still in charge may have taken some of the shine off his image, but to be cast as the good guy – as surely as Mr Ellison has been branded software’s bad boy – has its advantages. “If you’re going to get stuck with a reputation, that’s not a bad one to have,” says Mr Nelson.Above all, it is his ability to ride successive waves of technology that has made Mr Duffield stand out. Through a series of reinventions – adapting his idea for HR software from an early mainframe start-up to PeopleSoft, which rode the rise of the PC as a business tool, before making the shift to the internet with Workday – he has avoided the familiar fate of becoming trapped by a particular technology.“What’s amazing about Dave is he’s been successful in every era of computing,” says Mr Lucas.Whether his latest act will get him back to the top of the software world is another matter. It is too late for a newcomer to break into an industry now dominated by a handful of large companies, says Mr Lucas of SAP – himself one of the big-company executives who has a vested interest in the established order. In view of his record, however, it wouldn’t do to count the indefatigable Mr Duffield out.The writer is the FT’s West Coast editor
267;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Tech groups hunt for London offices;;The UK’s fast-growing technology, media and telecommunications sector is set to create a surge in demand for London office space during the next two years, offering a boon to tenant-deprived property companies.TMT companies are on course to absorb an additional 1.2m sq ft by 2014, an area twice the size of the Shard, London’s tallest skyscraper, according to a study by BNP Paribas.The wave of demand, underpinned by companies such as Google, Skype and Oracle, will be welcomed by commercial property landlords as they struggle with falling space requirements across other sectors.The take-up is also expected to spread across the city centre, rather than cluster around Old Street – an area called Silicon Roundabout and the traditional hub of the UK’s TMT industry.Paul Henwood, of BNP Paribas real estate’s investment team, said that companies would target emerging locations, such as King’s Cross, Southbank and Stratford as well as Old Street and the City of London.“There is a great opportunity for investors to look more seriously at these kinds of locations as well as the traditional core markets but the entry price will be the key factor to a successful outcome,” he added.A number of large TMT groups are rumoured to be looking for space in London, following the lead of Amazon, which in July signed terms to occupy an eight-storey office block in the City.Google is thought to be considering building a 725,000 sq ft office campus in Kings Cross, which would be a boost to the redevelopment of the 67 acres of disused railway yards and wasteland behind the station.However, while some TMT groups are seeking new addresses in the areas around the centre of London, many others are turning to the capital’s most established business district – the City.TMT companies took up 731,000 sq ft of new space in the City during the first half of this year, compared with 367,000 sq ft for the same period last year, according to Knight Frank, the property services group. This accounted for more than a quarter of all new City leases signed during the first half of the year.
268;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-01T22:56:57Z;Workday eyes $3.8bn valuation in IPO;;Workday, a lossmaking US business software company, has paved the way for the biggest technology IPO since the troubled Facebook listing, as it announced plans for a stock sale that would value it at up to $3.85bn.Workday’s arrival on Wall Street marks a swing into favour for business technology IPOs after the bumpy ride of consumer companies like Facebook, Zynga and Groupon, while also rekindling one of the most bitter personal rivalries in the software industry.Dave Duffield, Workday’s co-founder, lost his last company, PeopleSoft, to a hostile takeover by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in 2004. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Mr Duffield, who had spent nearly 20 years building PeopleSoft into the biggest maker of software for human resources managers, vowed that he would never expose any of his businesses again to take over by Mr Ellison.Along with Aneel Bhusri, another PeopleSoft executive with whom Mr Duffield shares the chief executive title, the 72-year-old software entrepreneur will control 67 per cent of the voting power in the company after it goes public.The arrangement echoes other recent tech IPOs that have left founders like Mark Zuckerberg in full control of their companies after listing. The arrangement flies in the face of standard Wall Street practice but has won strong support in Silicon Valley, where it is seen as a way to give founders breathing room to build their companies without fear of hostile acquisitions or attack from activist shareholders.Though it has become one of the leading names among the new group of so-called software-as-a-service companies, which sell access to their technology over the web, Workday warned in a regulatory filing that it did not expect to earn a profit for the foreseeable future. The company reported sales in the six months to July 31 of $119.5m, up 118 per cent compared with a year before, while its net loss rose to $46.9m from $36.3m.Despite the losses, Wall Street has grown increasingly comfortable in recent years with tech concerns like Workday which rely on subscription income rather than upfront sales of software. The arrangement forces them to defer some revenues to later years, making them unprofitable during periods of rapid growth since sales costs are reported immediately.The Workday IPO will give Wall Street investors a chance to bet on a sector that has already attracted high valuations from corporate buyers. Last December SAP bought Workday rival Success Factors for $3.4bn while Oracle paid $1.9bn for Taleo, another rival, in February.In one sign of potential investor demand, ServiceNow, which uses cloud computing to help companies manage resources, has seen its stock price nearly double since its offering at $18 a share in June.Workday said it plans to sell 22.75m shares at between $21 and $24 each, raising up to $546m for the company. The company is backed by Greylock Partners, and has listed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as lead underwriters for the offering
269;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-10-01T20:39:42Z;US manufacturing activity lifts Fastenal;;Fastenal rose on Monday as investors piled into the construction supplier after data on the US manufacturing sector showed activity in the world’s largest economy expanded in September.Shares in the company, which makes nails, screws and other fasteners, have dropped some 17.6 per cent in the past six months as global growth concerns have weighed on markets.Fastenal climbed 3.7 per cent to $44.60 as US equities moved higher in morning trading after the Institute for Supply Management said activity in the US expanded last month for the first time since May.That reading, which came at a level above what most expected, helped investors brush aside concerns from earlier in the day when China and Japan reported a contraction in their manufacturing activity.Analysts said the data lent some optimism to US growth forecasts.Millan Mulraine, strategist at TD Securities, said: “Given the impressive performance of this indicator in correctly gauging the tone of overall economic activity, we take some encouragement from the unexpected bounce in the headline index, which we see as a signal of a possible turning point in the recovery.”The S&P 500, which had dropped for two consecutive weeks, rose as much as 1.1 per cent before steadily giving up most of its advances in the afternoon. The benchmark US index finished the day up 0.3 per cent to 1,444.49.Monday marked the first day of the fourth quarter, and analysts at S&P Capital IQ said a look at historical data revealed that US equities tended to post their best performances late in the year.“Dating back to 1900, the S&P 500 has notched an average fourth-quarter monthly gain of 0.8 per cent versus only a 0.6 per cent average monthly gain overall,” said Alec Young, global equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.Financial stocks were leading the day’s risers as Goldman Sachs moved 2.8 per cent higher to $116.86. A report at the weekend suggested the US investment bank could stand to gain significantly if global capital markets conditions improved.The S&P 500 financial index was 0.5 per cent higher, as it pared gains from earlier in the day along with the rest of the market but still finished among the best performing sector groups on the benchmark index for the day.Bank of America, which agreed to pay a $2.4bn fine last week to settle a shareholder lawsuit alleging it concealed information about the financial health of Merrill Lynch, the securities group it bought in 2008, climbed 1.5 per cent to $8.96.JPMorgan Chase added 1.2 per cent to $40.97 as the bank said its chief investment officer for North America would leave to start her own hedge fund. JPMorgan Chase’s office of the CIO has faced strong criticism since it disclosed a multibillion-dollar trading loss earlier this year.American Express, the global payments company, added 1.5 per cent to $57.74 despite news the company would refund $85m to customers to resolve charges that three of its subsidiaries broke consumer protection laws.The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.1 per cent to 3,113.53.Apple declined 1.2 per cent to $659.39.Oracle climbed 0.7 per cent to $31.77 as the software company said it would announce its latest cloud computing business. Meanwhile, some of its investors worried that it risked falling behind rival providers such as Amazon in the business.Amazon, which made its boldest entry into financial services as it announced a tie-up between its cloud services business and Nasdaq OMX last week, lost 0.9 per cent to $252.01.ServiceNow, a cloud-computing software company, lost 5.7 per cent to $36.48 as its shares were downgraded by analysts at UBS. The company’s shares have risen to about double their initial public offering price of $18 in June.Google was up 1 per cent to $761.78 as the internet search and advertising company’s market capitalisation surpassed that of Microsoft’s and inched closer to $250bn.

The stock was 2.4 per cent higher on the week.In the broader markets, US equities gave up early gains to close flat and the leading indices ended the week roughly where they started it.Investors started the trading session optimistic after welcoming news reports that Spain is negotiating the terms of a bailout.“With Spain back at the negotiating table and central banks around the world serious about holding rates low, it is not surprising that markets are positive,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment strategist at ING Financial Services.Mr Zemsky pointed out that the lack of alternative investments opportunities and low returns on sovereign and high-yield bonds made US equities attractive.Jonathan Golub, chief US equities strategist at UBS, was more cautious about the recent rally in stocks.“There is a battle between fundamentals, which appear to be stuck in the mud and large-scale central bank intervention. The question is whether such action is going to change the underlying economic fundamentals.”The S&P 500 index retreated from the multiyear highs reached last week when traders responded enthusiastically to the Fed’s further bond-purchasing plan.The benchmark index closed fractionally lower at 1,460.15 on Friday, giving up earlier gains.

Apple sold 2m new iPhones in the first 24 hours of the pre-order period ahead of the retail launch in spite of complaints from some users about the smartphone’s maps app.The stock gained 1.3 per cent on the week and is trading more than 72 per cent higher since the beginning of the year.Oracle shares were sharply higher in the morning but then gave up much of the gains to trade 0.7 per cent higher at $32.47, but were heading to close the week 1.5 per cent lower after quarterly results fell short of analysts’ expectations.The software group, which released earnings results after the market close on Thursday, suffered from declining hardware revenues and a strengthening dollar.Shares in Darden Restaurants, which operates the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains, rose 4.5 per cent to $57.21 and added 5.9 per cent over the week after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations.AutoNation, the car retailer, rallied 3.6 per cent to $43.02 after analysts at Bank of America upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, citing the strong pace of new vehicle sales for 2012. The stock added 1.8 per cent over the week.Homebuilder stocks made substantial gains over the five trading days on the back of improving housing data.

The company warned of lower profits as demand for coal fell across the US.Among banking stocks, Morgan Stanley suffered the most losses over the past week, falling 6.4 per cent to $17.08. Goldman Sachs also gave up 3.8 per cent over the past week and traded fractionally lower at $116.72.
271;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-09-20T22:53:24Z;Stronger dollar takes toll on Oracle;;Oracle reported quarterly sales that fell short of Wall Street expectations as it suffered from declining hardware revenues and a strengthening dollar.Oracle, which focuses on software applications and services for business, said revenues fell 2 per cent year-on-year to $8.2bn, below analysts’ forecasts of $8.4bn.Hardware products sales fell 24 per cent from $1.03bn to $0.78bn as Oracle continued to struggle to absorb Sun Microsystems, acquired in 2010. Sun has hit Oracle’s operating margins as well with low-margin products that were becoming commoditised.Safra Catz, chief financial officer, pointed out at an analysts’ conference call that margins improved two percentage points in the quarter to August 31 to 44 from 42 per cent a year earlier, on a non-GAAP basis. That improvement helped lift net profit to $2.03bn, compared to $1.84bn last time.“We’re clearly on our way. Even though we have a $3bn-$4bn hardware company buried in us, we will get to our pre-Sun, pre-hardware operating margins very soon and clearly we took another step in that direction this quarter,” she said.Mark Hurd, Oracle president, emphasised that newer high-end hardware products such as Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics and other engineered systems grew more than 100 per cent in the quarter. He expected sales to double for the full year to $1bn and a new cloud business was also expected to deliver $1bn in revenues.“These two businesses will drive Oracle’s growth for years to come,” he said.Ms Catz said currency movements in Oracle’s first fiscal quarter to August – Oracle’s seasonally weakest of its year – reduced new software licence revenues by 5 per cent, total revenues by 5 per cent and earnings per share by 6 per cent.Oracle reported non-GAAP earnings of 53 cents a share, in line with Wall Street expectations.New software licences were up 11 per cent, rose 16 per cent in the US, 12 per cent in Asia, with Europe remaining weak with growth of only 1 per cent.Larry Ellison, chief executive, emphasised Oracle’s expanding cloud services business. He said the Silicon Valley company would announce an “infrastructure as a service” offering at its annual Oracle OpenWorld conference in San Francisco at the end of this month.This would complete the three tiers of cloud computing, he said. Oracle already offered software as a service (SAAS), with enterprise resource planning and other applications, and platform as a service, with its core database applications.Oracle will also announce its latest database software –12c – at OpenWorld. “Our primary competitor IBM, continues to lose share to us every quarter,” said Mr Ellison.Oracle shares traded flat at $32.26 in extended trading in New York. They have risen 25 per cent so far this year.
272;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

The retailer’s comments that the second half of the year would be similar to the first were also discouraging.“Given the stock run over the past month, we believe the stock reflects more optimistic near-term assumptions than are likely,” wrote analysts at Atlantic Equities.“While we expect the JC Penney stock to be volatile over the near-term (partly due to the 40 per cent short interest), we remain ‘neutral’ and will look for clearer direction heading into the new year.”Bed Bath & Beyond was also among the laggards on US equity markets, falling 9.7 per cent to $62.09 after the home-furnishing chain reported second-quarter results below Wall Street’s expectations.By contrast, ConAgra Foods rose 6.2 per cent to $27.24 after the quarterly profits beat analysts’ expectations and the company raised its guidance and increased dividends.In the wider market, stocks recouped earlier losses and major indices were little changed on Thursday amid a batch of disappointing economic news from the US, Europe and China.Initial claims for US jobless benefits fell less than expected with the less volatile four-week average reports trending upwards, the eurozone private sector contracted sharply, and manufacturing in China continued to slow.“We are in a period when euphoria from the actions of the largest central banks has faded,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial.Mr Canally added that investors are now waiting and wondering why China had not acted yet. “While immediate risks from Europe are off the table, macro risks are still there. Investors are concerned about economic and company-specific fundamentals heading into the third-quarter earnings season.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed virtually flat at 1,460.27 after falling as much as 0.6 per cent in the morning. Industrials and financials sectors were the main laggards, down 0.9 and 0.6 per cent respectively.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent up at 13,597.16 after trading in narrow range, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 3,175.96.United States Steel and Union Pacific Corporation were hit hard, down 3.5 per cent to $20.13 and 3.3 per cent to $120.95 respectively. Norfolk Southern, the railroad operator, tumbled 9 per cent to $66.11 as the company’s forecasts came in below analysts’ expectations. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, seen as a barometer of the economic health fell 2.7 per cent.Banking stocks were also in focus after reports that regulators were seeking more time to complete their investigations of banks allegedly involved in manipulation of Libor and other key interest rates.Meanwhile, UBS cut its ratings on Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to “neutral” from “buy”, saying these banks had fully participated in the sector’s rally.Citigroup lost 1.1 per cent to $33.81, Goldman fell 1.2 per cent to $117.63 and Morgan Stanley slid 2 per cent to $17.21.JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, also fell 0.2 per cent to $41.25.Bank of America fell 1 per cent to $9.19 amid reports that the bank was speeding up a planned reduction of 30,000 staff to counter falling revenues by cutting costs. The bank was said to be planning to cut more than 15,000 jobs by the end of the year.In earnings news, Jefferies, the midsize investment bank, reported higher third-quarter profit as revenue from trading activity more than doubled. The stock, however, fell 7.3 per cent to $14.52, as some investors expressed concerns over the company’s long-term growth trajectory.In the technology sector, Oracle shares closed 1.6 per cent lower at $32.26, but continued to fall in after-hours trading following the release of quarterly earnings. The software maker’s revenues and earnings came in below analysts’ expectations.Oracle’s results are closely watched by analysts, who expect the company to provide some clues as to whether corporations will increase spending on technology at the end of the year.Adobe rose 4.3 per cent to $34.53 as analysts at RBC Capital Markets upgraded it to “outperform”, even after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software issued a lower outlook for the current quarter. The company said its customers’ faster-than-expected switch to its new subscription-based model will dent its earnings.AOL shares fell 0.3 per cent to $34.48. The internet company appointed Karen Dykstra, a former hedge fund executive, as chief financial officer on Wednesday.Sprint Nextel fell 2.2 per cent to $5.44 even after the fourth-largest mobile provider said it had sold 1m phones that support LTE, a high-speed wireless technology it is building into its network.Nike said its board had approved to use cash to buy back $8bn in shares over four years on top of an existing $5bn share buyback programme. Its stock fell 1 per cent to $96.72.General Motors shares fell 1.3 per cent to $24.42 as talks between the Canadian Auto Workers union and the carmaker stalled, with a CAW official calling a quick breakthrough on an overall deal “unlikely”.GM will also this week begin to bid for Ally Financial’s auto-lending operations in Europe and Latin America.
274;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-08-23T21:04:59Z;Tech stocks – weather alert;The summer rally made sense given the fundamentals;"It’s been a sunny summer rally – the S&P 500 has returned 11 per cent since June 1 – and technology companies have been at the front. The tech stocks in the S&P are a percentage point ahead of the index as a whole. And the outperformance remains even if you exclude Apple. Only the energy sector has done better.Tech’s outperformance is persistent: it has beaten the index solidly over the past five years. Given the dreary world economy, however, it is wise to keep an eye on the fundamentals. The 10 biggest tech companies by market cap after Apple – a group that includes US giants such as Cisco and EMC and international ones such as Samsung and SAP – continue to report solid numbers. All of them reported higher earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in their latest quarter against the previous year. Some are seeing decelerating revenue growth (IBM, Microsoft, Oracle) but the pattern is not pervasive. Valuations are sane: forward price to earnings multiples remain near or below the market average, with a few slightly pricier exceptions (Google, Qualcomm).The arguments for owning big tech companies remain. They sell globally; their biggest buyers are corporations, which have stronger balance sheets than consumers; and growth trends from cloud computing to mobile are going strong.Cautious comments by the most cyclical of the tech companies – the chipmakers – are worrisome, though. In its second-quarter report, Intel tempered its sales outlook and waved towards macroeconomic weakness. Taiwan Semiconductor’s management stated that the economic outlook is “deteriorating” and expects revenue to dip in the fourth quarter. The summer rally made sense given the fundamentals.

276;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-08-03T00:57:58Z;SAP agrees to pay Oracle at least $436m;;SAP has agreed to pay arch-rival Oracle a minimum of $436m in compensation and legal fees to cover the illegal access by one of its US subsidiaries to Oracle’s computer systems.The amount could rise higher, however, if Oracle succeeds in an appeal to have the original jury award of $1.3bn in the case reinstated.The agreement is the latest turn in a set of high-profile cases that have thrown a legal spotlight on Oracle this year. Earlier this week, the US database software company lost a breach of contract case brought by Hewlett-Packard that is likely to lead to a damages claim of more than $1bn. It also lost a copyright claim against Google over that company’s Android operating system.The SAP case stems from the German company’s admission that TomorrowNow, a US subsidiary, had gained access to Oracle’s systems by illegally using passwords it obtained from Oracle customers.A jury in federal court in Oakland, California last year awarded Oracle $1.3bn, but the judge hearing the case later said the damages were excessive and that SAP should pay no more than $272m. Oracle executives appearing at the trial, who included chief executive Larry Ellison, had given “self-serving testimony” about the amount they would have demanded from TomorrowNow to allow it legal access, the judge said.The companies said on Thursday that they had agreed to set the minimum level of damages at $306m, while Oracle said that it had already received $120m in legal fees from SAP.The agreement will remove the need for a retrial of the case and allow Oracle to move ahead with its appeal to have the full $1.3bn award reinstated.
277;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-08-01T22:47:22Z;Oracle faces billion dollar bill from HP;;US software maker Oracle is facing a damages claim that could run into billions of dollars following its loss of a breach of contract lawsuit brought by Silicon Valley rival Hewlett-Packard.The legal defeat is the latest twist in a business partnership that has turned increasingly bitter as Oracle has invaded HP’s turf by moving into the hardware market. The enmity intensified after Oracle hired Mark Hurd, HP’s ousted chief executive, to run its own hardware business, prompting another lawsuit from HP and a war of words from Oracle boss Larry Ellison.The latest judgment sprang from Oracle’s announcement last March that it would stop producing versions of its software to run on Itanium processors, which sit at the heart of HP’s highest-priced computer systems. The decision was seen as a devastating blow to the Itanium technology, given the wide use of Oracle’s database technology by large corporations and governments.An independent analysis prepared for HP has put the damages suffered by the company in the form of lost sales at $500m since Oracle’s announcement, with the total loss potentially rising to $4bn by 2020, according to a person familiar with HP’s position. The claim has yet to be made public, but is set to be introduced in a second phase of the trial in which damages will be assessed.Together with the punitive damages that HP will be in a position to claim as a result of the breach of contract ruling, the eventual claim is likely to reach “in the billions of dollars”, said Rob Enderle, a tech industry analyst.Oracle said it planned to appeal against the decision and continue to press a cross-complaint against HP. “HP’s argument turns the concept of Silicon Valley ‘partnerships’ upside down,” it said in a statement.In an added twist to the Itanium dispute, the case turned on a single sentence in the settlement agreement that the two companies reached last year to end the dispute over Oracle’s hiring of Mr Hurd. In it, the two companies agreed to continue supporting each others’ products.“We know that Oracle did not give up its fundamental right to make platform engineering decisions in the 27 words HP cites from the settlement of an unrelated employment agreement,” Oracle said on Wednesday.If it fails to have the judgment overturned, Oracle will also face considerable costs to adapt, or “port”, future versions of its software to run on the Itanium platform, said Mr Enderle.
278;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-08-01T18:12:02Z;Cloud threatens to rain on Silicon Valley giants;New landscape changes technological foundations of IT systems;"A decade ago, Larry Ellison, the outspoken head of Oracle, declared an end to innovation in the software industry. No big new companies, he told the Financial Times, would ever rise up to challenge companies like his in the market for so-called “enterprise” software, used by companies and governments everywhere.That message doesn’t seem to have got through to the restless venture capitalists and entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley. Some serious amounts of money have been staked of late on the assumption that Mr Ellison is wrong, and even he is now having to move smartly to stay ahead.This week it was the turn of cloud storage company Box, which has just raised $125m. In all, Box has now raised $280m – more even than its better-known competitor, Dropbox– and carries a private valuation tag of $1.2bn.Such numbers give the lie to one of the prevailing myths in the tech world: that anyone with a laptop and an account with Amazon Web Services can turn themselves into an instant software multinational. Making it in enterprise software has always been a long and expensive slog.At least the system for financing and building software companies like these seems to be working well. While Wall Street has been rethinking its recent enthusiasm for Facebook and all things to do with social media, its affection for enterprise software is untarnished. The stars from the latest round of initial public offerings – all of them trading comfortably above their offer prices – are companies such as LinkedIn, whose main value is as a hiring solutions provider to businesses; ServiceNow, which makes software for managing IT systems; and Splunk, a service for handling large volumes of data.While not getting as far as a public listing, others have been selling for billions. The latest deals include VMware’s purchase of Nicira, which makes software to automate data centres, and Microsoft’s acquisition of Yammer, a networking and collaboration service for office workers.Two interdependent forces have served to open up the market that Mr Ellison declared to be closed a decade ago. One is the cloud. Accessing a service online, rather than having to install software on a company’s own computer, not only changes the economics of owning software, it also opens a new route to customers.The resistance of many in the corporate world to entrusting their data to cloud services is fast eroding. One sign of how much attitudes have already changed among traditionally conversative chief information officers: the person representing General Atlantic on its Box investment is Gary Reiner, a former chief investment officer at General Electric.The second force is consumerisation. Individual workers are choosing what to use rather than taking what their IT departments decide to give them. This is doing to the enterprise software business what smartphones and tablets are doing to hardware: Box, Dropbox and Yammer are all companies that have bypassed the IT department to reach workers directly.Whether any of these companies can one day grow into a giant to rival Oracle is a different matter. Most will inevitably be absorbed as bigger companies look to extend their own capabilities. Yet the cloud does more than open the way for a new generation of applications: it also changes the technological foundations on which IT systems are built. This is where the true disruption lies.VMware, a company founded only 14 years ago on the idea that servers could be used more efficiently if treated as pooled resources rather than standalone machines, is the first of the new cloud infrastructure companies to have a shot at the big time, with a stock market value approaching $40bn.Other software start-ups are no longer building their own services on top of software from companies such as Oracle, says Roman Stanek, another cloud software entrepreneur. His company, GoodData, which last week doubled the amount of capital it has raised to $53m, relies instead on a new generation of cloud technology. Start-ups like these, he says, show what all businesses will one day be doing.Mr Ellison is working hard to keep up. This week, he bought a data centre automation company that closely resembles Nicira, adding to a spate of cloud purchases. Having publicly ridiculed the very idea of the cloud a few years ago – a classic diversionary tactic from an arch-tactician – Mr Ellison is rebuilding Oracle to reflect the new realities.The trouble with technology revolutions, though, is that they have a habit of devouring their forebears. If Mr Ellison and his ilk are to avoid this fate, they will have to move fast.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast editorrichard.waters@ft.com"
279;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Social media gets down to business;;Silicon Valley entrepreneurs used to dream of building the next great social media start-up, convinced that killer photo features and viral sharing would relieve them of the need for a business model. The money would follow, they all assumed.Today, however, some of the most successful technology entrepreneurs have found a more direct route to riches, by applying those social concepts to tools aimed at the corporate world.Their early successes have resulted in a wave of dealmaking that has helped buoy the market for technology mergers and acquisitions, and helped Silicon Valley stay energised in the wake of Facebook’s flawed public offering. The most recent deal came on Tuesday, as Google acquired Wildfire, a social advertising start-up, for a reported $250m.“I don’t think this a flash in the pan,” said Mark Shafir, co-head of global M&A and head of technology, media and telecoms banking for Citi. “You do what you can organically, but for time-to-market reasons there will be a need for acquisitions. You have to be in the mix pretty quickly.”The biggest transaction in this wave of activity was Microsoft’s $1.2bn cash deal for Yammer, the social networking tool for businesses. Yammer, founded less than four years ago and with revenues of only $20m last year, is small by any measure compared to Microsoft.But the software leader saw in it the potential to bring some needed cool to its Office suite of productivity software. “Social is a hugely important driver,” said David Sacks, chief executive of Yammer. “It’s now up to all enterprise software providers to step up to a greater level of usability.”Just weeks before the Yammer deal, Salesforce acquired Buddy Media, a social marketing platform that competes with Wildfire, for $689m. Oracle has been picking off smaller targets including Vitrue for $300m, and Involver – both help big companies manage customer service relations and marketing on Facebook.For Vitrue, the deal was a culmination of mounting interest from bankers and companies. “Strategic acquirers had been knocking on the door for quite some time,” said Reggie Bradford, chief executive of Vitrue.Such deals have helped make technology a rare bright spot in an otherwise depressed deals market. Technology M&A is up 6 per cent by volume year-to-date, while overall M&A activity is down 16 per cent, according to Dealogic.For big companies such as Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce, buying promising start-ups is a way to stay current in the workplace, which is changing rapidly as employees increasingly engage with social media, use their own devices, and turn to the cloud.Chris Gaertner, Head of Global Corporate Finance for the Technology at Credit Suisse, said buying start-ups was an efficient way for big companies to get into emerging lines of business. “It keeps these companies from spending huge sums developing their own products that might or might not work,” he said. “You have to look at it as outsourced R&D.”Yet such bets can go horribly wrong. This month Microsoft took a $6.2bn charge as it wrote down nearly the entire purchase price of aQuantive, an online advertising company it bought in 2007.Now, as valuations for such companies creep higher, big companies looking to buy their way to relevancy will have to be wary of overpaying.“You can literally double your valuation just by being social,” said Andy McLoughlin, co-founder of Huddle, a social collaboration company that makes a product similar to Microsoft’s SharePoint, and is still independent. “When you see a company like Yammer get sold on a ridiculous multiple for an obscene amount of money, people think, maybe we could be next?”Investors and bankers say many of the companies that marry social media and big business have a distinct advantage over their consumer-facing peers, such as Instagram, which Facebook bought for $1bn shortly before its public offering. Instead of having no business model at all, or relying on the promise of advertising, the companies being snapped up today generate regular income through subscription fees.Brad Reback, managing director at Oppenheimer, the boutique investment firm, said many companies in the mould of Buddy Media and Vitrue had doubled revenues in each of the last few years, with evidence supporting a 30-50 per cent growth rate in the next few years.Bankers and executives say this wave of acquisitions is likely to continue as big technology companies look to stay current, even if not every deal is a hit. “What’s the cost of no action?” said Mr Gaertner. “Not every bet you place is going to be a winner, but you want to be sure you’re participating.”
280;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Cloud computing specialists snapped up;;Less than a week after VMware announced plans to spend $1.26bn to acquire Nicira, the cloud computing network virtualisation specialist, Oracle has agreed to buy Xsigo, another supplier of network virtualisation technology, for an undisclosed sum.Xsigo claims several hundred business customers including British Telecom, eBay, SoftBank and Verizon, while Nicira counts AT&T, NTT and Rackspace among its existing users.The two deals highlight just how fast the market for virtualisation software is consolidating and the growing importance for companies such as VMware and Oracle to be able to provide their customers with a full suite of virtualisation tools.These tools enable companies to dynamically manage their computing resources including physical infrastructure more easily, and increase or reduce capacity quickly simplifying operations and reducing costs.Xsigo’s software-defined networking technology simplifies cloud infrastructure and data centre operations allowing customers to connect any server to any network and storage on demand, thereby increasing utilisation and application performance while reducing cost.The combination of Xsigo network virtualisation software and Oracle’s existing server virtualisation technology will enable Oracle to deliver a complete set of virtualisation capabilities for cloud-based computing.“The proliferation of virtualised servers in the last few years has made the virtualisation of the supporting network connections essential,” said John Fowler, Oracle’s executive vice president of systems. “With Xsigo, customers can reduce the complexity and simplify management of their clouds by delivering compute, storage and network resources that can be dynamically reallocated on-demand.”Lloyd Carney, Xsigo chief executive, added: “Customers are focused on reducing costs and improving utilisation of their network. Virtualisation of these resources allows customers to scale compute and storage for their public and private clouds while matching network capacity as demand dictates.”Just last week, Oracle launched an upgrade to its “cloud-in-a-box” Exalogic technology, adding server virtualisation capabilities that make it easier for customers to add or reduce capacity.Oracle has made four other acquisitions in the past three months – three in the social networking field and one designed to boost its cloud-based project portfolio management capabilities.
281;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Companies miss potential to exploit data;;Companies are missing a significant revenue opportunity because they lack the capabilities needed to fully exploit the information they collect, according to the results of a new survey of senior executives.Senior corporate executives recognise the importance of collecting and managing ‘big data’, but almost a third think their companies are not prepared for the ‘data deluge’ and an astonishing 93 per cent believe their organisations are losing revenues – on average 14 per cent – because they cannot fully utilise the information they collect, according to the survey conducted by Oracle, the business software group.The study, ‘From Overload to Impact: An Industry Scorecard on Big Data Business Challenges,’ is based on the responses of 333 ‘C suite’ executives from US and Canadian midsized and large companies in 11 industries.Of the executives surveyed, 94 per cent said their companies are collecting and managing more business information than two years ago – an average of 86 per cent more – and identified the biggest data growth areas being customer information (48 per cent), operations (34 per cent) and sales and marketing (33 per cent).While two-thirds of senior executives say that the ability to draw intelligence from their data are a top priority for their organisation, 29 per cent give their organisation a ‘D’ or ‘F’ grade in preparedness for a data deluge. Only eight per cent of executives give their organisation an ‘A’ rating in terms of preparedness.“They have low confidence in their organisation’s data management capabilities,” says Rod Johnson, Oracle’s vice-president of industries strategy.Executives in the communications industry are most confident in their organisations’ preparedness for the data deluge, with 20 per cent giving their organisation an ‘A’ rating.Executives in the financial services and energy industries also tended to be less pessimistic about their companies’ preparedness, while at the other end of the spectrum, groups in the public sector, healthcare and utilities industries are least prepared to handle the data deluge – with 41 per cent of public sector executives, 40 per cent of healthcare executives and 39 per cent of utilities executives giving their organisations a ‘D’ or ‘F’ preparedness rating.Executives in the oil and gas (22 per cent) and life sciences (20 per cent) industries estimate that they lose the greatest percentage of annual revenue due to their current data management processes.Generally, the executives give their organisations the highest marks in securing data and the lowest marks in distributing timely information and translating data into actionable intelligence.But the most striking finding to emerge from the study is that the vast majority of those questioned believe that their company is losing revenue because of its inability to fully leverage the information that is collected. Organisations with $1bn in annual revenues or more say they are missing out on an average of 13 per cent, or $130m in revenue a year because of this failing.Respondents note they are frustrated with their organisations’ data gathering and distribution systems. Specifically, 38 per cent say they do not have the right systems in place to gather the information they need, 36 per cent say they cannot give their business managers access to pertinent information and need to rely on IT to compile and analyse information and 29 per cent feel they are using systems that are not designed to meet the unique needs of their industry.Seventy-seven per cent of organisations already use industry-specific applications or software to help leverage information to make strategic decisions. The financial services (91 per cent) and healthcare (87 per cent) industries are most likely to use industry specific applications.Looking ahead, 97 per cent of respondents said that their organisation needs to improve information optimisation over the next two years and 67 per cent of executives say that the ability to draw intelligence from their data are a top organisational priority.Other priorities include improving the ability to translate information into actionable insight (43 per cent), acquiring tools to collect more accurate information (38 per cent) and training employees to better make sense of information (38 per cent).Significantly, 64 per cent said it is important or crucial for managers to access business information on their mobile devices.
282;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-07-13T19:01:18Z;Big shift in type of City companies;;"Technology and media businesses doubled their uptake of office space in the City of London during the first six months of the year, providing the strongest evidence yet of the transformational shift in the area long dominated by banks.Companies in the TMT sector, including Skype and Oracle, took leases on 731,000 sq ft of new space during the first half of 2012, compared with 367,000 sq ft for the same period last year, according to data from Knight Frank, the property services group.The surge in uptake comes as financial institutions across the Square Mile downsize, and points to what many City property experts suggest is a revolution in the type of companies that want to be based in London’s pre-eminent business district.“The kind of businesses coming into the City now are the sort which would, traditionally, have taken up office space in the West End,” said Bradley Baker, head of central London tenant representation at Knight Frank.“It is making it a much more diverse place, with banks increasingly as just one group of entities with offices in the City,” Mr Baker added.As well as Skype and Oracle, which took up a combined 100,000 sq ft, Bwin, the internet gaming group, and Monetise, the online payments company, agreed leases of 20,000 sq ft and 42,000 sq ft, respectively, in the same building on Cheapside.One of the largest drivers of non-financial services companies coming into the City is the fact that rents have remained disproportionately subdued compared with surrounding business areas.Since the middle of 2009 – the nadir of the commercial property market – rents in the City have risen from £42.50 per sq ft to £55 today. In contrast, Covent Garden rents have risen from £45 per sq ft to £65, while in Mayfair rents have gone from £65 per sq ft to £95 over the three years.The upshot has been to push non-financial companies into the City. In 2007, at the start of the financial crisis, TMT accounted for 10 per cent of new office space leased. In the first half of this year, that figure hit 27 per cent.However, the changing face of the City is as much to do with the rise of entertainment and shopping facilities as it is with affordability, according to its planning authorities.“We have totally changed the City from being a place that people only came to work in to a place where people might just as likely come for a night out,” said Peter Rees, the City of London planning officer.“That is the reason that a lot of technology and media companies are taking up space here; it is the only way they can hang on to the bright people in their 20s and 30s,” he added."
283;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-07-12T22:10:51Z;SAP reports strong software sales;;Second-quarter sales at SAP exceeded market estimates, helping reassure investors that the German business software maker’s recent rapid growth has not yet succumbed to a global economic slowdown.SAP’s software revenues jumped by a currency-adjusted 19 per cent to €1.06bn in the three months to June 30, reaching the upper end of its forecast of 15-20 per cent growth. SAP recorded double-digit sales gains in all regions, including Europe.Analysts had predicted €977m in software sales, according to an estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Software sales are seen as a key indicator of the business’s underlying health due to opportunities for future service-related business.The stock had traded 3 per cent lower during Thursday morning after Infosys, the Indian software group, cut its sales forecast. But SAP’s stock surged after releasing the confidence-boosting preliminary figures and traded 4.8 per cent higher at €48.48 by mid-afternoon, to close up 2.7 per cent at €47.50.“The results came in at the upper end of our second quarter software revenue guidance in an uncertain macroeconomic environment,” Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, co-chief executives, said in a statement.In spite of worries over the global economy, many companies continue to invest in software in a bid to cut costs and improve productivity.Oracle, SAP’s biggest rival, reported strong software sales growth last month when it announced fiscal fourth-quarter results.However, weaker guidance from the likes of Infosys, Infineon Technologies, the chipmaker, and Informatica, a data integration company, has shaken investor confidence in recent weeks.SAP suffered a rare blip in the first quarter when its US sales model led to disappointing earnings. It reassured investors at the time that the problems were localised and issued bullish second-quarter guidance.In order to drive growth SAP is investing in new areas such as the cloud – the remote provision over the internet of software as a service – mobile and in-memory database computing.SAP’s Hana’s in-memory product allows customers to analyse vast amounts of data much more quickly. Analysts at Bernstein Research last month dubbed it a “disruptive technology” that “could change the way data [are] analysed and used”.SAP expanded its cloud activities in May by agreeing to acquire Ariba, a business-to-business ecommerce network, for $4.3bn. In December the German company paid $3.4bn for SuccessFactors, a provider of online tools for managing employees.Second-quarter operating profit rose 8 per cent to €1.2bn while total sales jumped 12 per cent to €3.9bn. These figures are at constant currencies and are not according to international financial reporting standards. The company is set to report full results on July 24.

285;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-07-03T16:53:19Z;EU court decision deals blow to Oracle;ECJ allows resale of software online;The European Court of Justice dealt a major blow to Oracle on Tuesday, ruling that the software maker cannot block the resale of its software online.The decision has the potential to create a multimillion dollar market for second-hand enterprise software licenses. It could also have broader ramifications for other digital products such as film, music and ebooks, lawyers say.As media becomes more digital, publishers have sought to license as well as sell content to their customers, and restrict second-hand sales via the terms in their licensing agreements.In Tuesday’s decision, “the court [is] applying principles that are clear in the bricks and mortar world to the digital environment,” Geert Glas, global head of law firm Allen & Overy’s IP practice said. “For that same reason it can be applied to other products and services, such as ebooks.”The ECJ ruled that once Oracle had sold its software, it had exhausted its exclusive distribution rights, regardless of whether the software was downloaded or sold via a physical medium, such as a DVD or CD-ROM.The US software company had launched proceedings against Munich-based UsedSoft in an attempt to force the second-hand software dealer to stop reselling licenses to Oracle software.The ECJ, however, said that resellers like UsedSoft were not bound by license agreements banning the resale of software licenses. “Even if the licence agreement prohibits a further transfer, the rightholder can no longer oppose the resale of that copy,” the court said in a statement.The judgment does not allow users to make copies of software, however, nor does it allow a user to sell off chunks of individual licenses.The ECJ’s decision is not binding, with a final judgment on the legality of UsedSoft to be issued later in Germany. But lawyers say the German federal court will be guided by the ECJ’s ruling.Re-selling of software licenses is currently not allowed in the US, Oracle’s biggest single market.Oracle’s legal representative in the case, Truiken Heydn at TCI Rechtsanwälte, said: “We think the Court of Justice of the European Union has missed a significant opportunity to send out a clear message about the value of innovation and intellectual property to the European economy and European businesses.”The decision could trigger a boom in the resale of surplus licenses, according to Conor Ward, partner at Hogan Lovells. “The decision has the potential of having pretty profound effects on the software industry,” said Mr Ward.“At present many corporates have a surplus of software licences, reflecting the fact that they have reduced staffing levels and the possibility of getting some cash by selling their surplus will clearly be attractive,” he said.“It is likely that a market for pre-used software licences could develop fairly rapidly.”Shares in Oracle were flat at $29.80 in early trading in New York.Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco
286;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Global slowdown weighs on Wall Street;;Shares in DuPont fell on Monday after investment banking group Jefferies downgraded the stock to “hold” from “buy” on worries of a sluggish European demand outlook.The company, one of the world’s biggest chemical groups, dropped 2.3 per cent to $49.43, as analysts estimated that the US chemical group’s second-quarter earnings would suffer.DuPont’s 12-month target price was also lowered to $55 from $62.Laurence Alexander, an analyst at Jefferies, said the inferior earnings outlook for the company was due to weak western European demand with global growth moving towards the lower end of the 2 per cent to 3 per cent range.Other multinational industrial groups also lost momentum. Caterpillar, the biggest maker of earthmoving equipment, fell 1.5 per cent to $83.68. General Electric moved down 1.7 per cent to $20.49.Overall, US equities were mixed on Monday as concerns of slowing global manufacturing overshadowed optimism that European leaders were taking action to address eurozone sovereign debt troubles.According to the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing managers’ index fell more than expected to 49.7 in June from 53.5 in May – indicating contraction in the manufacturing sector for the first time since July 2009.The benchmark S&P 500 edged 0.3 per cent higher to 1,365.51. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ticked up 0.6 per cent to 2,951.23. But the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.1 per cent to 12,871.39.“With last week’s positive news out of the EU Summit and the quarter close on Friday, [we] expect the market to be slightly bearish for the rest of the week,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of Active Trading & Derivatives at Charles Schwab. “The US economy seems to be at a standstill, which is one of the reasons the European issues continue to have so much impact on the US.”Among technology stocks, shares in Dell fell 1 per cent to $12.39 after the company said it had acquired a data management company for $2.4bn.Dell, the world’s third-largest personal computer maker by shipments, said on Monday it would pay $28 a share to buy Quest Software. The deal is expected to close in Dell’s fiscal third quarter.Shares in Quest Software moved up fractionally to $27.82 on Monday. The company disclosed in June that it received an offer of $27.50 a share from a strategic bidder. The stock has added 11.3 per cent over the past month.Dell said in a statement that the acquisition would “extend [its] existing capabilities in system management, security, data protection and workspace management”.The deal is seen as a positive move for the company to enhance its software exposure. “Dell has been aggressive on the acquisition front over the past couple of years in an effort to diversify its portfolio and move toward richer margin enterprise solutions,” said Brian White, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, was up 1.5 per cent at $592.52. The tech group has agreed to pay $60m to settle a trademark dispute with Shenzhen company Proview Technology, which had tried to block its sales of iPads in China.Social networking website Facebook dropped 1 per cent to $30.78. Hewlett-Packard added 0.3 per cent to $20.16. IBM increased 0.1 per cent to $195.83 and Oracle gained 0.3 per cent to $29.80.Microsoft said that it would report a non-cash, non tax-deductible goodwill asset impairment charge of $6.2bn, which is related to its acquisition of aQuantive in 2007 after the market closed. The stock dropped 0.4 per cent in after-hours trading.The telecom and utilities sectors led gains on Monday, rising 1.5 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively. AT&T went up 1.5 per cent to $36.20, while Verizon was up 1.1 per cent to $44.93.The S&P financials index, which traded in negative territory by midday, closed 0.5 per cent higher.Citigroup increased 0.2 per cent to $27.46. Morgan Stanley added 2.4 per cent to $14.94 and JPMorgan Chase moved up 1.5 per cent to $36.28. But Bank of America dropped 1.6 per cent to $8.05.“The recent euphoria will dissipate early in the second quarter reporting season, should investors see that the altered flow of bailout funds to Spanish banks won’t stem the ebbing tide of global economic growth,” said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.Elsewhere, Best Buy rose 5.9 per cent to $22.20. There were reports that the electronics retailer’s founder was exploring ways with investment bankers to take the company private. Shares in the company had rallied 15.7 per cent over the past five days.Healthcare group Bristol-Myers Squibb ticked up 0.3 per cent to $36.05 after the company said it had acquired biopharmaceutical company Amylin for $5.3bn to expand its portfolio of diabetes products.“We note the recent launch of Amylin’s chief Bydureon diabetes drug has been weak, probably linked to injection issues. The drug is also unable to take market share,” said Herman Saftlas, analyst at S&P Capital IQ. “While we see long-term potential from Bristol-Myers Squibb’s planned acquisition of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, we think the deal entails much risks.”BrightPoint surged 66.5 per cent to $9.01. The mobile phones wholesaler is to be taken over by an IT distributor Ingram Micro for $650m in cash.
287;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-07-02T18:18:50Z;Project problems highlight ERP risks;;The recent decision by NCC Group, a Manchester, UK-based IT security company, to write off a £6.9m investment in an enterprise resource planning project once again highlights the potential hazards of ERP system implementations.It follows a similar experience at Domestic & General (D&G), the warranty and insurance group, which sued its SAP integrator, HCL Axon for £18.9m for a failed IT project, and settled for £13m in 2011. Among other organisations which reported expensive ERP problems last year are Ingram Micro in Australia, the government of Marin County, California, and the UK’s National Health Service, which finally scrapped its £12bn IT programme.Four years ago, NCC began its search for software that would encompass finance, planning, resourcing and client relationship management (CRM). The procurement process was rigorous, says Rob Cotton, NCC’s chief executive. “We did very extensive work to approve suitability and were quite comfortable with what appeared to be on offer.”NCC declines to identify the ERP software that was chosen because the company is still in dispute with the supplier. It began implementation in January 2012, but in May, NCC announced its decision to suspend the project and revert to Sage, its previous software.Mr Cotton feels he was the victim of over-enthusiastic selling, and advises other potential customers to spend as much time as possible talking to ERP users and comparing marketing claims with what products actually do.But he says there is a problem for mid-sized organisations because a simple shrink-wrapped ERP product may be inadequate, and a large-scale system too expensive. “It’s like trying to fit into a suit that is too small or too big.”The cost and complexity of ERP systems provided by SAP, Oracle and Microsoft make them more suitable for large multinationals agrees Peter Lumley, ERP expert at PA Consulting. Their flexibility is part of the problem, because rather than using the standard templates that come with the system, customers are tempted to make too many modifications.“People think ‘we’ll just spend a little money and have this adapted’, but the successful ERPs are those that are as simple as possible,” says Mr Lumley. With consultants charging £1,000 a day, costs can quickly escalate.Another problem is that ERP originated in a manufacturing environment, and is less suited to other commercial applications. Predicting requirements is also difficult. Mr Lumley compares this to designing your own car from scratch, in which case you would almost certainly make mistakes. Far better to buy an imperfect vehicle and use it, making gradual enhancements as you go.Clients often struggle to articulate their processes, and across a multinational organisation there can be millions of parameters that need to be set, so there are many opportunities to get it wrong. The strength of an ERP is that it is massively connected, says Mr Lumley. “But if implementers make wrong connections and wire back into the switch they are going to get a jolt.”Another problem is that if implementation lasts too long it is like a child growing up, the decisions made at the beginning are no longer applicable. Sticking to a formulaic approach, is likely to be much cheaper and more successful than going for a ‘biig bang,’ says Lindsay Boullin, commercial product manager for ERP and CRM at Sage.He advises choosing an ERP product that is fast to deploy, easy to learn and simple to maintain. “A Sage ERP can be implemented in 35 days, and can be followed with gradual business process improvement.”ERP projects usually fail for human rather than technical reasons. Often this happens during the design and build phase when people are asked to do things differently, which causes resistance. People are uncooperative, and the design is signed off under duress, says Conrad Troy, partner in KPMG’s Advisory team. “When the system goes live it doesn’t do what people wanted.”People need to be incentivised to participate, otherwise they will continue doing their own thing. For example, extracting data from the system and putting it into their own spreadsheets, defeating the object of the ERP.Strong leadership is important. The unhappy customers are the ones who see ERP as putting in technology, says Mr Lumley. ”The happy ones are those who see it as a way to change the business leading from the top.”But leadership should be pragmatic. Saying you want the business to double in size annually might be a bit too ambitious operationally, says Mr Boullin. “It’s about breaking your business aspirations into very deliverable tranches.”NCC is going through mediation with its suppliers, and Mr Cotton doesn’t want to prejudge the outcome, but he sees the write-off as a “brave decision”. If you have been through a procurement process and it hasn’t worked out, you have the choice to either grin and bear it or kick it out and start again, he says.Lots of boards would be afraid to do the latter for fear shareholders and investors would say they had wasted their money, he says. “The right thing is to call a halt. It could be a temporary suspension, but we must back off and revert to our old system which is tried and tested, and will last three to five years.”That is all he is prepared to say. Nor will D&G discuss its experiences, having agreed to keep quiet as part of its legal settlement. This is understandable, but makes it harder for others to avoid the pitfalls.
288;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-06-29T21:03:51Z;US equities gain impetus from EU action;;Wall Street stocks enjoyed their best one-day rise this year, bolstered by optimism that European leaders are taking action that addresses eurozone sovereign debt troubles.Stocks surged in what was a broad-based rally as many investors had been expecting no definitive action at the two-day EU summit that ended on Friday.“The agreement by the European leaders showed that the leadership finally began to understand that capital markets are much more demanding in much less time nowadays,” said Quincy Krosby, financial market strategist at Prudential.The S&P 500 closed up 2.5 per cent on Friday for a gain of 2.03 per cent on the week to 1,362.15 points. The rally this week has propelled the benchmark index to its first positive monthly gain of 4 per cent since March and the best June performance since 1999. That leaves the S&P higher by 8.3 per cent so far this year.Analysts said the market’s strong performance was also a function of the final trading day for June and the second quarter, with investors buying stocks in order to bolster their portfolio returns.“Another aspect of [Friday’s] rallying markets has to do with the fact that it’s the end of the quarter and the first half year,” said Ms Krosby. “Managers are trying to enhance the performance of their portfolios,” she added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 2.2 per cent gaining 1.9 per cent over the week to 12,880.09. The Nasdaq Composite index also jumped 3 per cent to 2,935.05 and registered a 1.5 per cent gain for the week.US stocks shrugged off weak economic data on Friday, with consumer spending flat and incomes ticking up a meagre 0.1 per cent.Industrials and energy stocks were boosted by soaring oil prices on the back of the EU deal to help Spain and Italy recapitalise their banks and bring down bond yields.The S&P energy index was the best performing sector this week with a gain of 4.2 per cent.Among big winners this week were the oil and gas drillers Newfield Exploration and Pioneer Natural Resources. Newfield Exploration was 11.5 per cent higher on the week to $29.31, while Pioneer climbed 5.6 per cent over the week to $88.21.Financials also rose sharply on Friday, enabling the S&P sector to gain 1.7 per cent over the week. Major US banks were bolstered by the news that European banks will be stabilised after EU leaders took steps to creating a banking union.Citigroup rallied on Friday but fell 2.7 per cent over the week to $27.41. Bank of America rose 1.8 per cent to $8.18 and Wells Fargo added 1.4 per cent to $33.44 this week. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase fell 0.9 per cent this week to $35.73 as investors priced in larger losses from its credit derivatives activities.The S&P technology sector lagged behind others to register a 0.5 per cent rise on the week.One of the biggest gainers in the tech sector was Oracle, up 5 per cent to $29.70 this week. Another notable gainer was Amazon, up 2.6 per cent over the week to $228.35.In corporate deal news, Constellation Brands gained 39.5 per cent to $27.06 after the world’s largest wine company agreed to buy the other half of its Crown Imports joint venture with Grupo Modelo. The deal would turn Constellation Brands into the sole US importer of top-selling Corona beers.Anheuser-Busch InBev also ticked up a weekly gain of 12.6 per cent to $79.65 after agreeing to buy the rest of Grupo Modelo for about $20.1bn. The world’s largest brewer by sales gained 3 per cent over the week.Among the biggest losers, Research In Motion shares fell 24.6 per cent over the week to $7.39 following first-quarter results showing profit declines. Investors were also disappointed to learn that the launch of the BlackBerry 10 smartphone had been pushed back to early next year.In other corporate earnings news, Ford shares fell 6.7 per cent this week to $9.59 after the US’s second-largest carmaker pre-announced quarterly results, warning that its pre-tax profits would be “substantially lower” as revenues were hit in Europe, South America and Asia.Nike’s earnings results came in lower than expected on Thursday after the market close. The sports goods maker’s shares fell 11 per cent to $87.75 this week.KB Home announced a loss which was narrower than anticipated. The stock climbed 19.66 per cent over the past week to $9.80, with most of the gains coming on Friday.Coty, the cosmetics group, has filed for an initial public offering on Friday in an attempt to raise about $700m.
289;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-06-27T21:29:00Z;Consumerisation of corporate IT accelerates;;"Microsoft’s $1.2bn acquisition of Yammer earlier this week positions the software group to add enterprise social networking features to its existing business collaboration tools including SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Office.It also represents another example of the consumerisation of corporate IT; after the success of consumer-focused services such as Facebook, social networking technology is finding its way into mainstream businesses. Young employees in particular expect to be able to use the same tools and technologies at work that they have become familiar with as consumers.“Many employees at the junior (and now senior) end of the workforce live aspects of their personal lives through Facebook and Twitter, so the idea of introducing similar kinds of tools into the workplace seems to make sense from a communication and collaboration point of view,” said Richard Edwards, principal analyst at Ovum, the market research firm.“It’s not just Microsoft eyeing-up the opportunities afforded by the Facebook-led social paradigm shift,” he said. “Established enterprise IT vendors, such as IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com and SAP are all busy bringing social capabilities to the workplace via a variety of ways and means.As Mr Edwards noted, Microsoft SharePoint Server already touts social capabilities but it was designed and built in the pre-Facebook, pre-cloud era. In contrast, Yammer, which was launched in 2008, belongs to the new breed of enterprise collaboration tools, designed from the ground-up to exploit social, mobile, and cloud technologies.“Microsoft has been slow to the game in enterprise social,” said Rob Koplowitz of Forrester Research in a blog note penned before the Yammer deal was confirmed by Microsoft. “Their primary delivery mechanism, SharePoint, is a very big product with a traditionally long delivery cycle. When you upgrade your enterprise social story every 3-4 years, you’re going to be constantly behind in a market segment that is rewarded for being forward thinking. Hence, they’ve not been a thought leader.”Yammer, which enables companies to offer their employees Facebook and Twitter-style functionality within the security of the enterprise firewall and integrates with other business applications managed by a company IT department, is well regarded by analysts who follow the enterprise social networking market.Employees can set up user profiles, send and receive the equivalent of “tweets”, take part in discussion forums and receive notifications about what their colleagues are doing.Proponents of enterprise social networking tools which aside from Yammer include Salesforce.com’s Chatter; VMware’s SocialCast and tibbr, the social media service of Tibco Software, claim they improve the way employees communicate and collaborate by complementing email, instant messaging and other more traditional tools.Yammer will also sit neatly alongside Skype, the communication product that Microsoft acquired last year for $8.5bn but has yet to integrate into its mainstream business applications.“Since Yammer is a cloud-based service, it probably makes sense for Microsoft to integrate its functionality into its web-based Office 365 collaboration and email suite,” said Mr Koplowitz."
290;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-06-19T20:52:18Z;BofA jumps on Merrill unit sales talk;;"Bank of America shares rose sharply after Julius Baer, the Swiss private bank, confirmed that it was in talks to buy Merrill Lynch’s international wealth management business from the US lender.Shares in BofA closed up 4.5 per cent to $8.11. The Merrill unit in consideration has assets under management of about $90bn and an asking price of between $1.5bn to $2bn.“Bank of America would be selling the business to lower its risk weighted assets and to increase its capital,” said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Research.The news came as financials and bank stocks reversed their losses from Monday. Morgan Stanley increased 3.2 per cent to $14.26. Citigroup traded at $28.50, up 3.5 per cent, while JPMorgan Chase added 2.2 per cent to $35.38.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, testified for the second time in front of a US congressional committee regarding the bank’s unexpected trading loss from last month.Materials stocks led gains on Tuesday, rising 2 per cent.The telecommunications sector, which has been favoured by investors in recent weeks, was the worst-performing subgroup and declined 0.2 per cent.But Alec Young, equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, upgraded the telecoms sector to “hold” from “sell”.“We believe increasingly depressed bond yields are boosting the appeal of the sector’s market-leading 4.8 per cent dividend yield,” he said.AT&T lost 0.5 per cent to $35.47 and Verizon dropped 0.2 per cent to $43.73.Overall, US equities rose as investors continued to hope for more central
bank support as the Federal Reserve began monetary policy discussions.The S&P 500 index increased 1 per cent to hit a five-week high at 1,357.98. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent higher at 12,837.33.Some analysts said the central bank was unlikely to step in and support markets right away but, in a note to clients, Morgan Stanley argued that there was a high probability that some balance sheet actions, such as quantitative easing and Operation Twist, could be unveiled later.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.2 per cent to 2,929.76.Oracle added 3.1 per cent to $27.96. The database software provider reported better than expected quarterly results late on Monday. The company also said its board had authorised a share buyback of $10bn.Walter Pritchard, an analyst at Citi, which has a “buy” rating on the company’s shares, said the results should allay some recent investor concerns over how the weak macroeconomic environment would affect the company.Microsoft moved up 2.9 per cent to $30.70 after it unveiled Surface, its new tablet designed to compete with Apple’s iPad.Shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, gained 0.3 per cent to $587.41 while social networking website Facebook increased 1.6 per cent to $31.91.A Bespoke report said shares in Apple closed back above its 50-day moving average yesterday for the first time since May 2.The 50-day moving average is a measure of short to intermediate term trends. When a stock trades at about that level, it is an indication that the company’s share price has been improving.FedEx was up 2.8 per cent to $91.01. The US package delivery company said on Tuesday that it had profits of $550m, or $1.73 a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter – a result that fell short of analysts’ estimates of $1.92 a share. The company said it planned to cut costs to mitigate the negative impact imposed by the slow global economy.Jim Corridore, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said: “We continue to find the shares attractively valued.”Walgreen fell 5.9 per cent to $30.09. The company announced its fiscal third-quarter earnings of $537m, or 62 cents a share. The US retail and pharmaceuticals group also said it would pay $6.7bn for a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots.Barnes & Noble fell 4 per cent to $14.63. The US book seller reported a quarterly loss of $11.1m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.Construction on new US homes decreased 4.8 per cent in May to an annual rate of 708,000, according to the commerce department.Shares in homebuilders shrugged aside the data though as DR Horton increased 1.3 per cent to $16.71 and PulteGroup rose 3 per cent to $9.61."
291;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-06-18T23:13:12Z;Oracle rushes to report 1% rise in sales;;Oracle’s fourth-quarter revenues nudged up 1 per cent to $10.9bn, partly due to a rising US dollar and declining hardware sales at the technology group.In a further move to boost investor confidence, Oracle said its board had approved an additional $10bn for share repurchases following stock buybacks of nearly $6bn over the past year, though it did not give a timetable for spending the money.The company’s shares rallied more than 3 per cent in after-market trading, having earlier dropped 2 per cent after rumours of a senior executive departure fuelled concerns about its performance. Oracle rushed out its fourth-quarter earnings, which were in line with expectations, three days early on the back of the rumours.Keith Block, a 26-year veteran who heads sales and consulting in North America and sits on its executive management committee, is set to leave in the coming months, it later emerged. A person familiar with the departure described it as a personal decision rather than the result of problems in Oracle’s core domestic market.Larry Ellison, chief executive, said Oracle had notched up “fantastic” software sales in the fourth quarter, with revenues from new licences – a key indicator of the business’s underlying health – rising 12 per cent before the effect of foreign currency changes.Sales from the Americas rose more strongly than in other regions, climbing 5 per cent from the year before.Hardware sales fell 13 per cent in constant currency terms, though the decline was lower than Wall Street had feared and Mr Ellison claimed the results showed Oracle was on track with its plan to rebuild the business around new, higher-margin products. “Our focus remains on returning the overall hardware business to growth,” he said.Oracle reported pro-forma earnings of 82 cents a share, ahead of the 78 cents analysts had forecast and the 75 cents from a year before, thanks partly to a lower effective tax rate. Pro-forma net income climbed 8 per cent to $4.1bn.
292;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-06-08T17:31:41Z;Waterhouse to run McGraw-Hill Education;;The publisher McGraw-Hill has completed the long search for a chief executive of its education division, paving the way for the unit’s separation into an independent company later this year.Lloyd “Buzz” Waterhouse will become president and chief executive of McGraw-Hill Education from next Thursday, the company said on Friday. Mr Waterhouse, previously was chief executive of Harcourt Education, a competitor in the US school education sector. He also spent 26 years at IBM, where he was general manager of ebusiness services.“My lifetime commitment to learning and to technology convinces me that it’s time to accelerate the transformation to digital education,” Mr Waterhouse said in a statement.With Mr Waterhouse’s appointment, two of the four biggest educational publishers now have chief executives with an extensive background in technology. The selections signal the growing importance of digital in the education publishing business.Linda Zecher, who started as chief executive of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in September 2011, previously worked at the technology companies Microsoft, Texas Instruments and Oracle.McGraw-Hill announced in September last year that it would separate its financial and education businesses into two companies. The decision came in response to pressure to ramp up growth and boost returns to investors. In December, the company said that it would cut 550 jobs in its education division and alter pension plans to save $50m.McGraw-Hill competes in education with Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, Cengage, a publisher bought in 2006 by the private equity group Apax, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
293;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-06-05T22:47:09Z;Oracle agrees to buy Collective Intellect;;"Oracle stepped up its push into the corporate social media app market by agreeing to acquire Collective Intellect, a leading cloud-based social intelligence technology provider, for an undisclosed sum.The deal also highlights the race to acquire social media and cloud-based technology among the leading enterprise software companies including Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.Collective Intellect’s semantic and text mining technology allows companies and other organisations to monitor, understand and respond to consumers’ conversations on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.“Creating meaningful content based on a clear understanding of consumers’ conversations is the way brands will create stronger customer relationships,” said Don Springer, founder and chief strategy officer of the seven-year-old company whose customers include CBS, Barclaycard, Hasbro, Nestlé Purina, Walmart, Siemens and Pepsi.Just two weeks ago Oracle paid a reported $300m to buy Vitrue, a social marketing platform provider that has become one of the most popular solutions for big companies trying to win Facebook fans and push out marketing messages to consumers. Then on Monday Salesforce announced plans to buy Buddy Media for $689m.As Zach Hofer-Shall of Forrester noted in a blog posted on Tuesday, the Oracle/Collective Intellect deal comes a year after Salesforce.com purchased Radian6 and now gives both customer relationship management groups “the components they need to piece together something powerful. With social CRM in sight, this social technology arms race is the start of something very big to come,” he said.The flurry of recent mergers and acquisitions activity reflects the growing importance of both social media and cloud-based services to the corporate customers of the leading enterprise software companies such as Oracle and SAP, which has also made a string of recent acquisitions.“Why the acquisition streak?” asked Mr Hofer-Shall. “Because social start-ups hold the innovation that big tech companies need. As the thousands of social start-ups can attest, building social tools can be easy, but building successful social technologies is very, very difficult.“As my colleague Melissa Parrish pointed out in her Salesforce.com/Buddy Media post: ‘These acquisitions are not about adding immediate significant revenue. They’re about adding technology offerings.’ As always, Melissa is absolutely right. None of these acquisitions pick up wildly profitable companies; they pick up unique technologies that will help the tech giants meet future market demands.”The rapid growth over the past few years of social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter has presented companies with both new marketing opportunities and challenges for keeping pace with their customers, many of whom now use social media to comment on, recommend and sometimes criticise companies and their products and services.Oracle said it planned to integrate Collective Intellect and Vitrue’s technology with its own social data management and analytics capabilities to create “the most advanced and comprehensive social relationship platform”.“Gaining intelligence from consumer conversations across social media, and knowing customers’ intentions and interests helps organisations create better products and deliver better service,” said Thomas Kurian, executive vice-president of Oracle Development, explaining the deal.Integrating Collective Intellect and Vitrue with Oracle’s existing software-as-a-service, or SaaS, products will “enable marketing organisations to create more targeted marketing campaigns; help customer service teams respond quickly to customer feedback on social media; generate targeted leads and opportunities for sales teams; and strengthen how companies build more effective brands using the internet and social media”, Oracle claimed."
294;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-06-04T18:58:39Z;Managing complexity and app explosion;Apps have added complexity to IT systems management;"The growth in enterprise applications mirrors the apps explosion associated with consumer devices such as smartphones and PC tablets. Coupled with other key trends including rising user expectations, this had added enormous complexity to the management of corporate IT systems.As Marc Hurd, Oracle’s president, noted during a presentation at Oracle’s Industry Analyst World event, chief information officers face a “Rubik’s cube of complexity.” Old applications, storage, mobility and social media are all making life more difficult than ever for corporate IT, Mr Hurd said.A major impact of this is poor application performance. As a result, Gartner, the IT research firm, estimates that 20 per cent of the Global 2000 are shifting the emphasis of their IT operations to monitor and manage applications, rather than infrastructure.According to Gartner, about $2bn was spent worldwide last year on application performance monitoring (APM) licenses and first-year maintenance contracts. This was a 15 per cent increase over the $1.7bn spent in 2010, which in turn represented about a 10 per cent increase over the previous year.Although APM has been an implicit part of IT operations since the mid-1990s, it is only in the past seven years or so that it has emerged as a distinct IT discipline. It enables organisations to optimise the performance and value of their business-critical applications. This includes managing the speed and availability of applications.Significantly, Gartner suggests that the factor most responsible for the increased attention now being paid to the APM process and the tools and services supporting it does not come from IT, but from the business side of the enterprise which has, during the past decade, fundamentally changed its attitude toward IT in general.“Line of business and ‘c-level’ executives now generally recognise that IT is not just infrastructure that supports background workflows, but is also, and more fundamentally, a direct generator of revenue and a key enabler of strategy,” Gartner noted it its ‘Magic Quadrant’ analysis of APM market leaders published in September.“For the typical executive, what’s important is the application portfolio that directly enables him or her to accomplish business goals. Unfortunately,” noted Gartner, “at just the moment when executives have become keen about imposing an application-centric view of the world on IT operations, applications have become far more difficult to monitor; in general, architectures have become more modular, redundant, distributed and dynamic, often laying down the particular twists and turns that a code execution path could take at the latest possible moment.”I asked John Van Siclen of Compuware, one of the leaders in the market segment, to help me understand why the market for application performance management software is growing so quickly. Here is an edited Q&A with him:Why are slow, or poorly performing, applications more of a problem now than they were five or 10 years ago?There are two main reasons: first, end users are getting increasingly impatient and want their applications to perform with lightning speed. This not only applies to consumers but to business users where faster time-to-value is critical.Second, modern application delivery is very complex, making the management of application performance much more difficult. By the time an application residing in a data centre interacts with an end user, it must traverse this very complex application delivery chain, which consists of many dynamic variables that impact the end user experience.These can include things like web 2.0 code, mobile native applications, streaming applications, third-party and cloud services, smartphones, tablets, browsers, operating systems, internet service providers, mobile carriers and more. Many enterprises struggle with this new level of complexity, especially when they must deliver applications with more functionality, more quickly, and with fewer resources.Why are line of business executives getting involved in what was previously seen as an IT concern?In most enterprises, there’s a growing realisation that applications are the business. Applications are what your end users interact with, so executives see the direct impact that poorly performing applications have on the business.A new generation of application performance management systems are required to give executives real-time performance visibility with dashboards that show the actual business impact. In order to address the ever growing IT complexity, companies need to move away from a piecemeal, tools-based approach to a more integrated approach that offers a complete view of performance across the entire application delivery chain.A more integrated APM approach enabled organisations to optimise the performance and value of their business-critical applications. This is why investments in APM are growing at five times the rate of overall IT spending.How fast do end users expect their applications to download? What is the real dollar impact of slow performance?There have been many studies that indicate end users expect applications to be fast, available, and reliable. In fact, often faster than most organisations can currently deliver them. We call this the Google effect – we’re trained to have a search request fulfilled almost in real-time, and we expect the same from a web page, internal business application or mobile app.A decade ago, we were content to wait 10 seconds or more for an application or web page to load. The industry standard is now under two seconds, and for every second of wait time beyond that, the business is being impacted and revenue is lost. While the dollar impact varies from business to business, The Aberdeen Group estimates that an e-commerce website can lose 7 per cent of sales conversions for every added second of wait time.The challenge for business is to maintain end user service levels and to proactively detect and remediate problems before they impact the business. On the positive side, we’re seeing many leading organisations use performance management to get ahead of the competition by constantly improving their end users’ experience.What’s the impact of the cloud on the performance of online assets?For organisations using public or private clouds, several performance issues come into play; the first being the impact of geography. We created a free web community called CloudSleuth where we constantly monitor the speed (response time) of the major cloud providers. The results show that a service that might be fast on the US east coast can lag on the west coast or in Europe.Another overriding issue is lack of transparency. When you outsource that level of highly dynamic, scalable infrastructure – placing it in the cloud – your ability to manage and configure performance is limited, and most cloud providers do not offer service level agreements guaranteeing performance levels.Not only do you lose the ability to manage that infrastructure as you would an in-house server, you also lose the ability to monitor the end user’s experience. APM puts you back in control by providing the kind of visibility and management options that cloud installations require to achieve needed performance levels.It’s true that there’s no escaping the cloud, really. Most enterprises are already dependent on third-party cloud-based web services. Our internal data shows that the average web transaction depends on as many as a dozen hosts, and many of those are in the cloud. So even if your core infrastructure is within your own data centre, you probably depend on the cloud and therefore need to manage those resources effectively.How can APM assist with the leveraging of ‘Big Data?’‘Big Data’ takes the complexity we talked about earlier to a new level, as companies seek to effectively leverage massive amounts of information to gain competitive advantage or to improve the experience of their customers. However, these benefits can only be realised if the data can be processed intelligently, efficiently, and results delivered in a timely manner.Big Data applications suffer from many of the performance challenges and bottlenecks that plague current distributed applications, though the volume of performance data are often much larger. To facilitate speed and real-time results, APM must support massively scalable architectures and dynamic, elastic resource allocation.Helping businesses get to that data quickly is where APM comes in. The bigger the data, the deeper the dive. What I mean is that Big Data, by its very nature, requires special tools to help organisations manage and optimise its effective use. The companies that do this well will have an enormous advantage.What’s the impact of streaming video on online assets?One of our streaming executives attended the NAB (broadcasters) show recently and spoke about how to provide hiccup-free streaming video. At the end of the presentation, she asked if there were any questions, but no one took her up on it. But as she walked offstage, she was approached by a number of attendees all with multiple questions, each not wanting to publicly reveal their own streaming performance problems. This incident is telling; if professional broadcasters are challenged by streaming, just imagine how other companies are faring.Right now streaming video is mainly used by entertainment and media companies, but is moving steadily to a ‘must have’ in other industries as more people get accustomed to having it as an option for product descriptions, training, demos and so forth. Video requires a lot of storage and bandwidth and there are several formats of video used, so this is adding to the complexity of the application delivery chain and requires new APM approaches to manage.How is the ‘app revolution’ on mobile devices impacting businesses?The world is clearly going mobile and every organisation is dealing with these modern applications that are dynamically assembled at the edge of the internet in the user’s browser or mobile application. This complexity at the edge is daunting and is another factor driving the need for APM.Getting applications to perform well on a mobile device is particularly tricky given the multitude of available devices, operating systems, native and web apps, browser types etc. Add to this the inherent inconsistencies of wireless carriers and there’s much that can go wrong.Unfortunately, your customers are as unforgiving about poor mobile performance as they are with desktop or laptop PCs. The rate at which an end user will abandon a slow loading mobile website is very close to abandonment rate for all devices.What are the core best practices an organisation should implement to ensure fast and reliable performance of their applications?Everything we’ve talked about previously really speaks to one overriding best practice: focus on the end user. It’s the lens through which companies need to manage and look at application performance management. Your application is what the end user interacts with, not what leaves your data centre, so companies need to monitor the entire path of an application – from the edge of the internet through the cloud to your datacentre. A unified APM strategy may sound daunting, but it is the only way to ensure your applications are performing optimally amid this growing complexity.Executive and IT leaders alike are challenged to maintain customer service levels and proactively detect and remediate performance problems before they impact the business. But for every dollar lost to poor performance, know there’s an opportunity for gains that come at the expense of your slower competition.John Van Siclen is Senior Vice President and General Manager of Compuware’s APM business unit"
295;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-06-01T14:01:07Z;Letter from Lex: Left on the shelf;A week dominated by technologies and commodities;What do singletons in their thirties and technology have in common? A fear of being left on the shelf. Research In Motion is especially worried about too many of its BlackBerrys ending up on the scrapheap, so it has started to explore strategic options. Smartphone maker HTC also finds itself in a tricky position playing the third wheel to Apple and Samsung. Japanese chipmaker Renesas, which was formed from the marriage of NEC’s chip unit to those of Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric, once again finds itself in need of a credible turnround plan to rid itself of lossmaking units. Meanwhile Anglo-Dutch IT services group Logica, which has been in and out of the bid spotlight over the years, may have finally found a match with CGI’s £1.7bn takeover approach. Oracle and HP have skipped any romance and gone straight to court to settle a dispute over the $53bn server market.Elsewhere it was about less alluring commodities. Japanese trading house Marubeni bought US grain-trader Gavilon for $3.6bn while Xstrata revealed that it was planning to give chief executive Mick Davis a windfall payment of £30m over three years so that he stays on if the merger with Glencore goes ahead. In the oil & gas sector, Italy’s Eni continued to reposition itself with the sale of a 30 per cent stake in gas utility Snam to the state investment company for €3.5bn while Spain’s Repsol made a valiant effort to put Argentina’s expropriation of YPF behind it. Things are not going as well at TNK-BP, where hostilities have broken out in the dysfunctional boardroom, leaving BP to examine a possible sale of its Russian operations.Then there were unromantic but essential industrials. Fiat brought more order to its group structure with plans to merge Fiat Industrial and US-traded CNH into a New York listed holding company. Finally to the US military-industrial complex where SpaceX was the latest in a long line of private-sector contractors to help Nasa deliver projects faster and cheaper with its rocket to restock the space station. While the launch industry is set for relatively modest growth, US companies can always rely on the immense defence budget, which is close to $1tn rather than the much lower numbers the Pentagon prefers to advertise. With America’s penchant for military adventures, companies know that their technology is unlikely to be left on the shelf for long.John Casey, Lex Publisher
296;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Judge sides with Google on Oracle claim;;The US judge presiding over a high-profile legal spat between Google and Oracle has ruled in favour of the search company on a central issue in the case.His decision late on Thursday cast doubt on whether Oracle would be able to seek a retrial of the case, which had earlier drawn an inconclusive jury verdict.Google immediately welcomed the judge’s ruling, which it said would have a broader impact on the software industry by protecting the right of developers to make their code work with other widely used software programs.Oracle’s case turned mainly on a claim that the search company infringed its copyright on parts of the Java computer language, which it acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems. Google illegally copied Java in 37 of the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that its Android mobile phone software uses to work with other applications, according to Oracle.A jury agreed with Oracle earlier this month that Google had copied some aspects of Java, though it also said that the search company might be covered by “fair use” protections that allow limited use of copyrighted material. That mixed verdict had raised the prospect of a retrial, as the companies fought over a claim that Oracle said should yield damages of at least $1bn.In a ruling delivered in federal court on Thursday, however, Judge Denny Chin ruled that Google’s approach, which involved it using some of the same formats as Java rather than copying the actual code, was not illegal.“The particular elements replicated by Google were free for all to use under the Copyright Act,” the judge wrote. He added that his findings were based on the facts of the case and did not mean that “the structure, sequence and organisation of all computer programs may be stolen”.Some experts had warned that a victory for Oracle could have put many other software developers in jeopardy, since the approach Google took with Android is commonly used in the software industry to make programs work together.Oracle said it would “vigorously pursue an appeal”.“This ruling, if permitted to stand, would undermine the protection for innovation and invention in the US and make it far more difficult to defend intellectual property rights against companies anywhere in the world that simply takes them as their own,” it said.
297;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-05-31T19:10:29Z;Oracle and HP;One delightfully nasty business dispute goes to court;Sayre’s law states that in any dispute, intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the amount of value at stake. In business, the intensity ramps up as growth subsides and a fight for share begins.One delightfully nasty business dispute goes to court this week. Oracle announced a year ago that it would no longer update its software for servers running on Intel’s Itanium chips, arguing that the processors were becoming obsolete. The main buyer for the chips was Hewlett-Packard, which uses them in its Integrity servers. Oracle had recently got into the server business, so it looked a bit like it was unfairly crippling a competitor. HP alleges that Oracle is contractually obliged to keep the updates coming. Each company has trumpeted documents making the other look disingenuous.Why all the heat? It’s a big market. Some $53bn in servers were sold in 2011, a 7 per cent increase from the year before, according to Gartner. But in the first quarter, sales shrank. The question is whether this industry will come to resemble personal computers: slowing growth, falling margins and share gains by low-cost competitors. The results of the biggest competitors do not paint a pretty picture. HP’s high-end server business shrank by a tenth in 2011 and by 23 per cent in the past quarter. Dell’s server business is still growing, but the pace has slowed. Oracle’s hardware business has been steadily shrinking (the company says it is intentionally giving up unprofitable business). IBM, which leads in higher-end servers, describes its business as very profitable but a modest grower.In PCs, most of the value has accrued to software designers (and one very skilled hardware-software integrator, Apple). There is nothing to suggest the server business will not follow suit, generating a lot of fierce arguments along the way.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
298;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;HP /Autonomy: a necessary gamble;After a punt that just happened to go wrong, the overpayment debate appears to be over;That gleeful background noise, as Hewlett-Packard presented its quarterly results on Wednesday, was Larry Ellison giggling. Last autumn, the Oracle boss got into a nasty public back-and-forth with Mike Lynch, then head of Autonomy, about whether or not Lynch had shopped his company to Oracle, only to be told the price was too rich. Hewlett-Packard ended up paying $10.3bn for the company. This week, HP said that Autonomy stumbled badly last quarter, and that Lynch was being replaced as its leader.Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, thinks the problem at Autonomy is not the product or the competition. It is lack of grown-up management. “This is a classic entrepreneurial company [with] scaling challenges …” Regardless, the overpayment debate looks to be over.Revenues at HP’s total software division rose $173m in the most recent quarter versus the previous year, when Autonomy was not in the fold. Even on the unlikely assumption that all of that growth came from Autonomy, the annual revenue run rate at Autonomy is now about $700m, well short of the $1bn the company was producing before it was bought. Some part of the decline has to do with changes in the way Autonomy’s licence revenues are booked, but the upshot remains. HP paid even more than the dizzying 10 times revenues that was originally thought. Worse, HP software’s pre-tax profits expanded by only $14m in the quarter. Something is going badly wrong here.What, though, is a company in HP’s situation supposed to do? Its biggest businesses are suffering either secular decline or margin compression. It needs to cut costs, and it is doing so. And it needs to take a punt or two on adding growth businesses. One can argue that $10.3bn is simply too much to gamble. But the hard fact is that punts, by definition, sometimes go wrong.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
299;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-05-23T16:36:05Z;SAP / Ariba: into the clouds;Any doubts do not centre on the deal’s strategic logic;Angel delight? German software group SAP used the heavenly creature moniker as code name for Ariba during acquisition discussions – and executives appeared suitably chuffed at pulling off an agreed $45-a-share offer for the US business-to-business ecommerce network late on Tuesday. But investors were less certain: SAP’s shares dipped, rose and dipped again on the news.Any doubts do not centre on the strategic logic behind the deal. SAP is one of a clutch of big technology companies scrambling to develop cloud-based services, which deliver software packages to customers that run over the internet. In this case, combining Ariba’s position in procurement and supplier management with SAP’s applications and supply chain-related technologies makes ample sense. The former operates the largest web-based B2B trading community, used by multinationals from Disney to Deutsche Bank, to handle transactions with thousands of suppliers. Opportunities for cross-selling – for example, SAP’s HANA in-memory product, which helps quick analysis of large quantities of data – should be plentiful.Valuation is more tricky. This is the cloud, so prices are bound to be sky-high. The offer, a 20 per cent premium to Ariba’s undisturbed share price, puts an enterprise value of $4.3bn on the US company. That is eight times consensus expectations for Ariba’s 2011-12 sales and 35 times earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation. While not top of the range – SAP itself paid nine times forward sales when it bought SuccessFactors for $3.4bn this year – it is hardly cheap. Moreover, it leaves SAP, which had a difficult first quarter, with two sizeable acquisitions to integrate. For now at least, Ariba’s share price assumes no counterbid from the likes of Oracle. So SAP investors must only hope there are no hidden devils.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
300;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-05-22T22:44:20Z;SAP to buy Ariba for $4.3bn;;SAP has agreed to acquire Ariba, a business-to-business ecommerce network, for $4.3bn as the German enterprise software company expands its cloud offerings.SAP offered $45 a share for the Silicon Valley company – a 20 per cent premium over Ariba’s closing price on Monday. Ariba’s board unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to close at the end of August.Ariba was founded in 1996 and came to the market in 1999, when its shares nearly tripled in value on their opening day. It reached a market capitalisation of $40bn at the height of the dotcom bubble in 2000.SAP has been expanding into the cloud – the remote provision over the internet of software as a service – with acquisitions. It bought Crossgate, a business-to-business document and data exchange service last September for an undisclosed sum and paid $3.4bn in December for SuccessFactors, a provider of online tools for managing employees.Oracle, its biggest rival, has also been acquiring cloud companies, paying $1.9bn for Taleo and $1.5bn for RightNow in recent months.Bill McDermott, SAP co-chief executive, told an analyst conference call that Ariba was the most successful global trading network in the world“We are taking another bold step in our strategy to achieve leadership in the cloud,” he said. “With this acquisition, SAP will also become the clear leader in on-demand supplier relationship management or SRM,” a market segment that grew 20 per cent in 2011.Ariba employs about 2,600 people and reported revenues of $444m in 2011, up 38.5 per cent from 2010. Its network connected and automated more than $319bn in transactions. Buyers and suppliers pay for its services by subscription.SAP says its customers make up the majority of the top 2,000 companies globally and their annual spending of $12tn with suppliers means there is a huge growth opportunity if they can all be connected through Ariba.While it will integrate it with SAP business software products, Ariba will still serve non-SAP customers and will continue to be run as an independent business known as “Ariba, an SAP company”. Bob Calderoni, its chief executive, is expected to join the SAP global managing board.SAP, based in Walldorf, Germany, intends to fund the transaction with cash on hand and a €2.4bn loan. It expects Ariba to be accretive to earnings per share in 2013.Mr Calderoni said Ariba would be given additional resources and reach by joining SAP, accelerating progress on its goal of enabling more than $1tn in commerce by 2015.Ariba has more than 420 strategic large buyers including Walt Disney, Deutsche Bank, BHP Billiton and ExxonMobil. Walt Disney carries out more than 900,000 transactions with more than 7,000 suppliers a year on Ariba.
301;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-05-17T19:09:40Z;Investors bet on Facebook as gatekeeper;;"If Mark Zuckerberg needs a reminder of the impermanence of success in Silicon Valley, he should look no further than his company’s new home.The cluster of characterless buildings, built along the south-east shore of the San Francisco Bay, belonged until recently to Sun Microsystems. After shooting to prominence in the tech boom of the 1990s, Sun failed to catch the next technology wave and succumbed to a takeover by Oracle.Earlier this year, Facebook moved in, reviving the abandoned site and infusing it with the collective energy of its 3,500 mostly young employees: tapping on their computers, filing through the cafeteria, playing roller hockey in the courtyard.In Silicon Valley, the new is often built on the ruins of the old. Google, close by, occupies a campus once used by Silicon Graphics, a hotshot maker of workstations that flamed out and eventually went into bankruptcy.Such memories raise a discomforting question for the investors who look set to push Facebook’s valuation beyond $100bn on Friday, vaulting it into the top ranks of global tech concerns: will its reign prove any more lasting?Technology history “suggests that nothing lasts forever”, said AnnaLee Saxenian, dean of the Information School at the University of California at Berkeley. “The odds that Facebook will remain the hot thing on the block for decades are low.”Forget decades though: in the Web era, stretching back fewer than 20 years, periods of dominance have been counted in far shorter periods. Companies whose positions once seemed entrenched have already given way surprisingly quickly to new rivals.Like others before it, Facebook has set out to become the gatekeeper to the web. It wants to be the first place people turn to when they boot up their computers or whip out their mobile phones. But its ambitions go even further: it wants to be the framework around which everything else on the Web is organised.Other technology companies once had similar ambitions. AOL and Yahoo both vied for the role of acting as the first stop online for accessing information and communicating with friends and family. Yet even though both still attract large audiences, they are shadows of their former selves.What is Facebook really worth? This calculator illustrates how variations in key assumptions can change the potential market value and share price of an IPO.AOL’s stock market value reached more than $160bn at the height of the internet bubble, giving it the currency to buy Time Warner; now independent again, AOL is worth only $2.5bn. Yahoo, once valued at $80bn, is reckoned by Wall Street analysts to be worth something similar to after stripping out its Asian investments.Sometimes, a wholesale technological shift lies behind such big reversals in fortune. For AOL, that came with the move from dial-up internet access to broadband, sidelining its core service. “It’s similar to what happened to the cassette tape,” said Bill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark Capital, a venture capital firm. “They weren’t outplayed by a single company; the whole world just moved to a different format.”A similar big technological transition is coming with mobile internet access. Even though more than 500m Facebook users tap into the service on mobile devices, the company has faced the risk of being overtaken by made-for-mobile services.Photo-sharing app Instagram had a real chance to become “the Facebook of mobile”, says one veteran investor who has seen the successive internet waves close up. If so, then Mr Zuckerberg’s keen sense of paranoia – and a seemingly extravagant offer of $1bn – may just have headed off an existential threat to his company, though the acquisition still needs regulatory approval.Facebook’s continued rise relies on being able to identify and neutralise similar potential threats in future. Yahoo’s portal business, meanwhile, lost ground as internet users turned to Google’s more effective search engine as a better way of finding information.Google itself still maintains a powerful position in search and has extended its reach into email, mobile and video. However, it is clearly on the defensive when it comes to social networking, which has presented an alternative way of finding information online and communicating with friends and family.Could another, so far unforeseen shift in online behaviour one day threaten Facebook’s own gatekeeper status?To its supporters, the company’s “network effects” – its service grows more valuable as more people use it – are so powerful that it is hard for users to leave. Facebook itself touts its social graph, its web of how people are related and connected to each other, as its most valuable asset. Now it is encouraging news outlets, music, and movie companies to allow Facebook users to distribute their content on its platform.According to Benchmark’s Mr Gurley, even the rise of a new technology platform like mobile cannot undermine this.“For someone else to mount a threat to Facebook, they’d have to peel off you, but also all your friends and family and everyone else you’re connected to,” he said. “There are people throwing criticisms at the company about mobile or this or that, but none of that would cause its core competitive advantage to go away.”If this prevailing view is correct, then Facebook’s influence will last a lot longer than most of the internet gatekeepers that came before it. But given the previous cycles of disruption that are even now bringing it to the top, it may not do to rely too much on such assumptions."
302;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-05-14T23:01:19Z;Technology M&A activity defies downturn;;The technology sector has continued to see a large number of mergers and acquisitions, in contrast with the rest of the economy, as cash-rich companies buy strategic assets in areas such as cloud computing, social networking and mobile phones.The total value of global technology deals fell 12 per cent to $25.1bn in the first three months of the year, according to research by Ernst & Young, but the decline was only about half of that seen across other industries, where economic uncertainty has put the brakes on transactions.According to Dealogic, the data provider, the value of transactions across all sectors in the first quarter was down 23 per cent from the previous year.Deals such as Oracle’s $1.9bn acquisition of Taleo, the cloud software company, announced in February, and Cisco’s $5bn acquisition of video security company NDS, however, have helped keep tech sector deal volumes up.“It is the continuing trends of cloud, mobility, social networking and bid data that are driving a need for technology companies to ensure that they are at the top of their game and they are often looking to deal to do that,” said Joe Steger, head of Ernst & Young’s technology transaction advisory service.SAP, for example, admitted it could not build its own cloud computing software fast enough and so opted to buy SuccessFactors for $3.4bn at the end of 2011.Youku and Tudou, two of China’s leading online video companies, announced in March that they would combine forces to compete in a fiercely competitive industry.Many technology companies also hold large cash reserves and are able to keep spending despite global economic uncertainty. E&Y estimated that the 25 largest companies in the sector had about $634bn in cash and investments at the end of 2011. Apple’s cash reserves were $110.2bn at the end of April.Private equity deals have also bucked the trend in the technology sector. While deals have fallen off in other industries, in technology private equity deal values rose 171 per cent, from $2.1bn in the first quarter of 2011 to $5.8bn in the first three months of 2012.Vista Equity Partners, for example, announced a £1.27bn bid for Misys, the UK banking software company, in March, and Insight Venture Partners announced a $2bn deal to buy Quest Software.Many older technology companies, which are no longer growing rapidly but which still generate large amounts of cash, are ripe to be taken over and revamped by private owners.“Technology is becoming a more comfortable space for private equity companies. They like the recurring revenues they see in software and IT services companies. Anecdotally it feels like our private equity teams are very busy looking at technology deals right now,” Mr Steger said.
303;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-05-09T18:11:04Z;Case could ripple through software world;Repercussions of Oracle-Google court decision still unclear;Are you confused by the odd drama that has been playing out in a San Francisco courtroom between two of the titans of the technology industry, Oracle and Google? If not, then you should be.It is a case that turns on abstruse arguments to do with the interaction of software code and copyright laws that were not written with such digital forms of expression in mind.Even the companies’ own chief executives, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and Google’s Larry Page, have had trouble from the witness stand answering questions on technical concepts that can only have befuddled a non-expert jury.Also, depending on whom you listen to, the case is about everything or nothing. Either the future of Google’s Android operating system – and possibly much of the open-source software world – is at stake, or the eventual costs of this trial will be counted only in bruised corporate egos, along with minimal damages and licensing fees.At the heart of the dispute is a clash of the “open” and “closed” software worlds. These have become notoriously slippery terms: any tech company trying to put itself on the side of the angels likes to describe its approach as open while denouncing its rivals as closed.So it is ironic that Oracle, famous for its aggressive business tactics, should be the one defending the open – in this case, the Java programming language it acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems. The code was designed to make it possible for software applications to run on many different operating systems without the need for modification.It is Google, the self-professed “do not be evil” company, that is being forced to explain why – after failing to reach a deal with Sun to license Java – it felt it could just use the technology anyway.The main issue the rival armies of lawyers have been lining up around concerns 37 of the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that act as the software “hooks” for other developers to write applications that run on Android. Google followed the Java formats but wrote its own code. In effect, its APIs feel like Java, yet they don’t copy it exactly. Hence the confusion over whether copyright should apply.There is certainly an important issue of principle at stake. Java dates from the days when Sun was trying to prevent Microsoft’s Windows from completely dominating the software world. It needed a technology that would let applications travel widely, giving hope to software ecosystems beyond Windows. So if Google’s own “flavour” of Java threatens to Balkanise the technology – and, thanks to its growth, Android could eventually become the dominant form of mobile Java – then it makes sense to drag it back into the fold. But is that enough reason for Oracle to turn this into an expensive legal circus? Most technology pundits view it as a side issue that has little bearing on the wider health of the Java ecosystem. If so, then something less obvious is at stake.One possible hint of Oracle’s longer-term goal may have come early in the trial, with the revelation that it considered entering the mobile software business itself after buying Sun. It looked at acquiring Research In Motion or Palm and considered creating its own software from scratch. Taking up the next best tool it has to hand – Java – could be one way for it to extend its reach further into mobile software. Were Oracle to win its case, Google would have to seek a licence for Java or face the unpalatable option of rewriting its APIs, making them incompatible with existing Android apps.Besides the fees, such an outcome would leave Oracle with a bigger say over how Android operates. Future versions would have to reflect any changes made to Java – a potentially cumbersome process.Exactly how Oracle would exert that influence and what it might hope to get out of it are two of the murky questions this would raise, but it can’t be a prospect relished by Google. So far the jury has delivered a mixed verdict and the court has yet to rule on whether APIs are even copyrightable.Meanwhile, by taking potshots at Google, Oracle has threatened to open a much bigger can of worms in the software world. Were the court to find that software APIs are subject to copyright, it would raise a host of thorny questions for an industry that relies on many different techniques to make its products work together effectively.There have already been dark warnings that it could become harder for companies to reverse-engineer their rival’s technologies to create compatible products. The interaction of open-source and commercial software, which exist in different legal spheres, could also become tangled up in copyright disputes.It is impossible to tell how far the ripples might travel. But most in the software world would rather not find out.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editor
304;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Sage looks to cloud for sales growth;;Sage warned that weak economic conditions in southern Europe were weighing on the business, but the UK’s largest listed software company is hoping that a shift to cloud computing will help speed up sales growth.“I am not happy with the pace of revenue growth. I want it to accelerate,” said Guy Berruyer, chief executive, on Wednesday as Sage revealed that underlying sales had grown just 2 per cent to £661.2m in the six months to the end of March, less than analysts had expected.Revenues in Spain fell sharply, the company said, as many of its small business customers closed down as a result of the country’s economic woes. Trading has also been poor in France amid an uncertain business outlook and the presidential elections. These offset stronger performances in Germany and the UK.Sage provides accounting and other business software for more than 6m small and medium-sized businesses, and its performance largely reflects overall economic sentiment.However, Mr Berruyer is hoping to defy the effects of the economic downturn by increasing the amount of business software Sage offers over the internet or “the cloud”. Sage has been criticised for being slow to get into internet-based software.It launched a product in the UK last year, which has so far gained around 3,000 paying customers. But that is still a tiny fraction of Sage’s 6m customer base and there is no indication of the impact on revenues. However, customer numbers could start to grow faster when the cloud-based product launches in the US next week.“I don’t doubt that next year will be challenging,” said Mr Berruyer, noting that in the US there is already a strong online rival, Intuit’s QuickBooks, whereas competition in the UK has been more fragmented.“But I am pleased with the pace we have seen so far in the UK, with customer numbers doubling over the last six months,” he said. “It was not a given we would do well in the UK.”Mr Berruyer has ruled out acquisitions to build Sage’s cloud software capabilities. A number of software companies such as SAP and Oracle have spent large amounts of money buying cloud computing companies after admitting they could not build these offerings fast enough inhouse. However, Mr Berruyer said Sage had the capability to do its own development.“Our business is quite different. It is about simplicity and usability, not about depth of features. Building accounting software is our core knowledge and we have set out to do this internally. We have that cloud culture,” he said.Sage is also planning to streamline its portfolio of 270 products to focus investment on just on the top-performing lines. This would free up cash to speed up cloud developments, Mr Berruyer said.Pre-tax profit for the six-month period rose 3 per cent to £167.1m, and earnings per share were also up 3 per cent at 9.06p. It raised its interim dividend 30 per cent to 3.48p in line with a pledge last year to return more money to shareholders.Shares in Sage fell 5.5 per cent.

305;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-05-07T19:56:17Z;Jury delivers split Oracle-Google verdict;;The high-stakes courtroom showdown between Oracle and Google has been thrown into confusion after a jury found against Google on the main copyright infringement charge it faced, but also failed to reach a decision on a central argument made in Google’s defence.The search company immediately said it would file a motion to have the case declared a mistrial following Oracle’s mixed victory on Monday. An outright win by Oracle could lead it to seek damages of more than $1bn and leave a cloud over Google’s fast-growing Android mobile operating system.The dramatic turn in the federal court trial in San Francisco came after the judge urged the jury late last week to continue its deliberations to overcome an undecided verdict on a key aspect of the case. As the decision was read late on Monday morning, however, it became clear that the deadlock had not been broken.The main part of the verdict appeared to hand an important victory to Oracle, which had argued that Google copied parts of its Java programming language when creating Android. The case centred on Android’s application program interfaces (APIs), software “hooks” that allow other developers to write programs that run on the operating system. Some of the APIs followed the same format as Java, making it easier for developers to write programs for Android but also prompting Oracle’s claim.Despite the finding, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on Google’s argument that it was protected by the doctrine of “fair use”, which provides a defence against copyright infringement. A fresh round of legal manoeuvring is now likely as each side tries to turn the messy outcome to its advantage, according to observers.“Google has decided to fight pretty much tooth and nail not to have Android fall under the umbrella of Oracle,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC, a tech research firm. Were it to win, Oracle would be able to demand royalty payments and also exert a degree of control over future development of the software, potentially hampering Google’s ability to move quickly in the smartphone market, he added.A ruling that APIs are covered by copyright protection could also have a wider impact on the information technology industry, said Mark Driver, an analyst at Gartner.Many companies rely on being able to “reverse engineer” the APIs in other companies’ software to make their own products compatible with the technology, he said, adding that the personal computer industry would have been stalled at the outset had companies not been able to “clone” IBM’s original PC in this way.The 12-person jury found definitively in Oracle’s favour in one small part of the case involving the direct copying of a particular API. However, that instance involved only nine lines of software code and would only lead to small damages based on early testimony in the case, observers said.
306;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-04-20T18:20:05Z;Google and Oracle chiefs testify;;When the rival chief executives of two of the world’s biggest technology companies take the witness stand in a $1bn legal dispute, you normally expect fireworks. But when Larry Ellison of Oracle and Larry Page of Google testified this week in a courtroom in San Francisco, the discussion quickly moved on to abstruse technical points of software code – something even the chief executives sometimes seemed unsure about.At issue is whether Google’s popular Android smartphone software infringes Oracle’s rights in Java, a computer programming language it assumed with the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009. The 15m lines of code in Android are not themselves under the microscope, but whether Google acted illegally by following a format developed for Java when it wrote its system’s APIs – the software interfaces that enable other developers to write programs that are compatible with it.Mr Ellison was challenged by Google’s lawyers to explain why Oracle had a case when Sun had earlier welcomed Android’s use of Java and when Mr Ellison had promised that Oracle would keep the software open and freely available after the Sun acquisition. Mr Page, meanwhile, played down the significance of the code to Android, while at the same time admitting a different message might have been given to Google’s board.Trying to apply the principles of copyright to a computer language like Java is also a new departure, making life even harder for the non-expert jurors, who are expected to have eight weeks of similar testimony to sit through before being asked to come to a verdict.
307;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-04-17T19:02:07Z;Oracle ‘looked at buying RIM or Palm’;;Oracle looked at buying manufacturers Research In Motion or Palm in 2009 as part of a plan to break into the smartphone business in direct competition with Apple’s iPhone, a lawyer for Google said in court.The claim came as Google opened its defence on Tuesday against a $1bn copyright and patent infringement complaint from Oracle over the internet search company’s Android smartphone operating system.The case marks the first time Google’s software has been exposed to court scrutiny and could see an injunction lodged against sales of Android phones in the US, should Oracle prevail.Oracle’s lawsuit, launched in 2010, came after the database software giant had looked at building its own smartphone software or buying another company to break into the market but had failed to do so, Robert Van Nest, the lawyer heading Google’s defence, told the jury at the federal court in San Francisco. “They looked at buying RIM or Palm,” he said.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, also approached Google about an alliance between the companies, but was rebuffed, Mr Van Nest added.Oracle’s main complaint, involving a damages claim of $1bn, is that Android infringes its copyright in the Java programming language, which is used to write applications that can run on many different operating systems.A separate allegation that Google infringed seven Java patents was whittled down to two patents ahead of the trial, with claims for damages on those expected to be less than $10m.Judge William Alsup also revealed that Google last month offered to pay Oracle $2bn. He warned lawyers for Oracle that it would be “too self-serving” to present this offer to the jury as having been made mainly to settle the lawsuit.“It was an offer for $2bn but it was not for Java, it was for Java and lots of other things,” Mr Alsup said, adding that the patent infringement part of Oracle’s claim covered only two of “thousands” of patents on Java. “This is not about Java against Android,” he said. Mr Ellison was due to appear as the first witness on Tuesday.The case continues.
308;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-04-15T18:57:28Z;Google faces court challenge from Oracle;;Google’s Android operating system will face its first big court challenge on Monday as a trial gets under way in California to consider a claim from software group Oracle that could top $1bn.If successful, Oracle would be in a position to seek an injunction blocking US sales of Android handsets, which have overtaken Apple’s iPhone to become the biggest-selling smartphone platform worldwide.With such an outcome, Oracle would likely be required to offer Google a licence to its technology at rates that analysts say should not cripple Android’s competitiveness, however.The trial marks the first time that a jury has been asked to weigh up the inner workings of Google’s software. Hardware makers such as Motorola Mobility and HTC also face a barrage of lawsuits over the use of Android software in their smartphones, tablets and ereaders.Oracle first instigated legal proceedings against Google in August 2010, but its initial case, under which it sought damages of more than $6bn, has been scaled back significantly. Five of the patents underpinning its claim were thrown out in pre-trial hearings and lawyers close to the case estimate that any damages it stands to collect from infringement of the remaining two are likely to be less than $10m.The more unusual copyright claim due to go to trial on Monday leaves the database software company free to asset damages of $1bn or more, however.Barring an 11th hour settlement, jury selection is set to begin at the federal courthouse in San Francisco for a trial expected to last six weeks.Oracle has alleged Google infringed its copyright in the Java programming language, which Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems two years ago.Google is showing results from heavy investments in areas beyond search, with notable inroads in the mobile, video and display marketsJava was invented by Sun to act as a standard software interface across all operating systems, making it possible for developers to write applications that can be run on any system.Google lawyers have maintained that copyright doesn’t apply, since Oracle’s suit centres on features of the Android software that do not themselves directly replicate the Java software, but were written using the technology.Evidence expected to be presented by Oracle at trial includes an email by a Google engineer which concluded that the search company should seek a licence from Oracle to use Java. However, Google lawyers have said that this resulted from an internal review that only took place when it became clear that Oracle might sue. Java’s previous owner, Sun, had welcomed its use of the technology, the search company claims.The case has stirred up echoes of a prominent case involving Java dating back to the 1990s, when Sun sued Microsoft for $2bn alleging breach of contract and trademark infringement over the software.However, Oracle’s claim represents a novel departure, since it would be the first time that software written with a particular computer language had been held to be copyrightable.
309;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-04-15T15:33:12Z;Oracle/Google lawsuit;Oracle is cast against type, as defender of openness, protecting compatibility in name of all Java developers;Why didn’t Google just sign up for a licence and move on? Oracle’s lawsuit alleges that when Google used the Java programming language as the basis for its Android mobile operating system – without taking a licence – it misappropriated intellectual property Oracle acquired when Oracle bought Java, along with Sun Microsystems, in 2009. The trial is set to start today. A licence would not have been expensive. There is even a free, open-source version.As Oracle tells it, Google built Android out of Java building blocks so that it would be easy for the legions of existing Java developers to write Android applications. But it didn’t want to make Android fully compatible with other Java-based platforms, which taking a licence would have required.The idea was to keep the applications within the Android ecosystem, and under Google’s control. Developers can check in, but they can’t check out. This damages “the entire Java ecosystem”, according to an Oracle lawyer, because part of the value of any Java application is in its ability to “talk” to all the others.This story turns the images of Android as open software, and of Google’s “don’t be evil” ethic, upside down. Oracle is also cast against type, as the defender of openness, protecting compatibility in the name of all Java developers. Yet it is a bit hard to see how Google has harmed Java developers by building the first viable mobile operating system they can use and profit from. Anyone who has written an app for Android will have little trouble recasting it for another Java platform. Oracle is more likely concerned to participate in the future of a popular operating system that may grow beyond phones, and even enter Oracle’s core market, business software.Of course, all of this is only relevant if Google is found to have violated Oracle’s IP. There will only be reparations if there was a theft.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
310;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-04-11T15:00:37Z;Guest post: Moldova’s progress;;"By Lucian Anghel of BCRMoldova’s GDP per capita doubled over the last six years to an estimated $2,200 this year. With economic growth at 6 per cent in 2011, it was among the top three most dynamic economies in Europe. Exports surged by 29 per cent and investment advanced by more than 13 per cent in real terms.What lies behind this strong performance?Almost imperceptibly, Moldova has developed a highly effective IT sector, which now accounts for 10 per cent of the economy. Today, more than 1,200 companies are operating in the IT&C sector, employing about 20,000 specialists, many of whom supply solutions for western European companies on an ongoing basis.On top of their software kills, many young graduates in IT&C-related disciplines speak several languages, typically some permutation of Russian, English, French, Italian and German, along with their native Romanian.With such skill sets, many IT companies are becoming certified partners for top IT multinationals, including Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco, offering solutions in financial services, testing and business process outsourcing. As a result of the economic mini-boom, some parts of Chisinau, the capital, and its population of almost 800,000, give the impression of being part of a go-go EU country.Moldovan agriculture is another developing sector, expanding by almost 5 per cent in 2011. Wine in particular has been making progress, in terms of both exports and tourism. Wine and alcohol exports rose 2 per cent last year and the more than 200 kilometers of underground cellars to the south of Chisinau are a popular destination for a growing number of Western tourists. With a long tradition in wine production, Moldova is ranked among the top 20 wine exporters worldwide and the sector now accounts for 15 per cent of GDP.Moldova’s desire to become part of the European community of nations is reflected in its economic ties. The EU now accounts for 49 per cent of exports, with the Commonwealth of Independent States taking 41 per cent. Most importantly, after two decades of inconsistent developments, Moldova’s political situation is steadily improving. The election of a pro-western president in 2012 after nearly three years without a head of state has been an enormous boost for the process of integration and adopting European political and economic norms. The government has launched a reform programme to improve the business climate and implement European standards; a free trade agreement with EU is under negotiation. If successful, this will further facilitate exports to the EU and – thanks to a preferential tax regime – open new opportunities for European companies to expand into the Commonwealth of Independent States.Yet in spite of recent progress, Moldova’s Communist Party – an unreformed one at that – remains a significant political force and many Russian speakers in particular feel nostalgia for past times. Structural reform of the public sector is still at an incipient stage. A three-year programme under the IMF Extended Credit Facility, worth $572.7m, should help in this respect. Although declining, poverty is still significantly above EU standards. Considering that the average monthly salary is just $300, the authorities still have their work cut out to increase general living standards.Still, there is now hope for progress on Moldova’s most critical challenge, in its Eastern borderlands: Transnistria has been controlled by a separatist regime since independence in 1990-1992. The uncertainties caused by the existence of the Transnistria entity – which is not recognized by the international community – has been the biggest impediment to foreign investment for the last two decades.At the end of 2011 a more conciliatory head of the Transnistrian authority was elected. As a result, some progress has been made in the negotiation process managed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe with the involvement of EU, US, Russian and Ukrainian representatives.So if you would like to benefit from economic growth rates of around 6 per cent, at a reasonable risk and without being forced to go as far as Latin America, Asia or Africa, you could find an answer closer than you might think, just two or three hours flight from the most European capitals. Sometimes it’s worth looking east.Lucian Anghel is chief economist and head of strategy at the market and macroeconomics research division of Banca Comerciala RomanaRelated reading:

311;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-03-21T21:29:49Z;US stocks edge down;;US equities fell for a second straight day as new housing data showed that existing home sales slipped in February, even as homebuilders continued to strengthen their first-quarter gains.The S&P 500, which had opened the morning session positively, finished Wednesday’s session down 0.2 per cent to 1,402.89. The benchmark US index lost further ground from its highest close since May 2008 achieved on Monday.Economists expressed concerns about the housing market recovery with the latest data showing existing home sales fell by 0.9 per cent to 4.59m, just below analysts’ expectations .“As with the report for new home sales earlier in the week, the report for existing home sales, which makes up 93.5 per cent of the overall market, held close to the strongest level since May 2010,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economist at Miller Tabak.“However, the level of activity fails to change our view that any recovery is shallow, rising from a low base with conventional monetary policy failing to overcome the significant restraints hampering the housing market.”But the news did not damp momentum on the S&P 500 homebuilders index, which climbed 0.8 per cent on the day and has gained 34 per cent in the year to date.PulteGroup, one of three homebuilders measured by the index, led its rivals and rose 2 per cent to $9.39.Watson Pharmaceuticals, the maker of generic and brand name drugs, was the leading gainer on the main market.A Reuters report said the company was in talks to buy Actavis Group, a Switzerland-based generic drugmaker, for up to €5.5bn. Shares in Watson gained 8.8 per cent to $63.69.Hartford Financial Services was one of the day’s best performing stocks before settling, as it updated first-quarter projected earnings above analysts’ expectations. Shares in the insurance company rose as much as 7.3 per cent, but finished up just 1.2 per cent to $22.02.The S&P 500 financial service index led all major sectors in the morning session before falling 0.4 per cent to be second worst on the day, ahead of the energy index, which was down 1 per cent.Bank of America was near the top of bank stocks and was flirting with the $10 threshold for much of Wednesday. Shares in the bank climbed 0.1 per cent to $9.82. Morgan Stanley was the worst of the major banks, down 1.7 per cent to $20.06.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, was the biggest loser among the energy stocks and fell 5.8 per cent to $45.04 as it warned first-quarter profits would disappoint.The Nasdaq Composite Index was the only major index on the positive side, rising fractionally to 3,075.32.LinkedIn, the online professional networking site, was among the top gainers on the technology-heavy index.Shares in the company 6.5 per cent to $97.89 after receiving an upgrade from “hold” to “buy” by analysts at Goldman Sachs.“Our checks show increasing traction for LinkedIn’s hiring solutions and improving user engagement that, along with emerging products, suggest a steeper slope to the company’s long-term growth,” Goldman Sachs said in a note.“On a more macro level, we believe LinkedIn is one of the companies best positioned to benefit from growth in mobile usage, given its reliance on subscriptions over advertising.”Oracle, the software company, fell 2.3 per cent to $29.41 despite giving the tech sector a boost as it reported a “very solid” third-quarter in the three months to February 29.Analyst reactions to the company’s results were mixed, however.“The fact is that Oracle is not growing particularly rapidly and, despite an extended discussion to the contrary, the firm is facing a tougher group of competitors,” said Richard David, tech analyst at Canaccord. He reiterated his “hold” rating.Meanwhile, Citigroup analysts described the software company as “back on track” and maintained their “buy” rating on its shares.Micron Technologies, the semiconductor manufacturer, gained 2 per cent to $8.74 as reports said the company had made a $1.5bn bid to acquire Elpida Memory, a Japanese chipmaker.Netflix, the online and home delivery video provider, rose 4.4 per cent to $120.10 as it revealed plans to stream a new original series on its site, beginning in 2013.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,124.62. Hewlett-Packard, the computer and printer maker, was the biggest loser on the blue-chip heavy index.Shares in the company, which said it would combine its PC and printer divisions, fell by 2.2 per cent to $23.46.Walt Disney, the entertainment group that said on Tuesday that it would suffer a $200m loss on its latest film John Carter, rose 0.1 per cent to $43.27.Analysts at Nomura added its shares to their conviction buy list, saying: “We believe the focus will now shift to Disney’s core assets, which we believe are poised for above-peer growth.”
312;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-03-21T00:04:48Z;Tech sector given boost by Oracle;;Oracle gave a fillip to the tech sector with better than expected quarterly earnings and described its previous earnings miss as “an aberration”.The Silicon Valley company cast a shadow on the tech sector in December when it reported a slowdown in sales growth in its second fiscal quarter as deals were delayed by cautious customers referring final decisions to their chief executives – an indication of economic uncertainty hitting tech orders.But Safra Catz, chief financial officer, reported a “very solid” three months to February 29, the group’s third fiscal quarter, as it focused on its execution and was not dependent on any large deals.Oracle said licence revenues for its core software business rose 7 per cent year-on-year to $2.37bn, ahead of analyst expectations of 3 per cent. Profits of 62 cents a share beat analysts’ consensus of 56 cents, according to Bloomberg data. “It’s clear by these numbers that Q2 was actually an aberration,” Ms Catz told an analyst conference call. “Sequential growth is the highest it’s been in years, which is a sign that something was off frankly, because Q2 and Q3 are usually very similar quarters.”Analysts at Nomura Securities said Oracle had beaten profit forecasts through lower operating costs and a lower tax rate. Revenues from hardware products – Oracle bought server maker Sun Microsystems in 2009 – were down 16 per cent at $869m, with Wall Street expecting a fall of only 12 per cent.Ms Catz said the acquisition of Taleo, announced in February, would close in April. Oracle agreed to pay $1.9bn for the provider of online human resources management software as it moves more into delivering services from the cloud.FT tech writers upload their viewsLarry Ellison, chief executive, said that after a long period of testing, the Oracle cloud platform and its applications would become generally available in the current quarter. Database, human resources, financial and customer relationship management services on the Oracle Secure Cloud, which has been developed over the past six years, would be available for a monthly rental fee.“Salesforce.com does not offer this kind of security in their cloud … By far our biggest applications competitor SAP will take years to catch up,” he said. “In the meantime, the growing popularity of cloud computing gives us a great opportunity to replace SAP as the number-one applications company in the world.”Looking at the current quarter, the chief financial officer said the fundamentals of the business remained strong.The group ended its quarter with nearly $30bn in cash after the Taleo acquisition, a $1.7bn share buyback in the quarter and a dividend of 6 cents a share.Ms Catz predicted new software licence revenue growth would be between 1 and 11 per cent at constant exchange rates and hardware revenues could rise by as much as $110m, with estimates between $870m and $980m.Oracle shares rose 1.6 per cent to $30.58 in extended trading in New York on the news.
313;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-03-20T15:15:20Z;Risk and cash control: Many treasury systems still fail the ‘user friendly’ test;There is demand for more sophisticated capabilities but the software is not there yet, reports Jane Bird;Just as “fly-by-wire” systems control aircraft with minimal intervention from the pilot, so intelligent software looks set eventually to take over much of the corporate treasury function.Continuous calculations will be made in real time, for everything from cash management to complex risk, debt and investment strategy, with the software also spotting trends, raising alerts and triggering actions to optimise a company’s financial position.At present, such tasks are largely manual, making them time-consuming and prone to error, says Leslie Holstrom, senior editor of EuroFinance, which conducts research among 2,000 chief financial officers (CFOs) and treasurers a year.In future, intelligent treasury applications will be able to accomplish many tasks without human involvement, Ms Holstrom says.“If rating agencies downgrade a particular bank, software will run a ‘checker’ to see what exposure the company has, and adjust credit limits or take action to switch out of that bank.”The system will also generate reports – filing direct to government channels if a company opens in a new country, or issues a bond in a regulated market.Such software is still several years off, but there have been big developments in treasury applications since the economic crisis of 2008, which focused attention on the need for companies to have a clear picture of their financial position at all times.The traditional source of corporate treasury software was modules of enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications, from companies such as Oracle, SAP, Unit4, Lawson and IFS. But these have been limited in scope.Most systems do not have much that relates to treasury beyond cash and liquidity management, says Nigel Rayner, a vice-president at Gartner, the IT market research company.Now, corporate treasurers need software to help with a much wider range of skills, including managing financial instruments, issuing corporate bonds for debt finance, and understanding the impact of interest rate changes or currency fluctuations.Mr Rayner says: “Some organisations almost become banks and financial services companies, for example trading commodities such as oil, and hedging with complex financial instruments to fund expansion.”Many corporations have gone for a hybrid approach, combining ERP modules with specialist treasury management software from suppliers such as SunGuard, Wall Street Systems, IT2, and SuperDerivatives.Oren Cohanoff is head of strategic solutions at SuperDerivatives, which provides hedging and risk management software. He says current ERP systems are not up to combining a global hedging portfolio in a single system that could be managed across an international organisation.“While most corporate treasurers do not have a background in trading, increasingly they need to perform these activities,” Mr Cohanoff says.“Standard ERP systems can’t price derivatives, so corporate treasurers are unable to explore ‘what if?’ scenarios to investigate financial vehicles and assess their profit or loss. This creates risk.”Specialist treasury software is usually delivered, as software-as-a-service (SaaS), via the cloud. This makes it popular with CFOs, because it is a variable operational expense rather than a big capital investment, says Mr Rayner. “And in-house IT people don’t have to manage it.” Most CFOs have overcome security worries about the cloud, he says.While corporate treasurers are revamping in-house applications, they are also demanding improved services from banks, says Olivier Berthier, global solutions director, transactional banking at Misys, a financial software supplier.Previously, they expected banks to be cheap and quick, he says. “Now, they want banks to understand their corporate treasury value chain and advise on suitable products and services.”These might include software tools for cash pooling, to balance multiple accounts worldwide and to stop any going into the red.Trade finance tools, which help companies manage international transactions, are also in demand, says Mr Berthier. “This is the area of greatest demand. But companies need to ensure their in-house IT systems can integrate with instruments used by the bank,” he says.Increased demands from corporate treasurers are also noted by Cindy Murray, head of treasury e-commerce for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They want to understand where their cash is at any given moment, regardless of country and region,” she says.“They also want to deal with multiple banks without being locked into a single proprietary system. So they expect us to collaborate increasingly with other banks and develop a standardised global approach to technology through organisations such as Swift.”The move towards automation extends far down the treasury value chain to areas such as electronic invoice processing.Although 99 per cent of invoices are created electronically, three-quarters of them are printed for processing, says Martyn Christian, chief marketing officer of Kofax, an information management company.The goal is to make this process “touchless”, so that invoices are automatically logged, checked against a purchase order and paid, Mr Christian says.Treasury applications still have far to go. They have failed to become as user-friendly as software in other departments, says Ms Holstrom. In the words of Mr Rayner: “They still tend to be fragmented, with a surprisingly high number of disparate systems implemented in a patchwork, with no overall strategy.”
314;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-03-12T21:20:16Z;Wall St steady despite global worries;;US equities were mixed on Monday as fresh economic data out of China added to growing concerns that the world’s second-largest economy was cooling.The S&P 500 was up fractionally on the day to 1,371.09 as markets reacted to news that a drop in exports had caused China’s trade deficit to widen last month and provided further evidence that global demand was slackening.Shares were sent to their worst performance in nearly three months last Tuesday after China revised down its growth forecasts for 2012. Stocks recovered later in the week as a resolution to a Greek debt restructuring deal was reached and strong non-farm payroll employment data from the US supported hopes of a labour market recovery.China’s two largest online video providers, Youku and Tudou, soared as the US-listed companies announced an all-share merger on Monday that raised the prospect of creating a profitable market leader. Shares in larger Youku climbed 27.4 per cent to $31.85, while smaller rival Tudou jumped 156.5 per cent to $39.48.Banks were leading the losers with the benchmark index’s financials off by as much as 0.8 per cent as the day began with reports that Greece’s new bonds – following last week’s debt swap – were trading at distressed levels. Citigroup recovered early day losses and ended up 0.3 per cent to $34.29, while Wells Fargo dropped 0.5 per cent to $31.51. Bank of America fell below the $8 threshold, down 0.8 per cent to $7.99 and Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $18.20.But volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, continued to fall, down 7 per cent to 15.92. The Vix, or Wall Street “fear gauge”, climbed above 20 before resettling last week as fears of global economic woes crept back into the market.The S&P 500 utilities index was the best performing sector, up 1.1 per cent. Gains were led by Constellation Energy, which added 3 per cent to $37.23 and Edison International, which climbed 1.8 per cent to $43.69.The Nasdaq Composite index moved down 0.2 per cent to 2,983.66, edging away from the 3,000 mark that it eclipsed two weeks ago for the first time since the dotcom boom. The Nasdaq fell despite gains by Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the index. The company finished up 1.3 per cent to $552.Oracle, the software company, lost 1.4 per cent to $29.71 after Jefferies lowered its rating from “buy” to “hold”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent to 12,959.71. The blue-chip heavy index was led by ExxonMobil, which rose 1.5 per cent to $85.55. The oil company was reported as having reached an agreement for payments with the government of Iraq for work on an oilfield in West Qurna.Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, climbed 0.2 per cent to $29.84 after being upgraded from “hold” to “buy” by Nomura.“Lowe’s has begun to make tough decisions . . . In many ways, it is following what Home Depot did three years earlier when it slowed growth, shut stores, cut costs and addressed inventory. The bottom line is that Lowe’s has begun to play offence,” said Aram Rubinson, analyst at Nomura.Rival home improvement group Home Depot was up 0.5 per cent at $48.59 even as Nomura maintained its “hold” rating on the company’s shares.United Continental Holdings, the parent of United Airlines, was down 1 per cent to $19.62 after analysts at Bank of America downgraded shares in the recently merged company from “buy” to “hold”, citing oil prices. Southwest Airlines, another US carrier, fell 2.4 per cent to $8.28.Harley-Davidson, the iconic motorcycle maker, hit a 52-week high and closed up 2.6 per cent to $48.11 after analysts at Citigroup raised its price target.Confectioner Hershey gained 1.8 per cent to $60.56. The chocolate maker was upgraded from “hold” to “buy” by equity analysts at Goldman Sachs Investor Research.Michael Kors, the retail group, fell by as much as 5.8 per cent before finishing down 2.1 per cent to $48.57. The company, which went public last December, said shareholders had agreed to waive lock-up restrictions with underwriters.American Apparel rose 21.5 per cent to $0.91 on a report that George Soros was considering offering a credit line to the struggling retailer.
315;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-02-24T22:14:51Z;AOL urged to look at patent portfolio sale;;"An activist investor has called on AOL, the struggling digital media company, to consider five new board members and explore the sale of its patent portfolio, which it said could be worth up to $1bn.Starboard Value LP, which owns 5.2 per cent of AOL, said it was “troubled that the company remains closed-minded to alternative value creation initiatives, and instead appears solely focused on pursuing the status quo”.The move follows a letter Starboard sent to AOL in December, when it expressed disappointment with the company’s direction. AOL is attempting to kick-start its online advertising business with a premium content strategy that includes sites like the Huffington Post and TechCrunch, while managing the decline of its internet access service.Starboard’s nominees include Jeffrey Smith, chief executive of Starboard; Ronald Epstein, head of a company that helps sell patents; Steven Fink, who once managed investments for Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison; and two other executives with digital media experience.AOL said it had met Starboard several times and offered to work with the investor “to help shape” its board’s composition and size. One person familiar with the talks said AOL had agreed to consider “qualified” board candidates but disagreed with Starboard’s nominees.AOL said it had already begun reviewing its patent portfolio last year, before Starboard’s first letter.Starboard’s latest statement came a day before AOL’s deadline for nominating directors for its annual meeting, expected in May. AOL stock is up 80 per cent since its 2011 low and up 20 per cent this year but still below its valuation when it was spun off from Time Warner in December 2009."
316;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-02-09T21:48:57Z;Latest deal highlights cloud agenda;;Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Taleo for $1.9bn is the latest in an aggressive and competitive wave of market consolidation in the emerging cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) software field, which has also seen SAP acquire Success Factors, and Salesforce.com acquire Rypple.It also underscores the growing importance of cloud-based business software and the scramble among traditional enterprise planning software companies including Oracle and SAP to bolster their cloud offerings.“These acquisitions indicate the increasing enterprise acceptance of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, with HCM following in the footsteps of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) as the next SaaS battleground,” said Tim Jennings, chief analyst at Ovum, the technology market research firm.“It also emphasises the urgency that the major enterprise application vendors attach to establishing a strong position in cloud-based software,” he said. “Both Oracle and SAP have existing on-premise HCM solutions, but both have been prepared to pay out large sums on cloud-based equivalents, rather than simply transitioning their existing solutions to the cloud.”Taleo will also further advance Oracle’s public cloud strategy, joining the recently closed acquisition of RightNow for customer service management, Oracle’s Social Network for collaboration, and Oracle’s own Fusion applications.Like SAP’s pending $3.4bn acquisition of San Mateo, California-based Success Factors which was announced in December, Oracle’s proposed acquisition reflects the increasing demand from customers for more flexible cloud-based enterprise software that can be accessed on demand.With cloud-based start-ups like Taleo, Success Factors and Rypple making inroads in the human resources area, the giants of the software industry have had to respond, said Paul Hammerman, an analyst at Forrester Research.This trend also reflects easing concerns among major companies about the availability and security of cloud-based software and a growing appreciation that on-demand cloud-based services can provide additional flexibility and agility.“The cloud offers new delivery styles and options that are industrialised in a value chain that renders on-premises IT systems and expertise as only part of the overall delivery of IT capabilities to the company,” noted Darryl Plummer of Gartner in the IT research group’s predictions for this year.Among business users, customer relationship management and human resource management have emerged as some of the first major corporate functions to switch from in-house software packages running on corporate servers to cloud-based services that run over the internet.As a result, tools that allow companies to track and measure employees performance – often called “talent management” suites – have become one of the high-growth areas in the software industry. IDC has estimated that the sector grew by 41 per cent between 2009 and 2010, and both Taleo and Success Factors are considered leaders in the field.This switch also underscores the rapid changes under way in corporate HR departments which once relied heavily on internal systems and costly external agencies, especially for recruitment. “Human resource information systems have altered how HR services are delivered and managed by organisations,” says the Washington-based Society for Human Resources Management.So why has talent management software as a whole fared so well in recent years? In an interview last year Michael Gregoire, chief executive of Taleo, explained that the functions it provides are in tune with board-level concerns in times of economic uncertainty.“When chief executives find themselves unable to invest in hard assets such as new warehouses or manufacturing lines, their attention tends to be drawn to the workforce as a source of competitive advantage,” he said.“That focus often triggers the realisation that they simply don’t have the transparency they need to identify the ‘stars’ in their organisation, the high-performers who make a measurable contribution to business results and who need to be nurtured, motivated and rewarded for their achievements.”
317;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-02-09T19:33:59Z;Oracle in online shift with Taleo purchase;;Oracle is set to take its biggest leap yet into the fast-growing world of cloud computing, announcing on Thursday that it would pay $1.9bn for Taleo, a US company which provides online human resources management software.The deal echoes SAP’s pending $3.4bn acquisition of a similar company, Success Factors, and reflects an acceleration in the shift of some key aspects of business software to the internet. With companies such as Workday, an internet-based start-up, making inroads in the human resources area, the giants of the software industry have had to respond, said Paul Hamerman, an analyst at Forrester Research.Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, once dismissed cloud computing as “gibberish” and a passing fad, but has recently embarked on a number of acquisitions of companies offering internet-based software. The agreement to buy Taleo tops the $1.5bn that Oracle paid to acquire RightNow, which provides online software for managing customer services.The shift to online delivery of software – known as “software as a service”, or SaaS – threatens to disrupt the traditional software business since customers pay through annual subscriptions, replacing the upfront sales that are central to Oracle and SAP.Mr Hamerman said: “Oracle has been very reticent about SaaS, preferring the revenue recognition associated with its original licensing model.”But he added that in human capital management – the name given to software from companies such as Taleo – and customer-relationship management, “the market has already voted” for online delivery, forcing Oracle to follow suit.Oracle’s latest acquisition will revive an old battle in the software industry. A decade ago, the world’s second-biggest software company triggered consolidation in the industry with an unsolicited bid for PeopleSoft, a company selling traditional human resources software. Dave Duffield, the entrepreneur behind PeopleSoft, and Aneel Bhusri, a long-time ally, went on to found Workday, opening a new front by shifting their focus to online delivery.Oracle, which has bought more than 70 companies in a $40bn buying spree over the past few years, is under pressure to lift sales growth after revealing in December that sales had only grown just 2 per cent in the three months to November.Tim Jennings, chief analyst at Ovum, called Oracle’s move “the latest in an aggressive and competitive wave of market consolidation” in human resources software, following the Success Factors deal and Salesforce.com’s acquisition of Rypple.Tools that allow companies to track and measure employees’ performance has become one of the high-growth areas in the software industry. An IDC study calculated a market growth rate of 41 per cent for the sector between 2009 and 2010. Taleo and Success Factors, both relatively young companies, were the leaders in the field.Shareholders at Redwood City, California-based Taleo will receive $46 a share, an 18 per cent premium over Taleo’s closing price on Wednesday.
318;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-02-08T18:56:27Z;Google in patent push to win Motorola approval;;Google will make a public declaration on how it intends to use Motorola Mobility’s arsenal of patents in a bid to clear the path for Europe’s competition watchdog to approve its $12.5bn takeover of the US smartphone maker.The potential for the internet group to exploit the market power of Motorola’s 17,000-strong patent portfolio has emerged as a key issue for Brussels, which is assessing the proposed tie-up between the maker of the most popular smartphone operating system and its main handset vendor.Yielding to pressure from the European Commission, Google will reiterate Motorola’s existing commitments to license any patents that are part of industry-wide technology standards to all applicants on a fair and reasonable basis.The gesture of good faith will also outline in more detail a ceiling for patent royalties and the steps that would be taken to resolve disputes before Google would resort to court injunctions seeking to ban a product from being sold.The letters, which will be sent to standard setting bodies, mostly restate what lawyers see as legal obligations that Google would inherit from Motorola. Google’s unusual step of declaring that it will follow the law underlines the Commission’s determination to address the patent wars roiling the technology industry.Brussels last week opened an investigation against Samsung Electronics over concerns that it breached antitrust rules blocking rivals access to key technologies – a case raising issues that are seen as having some parallels with the Google merger. The deal gives Google direct access to Motorola Mobility’s portfolio of more than 17,000 patents and 7,500 pending patents, ammunition Google claims it needs to repel a patent assault by Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and others on its Android mobile phone operating system.During negotiations with competition officials, Google was nevertheless asked about the risk that these patents could be used in an aggressive manner that would inhibit competition. A wider aim of the Commission is to better define the fair and reasonable terms for licensing patents, a process that would be assisted by Google providing greater clarity on the use of injunctions or royalties.Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner, will on Tuesday announce whether he will clear the Google-Motorola merger, or open a more in-depth, second phase investigation.While Google did not submit any legally binding concessions – so-called “remedies” – to address specific competition concerns, a statement of intent on the use of patents would be taken into account in the approval decision.A Commission spokesperson declined to comment. Google said the company always intended to license Motorola’s standard-essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
319;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-02-07T21:14:59Z;Misys and Temenos agree key merger terms;;Misys and Temenos have reached agreement on the key terms of a proposed £2bn merger that would create the world’s largest supplier of risk-management computer software to banks.The planned merger, one of the biggest between European technology companies, would see Misys shareholders take 53.9 per cent of the combined group and Temenos shareholders 46.1 per cent.The combined group would have about 1,000 banks as customers, making it about four times larger than its closest competitors, the financial services arms of Infosys, TCS and Oracle.Guy Dubois, currently chief executive of Temenos, would hold the same role at the combined group, while Stephen Wilson, the chief financial officer of Misys, would become CFO of the merged company.The combined company would have its headquarters in Switzerland but be listed on the London Stock Exchange, with a potential secondary listing in Switzerland.Andreas Andreades, chairman of Temenos, would become chairman of the combined group. Misys would choose five out of nine board members while Temenos would pick four.Mike Lawrie, chief executive of Misys, will leave the company. His departure was widely expected, given that, during the five years Mr Lawrie has been working to turn around the Misys business, he had never made the UK his permanent home during that time.Value Act, the largest shareholder in Misys, has sad it is strongly supportive of the proposed merger.Misys is closely held by a small group of shareholders, including Schroders Investment Management, Threadneedle and Fidelity. Standard Life is one of the ten largest shareholders in both companies.With no period of exclusivity, some industry analysts still expect a counterbid to emerge for Misys, possibly from Fidelity National Information Services, which had failed takeover talks with the company last summer.Analysts said it remained to be seen whether Temenos shareholders would want to swap their stock for shares in the combined group, given that Misys shares have gained nearly a third in value over the past month on the back of bid rumours.Misys shares fell 2.6 per cent to 326.10p ahead of the announcement by the companies after the close of trading in London. It was valued at £1.12bn at the closing price. Shares in Temenos rose 0.56 per cent to SFr19.25, giving it a market capitalisation of SFr1.38bn.Misys and Temenos are expecting costs savings from combining their back office and research and development functions, although people close to the company said that the two companies’ flagship core banking software systems – BankFusion and T24 – will both be maintained.The companies are under pressure to agree a deal quickly, not just to prevent the emergence of a rival offer, but because of concerns that customers will delay orders while there is uncertainty over the future of the two companies.Temenos has rapidly grown its share of the market for core banking software during the last few years, but experienced a sharp drop in spending last year as banks pulled back on new projects. Misys has had slower growth in the past few years but has withstood the downturn better thanks to repeat revenues from a long-established customer base.
320;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-02-07T11:25:08Z;Oracle seeks fresh trial in SAP copyright case;;Oracle will seek a new trial in a long-running copyright infringement battle with rival SAP rather than accept a reduced damages from the German software maker.Last year a US judge ruled that Oracle should receive no more than $272m in damages from SAP or seek a new trial, throwing out an original $1.3bn jury award over copyright infringement by a former SAP subsidiary.But in an Oakland court filing on Monday, the US software group said a new trial would be the only way to “vindicate the verdict of the jury and Oracle’s intellectual property rights as a copyright owner”, news wires reported.SAP issued a statement saying it was “disappointed that Oracle has passed up yet another opportunity to resolve this case. We will continue to work to bring this case to a fair and reasonable end”.SAP’s shares slipped by 0.4 per cent to €47.90 in early trading on Tuesday.The dispute stems from the unauthorised access to Oracle’s computer systems gained by TomorrowNow, a software support and maintenance company acquired by SAP in 2005.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, accused SAP of “industrial espionage and intellectual property theft”, helping the colourful legal battle become the talk of the tech community.Although the German software company admitted in court that its subsidiary had copied large amounts of software code, it rejected Oracle’s large damages claim.SAP currently has the wind in its sails, having achieved record results last year thanks to product launches that helped it gain market share from rivals. By contrast, Oracle last month said sales growth had slowed.
321;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-02-03T11:51:25Z;Misys holds $2bn merger talks with Temenos;;Misys and Temenos, its Swiss rival, are in talks about a possible $2bn merger that would create the world’s largest supplier of risk-management software to banks.The UK group on Friday confirmed it was in preliminary discussions with Temenos about an all-share deal following constant market speculation over its future in recent months, which has pushed its share price up by nearly half.People close to the deal said Temenos was likely to take just 45 per cent of the combined company but that Guy Dubois, Temenos chief executive, would become its CEO. Misys would appoint the chairman. The companies said there had been no agreement on terms.A combined Misys/Temenos would have about 1,000 banks as customers, making it about four times larger than its closest competitors, the financial services arms of Infosys, TCS and Oracle.But both companies, which have had a sometimes fractious relationship, have been hit by the squeeze on European banks’ spending amid pressures on profitability and delays to long-term IT investments.At the same time, the financial industry is facing sweeping regulation on both sides of the Atlantic, which will require banks to maintain larger capital reserves, alongside greater transparency and tighter margin requirements for trading. Many banks admit they will need real-time monitoring of capital to meet the new rules, potentially benefiting companies such as Misys and Temenos, which can provide appropriate software.Takeover talks between Misys and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) collapsed last summer, but analysts said the Temenos talks could flush out a counterbid from competitors such as Infosys or TCS.“There is more of a chance of them getting involved than when there were talks with FIS and Misys,” said Milan Radia, analyst at Jefferies. “A combined Temenos/Misys is much more dangerous a competitor to them.”Others suggested that Misys had been, in effect, up for sale for six months but had attracted no bids. “Management would be unlikely to entertain talks with arch-rival Temenos unless they felt that other avenues were exhausted,” said David Toms, an analyst at Numis Securities.Both companies have had internal reorganisations in recent months. Mr Dubois became chief executive of Temenos last July just before a profit warning. Misys has been digesting the 2010 acquisition of Irish rival Sophis for £235m but is coming towards the end of a five-year turnround plan under Mike Lawrie, its chief executive. He has been backed by ValueAct, a US private equity firm which is both a 22 per cent shareholder and his former employer.Misys closed up 4p at 329.5p, giving it a market capitalisation of £1.1bn. Temenos rose SFr2.7 to SFr19.9, giving it a market capitalisation of SFr1.3bn. Temenos is being advised by Lazard and Misys by Barclays Capital.
322;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
323;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-01-25T09:05:05Z;SAP bullish as it brushes off slowdown;;SAP has shrugged off Europe’s economic slowdown as the world’s biggest business software maker by sales indicated it may raise its 2015 sales goal after achieving record annual profits and setting double-digit growth targets for this year.The bullish message from SAP contrasts with gloomy news from Oracle, its biggest rival, which sent shivers through the technology sector last month when it reported an unexpected slowdown in sales growth and earnings that sparked worries about corporate IT spending.But IBM and Intel were among the tech companies that last week reported solid margins, raising hopes that the sector can withstand a sluggish economy.Bill McDermott, SAP’s co-chief executive, told the Financial Times in an interview: “If you look at Italy, Spain, Portugal – parts of Europe that people have expressed concern on – we’ve grown over 20 per cent in these markets.”“Optimism is a free stimulus: sometimes it really does intrigue me that people are so hell-bent on selling themselves into a recession instead of getting focused on innovation, their customers, their people, and leading in a certain sense.”“It’s one of the things that more people who have the reins of companies need to do. They need to take charge,” he added.In December, SAP agreed to buy SuccessFactors, a provider of cloud-based human resource management software, for $3.4bn to boost its presence in the fast-growing cloud computing segment.At the time, SAP said the SuccessFactors deal might help it reach €21bn in sales by 2015 compared with the German company’s €20bn target.But Mr McDermott said on Wednesday: “I’m confident that we have at least €21bn-plus [of sales in 2015] at this stage of the game.”“Once we bring SuccessFactors on and we get that really rolling, and we see where we’re at the end of 2012, it may be time to adjust it even more.”SAP’s total revenues increased 14 per cent to €14.2bn last year, excluding the takeover of SuccessFactors, which is yet to close.Since taking the reins at SAP in February 2010, Mr McDermott and co-chief executive Jim Hagemann Snabe have reinvigorated a tired brand, restored the trust of a once restless workforce, embedded a new strategy and chalked up eight consecutive quarters of double-digit software revenue growth – a closely watched metric due to opportunities for further service-related business.SAP’s shares have increased by about 9 per cent during the past year, outperforming most German blue-chip stocks.New products in mobile, cloud computing and so-called “in memory computing” – which allows users to rapidly analyse vast quantities of data – are helping to fuel growth at SAP, prompting Mr McDermott to characterise the 40-year old company as a start-up in certain respects.Overall, SAP said it expected software and software-related services revenue to increase 10-12 per cent this year.Operating profit was expected to increase from a record €4.7bn last year to between €5.05bn and €5.25bn, or as much as 11.5 per cent. The figures are at constant currencies and are not based on international financial reporting standards.
324;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-01-24T14:39:28Z;Analysing customers: It pays to keep data near where they are crunched;Jessica Twentyman explains ‘in-memory analytics’, which give much quicker insights into behaviour and preferences;"Who are our best customers? Which products or services do they regularly buy from us? What offers or promotions would best persuade them to spend more?At many companies, getting answers to questions like these can be a long, drawn-out affair.Customer data must first be pulled from a range of operational systems.Then, it must be reorganised in an enterprise data warehouse (EDW).Running a query against that EDW, meanwhile, can take hours or even days, depending on the complexity of the query.It is a painfully slow process, and by the time results are delivered, they can hardly be expected to offer the most up-to-date view of current buying patterns.In the age of “big data”, however, stale reports on historical purchasing patterns struggle to satisfy business needs, says Stephen Gallagher, a business intelligence (BI) expert at PA Consulting.For a start, he says, many companies want to gather information about customers and their behaviour “from an ever-expanding range of fast-moving channels”, from recordings of calls made to customer-service agents to complaints or praise posted on social media sites such as Twitter.“At the same time, there is a growing need to respond faster to changing customer demands by making use of real-time analytical techniques,” he adds.In-memory analytics technology promises to solve the problems of time-delay associated with traditional approaches to customer analytics.The main way it achieves this is by keeping data in the main memory of a server, rather than on a database spread across physical disks on a separate machine. In this way, data are kept closer to where they are “crunched”.Three recent developments in server technology have made in-memory computing a viable proposition for mainstream corporate IT.One is the emergence of 64-bit architecture, which makes more of a server’s main memory usable for purposes beyond simply running that server.The second is multi-core systems, which use multiple central processing units (CPUs) to boost the speed and power at which a server can perform a computing task.The third is the falling cost of RAM [random access memory], which can now be bought for about $20 for 1GB, compared with $150 just a few years ago.Eliminating the mechanical processes of writing data to disk-based storage elsewhere (and reading it back again) – sometimes referred to by suppliers as the “input/output (IO) bottleneck” – and substituting it with in-memory processing can result in enormous boosts in analytic performance.Take, for example, Japanese electronics supplier, Yodobashi: it has reduced the time it takes to calculate monthly incentive payments to 5m loyalty-card holders from 3 days to 2 seconds, according to executives at SAP, the company that supplies the in-memory database used by Yodobashi.In fact, analysing customers is the number one reason that companies have invested in Hana in-memory computing since its launch in December 2010, says Steve Lucas, executive vice-president of business analytics and technology at SAP.“Customer analytics is the top scenario for Hana right now, and the reason is because in the current economic environment, companies really need to understand what their customers are buying and what products to sell to them.“ I can’t think of a better use of in-memory technology right now.”Executives at database giant Oracle, meanwhile, are thinking along the same lines; they announced the company’s own in-memory analytics appliance, Exalytics, at its San Francisco conference in October 2011.“I’m proud to say our Exalytics machine not only handles relational data, not only multidimensional data, [but] also analyses unstructured data at the speed of thought. Nothing is faster. There is no response time,” said Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, in his keynote speech.But the considerable head start that SAP has seems to be serving the German company well so far; in its 2011 fiscal year, sales of Hana reached $160m, well ahead of the company’s target of $100m in revenues.That suggests a buoyant market in the year ahead for in-memory analytics.At Forrester Research, an IT market research company, James Kobielus, an analyst, expects 2012 to “boom”, not just for customer analytics, but all forms of data analysis.At a time when businesses rely more than ever on fresh and plentiful data to respond to opportunities and emerging trends, in-memory analysis looks set to become “the predominant architecture for all users, uses and data,” he predicts."
325;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-01-13T16:45:44Z;SAP bucks pessimism with record results;;SAP defied fears that cautious businesses might slow investment in new software when the German company posted record fourth-quarter and full-year results that exceeded analysts’ forecasts.SAP, the world’s biggest maker of business software by sales, boasted that it was outperforming and gaining market share from its competitors after fourth-quarter operating profit rose 10 per cent to €1.78bn, excluding exceptional items, including a one-time litigation effects. This beat a €1.65bn consensus estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters StarMine.Software revenues – a closely watched metric of future performance due to the tendency of customers to enter lucrative, long-term service contracts – were 16 per cent higher at €1.7bn. Total revenues increased by 10 per cent to €4.5bn.The shares surged 3.8 per cent to €43.04 on Friday, when most German blue-chips were trading in negative territory. The figures are preliminary and are not based on international financial reporting standards.Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, co-chief executives, said in a statement: “In an uncertain environment, SAP delivered the best year in its 40-year history. We gained significant market share and achieved double-digit growth across all regions.”Last month Oracle, SAP’s big rival and a bellwether for tech corporate and government tech spending, sent shivers through the business software sector when it warned that sales growth unexpectedly slowed and earnings fell short of forecasts.Software AG, Germany’s second-biggest software company by sales, added to spending worries this week when fourth-quarter sales and profit missed estimates, sending its shares spiralling 20 per cent lower.SAP has remained bullish on corporate tech spending in recent months. The company is banking on growing demand for new products in mobile, cloud and so-called “in-memory” computing that allows clients to quickly analyse huge quantities of data.The company said on Friday that it had recorded €160m in sales of its HANA “in-memory” technology platform, exceeding a €100m target.“Oracles’s figures led to scepticism in the marketplace [about whether] SAP could achieve these kind of results, which explains the share price increase,” Mirko Maier at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg said. “It’s also pleasing to see HANA and SAP’s mobile business having a bigger impact in their first year than many people expected. The most important thing to watch for now is SAP’s outlook for 2012.”SAP last month said it would buy Success Factors, the provider of cloud-based human resource management software, for $3.4bn in an effort to strengthen its ability to provide software to companies over the internet, which is considered a key industry growth area.The company’s full-year revenues rose by 14 per cent to €14.3bn, while software and software-related serve revenue climbed by 17 per cent to €11.4bn at constant currencies, exceeding the company’s guidance for an increase at the upper end of a 10-14 per cent range.SAP is due to report final fourth quarter and full-year figures and its outlook for 2012 on January 25.
326;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-01-10T19:40:34Z;Software AG shares tumble as sales fall short;;Shares in Software AG, Germany’s second largest software company, tumbled by more than 20 per cent after fourth quarter sales and profit missed estimates due to growing customer caution and weak US sales of its business process optimisation software.The company said it expected quarterly net income to decline by up to 30 per cent to between €45m and €50m after customers withheld investment that traditionally boosted sales in the fourth quarter. Revenues are set to decline by around 10 per cent to between €290 and €295m.Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a profit of around €70.4m and €340 million in sales.Software AG’s license revenues – a measure closely watched by analysts due to the opportunity for repeat service business – were as much as 27 per cent below the prior year, at constant currency rates.Oracle’s slower than expected revenue growth and cautious forecast last month hit technology stocks amid fears that falling confidence is beginning to hold back corporate spending on business software.In spite of financial market turmoil and fears of a slowdown in Europe, Oracle and rival SAP had previously been among the most resilient technology stocks.Software AG is the latest in a series of European tech companies that have reported weaker demand. Logica, the IT services company, last month cut 1,300 jobs saying that its customers had never been so unsure of the future.Investors had anticipated a decline in Software AG’s Brazil enterprise transaction revenues due to the prior year impact of transferring local customers to a new direct sale model. But Software AG was unable to make up this shortfall in Europe and the US as it had hoped. It is the second time in little more than six months that the company’s sales figures have precipitated a sharp share price fall.“Presumably, the predicted economic slowdown meant that customers’ residual budget, in contrast to normal years, was not invested in capacity expansion,” Software AG said in a statement. For the full year the company expects to achieve turnover of nearly €1.1bn, the same as the previous year at constant currency rates. In October it had forecast an increase of up to 5 per cent.Arndt Zinnhardt, chief financial officer, said Software AG “had to face a difficult business environment which has slowed down our revenue growth after a promising nine month performance in 2011”.Analysts at Exane said they believed Software AG’s problems to be driven by macroeconomics and not company-specific.Software AG’s shares tumbled by 20 per cent to €24.19 dragging down SAP’s stock, which fell 1.4 per cent to €42.07.
327;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2012-01-10T17:17:54Z;Ainslie launches America’s Cup campaign;;Ben Ainslie, who would become the most successful Olympic sailor in history if he adds one more to his collection of three golds and one silver at London 2012, on Tuesday launched his campaign for the America’s Cup in an international sporting alliance with US software group Oracle.Ainslie is assembling a team for a British challenge initially underwritten by Oracle Racing, funded by US software billionaire Larry Ellison, which will compete first in the America’s Cup World Series in AC45 wing-sailed catamarans, and ultimately take on the cup’s defender in the full-size AC72s.Ainslie, who will also be joining the San Francisco-based US team after the Olympics in August to seek a coveted spot in their America’s Cup boat in 2013, appealed for funding from international companies to back his new British team’s full challenge for the “Auld Mug”.He said the set-up costs for the newly created Ben Ainslie Racing, €3m, had been underwritten by Oracle, though teams have been known to spend $200m for a full run at the trophy.Setting out his long-term vision to compete in the 35th America’s Cup, after the 34th edition is staged in San Francisco next year, he said: “I’ve always tried to have a plan of what I’m doing next after the Olympics. The 2012 Olympics has been the focus, but from that has come the opportunity to be able to build a team which we hope can ultimately go on to challenge for the 35th America’s Cup.”Ainslie noted that the America’s Cup had been “in a difficult place” but said its organisation was now “second to none, attracting the best athletes and designers and with a bright future”.”We aim to be a challenger for the cup in the future and in the meantime to bring in commercial partners, to build the brand and an elite team of sailors. It’s a fantastic opportunity for people to get involved with the America’s Cup.” He said early team members were Grant Simmer in a managerial role and Jo Grindley in communications.Sir Russell Coutts, four times winner of the America’s Cup and Oracle Racing chief executive, told the FT at the launch of the initiative at London’s Royal Festival Hall: “With Ben, our challenge is to build an invincible team around his objectives as well as ours. We get his incredible talent and in return he gets to see our teamwork and learn all about wing-sailing as we do and apply it to his own team of sailors.“There is no question he is a fantastic talent and we will be using those skills in ways yet to be determined. He could choose a more technical role with Jimmy Spithill at the helm, or he could take him on for that spot. I will put the best man behind the wheel when it comes to it.”Sir Russell added: “This arrangement is taking the concept of the sport to a whole new level where, as with Ben, we are seeing more important player trading, the sport and action becoming more dynamic as a result. The wing-sailed boats are becoming more and more manoeuvrable, making racing more exciting.“In the AC one-design classes, competition is more equal, the trick with the wing is when and how you shift the wind power and how the crew reacts as the wind shifts and the boat turns. These younger, fitter Olympic sailors will play an increasingly important role in the handling of this finely tuned technology. The boats only amplify the skills of good and average sailors.”Sir Russell said earlier: “With all the things we are doing to improve the America’s Cup commercially, I think this is a great time for someone like Ben laying down the foundations for his own team. With massive improvements to televising the racing and staging it right where fans can see it, there has never been a better arena for stars such as Ben.”Ben Ainslie Racing will be entering the America’s Cup World Series representing the Royal Cornwall Yacht Club, which is run by commodore Peter Collett in Falmouth, which may now find itself competing in the same international arena as Oracle’s Golden Gate Yacht Club.It will be 34-year-old Ainslie’s fourth America’s Cup campaign. After the 2000 Sydney Olympics he joined the American One World Challenge, then after Athens in 2004 he helped Team New Zealand lift the Louis Vuitton Cup before joining Sir Keith Mills’s challenge Team Origin as skipper after Beijing.Welcoming Ainslie to his team, Sir Russell said: “It’s fantastic for the America’s Cup that we’ve got a three-time Olympic gold medallist, four-time Olympic medallist, hopefully soon to become five. The America's Cup without Ben would be a little bit like Wimbledon without Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic. He’s the number one sailor in the world right now and it’s fantastic to have him involved in our team.”The cup was first awarded in 1851 by the Cowes-based Royal Yacht Squadron for a race around the Isle of Wight which was first won by the schooner America. The trophy was renamed the America’s Cup after the winner and was donated to New York Yacht Club under the terms of the Deed of Gift which made the cup available for perpetual international competition that has drawn challengers from around the world ever since with billions of dollars to invest in attempts to lift the trophy.The event delivers the third-largest economic rewards in sport to host countries, behind the Olympic Games and football’s World Cup, according to a recent study.As the America’s Cup takes place on a three- to four-year cycle, the World Series, staged in Europe and the US, was introduced to give teams and their sponsoring partners a more sustainable business model and take the best sailors and fastest boats to other venues.With fleet and match racing over five days, it rounds off with a winner-takes-all finale in which a championship title is awarded.The 2011-12 season started in Cascais, Portugal, last August and finishes its first season in Newport, Rhode Island, in June having stopped at Plymouth, San Diego, Naples and Venice. The champion of the 2012-13 season will be crowned just prior to the start of the Louis Vuitton Cup (the America’s Cup challenger series) in July 2013.Simon Greaves is FT.com’s sailing correspondent

Warren Buffett has recorded an online video for the CCTV Spring Festival gala, an entertainment show viewed by hundreds of millions every year on Chinese New Year’s eve.The secret of singing in China is knowing not just how to sing, but what (given the sensitivity of one’s hosts). Mr Buffett has done his Axl Rose impression in an ad for Geico, so a number from Guns N’ Roses’ Chinese Democracy album is probably out. A classic such as David Bowie’s China Girl? Or China in your hand by T’Pau (with China Crisis as his backing band)? Perhaps he chose one of the Bob Dylan protest songs not played by the singer at his concert in China last year. But to welcome in the Year of the Dragon, maybe a rousing rendition of Puff the Magic Dragon would work best?
329;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-30T04:20:23Z;Former HP chief loses appeal over letter;;Mark Hurd, former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and now president of Oracle, was forced to disclose a letter detailing allegations of sexual harassment made against him while in charge at HP, after a Delaware court denied his request to keep it sealed from public view.Mr Hurd had appealed to keep the letter confidential, saying that revealing the information it contained about his relationship with Jodie Fisher, an HP marketing consultant who accused him of inappropriate behaviour, would violate a California privacy law.The Delaware court disagreed in a ruling issued Thursday, instead siding with an HP shareholder who demanded the letter be made public in support of his investigation into corporate wrongdoing.“[Al]though the letter goes into embarrassing detail about Hurd’s behaviour, it does not describe any intimate conversations or conduct,” the court said. The letter “does not contain any nonpublic financial information, trade secrets, or other proprietary information”.The eight-page letter was written by Gloria Allred, an attorney for Ms Fisher, and sent to Mr Hurd in June 2010. A copy of the letter, obtained by the Financial Times on Thursday, claimed that Mr Hurd repeatedly attempted to engage Ms Fisher in romantic exchanges over the two years that she did contract work for HP. At events from Los Angeles to Madrid between 2007 and 2009, Mr Hurd invited Ms Fisher to dinner or stopped by her hotel room, according to the letter.Ms Allred also wrote in the letter to Mr Hurd: “It is appalling that you would use HP revenues for the purpose of procuring female companionship and romance under the guise of HP business.”HP’s board investigated the matter and found no substance in the sexual harassment claims, but did determine that Mr Hurd mishandled expense reports in violation of the company’s code of conduct. That investigation report remains sealed.Mr Hurd resigned from HP in August 2010, but left with a severance package worth up to $40m. He and Ms Fisher resolved the sexual harassment dispute privately around the same time. Ms Fisher has since said that the letter contained “many inaccuracies”, a point reiterated by representatives of Mr Hurd and Oracle on Thursday.Amy Wintersheimer, employment attorney for Mr Hurd, said in a statement: “The truth is, there never was any sexual harassment, which HP’s investigation confirmed, and there never was any sexual relationship, which Ms Fisher has confirmed.”Ernesto Espinoza, an HP stockholder, asked to see company records and documents, including the letter, as part of a shareholder investigation into whether Mr Hurd’s actions, and the HP board’s response to them, amounted to corporate wrongdoing, mismanagement or waste.Though Mr Espinoza has seen the letter and admitted in court documents that his investigation is “neither furthered nor undermined by the publication” of it, he argued in support of releasing it to the public because its contents demonstrate it was “a business communication concerning how and why Hurd allegedly breached his fiduciary duties to HP stockholders”.HP declined to comment.Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco.
330;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-23T21:42:49Z;NYSE falls behind as S&P 500 solidifies gains;;Tech stocks sat out a good week for equities, as an earnings miss by Oracle led to a sell off in the software sector on Wednesday.Oracle ended the week down 10.8 per cent to $26.06 after revenues rose just 2 per cent to $8.8bn in the three months to the end of November compared with the 7 per cent growth that had been forecast, as corporate customers delayed purchases.“Management noted that IT budgets were not reduced, rather the sales cycle increased as additional levels of approval were required, which is typical of a macro slowdown,” said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund.“Cloud” software company Red Hat, which had lowered 2012 guidance earlier in the week, fell 12.7 per cent to $41.59 and Salesforce.com, a fast-growing software company, whose contract growth has slowed markedly in the past month, fell 8.4 per cent to $98.02.That meant the Nasdaq ended the week up just 2 per cent to 2,618.64, underperforming other US indices, and still in negative territory for the year.The S&P 500 climbed 3.7 per cent over the week to 1,265.31, putting the benchmark index into the red for December, historically a good month for equities, and, more importantly, just into positive territory for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6 per cent to 12,294.00. That left the large-cap index up more than 6 per cent for the year, but analysts were quick to stamp on suggestions that meant US equities had enjoyed a good year.Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, pointed out that just two stocks – IBM and McDonald’s – had accounted for half of the Dow’s gains this year.“That’s a function of the way the DJIA is constructed – weighted by stock price rather than market cap – as well as the strong performance of these two stocks,” Mr Colas commented.The Dow has also been helped by the small number of financials in the index, and the low stock prices of the banks that are in the index. Bank of America has traded in a range of $4.92 to $15.31 this year and JPMorgan $27.85 to $48.36, meaning they do not move the price-weighted index significantly.On Friday, for example, BofA shares climbed 2.4 per cent to $5.60 for the best performance in the Dow, but that did not even shift the index 1 point, whereas a gain of just 1.5 per cent to $184.75 for IBM shifted the index more than 20 points.The Nasdaq and S&P 500, both market capitalisation-weighted indices, both lag the Dow by more than 5 per cent in the year to date.Shares in NYSE Euronext lagged behind the market up just 0.6 per cent to $26.38, despite receiving approval from US regulators for its proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Börse.Analysts at Raymond James said the deal was still likely to be blocked, as European regulators remain concerned about competition within the exchange space. Raymond James cut its 12-month price target for the exchange to $36 from $42, based on a 33 per cent probability the merger will go ahead.Akamai Technologies was a rare bright spot among tech stocks, climbing 19.8 per cent to $31.93 as investors in the internet services company applauded its $268m purchase of Contendo, a “cloud” services company.“This is a very positive move,” said Michael Turits, a tech analyst at Raymond James. “Akamai are doubling down on the cloud side of their business, which has seen faster growth and has higher margins than their core video acceleration business.”First Solar climbed 8.7 per cent to $34.70. lnvestors picked up shares in the world’s largest solar panel manufacturer by market capitalisation after Robert W Baird analysts said it could be subject to a takeover bid, after its valuation tumbled 75 per cent over the year.Takeover speculation was fuelled late in the week when Total boosted its stake in SunPower, a smaller panel maker, to 66 per cent. SunPower shares climbed 17 per cent to $6.00.TripAdvisor fell 13.3 per cent to $25.15, in its first three days of trading on the Nasdaq, after it was spun out from its parent, the travel booking website Expedia.Investors had shown strong interest in the travel review website as it traded in a “when-issued” market for two weeks before its formal listing, once Expedia shareholders had approved the spin off. But several analysts offered negative opinions once the stock was trading.A Morgan Stanley recommendation to sell the stock on Thursday, which citied expected margin compression and greater competition from online search engines, led to a 10 per cent fall.Mead Johnson Nutrition slumped 10.5 per cent over the week to $65.29, as it battled negative publicity after a newborn baby died in Missouri after being given one of its powdered products.Both Walmart, where the Mead product was bought, and Supervalu, the operator of Jewel-Osco supermarkets, pulled the Enfamil powdered baby food formula from their shelves, citing an “abundance of caution,” as investigations continued as to the cause of death.The CBOE Vix index of equity volatility continued to fall. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” has now dropped more than 25 per cent over the month and is trading at 20.88, meaning the price of options on the S&P 500 have tumbled during December.
331;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-23T16:36:18Z;Investors fret over Oracle results;;A rare slip-up by one of the technology industry’s most reliable profit-machines, or evidence of a broader slowdown that is about to hit the sector at large?That was the question left hanging this week after Oracle, the world’s second-biggest software company, disclosed surprising weakness in its latest quarterly earnings and revenue growth. The company’s shares tumbled 12 per cent after news that its sales had grown only 2 per cent in its latest quarter, compared with the 7 per cent increase Wall Street had been expecting.Oracle executives blamed the shortfall on weaknesses in the company’s management of its own sales processes. In particular, they said the company had been caught out by delays to the way customers approve technology purchases, with some referring the decisions up to their chief executives.With underlying demand from customers still said to be strong, Oracle promised the problem would be fixed by the time it next reports results.The comments failed to reassure investors. The breadth of the sales weakness, which hit most of the company’s products and geographic markets, left some wondering whether a broader pull-back by customers lay behind the disappointment.Other tech stocks slipped as Wall Street digested the implications for other IT suppliers in what is typically their strongest quarter of the year. With a fiscal quarter that ended in November, a month before most others in the sector, Oracle’s weak numbers could be an early warning of more bad news ahead.
332;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-22T16:29:03Z;Asian techs slip after Oracle disappointment;;Asian shares drifted lower as investors remained worried that Europe’s debt crisis would not be resolved in the near future.The FTSE Asia Pacific index slipped 0.3 per cent to 218.25 with technology stocks among the biggest fallers across the region following a disappointing set of results from Oracle, the US software group.In Seoul, Hynix Semiconductor fell 0.9 per cent to Won21,150 and Samsung Electronics slipped 0.5 per cent to Won1.05m, even as the Kospi index eased less than 0.1 per cent to 1,847.49.In Tokyo, Advantest, which makes equipment for testing memory chips, sank 4.5 per cent to Y740, the lowest since November 1992, as it was further burdened by negative broker comment.Similarly, industrial robot maker Fanuc shed 3.4 per cent to 11,450 after a sector downgrade by a leading securities house, traders said.Tokio Marine Holdings, the casualty insurer, dropped 1.7 per cent to Y1,713 on worries that the company may be paying too much to buy Delphi Financial.But there were bright spots in the Japanese market. Tepco jumped 5.2 per cent to Y222 after reports that the utility planned to raise electricity rates at factories and office buildings from April next year.The Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.8 per cent to 8,395.16, ending a two-day run of gains.The broader Topix index lost 0.4 per cent to 723.12. Volume was just above the year’s lowest level as activity from foreign investors dwindled ahead of the holiday break.Chinese stocks remained under pressure amid concerns about the economic outlook for the country.The Shanghai Composite index closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,186.29, having touched a 33-month intraday low.The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong also eased 0.2 per cent to 18,378.23. Li & Fung, which supplies goods to retailers including Walmart, dropped 2.9 per cent to HK$14.14.In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 index fell 1.2 per cent to 4,090.8 as retailers were hit by a warning of disappointing Christmas sales from Kathmandu Holdings. Shares in the New Zealand-based outdoor gear chain tumbled 25 per cent to A$1.23.
333;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-21T21:49:49Z;Oracle earnings miss spurs sector sell-off;;"An earnings miss by Oracle sent software stocks tumbling on fears that large business customers are taking longer to close orders.Oracle fell 11.6 per cent to $25.77 after revenues grew just 2 per cent to $8.8bn in the three months to the end of November compared with the 7 per cent growth that had been forecast.Richard Davis, of Canaccord Genuity, stripped Oracle of its “buy” rating, saying: “Oracle will have to rebuild confidence that the firm is not headed to Microsoft’s valuation level [seven times earnings] over the next few years.”But other analysts blamed the miss on delayed purchases by corporate customers, which would affect software stocks more widely.“Management noted that IT budgets were not reduced, rather the sales cycle increased as additional levels of approval were required, which is typical of a macro slowdown,” said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund, who maintained a “buy” rating on Oracle.“Cloud” software company Red Hat, which had lowered 2012 guidance earlier in the week, fell 4.9 per cent to $39.90, now down 16.2 per cent for the week.Salesforce.com, a fast-growing software company, whose contract growth has slowed markedly in the past month, fell 5.1 per cent to $99.03.Citrix systems fell 7.8 per cent to $58.46 as Citigroup analysts said it was among the most exposed to the possibility of “non-recurring software orders” from businesses.That left the Nasdaq Composite index reeling. The technology-heavy index fell 1 per cent to 2,577.97.Research In Motion was one of the few bright spots, climbing 10.1 per cent to $13.78 on hopes that it could be an acquisition target after reports that Yahoo had considered a bid for the BlackBerry handset manufacturer.RIM’s market capitalisation has fallen 75 per cent this year due to poor sales of its PlayBook tablet
and a failure of its BlackBerry network but analysts said the share price may fall further before a buy-out.“We expect to see further pressure on RIM’s share price,” said Stuart Jeffrey at Nomura. “While we believe that RIM shares could be worth $15 in a gradual wind-down scenario, we don’t see financial buyers bidding until the stock falls below $10.”Shares in Yahoo itself were on the move too, climbing 5.9 per cent to $15.99 late in the day on reports the internet portal will sell Alibaba Group and its Japanese affiliate back to their majority holders in a deal that could be worth $17bn.Tech stocks also weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended the day flat at 12,107.74, with IBM off 3.1 per cent to $181.47 and Cisco Systems down 2.7 per cent to $17.92.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2 per cent to 1,243.72, turning positive late in the day, despite Moody’s warning of a possible downgrade to US sovereign debt in 2012.The S&P 500 had opened lower as European nerves returned, after strong demand from the continent’s banks for three-year loans from the European Central Bank.US bank stocks also reversed early losses to close in positive territory, with Bank of America up 1.2 per cent to $5.23.Oil producers showed firmness as the price of crude oil edged up for a second day, nearing $100 a barrel, after falling as low as $94 last week. Among the smaller explorers, Noble Energy was up 1.9 per cent to $94.56 while, among the majors, ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $83.12.Cintas Corp rose 9.3 per cent to $34.19 for the best performance in the S&P 500. The provider of bathroom supplies and entrance mats raised its fiscal year 2012 profit forecast to at least $2.16 a share, 13 cents higher than expected.Nike climbed 2.9 per cent to $96.35 after the world’s largest sports goods company reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates by 12 per cent on strong North American sales.Walgreen shares tumbled more than 5 per cent in early trading after the pharmacy missed earnings estimates on declining market share, but shares recovered to close down just 0.4 per cent to $33.37.Rival CVS Caremark ticked up another 1.7 per cent to $40.46 after surging 9 per cent on Tuesday, as it raised its dividend.The CBOE’s Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 fell to its lowest level since the start of August, closing at 21.63. It had consistently traded above 30 from August through November."

Aim-listed Sierra rose 3 per cent to 34p.Retailers were not helped by a profit warning from Thorntons, down 37.5 per cent to 23¼p, and a reading of UK consumer confidence that was the lowest since 2009. Marks and Spencer lost 2.2 per cent to 302¾p and Supergroup fell 3.3 per cent to 480p.“In aggregate, we believe that Christmas trading statements are likely to show deterioration of performance year-on-year but sequentially we believe the run rate of sales for many companies may benefit from more promotional-driven sales and weaker comparatives pre-Christmas,” Goldman said.It saw Dixons Retail, off 2 per cent to 9½p, as among the most likely to disappoint due to a “commoditised” product range and reliance on Christmas.Ocado remained out of favour in the wake of Monday’s profit warning, losing a further 7.9 per cent to 52¾p.

335;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-21T19:14:05Z;Oracle: big issue;Expectations must be trimmed for all business technology vendors;Stock market bulls have argued in recent years that, while spending by indebted consumers and governments is likely to remain sickly, big companies, which are enjoying record profitability and strong balance sheets, are in rude health and will spend to grow further. The 14 per cent fall in Oracle’s shares early on Wednesday after its weak earnings report suggests that this particular stool’s one good leg is becoming wobbly.Oracle sells more software to big companies across industries and geographies than anyone else. In the past quarter, new software licence revenues grew just 2 per cent, a 10th of the rate of a year ago. It appears that those robust global companies are feeling a bit cautious. The pressing issue is what this means for the earnings of other big business technology vendors. These fit into two camps: the slow-growing value plays, and innovative growth plays (Oracle falls between the two).Consider a representative sample of the former – IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, SAP, Dell and Xerox. Analysts expect near-term sales growth in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range on average. Even this may be a bit optimistic, but the reason to own these stocks is their cash generation and low valuations more than their revenue trajectory. For the latter group – EMC, VMware, Salesforce.com, NetApp – the outlook is for strong double-digit growth. If the slowdown reaches cutting-edge parts of data storage, virtualisation and cloud computing, look out.Oracle is not a perfect bellwether. Last week’s results from technology services leader Accenture were solid. Business technology spending has not simply stopped. But Oracle’s results are unsettling, not just for other technology companies but for companies and investors who have hitched their financial wagons to the fortunes of the world’s largest companies.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Carrefour, Europe’s largest retailer, dropped 4.7 per cent to €16.58 as fears of weak Christmas sales continued to hit retailers across Europe.German retailer Metro lost 3.8 per cent to €28.23 as the Xetra Dax index fell 1 per cent to 5,791.53.German software company SAP sank 6.1 per cent to €39.92 due to falling sector confidence following disappointing results from US technology firm Oracle.Deutsche Telekom also fell 0.9 per cent to €8.75 as Credit Suisse cut its forecast for the German company. “Overall, we see modest rather than major downside with the group likely to maintain its dividend and comfortably service its debt,” wrote Credit Suisse.
337;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-20T22:25:22Z;US data boost homebuilding stocks;;Homebuilders led a strong rally in US stocks as the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day so far in December.PulteGroup rose 10.4 per cent to $6.17, DR Horton was gaining 5.7 per cent to $12.43 and Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $19.68, as construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November.Home improvement retailers were boosted, with Masco rising 8.9 per cent to $9.82 and Home Depot adding 4.3 per cent to $41.93.Some analysts were cautious, however, noting that much of the rise was due to building works starting on apartment blocks, which hit a three-year high.“The report doesn’t signal any turn in fortunes for the lion’s share of the market – single family homes,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Activity there rose by just 10,000 units to a 447,000 annualised pace and the highest in only five months.”Other analysts warned that Tuesday’s gains could be reversed by a change in sentiment, noting the high volatility of homebuilder stocks. All three large US homebuilders had fallen on Monday, in spite of a confidence survey rising to its highest level of the year.Broader markets bounced with the S&P 500 adding 3 per cent to 1,241.30 after its best day of the month. However, the benchmark US index remains in negative territory for December, traditionally one of its strongest months.The financial sector of the S&P 500 recovered ground after Monday’s sell-off. Bank of America climbed back above $5, a level that it had breached on Monday for the first time since 2009. BofA shares closed up 3.7 per cent to $5.17.Morgan Stanley climbed 4.5 per cent to $14.80 and Citigroup was up 4.6 per cent at $25.95.Jefferies surged 22.9 per cent to $14.50, its highest close since October, as the investment bank revealed quarterly earnings that were not as bad as expected.Profit fell to $63m, 23 per cent lower than last year, but many analysts had expected worse. The bank faced intense scrutiny of its exposure to eurozone sovereign bonds in November, but fees from investment advisory services rose year on year.“The results are better than expected but the share price reaction is overdone,” said Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga Securities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.9 per cent to 12,103.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.2 per cent to 2,603.73.AT&T lagged behind the market, but was still up 1.3 per cent to $29.01, despite calling time on its attempt to acquire T Mobile USA.That was a fillip for its equipment suppliers. Juniper Networks climbed 8.9 per cent to $19.74 and F5 Networks was up 6.7 per cent to $109.39.“We believe this development is a short-term positive for equipment vendors,” said George Notter at Jefferies. “We believe that AT&T in recent months had significantly dialled back fourth-quarter spending in order to apply leverage in its fight with regulators.”Rival network Sprint Nextel also took cheer, closing up 9.3 per cent to $2.36.BlackBerry handset manufacturer Research In Motion suffered another day of heavy selling.Shares fell 2.9 per cent to $12.52, the latest losses apparently triggered by reports that as many as 5,000 of its PlayBook tablets had been stolen from a freight truck.CVS Caremark rose 8.9 per cent to $39.80. The pharmacy chain boosted its quarterly dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.Eastman Chemical jumped 8.1 per cent to $38.70 after announcing it had broken ground on a new facility to produce acetate in China.Red Hat fell 8.9 per cent to $41.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. The open-source software company reported fiscal third-quarter billings that missed analysts’ estimates.Billings, a predictor of revenue, increased 23 per cent from a year earlier in the three months to the end of November.Cruise ship operator Carnival Corporation was one of the other five S&P 500 stocks to fall. Shares close down 0.2 per cent to $31.93 after Carnival lowered guidance for 2012 earnings.Zynga, the online social game developer, enjoyed its first day of gains since a $10bn IPO last week.Its shares were up 2.1 per cent to $9.24, still 76 cents below their debut price.In after-hours trading Oracle shares tumbled 10 per cent to $26.26, after the software reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. That knocked the S&P 500 futures by 5 points suggesting the benchmark index may open lower on Wednesday.
338;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Oracle’s earnings miss chills tech stocks;;Shares in technology companies fell across the board on Wednesday morning after investors took fright at an unexpected slowdown in sales growth at Oracle in the latest quarter and earnings that fell short of forecasts.Oracle shares were down 8 per cent in pre-market trading, as two large brokerages cut their price targets for the stock. SAP, Oracle’s European rival, was down 4.3 per cent in morning trade, while Capgemini, Europe’s largest IT services company, was down 4.36 per cent. Atos, another IT services company was down 2.36 per cent and Software AG, the German software company, fell 2.8 per cent.“We have seen a dramatic deceleration in new business for Salesforce.com and slowing growth from Red Hat recently,” said analysts at JP Morgan. “This may be just the beginning of a long list of IT companies that struggle in the next quarter or more.”The world’s second-biggest software company after Microsoft, Oracle had previously proved one of the most resilient tech companies amid the recent financial crisis and ensuing economic headwinds.However, news on Tuesday that its revenues had grown by only 2 per cent to $8.8bn, compared to the 7 per cent growth that had been expected in the three months to the end of November, sent a chill across the tech sector.The sales weakness was caused by delays in finalising big purchases late in the quarter, said Safra Catz, Oracle co-president. This reflected changes by some companies in the way they approve big new tech purchases, leaving the final decision with their chief executive officers, she added.In the past, requiring more senior approval on purchases has often reflected growing caution on the part of customers and foreshadowed a broader sales slowdown in the tech sector. However, Ms Catz and other Oracle executives described the impact as temporary and said that tighter management of the sales process, along with the addition of 1,700 extra sales staff, would see the company bounce back.Despite the show of confidence, the maker of database and business application software also issued a cautious forecast for its current quarter, predicting that revenues would increase by 2-5 per cent from a year before, compared to the 8 per cent analysts had been expecting. Pro-forma earnings per share are likely to reach 55-58 cents, it added, compared to the 59 cents expected by Wall Street.As the first of the big tech concerns to report earnings and a bellwether for tech spending by big companies and governments, Oracle’s results were seen as a sign that falling confidence had eaten into tech spending at what is traditionally the strongest period of the year for IT suppliers.The sales weakness was reflected in growth of only 2 per cent in new software licences, compared to the 6-16 per cent that the company itself had predicted three months before. New software licences are seen as a key indicator of underlying business health, since the company’s future maintenance revenues are closely tied to the level of new sales.The company’s hardware division also registered another decline in sales, reflecting growing pressure on a business that Oracle assumed with its acquisition of Sun Microsystems a year ago. Sales fell by 14 per cent to $953m.On the pro forma basis on which Wall Street judges the company, Oracle reported net income of $2.8bn, or 54 cents a share, compared to the 57 cents analysts had expected. Based on formal accounting rules, net income rose by 17 per cent to $2.2bn, or 43 cents a share.
339;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-19T12:15:49Z;BT sues Google in patent case;;BT, the UK telecoms company, has launched legal action in the US against Google for patent infringement in a number of areas crucial to the US technology group’s search, maps and music services, as well as its Android phone platform.BT claims infringement of patents in technologies behind location-based services, navigation and guidance information, as well as access to mobile services and content.Such patents cover a variety of Google’s services, such as music, maps and advertising but also its Android operating system, which was used in more than half of smartphones sold globally in the last quarter.BT has filed a civil suit in a Delaware court alleging infringement of one or more of six of its patents. The company has asked for unspecified damages, as well as for a trial by jury.In a statement, Google said BT’s claims were “without merit” and it would defend itself “vigorously against them”.In a statement, BT said it had made “a well-considered claim” and that there was “a strong case of infringement”.It said: “BT can confirm that it has commenced legal proceedings against Google Inc by filing a claim with the US District Court of Delaware for patent infringement. BT’s constant investment in innovation has seen it develop a large portfolio of patents which are valuable corporate assets. This is about protecting BT’s investment in its intellectual property rights and innovation.”BT has a total worldwide portfolio of about 5,600 patents and applications, and during the last financial year filed for patent protection on 62 inventions.Over the past five years, BT has spent more than £5bn on research and development and has a history in mobile telecoms given its Cellnet venture in the 1980s.BT says that those services that infringe one or more of its patents include the storage, retrieval and delivery of location-based activities of Google’s search engine, Android, AdMob, AdSense, Gmail, Google+, Google Maps, Google Offers and Google Location.It says that Google has derived a substantial value from these products and services and the action aims to recover compensation it is owed and to prevent Google from continuing to use the services without BT’spermission.The case marks a return by BT to a widespread patent battle being engaged in the telecoms industry, which has intensified in recent years given the popularity of smart phones and internet based services by rivals offering often similar platforms.In particular, those companies that have been established longer are looking to use their large historic patent portfolios to either prevent others using them, or derive some value from them through licensing deals.However, patent issues are often very complicated and can come down to interpretation given the similarity of many technologies that do slightly different things.Google is involved in a number of patent disputes with companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Oracle over its Android platform.Handset manufacturers are similarly involved in complicated legal suits, ranging from fundamental technologies that allow the devices to work to the simple design of phones.The International Trade Commission is expected to rule Monday in the US on a patent case involving HTC and Apple that had been delayed last week, which also involves Android phones made by HTC. This could also have a wider implication for Google’s Android platform should there be a decision in favour of Apple.
340;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-08T22:57:49Z;Big software groups buy into the cloud;Companies pay premiums for web-based start-ups;While companies are upgrading their IT infrastructure to take into account megatrends such as the shift to cloud computing and the growing importance of business analytics and “big data”, the enterprise software market itself is undergoing something of a metamorphosis.In the past few months, three premium-priced software acquisitions have highlighted the changes under way in the enterprise software market.First, Oracle agreed to buy RightNow Technologies, a leading provider of cloud-based call centre automation, sales force automation (SFA) and customer relationship management (CRM) services for $1.43bn.Then on Saturday, Germany’s SAP announced plans to buy SuccessFactors, a cloud-based human resource management service, for $3.4bn – a 52 per cent premium over the previous day’s closing price.Now, International Business Machines has agreed to acquire DemandTec for $440m. DemandTec’s flagship product analyses data to help retailers decide how much to charge for their wares. The company has added capabilities to track promotions and work with consumer products companies.All three deals highlight the trend of established big tech companies paying big premiums for relatively young companies offering web-based software to fill out their cloud-enabled product portfolios.For their business customers, these deals could be something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, they should enable the acquirers to provide a more complete “one-stop shop” for cloud-based business applications. On the other hand, some analysts fear they could reduce competition and perhaps even stifle innovation.Oracle in particular has been scrambling to assemble a full range of cloud solutions, including sales force automation, human resources, talent management and social networking, as part of its Oracle Public Cloud initiative.Oracle, seen by some as being a latecomer to the cloud party, and RightNow should be able to offer what Oracle describes as “a superior customer experience at every contact and across every channel”.The deal also represents an important counterweight for Oracle in its continuing battle with Salesforce.com, the market leader. RightNow, which has about 2,000 customers, is seen as something of an also-ran to Salesforce.com and will bring some customers into the mix, but more importantly it will bring a mid-market CRM solution to Oracle.Similarly, SAP’s purchase of SuccessFactors should help Europe’s biggest software group to expand its offerings of the cloud-based services many of its customers have been clamouring for.SuccessFactors provides software that helps companies manage their workforce, hosted in remote data centres or “the cloud”. With 15m subscriptions at more than 3,500 companies worldwide, it is believed to be the second-largest cloud-based provider of enterprise software after Salesforce.com.SAP’s own cloud-based offering, Business by Design, has taken longer than expected to develop and has seen a relatively slow uptake among customers. “The cloud is a core of SAP’s future growth, and the combination of SuccessFactors’ leadership team and technology with SAP will create a cloud powerhouse,” said Bill McDermott, SAP’s co-chief executive, when he announced the deal.IBM’s $13.20-a-share purchase of DemandTec – a 57 per cent premium over DemandTec’s closing price on Wednesday – follows a similar logic.The agreed purchase will help IBM build on its focus of providing its customers with the tools to extract value from the huge volumes of data that they are now able to collect from point-of-sale and other applications.DemandTec’s complex number-crunching applications help customers make business decisions based on near real-time data, and its purchase will extend IBM’s own push into cloud-based software and services.“DemandTec has unprecedented capability to improve customers’ price and promotion tactics,” Craig Hayman, general manager of industry solutions at IBM, said in a statement.DemandTec’s biggest customers are US retailers trying to make sense of the gargantuan volumes of data they collect from shoppers.In the fiscal second quarter, 23 per cent of DemandTec’s $22m in revenue came from Target. Walmart Stores is another big customer. The company reportedly charges its biggest customers about $2m a year for access to its pricing program, which is primarily designed to help them fine-tune their sales forecasts and predict consumer demand.The purchase will complement IBM’s “smarter commerce” portfolio, which it introduced earlier this year with DemandTec’s pricing functionality adding to IBM’s existing business analytics tools focused on marketing, mobile devices and other areas. IBM says the portfolio addresses a market opportunity the company that could worth $20bn or more by 2015.
341;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-12-05T22:45:36Z;SAP/SuccessFactors: a long-term punt;German software company makes a sensible long-term bet;It is an odd time for a speculative deal but SAP does not want to be left behind. The German software maker’s purchase of SuccessFactors, a cloud-based human resources software company, for $3.4bn in cash including debt, comes on the heels of rival Oracle’s $1.5bn October acquisition of RightNow, which develops similar software for call-centres. SAP’s move is part of the scramble to develop cloud-based services that deliver software to customers via the internet, reducing companies’ computer hardware budgets. With no near-term earnings kicker, however, investors pushed down SAP’s share price on Monday by 2.5 per cent.The reason is that valuations for cloud-based companies are sky-high. The $40 per share SAP will pay for SuccessFactors is 333 times its earnings and almost 9 times next year’s sales. In comparison, Oracle’s purchase of RightNow valued the target about 6 times sales. SuccessFactors’ third-quarter revenue growth of about 70 per cent – about six times higher than RightNow’s – helps to justify the additional premium. But the deal’s success is dependent upon SAP’s sales force pushing cloud-based services much harder to generate revenue synergies, something investors should normally ignore.If, by 2013, SuccessFactors’ general and administrative expenses are removed, and revenue synergies equal to 20 per cent of its sales are realised, the deal will still only be earnings neutral, UBS calculates.SAP’s management believes that only about 14 per cent of the two companies’ customers overlap, allowing for significant cross-selling. That still makes the deal a long-term punt but, with the industry shifting towards cloud services, it has a sensible rationale. At the very least, it is good to see a company making a strategic long-term deal even with the knowledge that in the short term its share price will be punished.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
342;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-11-17T20:38:35Z;NetApp: watch the canaries;Selling information technology to big corporations has been a gold mine;"Selling information technology to big corporations has been a gold mine for IT enterprise providers in recent years. Companies handle an ever-increasing amount of data and new tools for managing it have emerged. Revenue and profit growth at the leading IT providers has been strong, even during the downturn. As with any mine, however, watch the canaries.With $6bn in annual sales, storage vendor NetApp is a big bird. Results reported this week may have the miners worried. Revenue was up by a fifth but below expectations; margins and guidance were light, too. The company said the issue was “an unexpectedly large slowdown” in nine of its largest US accounts. Customers are looking for low prices in a market where “there is a lot of capacity chasing deals”. NetApp’s shares fell by more than a 10th on Thursday.Of the IT companies that have reported recently, NetApp provided the biggest negative surprise. But there are a few other queasy-looking canaries: EMC, another leader in storage, said that it expected slightly less than seasonal revenue growth in the next quarter, a view echoed by CDW, the big technology reseller. A glance at recent quarterly reports from the IT leaders (IBM, Oracle, Cisco Systems, Juniper, Hewlett-Packard and Dell) shows that there is a reasonably consistent pattern of revenue and net income deceleration. But the slowdown is not severe and is perhaps to be expected as the rebound from the 2009 recession recedes into the past. Margins have only faded slightly.The core strengths of the IT vendors – geographically diversified corporate customers with strong balance sheets and products that provide demonstrable returns on investment – remain. But the industry is not isolated from the larger economy. If global growth sputters, the chirping will stop too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
343;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-11-14T19:48:25Z;Buffett and IBM: tech switch;The company’s sheer size makes the next phase a bigger challenge;Does Warren Buffett buy a stock because it’s a good investment, or is it a good investment because Warren Buffett buys it? Generations of Mr Buffett’s admirers have been wary of tech stocks because The Oracle was. But now Berkshire Hathaway has bought more than 5 per cent of IBM.This turnabout makes sense at several levels. IBM has the financial and operational characteristics that Mr Buffett favours. IBM generates oceans of free cash flow ($80bn between 2005 and 2010) and allocates it in shareholder-friendly ways ($82bn in buy-backs and dividends over the same period).IBM has achieved this, and increased net income by nearly 90 per cent while hardly expanding its asset base at all. The move into services – now well over half of revenues and the chief legacy of Sam Palmisano, the departing boss – makes IBM relatively stable. As new business technologies emerge, IBM’s global network of consultants simply help their customers install and use them. And IBM’s cash generation means it also has a war chest for acquiring cutting-edge technologies.Berkshire Hathaway, with $35bn in gross cash on its balance sheet and more rolling in all the time from Mr Buffett’s portfolio companies, needs to put money in big, liquid stocks. IBM, with its $220bn in market value, fits the bill. But IBM’s sheer size will make the next leg of growth a bigger challenge than the last one. The competition is going to be tougher as well. Hewlett-Packard, for example, cannot execute poorly for ever. Because of IBM’s success and the accelerating commoditisation of hardware, every big tech company is rushing into services and software. IBM is the most richly valued of the big IT companies, at 14 times forward earnings. By paying up, Mr Buffett got a stake in the best-run and most stable large tech company. But it has a very large target painted on its back, as well.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

345;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-11-13T19:57:37Z;SAP resumes search for big acquisitions;;Jim Snabe, the co-chief executive of SAP, says the software company is looking for further, large acquisition opportunities, to build on its purchases of Business Objects and Sybase.“We’ve proven twice that we can buy big and be successful with that. With Business Objects, which we bought a couple of years ago, we came into the analytic space in a very strong way and we are now a clear market leader. Last year we acquired Sybase to bring the mobile technology to business software. So we can and we are also, of course, looking for such opportunities,” Mr Snabe told the Financial Times.But while he will not shy away from deals, Mr Snabe’s key focus is still innovating the company from within.“We can innovate faster than others can acquire. We have brought our innovation cycle down to six months, while a big transaction can take much longer than that, 12-18 months,” he said. It is an indirect allusion to Oracle, SAP’s US rival, which has made acquisition a central strategy, buying about 78 companies over the last six years.One of the most important innovations is making SAP’s technology more appealing to consumers. The software tends to be in the background of large corporations, running financial transactions, for example, or a human resources database. But few employees will realise they are using it. Mr Snabe wants them not just to notice – but to smile.“At Electronic Arts they have a rule that if they don’t see visible joy in a user in seven minutes a game will not sell. I would like to do the same with business software,” he told the Financial Times. “We are not quite there yet, but sometimes we do get visible joy, with people saying ‘this is really cool and I am going to show it to my children’,” he said.Last year, when Mr Snabe and Bill McDermott, his co-CEO, took charge of the company, they set a target of “touching 1bn people” with their software by 2015, putting the software into the hands of more employees at each customer company.It is crucial to do this, as the way that business software is bought is changing dramatically. In a move often referred to as the “consumerisation of IT”, employees are increasingly bringing their own technology to the workplace and expecting the same kind of ease of use from business software as they get from their Google webmail or their Apple iPad.If companies like SAP don’t adapt to these trends, they face being replaced by newer competitors.“Big enterprise software installations are very sticky – they represent decades of investment so companies don’t easily change them. But it is not a market that is growing very fast,” said Ross MacMillan, analyst at Jefferies. “Over time, if upstart vendors begin to offer inexpensive, cloud-based versions of software that address complex processes that SAP software addresses, the company could face a lot of risk.”“It is important for SAP to show that they are continuing to innovate, and adding to the platform that customers have installed. It will keep customers spending more money with them,” he said.Mr Snabe has borrowed ideas not just from EA, but a host of other companies.“We visited Porsche to learn lean, EA to learn user feedback, Cisco to learn how to breathe new ideas into the company, and Intel to learn about complex innovation processes,” Mr Snabe said.Internet and tablet companies are also clearly an inspiration. “We want to take the concept of Facebook and bring it to business,” he added.When Mr Snabe demonstrates some of SAP’s new products they all appear designed to work on an iPad screen. One, a team evaluation tool, allows pictures of employees to be plotted on a performance chart with the swipe of a finger. Another, a diagnostic tool for doctors, shows patient records in a Facebook-like format.One of the surprise hits for the company has been Hana, an in-memory processing technology that allows large amounts of information to be analysed extremely quickly. Customers such as supermarket groups are evaluating its use. It could, for example, be used for sending shoppers highly personalised coupons, straight to their mobile phones while they are browsing in the store.Hana was seen as very experimental last year, but now analysts like Mirko Maier, at Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, have been steadily raising their estimates for sales from the business, to €150m ($206m) for this year.“By 2013 Hana could account for 10 per cent of licence revenues, and even that could be conservative. It could be a meaningful revenue stream,” said Mr Maier.Other initiatives are going more slowly, however. Business by Design, SAP’s cloud computing offering, was launched late and is growing slowly. SAP aims to have 1,000 customers for the unit by the end of the year, but is currently up to just 650.Overall, investors seems satisfied with a recent run of positive results, and the share price has moved up nearly 17 per cent over the past year. But with European markets facing crisis, it is unclear if the transformation is enough.“The question is how much do these incremental businesses drive growth?,” Mr MacMillan said. “Fifty or 60 per cent of the company is still the core business which will slow in a downturn.”
346;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-11-13T16:22:52Z;Results loom as SAP tries to cut Oracle liability;;SAP, the business software maker, returned to court this month to try to reduce the $1.3bn in damages awarded last year to arch-rival Oracle over copyright infringement by a former SAP subsidiary, writes Chris Bryant.SAP hopes to cut its liability by at least two-thirds, but a ruling is unlikely before it reports second-quarter results.The company disappointed investors in April when its first-quarter profits fell short of expectations.Consensus opinion, however, suggests software licence sales may have picked up over the past three months.After businesses cut spending during the recession, analysts viewed SAP as a possible beneficiary from continued pent-up demand for information technology products.Solid recent results from Oracle and Accenture, the consulting company, suggest SAP may have enjoyed a better quarter this time round.A profit warning this month from Software AG, a business process software company, however, provides continued grounds for caution, although analysts consider the two companies to have very different product portfolios.
347;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
348;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-11-11T21:42:50Z;AT&T finds fix for overworked databases;;"Bryon Rickey has the distinction of running what he claims is the world’s largest supply chain using Oracle’s E-Business Suite. “It’s the biggest and baddest, we’ve got big iron,” says the director of production operations for AT&T proudly.“We handle pretty much all AT&T’s supply chain activities; wireline, mobility and all the accessories – all the phones and all the stuff that goes through our thousands of stores throughout the country. Without it we can’t sell, which is not a good thing, ” says Mr Rickey.Like most US-based mobile network operators, AT&T’s mobile business has grown over the last decade in part through a series of mergers and acquisitions culminating in the $41bn purchase of AT&T Wireless by Cingular in 2004.“Everybody had their own Oracle supply chain platform and databases which got bigger when they were consolidated,” says Mr Rickey. While AT&T’s supply chain system generates what Mr Rickey calls “gargantuan” volumes of data, the company’s expanding mobile business has also grown rapidly in recent years pushing the capacity of the company’s ‘Mercury’ customer analysis database to its limits.Such growth led to two challenges, explains Mr Rickey. First, as a database grows, it consumes more storage and becomes less and less efficient. In AT&T’s case this began to affect the efficiency of the more than 8,000 employees who access the database – including retail store employees, purchasing agents and financial reporting analysts – as well as impacting customer service.To give an idea of the scale involved, the Mercury database handles 2.5bn reads a day and had become so large that it exhausted the available supply of inventory table sequence numbers – 4.2bn. “We had to reset back to zero,” says Mr Rickey, “and we’re going to exhaust that in Q3 of next year. That’s how big we are and only one other client has actually hit that limitation. So when I say big, I mean we’re really big.”The second problem facing Mr Rickey and his team was that when the database became larger than 16 Terabytes, the time required to back-up the data were longer than the available overnight window. “The database got so big that our backups would literally take days,” he says.“We had to find a way to cap that growth, to control it,” said Mr Rickey. To start with the IT team instituted database purging – removing data that was no longer required on a regular basis. But as Mr Rickey explains, “you can’t purge everything just to free up the space.”Rather he says a company needs to establish and follow policies that decide which data must be kept long term, and what can be safely deleted. “You’ve got to be smart about it,” he says but adds “I know of a lot of companies that aren’t; they don’t even have policies in place”.So then the team began to look at archiving some of the data. “There are a lot of things you don’t need in the transactional database, and they can be kicked over into history,” he explains. After comparing competing archiving tools, AT&T chose Informatica’s data archiving software, mostly because “Informatica has the best integration with Oracle EBS, hands down,” says Mr Rickey who adds, “we’re able to get into the code. It’s not black box. It’s a database driven type architecture“.Using Informatica’s Data Archiving software, AT&T has been able to contain the size of its Mercury database under 16Tb, maintain acceptable service levels and preserve the overnight back-up window.Inactive data (such as data that is several years old) is compressed and kept in a separate 10.8Tb database for historical reference. “The problem with basic compression is that when you write to it, you get a performance hit,” explains Mr Rickey. “That’s why you don’t do compression on a live transactional database, but it is perfect for a history database where the only thing you are doing is reading (data)”.He says that by using Informatica Data Archive during the past five years, despite constant data growth, AT&T has been able to contain server and storage costs. What is more, the simpler database organisation that results from the archiving and removal of old data has yielded a database that is easier to tune and that performs better.IDC, the market research firm, estimates AT&T annual cost savings at over $670,000 per year and that the archiving software delivered a return on investment of 276 per cent with payback in less than six months.For example, up to 300 auditors regularly use the system. The time required to run auditor reports impacts the efficiency of their work. This time has been trimmed from 6.5 hours to 3.5 hours resulting in higher efficiency and user satisfaction. Annual cost savings on auditors is over $475k.In addition Mr Rickey says his IT staff are also more efficient. “Before Informatica, it would take about three or four days to back up the entire system. In terms of labour time, I’d say that we are saving about 40 hours per month”.Mr Rickey has some advice for other companies considering archiving as a way to improve performance or speed up backups. “I would say just the fact that you’re thinking about it, you’re on the right track,” he says. “But the main thing I would say to folks is, one, you need to know your environment. This is not going to be something you’re going to do overnight because when it comes to archiving, the bottom line is this: You need to be able to understand the retention policies for data – that’s the first and foremost”.In fact he suggests companies should establish two types of retention policies. The first related to how long you want to keep that data in the transactional database and a second dictated by corporate retention policies and legal liability. “When it comes to archiving, you have got to have somebody that’s going to be passionate about it and who is going to run the program and drive it because it’s one of those things that you have to have a holistic picture to make it forward,” he says.“To be successful, you can’t do this stuff half-baked. You have got to really understand what archiving is truly about,” he says."
349;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-11-08T22:31:49Z;Sustainability: Market increases focus on good corporate citizenship;Jessica Twentyman notes regulation is not the only force driving initiatives. Investors and customers want more information;In early October, members of the European Parliament’s environment committee voted overwhelmingly in favour of changes to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which would impose on member states a requirement to collect 85 per cent of the e-waste they generate from 2016.It is a hugely ambitious target and not everyone agrees it is realistic.Either way, the proposal faces a bumpy ride, as the European Parliament, the Commission and the EU Council of Ministers slug it out over what the actual target should be when the revised directive comes into force.Thomas Knopp, environmental project manager at Panasonic Europe, an arm of the electronics group, will be watching those skirmishes with interest.Once a month, he makes the journey from his Hamburg workplace to Brussels, where he is a lobbyist on e-waste recycling issues as part of DigitalEurope, a trade association for large technology manufacturers.However, the bulk of his time is spent ensuring that Panasonic is able to meet its obligations under the current WEEE directive, across 18 European countries, each of which implements and enforces WEEE in its own way. He is also charged with ensuring compliance with EU regulations on packaging and battery recycling.That is no easy task, but Mr Knopp is able to ensure that Panasonic Europe meets targets by using recycling software as an add-on to its enterprise resource planning suite.The software provides Mr Knopp with a repository of information, collected across Panasonic’s European operations, from which he can monitor progress.He and his team can classify and track recyclable materials by type, weight, usage, destination, brand and product category and manage recycling costs across a large number of contractors.“It’s a hugely complicated picture, but I absolutely need to have a complete view to ensure compliance and good governance,” he says.When Panasonic started using the software – SAP’s Recycling Administration package – in 2003, the market for sustainability applications was a good deal less crowded.However, as improving the sustainability of business processes has moved up corporate agendas, a crowd of software vendors has rushed in.At Forrester Research, an IT market analyst company, Christopher Mines has identified more than 70 vendors specialising in energy and carbon management (E&CM) software alone.Other suppliers focus on making product development, supply chain and facilities management more sustainable.Some of these providers are big software vendors, such as SAP and Oracle. Others are smaller specialists – CSRware, Cloud Apps, Enablon and FirstCarbon Solutions, for example.Increased regulation certainly plays its part in convincing technology decision-makers to invest in these products, says Mr Mines. In Europe, EU proposals to incorporate sustainability into financial reporting requirements could boost demand further.But there are other factors, not least the demands of investors and customers for companies to be more open about their sustainability goals and achievements, he says.That’s a view shared by Dan Vogel, chief executive of Enablon. “Non-financial information about a company’s performance has become far more important to overall corporate value in recent years. Sustainability metrics – whether they relate to energy use, waste management or health and safety – are central to that value,” he says.But at many companies, he adds, managers are still forced to collect relevant data on an ad hoc basis and manage it in Excel spreadsheets.That is how James Rushen, group head of environment at Centrica, a utility company, was handling data on energy use, carbon emissions and waste and water management until two years ago. He now uses software from Enablon to streamline data collection and management across Centrica’s international operations.Regulation was not a big driver behind the decision to go ahead with this investment, he says.His main goal was to make easier voluntary reporting on sustainability – to the Carbon Disclosure Project, the FTSE4Good Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.But with the introduction of the UK government’s CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (formerly the carbon reduction commitment) last year, Mr Rushen has found he has in place a source of verified information that makes compliance a good deal easier.“The data are the same, whether you’re reporting to stakeholders or reporting to regulators,” he says.“For a large, global company such as ours, with publicly stated corporate social responsibility ambitions, having that data in one place and having confidence that it is accurate is a big part of being a good corporate citizen.”
350;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-11-08T14:48:34Z;Overview: How to make ready for regulation;Financial groups will have to devote large parts of their technology budgets to complying with much stricter rules;"In an increasingly regulated world, IT plays a crucial role in storing data, organising them and ensuring compliance. In the banking and financial services industry, this role is particularly significant.The global economic crisis created a wave of legislation designed to mitigate risk and protect the financial system from shocks. This in turn has transformed the relationship between regulators and regulated.“Regulators used to come visiting, now they live with our clients and have access to all their systems,” says Chip Tsantes, practice leader for Ernst & Young’s information security services in financial services. “That means they see everything.”S Ramakrishnan, manager of financial services analytical applications at Oracle, the software maker, agrees. “Financial services organisations today are facing a wave of regulation, whether from Basel III globally or from Dodd-Frank in the US.”“The new regulations are going to require them to change the way they look at and assess risk, to say nothing of the way in which they reserve and allocate capital. The challenge is that many of the details of the regulations are still being worked out, even as deadlines near.”Just last month, for example, US financial regulators issued proposals on “proprietary trading”.The so-called “Volcker rule”, seeks to prevent banks trading on their own account and also limits their ownership interest in hedge funds and private equity companies. The rule will be open for public comment until mid-January and is expected to come into effect by mid-July.Mr Ramakrishnan thinks an important early step businesses can take to prepare for regulatory change is to unify IT infrastructure for analytics, so it covers compliance and risk and performance management.Doing so can provide relevant information to the entire enterprise and deliver detailed insight when required.As the financial downturn demonstrated, the ability to connect developments and indicators in one part of the business with those in other parts can be crucial.The financial services industry will have to supply significantly more information to an expanded number of regulatory authorities, no doubt more frequently, Mr Ramakrishnan says.“While regulators continue with rule-making, banks have an invaluable window of opportunity to bolster their analytical environment.”But before they see any benefits, banks and other institutions are likely to have to devote a significant proportion of their IT budgets to compliance.Some studies suggest the additional direct implementation costs for the largest banks from Dodd-Frank and Basel III alone could be in excess of $100m an institution.From an IT standpoint, the cost impact is being felt in storing and managing extra data; system and process updating; and, particularly, the added frequency and rigour of IT audits.Some costs may be one-off. However the majority are likely to be ongoing.In addition many companies, particularly smaller ones, have extremely small compliance budgets.A November 2010 survey by Bankers Online, an industry information site, estimated 65 per cent of US financial companies have budgets of less than $50,000 a year and few compliance staff.Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association, recounts a recent conversation with a banker in Nebraska.“For the first time, [the Nebraska banker] said his bank now devotes more work hours to compliance than to lending. Specifically, he has 1.2 employees on compliance for every one focused on lending and bringing in business.”Mr Keating notes that under the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulators have already issued 4,870 pages of proposed or final rules affecting banks.“Managing this mountainous regulatory burden is a significant challenge for a bank of any size, but for the medium-sized bank – with 37 employees – it’s overwhelming.“The cost of regulatory compliance as a share of operating expenses is two and a half times greater for small banks than for large banks.”David Furlonger, a research fellow at Gartner says that bank chief information officers now need to establish a more wide-ranging approach to risk management and compliance. They also need to adjust compliance programmes to focus, above all, on improving institutional performance and to work more closely with chief risk officers and legal counsel.Banks must also get their IT houses in order. He says: “They need to evaluate the efficacy of existing compliance and risk systems in terms of complexity, flexibility and latency [lag time], improve reporting capabilities by standardising data and automating work flows, and seek to normalise data sets and implement tighter controls over procurement to reduce application proliferation.”Tough challenges indeed, but leading bank CIOs say they are up to them. While the regulatory changes in their industry are perhaps the fastest moving, they are not alone.Regulation plays a big role in most sectors, particularly in data protection and security, transparency and sustainability.For example, data privacy legislation can affect where and how companies store consumer information and what actions they must take if security is compromised.Healthcare providers are subject to increasingly tight privacy requirements. Food processors must abide by regulations designed to protect consumers, while aircraft and automakers must comply with numerous safety and – increasingly – efficiency requirements.Across the board, companies must comply with health and safety legislation, laws designed to protect the environment and a host of other requirements, particularly if they want to bid for state or local government projects.Most must also be able to produce data, such as customer information, test results or perhaps an email or instant messaging exchange quickly, if they receive a legal “e-discovery” request – the retrieval and review of electronic documents – from a government agency, lawyers or law enforcers.Drugmakers, in particular, must be able to demonstrate compliance with laws and industry standards.Kevin Barrett, chief information officer of Elan, a Boston pharmaceutical company says: “When the Food and Drug Administration [the US regulator] comes in during a clinical trial and asks: ‘How are you controlling your data, how are you controlling the process?’ – if you can take out the certificates and show them the scope of the certification, the discussion ends.”Neil de Crescenzo, manager of Oracle’s health sciences global business unit, says regulation and compliance are a way of life in the health sciences industry.“It governs the entire product life-cycle – from compound development to clinical trials and FDA approval; from raw ingredient procurement to packaging and tracking through the distribution channel; and more recently in documenting the amount of marketing dollars expended on individual healthcare providers in the US.”As in other sectors that face both market pressures and the rising cost of regulatory compliance, he says, “life sciences companies are increasingly turning to IT to help them manage, document, and streamline their regulatory compliance initiatives.”"
351;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-28T15:40:17Z;Analytics: Numbers game is hard to play;Measuring the right data is crucial, says Rod Newing;Annual environmental reporting, especially the Global Reporting Initiative, has been a main driver for electronic environmental systems. However, the real need is for day-to-day analytical systems designed to produce improved environmental performance from a seemingly unmanageable mass of data.Most organisations have data warehouse and business intelligence systems that can manage the underlying data. But they need costly customisation to take account of the specific needs of environmental modelling and analysis, such as conversions of meter readings into carbon dioxide equivalent.They also need to include external data, such as the carbon efficiency of different sources of energy and transportation or carbon footprints of other companies in the supply chain. For this reason, most organisations use specialist software or cloud computing.Carbon reporting was the original trigger for environmental software development, but energy reduction now provides the business case. Simon Mingay, research vice-president at Gartner, says the big business software suite vendors have been very slow to move into the area, with SAP moving fastest and Oracle and Microsoft being very cautious.A whole range of specialists has emerged, including CA ecoSoftware, CarbonSystems, CloudApps, Greenstone Carbon Management and Hara. They join long established environmental health and safety vendors, such as Enablon, Enviance, IHS and SAP, and corporate social responsibility vendors, such as credit360, CSRware, ifu Hamburg and P-E International.Lifecycle assessment vendors that calculate the carbon footprint of a product, such as IFU Hamburg, P-E International and SAP are also popular.“Most enterprises are prepared to spend between £50,000 and £180,000, which is not a lot of money,” says Mr Mingay. “They have yet to recognise the additional value of the analytics.”When selecting an environmental analytical solution, Ed Kiernan, director at Deloitte Analytics, advises clients to ensure that it has pre-built environmental reporting intelligence, links to their enterprise resource planning and business intelligence systems and can support different regional regulations.A big issue is choosing the right data to gather. Salesforce.com collects 1,300 types of data from 100 sites around the world. It uses the CloudApps service, one of several sustainability services on its Force.com cloud platform.“Much of the sustainability conversation measures the wrong thing with great precision,” warns Peter Coffee, Salesforce.com’s head of platform research. “Don’t try to do the wrong thing better, do the better thing, by picking metrics that don’t obscure the most important opportunities.”Jyoti Banerjee, a partner in Fronesys, a specialist sustainability advisory service, says: “Most companies have not yet gone through the process of determining which environmental metrics are material to them.“Without that, you could end up tracking metrics which are fashionable in the marketplace, but not relevant to your business.”James Farrar, vice-president for sustainability at SAP, points out that while the corporate jet may be an easy target, its overall environmental impact compared with other outputs is usually minimal.Another problem with environmental systems is getting the attention of management. “You get buy-in from people around the business if you make the value clear to them,” says Andy Wales, head of sustainable development at SABMiller. The company’s system uses internal benchmarking and external reporting to compare with its peers.Similarly, Salesforce.com uses CloudApps’ Sustainability Momentum (SuMo) app to report to managers. “It turns what would otherwise be an eye-glazing business process into something with a little bit of spice and competition,” says Mr Coffee. “It is proving to be tremendously effective.”Peter Grant, chief executive of CloudApps, says the idea is to make environmental performance im­provement easy and fun by engaging some of the natural impulses of humans to experiment, compare results and compete.DHL Supply Chain, a contract logistics specialist, has a system covering thousands of locations in 220 countries and territories. Laura Bolton, its sustainability director, says the most important thing is not to have environmental data as a separate system, but part of the core business system.“We have an efficiency target – not an absolute one – that managers can compare with relevant key performance indicators to understand whether a given number is good,” she says.The biggest difficulty, concludes Mr Coffee, is “getting a corporate culture of looking at the numbers and sharing them in a way that prompts action”.
352;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-26T18:52:09Z;Rometty’s rise suggests convergence for IBM;Incoming chief has to hone group’s approach to new tech markets;Technology companies aren’t, first and foremost, about the technology any more.That was the lesson from Steve Jobs’ remarkable career at Apple. And it is the unmistakable message from the rise of Ginni Rometty, who has just been anointed as the next chief executive of IBM.Certainly, companies such as IBM and Apple have had to stay on the leading edge of an increasingly challenging range of technologies. But the real objective has been to integrate hardware, software and services in a way that exploits the component pieces for a higher goal – whether that means, in Apple’s case, delighting consumers, or, for IBM, helping companies meet their business objectives.The most noteworthy thing about Ms Rometty is that, in her 30 years at Big Blue, she has never run one of the company’s big technology divisions. That does not just go for the hardware that once dominated IBM, and now accounts for only 17 per cent of its revenues and an even more minuscule 6 per cent of profits. It also includes software, which has become the main driver of IBM’s profit growth under long-time head Steve Mills, as well as technology-related activities such as outsourcing that make up two-thirds of IBM’s huge services division.Instead, Ms Rometty made her mark with the other third of services: the consulting, “business process outsourcing” (running entire functions for customers, not just the technology associated with them) and other business-related activities. These are designed to be both a foot in the door for IBM to sell more of its tech gear, as well as a lever to transform bits and bytes into something with higher value added.She has also thrived in sales, stitching the company’s various technologies together to come up with answers to business problems that will let IBM talk over the head of its customers’ IT departments and direct to chief executives.That the world’s biggest pure “enterprise” technology company – one that sells mainly to large businesses and governments – is ready to elevate an executive with this background says something about the state of IBM, as well as the direction in which the rest of the corporate tech sector has been heading.Most of IBM’s big rivals have been converging on the same place: a combination of more elements of what is known as the “stack” of hardware, software and services that comprises complex corporate IT systems.For software maker Oracle, that has meant getting into hardware with the acquisition of Sun Microsystems. Networking equipment maker Cisco has moved into the server market and Dell is pushing hard into IT services – as is Hewlett-Packard, which has set a software-and-services strategy that strongly echoes the one adopted by IBM under Lou Gerstner nearly two decades ago.HP’s tortuous succession of chief executive oustings, strategic rethinks and boardroom overhauls has become an object lesson in how hard it is to make these strategies work. If its first mistake was to take too long to learn the lessons from IBM, it tried more recently to move too fast, with a plan to jettison its PC division (something IBM did seven years ago) and mount an expensive software acquisition to remake itself in Big Blue’s image.It is ironic that, just as IBM takes the next step forward with a meticulously planned and seamless chief executive succession, Meg Whitman, who has just been bounced into the CEO chair at HP, has promised a rethink by the end of this month of what to do with HP’s PC business – and has hinted heavily that she is leaning towards retaining it after all.For Ms Rometty to succeed, meanwhile, she will have to carry through on the job that current CEO Sam Palmisano has been working at for a decade. Combining business services with technology through the acquisition of PwC’s consulting division – Mr Palmisano’s biggest single bet – was not a home run in the early years, and successfully integrating the operations remains one of Ms Rometty’s biggest main accomplishments.She now has to hone IBM’s approach to some of the most promising new tech markets. The challenge, above all will be to fight the deflationary force that has at times in the past decade threatened to put a cap on IBM’s revenue growth. When it comes to IT, big companies always demand more for less. That explains one of Ms Rometty’s biggest recent pushes: the creation of a “growth markets” unit, to put extra focus on the special requirements of selling in emerging countries. These markets accounted for 21 per cent of IBM’s sales in 2010, and are targeted to generate 30 per cent by 2015.The pieces are in place. The question now is whether Ms Rometty has the wherewithal to turn them into a coherent whole that is more than the sum of the parts.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Editorrichard.waters@ft.com
353;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-26T08:42:17Z;SAP considers buy-backs as revenues rise;;SAP, the world’s biggest maker of business software by sales, will consider buying back more of its own shares after software revenues grew at the fastest rate in a decade in the third quarter and helped boost cash flow.SAP pre-announced quarterly results earlier this month due to brisk software sales. It reiterated on Wednesday that its sales pipeline remained “very strong” as in spite of uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook companies with solid balance sheets are continuing to invest in IT.In light of its strong cash flow generation SAP said it would “further evaluate buying back shares in the future”.However, Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executive, played down the significance of the announcement, telling the Financial Times that “we are not going to spend all our cash on buying back stock”.SAP is investing heavily in fast-growing areas such as mobile and cloud computing in a bid to increase total revenues to €20bn by the midpoint of the decade, compared with €12.5bn last year.Optimism about its new product line-up has helped the shares gain about 12 per cent this year but the stock has drifted lower since a peak in April.The company has high hopes for its HANA “in-memory” technology that allows clients to quickly analyse huge quantities of data by pushing information closer to the processors that work on it.SAP believes it is up to two years ahead of its rivals in the technology although it still represents only a small fraction of SAP’s sales.Mr Snabe said SAP has “a chance” to beat its €100m sales target for HANA in 2011 after it achieved €61m in revenues in the first nine months of the year. “There is a first-mover advantage in our industry …[HANA] is going to be big,” he added.Oracle, SAP’s big rival, once dismissed the potential of in-memory but this month unveiled its own high-speed analytics offering. Oracle also sought to boost its presence in cloud computing this week by agreeing to acquire RightNow, a US company, for $1.5bn.Mr Snabe said SAP did not “believe in acquiring market share” and could reach its €20bn target without a big acquisition.SAP’s software revenues – a key metric of future performance as customers that buy software licences tend to enter lucrative, long-term service contracts – rose by 28 per cent to €841m in the three months to September 30, compared with a year ago.The company’s operating margin widened substantially during the quarter thanks to a €723m reduction in the provision set aside to cover damages arising from a copyright dispute with Oracle. Net income more than doubled from €501m to €1.25bn.SAP said it was maintaining its full-year sales outlook, however, “due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment”.The company said the decision did not demonstrate a lack of confidence and pointed instead to the tough comparison effect caused by last year’s strong fourth quarter. The shares rose by 2 per cent to €43.69.
354;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-25T00:19:31Z;Tech bubble 2.0, revisited;;It seems that August’s stock market mayhem has done little to deflate the latest internet bubble – at least, when it comes to private companies with strong growth prospects and some traction in their business models. The latest case in point: Workday.The software-as-a-service company founded by PeopleSoft veterans Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri has quietly but steadily been establishing itself as a prime contender to become one of the first broad-based “cloud” software plays.Its latest fundraising, announced on Monday, has put a valuation of $2bn on the business, according to one person familiar with the transaction – not far shy of the values accorded to public SaSS companies like Netsuite ($2.1bn) and SuccessFactors ($2.5bn).This comes a week after cloud back-up company Dropbox announced a fundraising that valued it at $4bn – the valuation it was reported to have been pursuing even before the August market disruption.Workday is on track to meet its target of at least doubling bookings this year from the $150m recorded in 2010, Bhusri said when I caught up with him earlier today.Though starting out in human resources management, Workday has always had its sights set on breaking out of the of single-product niche that often traps such companies: it has 50 customers so far for its financial accounting products, says Bhusri, with half of those using the full suite. Extending the scope of its services has long been part of its preparation for an IPO in 2012 – though with the latest $85m investment round (taking the total raised to $250m), Workday is buying itself insurance in case the public markets prove inhospitable and it is forced to survive without any more capital-raising, Bhusri adds.The breadth of Workday’s ambition has already marked it out as potentially the biggest SaSS threat to established applications software leaders like Oracle, says Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Nomura.Oracle’s own $1.5bn acquisition of RightNow shows it is becoming more aware of the threat from the SaSS players and is concerned about protecting its flanks, Mr Sherlund adds – though he also warns that the SaSS subscription business model and particular appeal to small and medium-sized customers make it hard for a company like Oracle, whose sales prowess has been built on large transactions with high up-front commissions, to master.Like last week’s Dropbox investment, the latest news form Workday is evidence that the investors who drove up private-market internet valuations in the first half of this year are still ready to bet big on some names.

Taleo Corporation, which sells human resources software to businesses, was up 7.9 per cent to $31.61. SuccessFactors, which markets business education courses, rose 9.3 per cent to $26.24.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.4 per cent to 2,699.44 at the close.The S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent to 1,254.20, its highest close since the start of August, and decisively above the 1,220 to 1,230 range where two previous rallies stalled in recent months.The Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 closed below 30 for only the second time since early August. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” had been above 30 for most of August and September.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 11,900.03.“EU debt negotiations didn’t go off the rails over the weekend, and it appears that some progress may have even been made toward an agreement,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The rally was broadly cyclical with material and industrial stocks in the S&P 500 up 2.3 and 1.7 per cent respectively. Both sectors were helped by a better than expected “flash” purchasing managers’ index survey in China.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for use in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.5 per cent to $23.79.

356;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Oracle / RightNow;The $1.5bn purchase has some eyebrow-raising elements but Oracle can afford it;The description of RightNow Technologies in its regulatory filings is a tour de force of faddish, incomprehensible business rhetoric. The company sells a “comprehensive customer experience solution for consumer-centric organisations to enable interactions across web, social and contact centre touch points”. Give bosses of technology companies a choice between reading page after page of this to figure out what RightNow does, and simply buying the company blind at a staggering valuation, and they will probably pick the latter.Whether or not Oracle’s $1.5bn purchase of RightNow was done under such duress, it has some eyebrow-raising elements. Oracle is a prolific but usually disciplined acquirer. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief, commented in June that small and mid-cap software companies were “wildly” overpriced. Yet he has paid 52 times 2012 earnings, and over five times sales, for RightNow.Has Oracle succumbed to the trend for all things “cloud”? RightNow’s software helps companies provide better customer support through their websites and call-centres. It is cloudy in that it is delivered over the internet, as a service, rather than by selling software licences. This distribution model is expanding fast. Average annual growth since 2005 at Salesforce.com, a larger pure-play on cloud software for businesses, has been 40 per cent.Before accusing Oracle of overpaying to grab growth or sex appeal, keep in mind the scale of the deal. Oracle generates $1.5bn in free cash flow every month and a half. It can take a periodic punt at deals such as this, hoping one of them will turn out to be a huge winner, without making a noticeable dent in its strategy or balance sheet. And Oracle’s sheer size means it can get a new product in front of more companies than anyone else. Expensive, yes, but not costly.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
357;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-24T17:44:18Z;Oracle to buy RightNow for $1.5bn;;Oracle has mounted one of its biggest acquisitions yet in the fast-growing field of cloud computing, a business that was once denounced by chief executive Larry Ellison as “complete gibberish” and merely the product of technology industry fashion.The US maker of database software on Monday announced an agreement to buy RightNow, a US company whose internet-delivered service is used by companies to manage customer services, for $43 a share in cash, or $1.5bn after taking RightNow’s net cash into account.The deal came on the same day that Workday, one of the best known among a group of private “cloud” software companies, announced it had raised $85m in a fundraising round that one person close to the company said had valued it at $2bn.Both companies are engaged in software-as-a-service, which involves providing a service to companies for a regular subscription rather than selling them software to run on their own computers.For Oracle’s outspoken chief executive, the RightNow deal represents the culmination of a rhetorical about-turn that has been under way in recent months. Mr Ellison denounced early talk of cloud computing as “idiotic” and claimed it was nothing more than the marketing hype that often accompanies new advances in corporate technology.“The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women’s fashion,” he said two years ago.Growing interest among companies in farming out parts of their computing needs to other companies rather than handle them all in-house, however, has led Mr Ellison to change tack and increasingly adopt the marketing language as well as the technologies of cloud computing, most recently with Oracle’s announcement last month of what it called its “public cloud” service.The purchase of RightNow will throw Oracle more directly into competition with Salesforce.com, the leader in selling salesforce and customer service software as a service and a company in which Mr Ellison himself was an early investor. It also puts more pressure on German software maker SAP to move more aggressively into cloud computing, according to Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Nomura.The high valuation accorded to Workday, meanwhile, marks the latest vindication of the course taken by Dave Duffield, an old rival of Mr Ellison, after Oracle bought his former software company, PeopleSoft, after a hostile battle in 2005. With Workday, Mr Duffield set out to reinvent the PeopleSoft applications software business as a cloud-delivered service.Oracle said its offer for RightNow, which represents a 19 per cent premium to the closing price at the end of last week, was expected to close late this year or early in 2012. The Bozeman, Montana-based company reported profits of $194,000, or 1 cent a share, in the second quarter on revenue of $58.4m.
358;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-18T08:03:10Z;Russian tech veteran launches US fund;;The investor behind some of Russia’s best-known internet success stories, including Yandex and Ozon, is launching a $100m venture-capital fund in the US.Leonid Boguslavsky, president and chief executive of Ru-Net, plans to invest in early-stage software, cloud computing and, in time, eCommerce and internet services, through a new office in New York.By expanding to the US, Mr Boguslavsky will be following in the footsteps of fellow Russian Yuri Milner, whose Digital Sky Technologies investment company has taken substantial stakes in several leading US internet groups, including Facebook, Zynga, Airbnb and Groupon.But unlike Mr Milner, who has often invested by buying shares from existing employees in later-stage funding rounds, Mr Boguslavsky plans to take a more traditional approach to venture capital, investing between $1m and $10m in each start-up.Ru-Net’s US arm, dubbed RTP Ventures, quietly opened its New York office last month under Kirill Sheynkman, a former tech investor at Greycroft Partners and co-founder of Plumtree Software, now part of Oracle.Among its first investments is Tinfoil Security, a “software as a service” provider which scans websites for common security vulnerabilities, imitating a malicious hacker.“Being new to the market, it’s good to start with early-stage investments,” Mr Boguslavsky said. He hopes to strike bigger deals once RTP has become established in the US tech community.The 20-year Russian technology veteran shrugs off fears of a glut of angel funds investing in US technology.“What I learnt starting investments at the internet bubble in 1999-2000 is that if you are doing good investments, time doesn’t matter and the situation of the market doesn’t matter, particularly if you are investing in real business models and at the early stage,” Mr Boguslavsky said.Mr Boguslavsky founded his first technology company in 1990 before selling it to PwC in 1997. He was among the first investors in Yandex, Russia’s leading search engine now valued at $7.8bn after floating on Nasdaq in May.Ru-Net now has about $700m in funds under management globally and has made investments in Asia and Europe before expanding towards Silicon Valley. Over time, half of the fund will be invested outside Russia, where it has focused on eCommerce and online entertainment companies, such as Ozon, which is similar to Amazon.com.The Russian internet market is one of the few where local operators have remained ahead of incoming US rivals, with Yandex still leading Google in searches, and discount site BigLion – another Ru-Net investment – inching ahead of Groupon.While some observers have accused Russian technology companies of being mere clones of American services, Mr Boguslavsky believes that he and his partners can still teach US start-ups a few tricks.For example, BigLion regained its lead from Groupon over the summer with two high-ticket deals for cars and apartments with discounts of 80 per cent or more, generating huge publicity. BigLion also launched a Yelp-style recommendation service and channels focused on electronics and apparel.“There are many such examples,” Mr Boguslavsky said. “You can pick up ideas and bring it to another market and vice versa.”
359;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-14T16:48:38Z;SAP confident of continuing IT investment;;SAP, the world’s largest business software maker by sales, said companies were continuing to invest in information technology in spite of the uncertain macroeconomic environment, allowing the German company to deliver third-quarter sales figures that beat market expectations.SAP’s software and software-related service revenues jumped 16 per cent to €2.7bn in the three months to September 30. The preliminary figures are based on international financial reporting standards and include currency changes.“The record quarter was driven by strong results across all regions,” Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executives said in a statement.“SAP’s pipeline remains very strong and companies continue to invest in IT, in particular in innovative software solutions,” the Frankfurt and New York-listed business, said.SAP’s total of €3.41bn in quarterly revenue represented an increase of 14 per cent on the same period a year earlier and beat a €3.32bn consensus estimate conducted by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, spurring its shares to a gain of more than two per cent on Friday.Operating profits more than doubled from €716m to €1.76bn, after the German business software group reduced by €723m a provision set aside to cover damages arising from a copyright dispute with rival Oracle.A US court last month overturned the original $1.3bn award against SAP concerning its former US subsidiary and said Oracle should receive no more than $272m or there should be a new trial.Since taking over last year, SAP’s co-chief executives have sought to shake off the company’s staid image, repair strained customer relations and increase investment in innovative areas such as mobile applications and cloud computing.SAP’s so-called “in-memory technology” that aims to push data closer to the processors that work on it has won praise from industry analysts but still represents only a small fraction of the company’s sales. The company is targeting €20bn in total revenues by the midpoint of the decade, compared with €12.5bn last year.“After a period of uncertainty, due to changes in management …SAP has embarked on a massive, ambitious and visionary effort to refresh its technology platform,” Gartner analysts wrote in a note to clients.“Although still rough around the edges and incomplete, SAP’s strategy is likely to shake up the application infrastructure market and put extraordinary competitive pressure on the megavendors, including IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.”In spite of a successful quarter, SAP said it was maintaining its full-year guidance due to the “ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment”.The company expects full-year software and service-related revenue to increase by between 10-14 per cent on last year’s €9.9bn at constant currencies and based on non-IFRS, but expects to reach the upper end of the range. SAP reports full results for the third quarter on October 26.
360;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-12T20:34:28Z;Devon faces US tax if it repatriates cash pile;;Devon Energy will have to pay US corporation tax on the $6.5bn cash it holds outside the US if it repatriates it, the energy company’s chief executive has said.It amassed the money last year when it withdrew from deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the oil and gas industry outside the US and Canada to concentrate on onshore oil and gas development in North America.Many US companies, including Microsoft, Google and Apple, have large offshore cash holdings that would be liable for tax if brought onshore, inspiring a campaign by businesses for tax reform that would encourage that money to flow back home. Under the US system, which taxes a company’s worldwide earnings regardless of where they are made, companies are allowed an exemption for profits not repatriated to the US.Devon sold assets in Brazil, Azerbaijan and the Gulf for more than $10bn, raising about $8bn after local taxes. Overseas proceeds brought home will face US corporation tax of up to 35 per cent, although a deduction is allowed for foreign taxes already paid.Devon is in a tight spot because it has tightened its strategy to focus exclusively on North America, so it has few attractive options for using it.John Richels, chief executive, said he was hoping for tax reform that would make it possible to bring the cash into the US without paying the full rate of tax on it. “We’re hoping the Obama administration sees the wisdom in bringing that money back to the US. There’s $1,500bn sitting offshore right now. It makes sense to get that back to stimulate the economy.”Senators Kay Hagan, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican, last week presented a bill that would create a temporary tax “holiday”, allowing earnings to be repatriated at a tax rate of just 8.75 per cent for a year.The move was welcomed by several business leaders, including executives at Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft, and Duke Energy, but still faces scepticism in Congress and the administration.
361;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-12T18:45:07Z;Hewlett-Packard: Plan A;The original plan to spin off the PC business gains merit;"Meg Whitman’s career at Hewlett-Packard will be a series of hard decisions. The first will be whether to spin off the personal computer business, which generates a quarter of HP’s revenues and a sixth of operating profit. Ms Whitman’s predecessor, Léo Apotheker, liked the idea; Ms Whitman has promised a “hard look” before deciding.The primary argument in favour of keeping the business is synergies with other HP businesses. The server business is the most obvious example. Servers are essentially just big PCs: both use processors, solid-state memory, hard disk drives, power supplies and so on. Keeping PCs means buying in greater bulk and paying less. And the synergies extend beyond the servers to other data-centre gear for networking and storage. Overall data-centre hardware accounts for a fifth of HP profits. And it is not just components that HP buys in bulk. Without PCs, the volume of business HP sends to its contract manufacturers will decline, reducing pricing leverage.There is, then, little doubt that HPs data-centre business will take a short-term margin hit from a PC spin off, but not a big one. Bernstein Research estimates that gross margins in the data-centre business would drop about a percentage point, to just over 28 per cent.Against this, there are three key considerations. What valuation does HP get once its slow-growing, low-margin PC business is removed? It is a safe bet that it gets a better multiple than the current five times this year’s earnings, but aspiring to, say, Oracle’s 12 times is unrealistic. Second, how much better can each business operate when separated from the other – that is, does focus matter? Finally: is HP for sale? Given its low valuation, speculation about a takeover bid has become a parlour game. Without PCs, HP becomes much easier to digest. Food for thought for Ms Whitman.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
362;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-11T17:06:17Z;Box.net raises $81m of new funding;;Box.net, a cloud-based document management company in Silicon Valley, has raised $81m of new funding in a deal that values the company at about $650m, according to two people familiar with the financing.The investment reflects growing confidence in cloud computing services, which allow people to store and access information through web-based software, rather than physical hard drives or network systems.Box designs software specifically for businesses, allowing employees to share and access information from whatever device they are using, from any location. The six-year-old company positions itself in direct challenge to veterans in business-focused computing, such as Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM.“Businesses of all sizes are moving their information and collaboration to the cloud,” said Aaron Levie, Box’s chief executive. “With this new capital, we’ll support their transition by continuing to aggressively out-innovate legacy players like Microsoft.”Box currently has 7m individuals and 100,000 businesses using its services, with adoption in 77 per cent of Fortune 500 companies, including Procter & Gamble and AAA.Investors in the current funding round included venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners, NEA, Andreessen Horowitz, and Draper Fisher Jurvetson Growth, as well as two strategic partners, salesforce.com and SAP Ventures.“The market potential for Box is massive,” said Byron Deeter, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “The company has already inspired 100,000 businesses to rethink the way they share and manage content, and they are just getting started.”Box plans to use the capital to integrate its content management services with the cloud-based collaboration tools of salesforce and SAP, to expand its international presence, and to continue building its US infrastructure, including opening a third data centre in 2012.The alliance with other cloud-based software companies strengthens Box’s position as it takes on wealthy companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM, which Mr Levie regularly criticises for misunderstanding recent evolutions in technology that have led to a more mobile, more collaborative “post-PC world”.“The way people interact with information and use the internet has changed in the past decade,” he said, citing Apple and Facebook’s consumer-oriented, aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-use products as the new paradigm for software. “Most companies in the enterprise space have been around for 20 or 30 years and haven’t been able to adapt as quickly as they need to.”Box’s fundraising comes on the heels of significant fundraising rounds by other start-ups, including Tumblr, which raised $85m for an $800m valuation last month, and Airbnb, which raised $112m, giving it a $1.3bn valuation, in July. There is ongoing speculation that Dropbox, which offers cloud-based storage of files, photos, and videos for consumers rather than businesses, is also looking to complete a massive fundraising round that could value the company at $4bn.The financings come at a time when venture capital firms are at a low point in raising their own funds. Dollar commitments to venture capital funds decreased 53 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 to $1.72bn, down from $3.5bn during the same quarter the year before, according to a new study of 52 firms by Thomson Reuters and the National Venture Capital Association. It was the lowest amount raised since the third quarter of 2003.
363;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-06T22:47:09Z;Bipartisan US push on overseas profits tax;;Efforts by US multinationals to secure a tax holiday on overseas profits were bolstered by a fresh bipartisan push in the Senate but the legislation’s ability to pass muster with the rest of Congress and the Obama administration remains in doubt.Kay Hagan, a Democratic senator from North Carolina, and John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona, locked arms on Thursday to present a bill that would temporarily tax earnings generated internationally at rate of 8.75 per cent.At the moment, US companies pay as much as 35 per cent in taxes on income generated from their foreign operations when it is brought back to the US. Supporters of the holiday argue that this encourages businesses to avoid repatriating cash that is needed to prop up the domestic economy.“A trillion dollars is locked out overseas,” Ms Hagan told the Financial Times. “This is truly an opportunity to inject that into this anaemic recovery,” she said.Five other senators – including one Democrat and four Republicans – immediately signed on to the plan.Although the new proposal in the Senate was greeted warmly by campaigners for the tax holiday in corporate America – including top executives at Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft, and Duke Energy – the path to enactment remains highly uncertain.In 2004, under President George W. Bush, the US pushed through a similar tax holiday, and the results were mixed, prompting some lawmakers and the Obama administration to be sceptical of the benefit of doing it again.The FT and ProPublica dissect the battle by banks and companies to preserve tax tactics that save them billions of dollars“There is no evidence that it created jobs and in fact most of the largest beneficiaries actually cut jobs in 2005-06, despite overall economy-wide job growth in those years,” said a US Treasury department spokeswoman on Thursday.There is also a possible “moral hazard” problem with a temporary holiday, in that it could encourage companies to park their profits overseas as they await the next year-long break.The bill proposed by Ms Hagan and Mr McCain tries to address some of the shortcomings of the 2004 plan, offering additional incentives for companies to create jobs, while imposing penalties on those that repatriate earnings but slash payrolls. If businesses add to their employee base, they can cut their taxes on foreign earnings to 5.25 per cent. If they shrink employment, their gross income for tax purposes is increased by $75,000 per job loss.But those changes may not be sufficient. Some senior Republicans in the House of Representatives back a repatriation holiday but, in the Senate, it faces significant obstacles. Democratic leaders there have said they would consider a temporary tax holiday but only in conjunction with other measures that Republicans may oppose, such as new infrastructure investment.The Obama administration has said it would consider changing the tax treatment of foreign earnings but only as part of a much broader corporate tax reform, which may be a long time coming.The Treasury has been working on its own plan for corporate tax reform – which could potentially include a switch to a territorial system that does not tax foreign earnings, with some restrictions – but that has not been released yet.
364;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;US economy: bullish Buffett;Equities, which the Oracle has been buying furiously, give false recession signals;They don’t call him the Oracle for nothing. Still, Warren Buffett’s pronouncement on Friday that a US recession is extremely unlikely has been met with some scepticism.At first it is not clear why. After all, forecasts of an economic contraction remain a non-consensus view. Of more than 70 professional forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg, not a single one expects negative growth for 2012. The lowest forecast was for real gross domestic product to expand by 1 per cent. The highest was a whopping 4.8 per cent and the average calls for 1.6 per cent. The lowest quarterly consensus forecast is for 0.9 per cent at the beginning of the year. An accepted recession requires two consecutive negative quarters. Then again, these are the same forecasters who were unanimous in missing a recession forecast in 2008 when it had already been under way for several months.Lending more credence to Mr Buffett’s view is that he has his finger on the pulse of the economy as few others do. With more than a 250,000 employees engaged in utilities, railroads, manufacturing, finance and home furnishings, Berkshire Hathaway’s operating data are far more timely than nearly any government report. Even the normally prescient Economic Cycle Research Institute, which last week confidently forecast a recession, does not have that kind of insight.The disagreement may be more technical than substantive. Last summer Mr Buffett said the US was still in a recession a year after official arbiters said it had ended. Now he says the country is just emerging from one, defining an expansion as the point when the previous level of GDP is regained. Equities, which Mr Buffett has been buying furiously after the recent drop, are notorious for giving false recession signals. Nearly as notorious as fund managers talking their own books.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
365;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-10-03T21:39:09Z;HP wins control of Autonomy;;Hewlett-Packard on Monday night declared that it had sealed its £6.7bn ($10.4bn) acquisition of Autonomy, bringing to a close a controversial and closely watched deal.HP said that 87.3 per cent of the UK software company’s shareholders had accepted its all-cash, £25.50-a-share offer, which represents a 79 per cent premium to the price before the bid emerged in August. The markets have assumed since Friday that the deal was all but done, with the shares trading at £25.45. A number of large UK institutions holding Autonomy shares tendered their acceptances late last week.Mike Lynch, chief executive of Autonomy, who is to take a leading role in HP’s software division, said the deal had opened a “fascinating new chapter” for his company as part of a bigger, global corporation.The ousting of Léo Apotheker, HP’s chief executive, in the middle of the bid process added some anxiety for Autonomy shareholders. Some investors felt Mr Apotheker had overpaid for the British software company, an impression furthered by comments last week from Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, a fierce rival of HP.Mr Ellison said Oracle had been offered the chance to buy Autonomy but had thought the company overpriced. The comments sparked a public row between Mr Ellison and Mr Lynch over whether meetings to “shop” the company had or had not taken place.However, under UK takeover rules it is virtually impossible to reverse a firm bid offer and, in spite of investor concerns over price, Meg Whitman, HP’s new chief executive and Ray Lane, executive chairman at HP, had both confirmed that they supported the strategy to buy Autonomy.They have, however, played down the significance of the deal in transforming HP into a company more focused on software.Ms Whitman has indicated that HP would review the decision, announced at the same time as the Autonomy deal, to spin off HP’s hardware division into a separate company.Mr Lynch is not contractually required to stay with HP but said last week that he was looking forward to working with both Ms Whitman and Mr Lane, who has a background in the software industry.HP shares, which have lost more than 45 per cent of their value during a turbulent year, closed 1.11 per cent lower at $22.20.
366;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-30T18:14:22Z;HP close to securing control of Autonomy;;Hewlett-Packard could win control of Autonomy this weekend or Monday, three people involved in the pending transaction have told the Financial Times.The world’s largest maker of computers by revenue said in regulatory filings this week that it had passed the last antitrust reviews and would make its offer to buy Autonomy shares unconditional on Monday, the formal end of an offer window.One person briefed on the progress of the deal said that the percentage of shares tendered by late on Friday in London was up substantially from the 42 per cent previously reported by HP and was very close to the 75 per cent required for the deal to go through. HP declined to comment, but one person close to the company said there were “strong signals” that it would close, although it would extend the offer if it needed to do so in order to reach the 75 per cent threshold.If the deal does close next week, it would end a saga that contributed to the ousting of HP chief executive Léo Apotheker. On Tuesday it said Mr Apotheker would receive $7.2m in severance pay and a bonus of $2.4m.Some shareholders had argued that Mr Apotheker had offered too much for the UK software house and felt he had gone back on previous statements that he planned no significant takeovers. HP’s offer values Autonomy at £25.50 a share, or £6.7bn ($10.6bn). The shares closed at £25.50 on Friday.Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, and a frequent critic of HP since Oracle bought rival hardware manufacturer Sun Microsystems, continued to harp on the price for Autonomy in a war of words between him and Mike Lynch, Autonomy’s chief.This week they accused each other of lying about whether Autonomy was “shopped” to Oracle before agreeing to the HP deal.Although Mr Lynch has borne the brunt of Mr Ellison’s assault, the Oracle chief’s real target is its increasingly bitter rival, HP, according to insiders at that company. Mr Ellison has previously lambasted the HP board for removing chief executive Mark Hurd last year . Mr Hurd is now president of Oracle.The dispute could also raise questions for Autonomy with the London Stock Exchange, which requires listed companies to inform shareholders about any serious takeover talks.At the source of the spat is a presentation given to Oracle management by Frank Quattrone, whose boutique Qatalyst acted as adviser both to Autonomy and to Motorola in its $12.5bn sale to Google, the year’s two biggest tech deals.“Autonomy was shopped to us,” Mr Ellison told analysts on an Oracle earnings call last week. “We looked at the price and thought it was absurdly high.”Mr Lynch denied this in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, saying: “If some bank happened to come with us on a list, that is nothing to do with us.”He went on to reprise his familiar critique of Oracle’s database products, which compete with Autonomy’s “unstructured data” management software.Oracle hit back at Mr Lynch by issuing a press release late on Wednesday night, accusing the Autonomy chief of telling “another whopper” by failing to mention his April meeting with Mr Hurd and Doug Kehring, Oracle’s head of M&A.“Either Mr Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying,” Oracle said. “After listening to Mr Lynch’s PowerPoint slide sales pitch to sell Autonomy to Oracle, Mr Kehring and Mr Hurd told Mr Lynch that with a current market value of $6bn, Autonomy was already extremely overpriced.”Mr Lynch immediately returned fire, insisting the meeting was nothing more than a “lively discussion about database technologies”.“Frank was not engaged by Autonomy and there was no process running. The company was not for sale,” Mr Lynch said.Oracle then took the unusual step of publishing the slides from Mr Quattrone’s presentation at Oracle.com/PleaseBuyAutonomy, which it said was made with Mr Lynch present.“After the sales pitch was over, Oracle refused to make an offer because Autonomy’s current market value of $6bn was way too high,” Oracle reiterated.This prompted Mr Quattrone to wade in with a new twist in the tale.“The slides Oracle posted publicly were sent by me to Mark Hurd in January, were prepared by Qatalyst and were for the purpose of our independently pitching Autonomy as an idea to Oracle,” Mr Quattrone said. “These slides were not used in our April meeting with Mark and Doug.”Reporting by Joseph Menn, Tim Bradshaw and Maija Palmer in London and Richard Waters in San Francisco

The two have since engaged in a loud and escalating argument, with each claiming the other is confused or fibbing, and citing various odd bits of evidence as proof.The stakes could not be lower: Autonomy has been sold to Hewlett-Packard and there’s no turning back. Such carrying-on should perhaps be cause for condemnation. But all the unnecessary venom can only be seen as funny. That is the universal response when the high and mighty decide to be childish and petty.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
368;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
369;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-29T19:17:42Z;Google: Android malfunction;Android devices may be a bigger threat to Google than the deal to pay Microsoft royalties;Are these the droids Google was looking for?Microsoft and Samsung announced on Wednesday that the former will receive royalties each time Samsung churns out a device using Google’s Android software. Microsoft claims that Android depends on its intellectual property, and has reached similar deals with HTC, Acer and others.The easy conclusion from the royalties agreements is that Android is no longer free and could become even more costly: Oracle and Apple’s lawyers are after Android too. So the door is ajar for rival operating systems such as Microsoft’s. But no one at Google could have thought that Android would never incur royalties. The two big issues for Android continue to be cost differential (rather than absolute cost) and whether it encourages user behaviour profitable for Google.What the ultimate royalty obligation for each Android device will be is a matter of speculation. But assume it comes to $15 – toward the high end of the mooted range. It will be difficult for Microsoft to significantly grow its Windows business, which had $19bn in sales last year, selling mobile software licences at prices in that range. The royalties hurt Google, but Android products will probably remain a low-cost option.The second issue looks more pressing. If Android continues to fragment (that is, if device makers roll out versions that look and operate differently, and deploy company-specific applications or content), Android users are less likely to use Google search or other Google services as their primary way of accessing the internet. If that happens, Google’s mobile advertising revenue declines. In this light, the Amazon Fire – an Android device with a highly customised user interface and browser and an app store carefully controlled by Amazon – looks like a bigger threat to Google than the Samsung agreement.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
370;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-29T01:11:50Z;Autonomy’s Mike Lynch gets the Oracle treatment;;You have to hand it to Oracle, it never misses a chance to humiliate its rivals in public.On Wednesday it was the turn of Mike Lynch, the founder of Autonomy. His provocation? To have publicly denied that he tried to “shop” his company to Oracle before eventually selling to Hewlett-Packard. (This has now turned into a “he said, she said” – see updates, below)Mr Lynch made his claim to the Wall Street Journal’s Digits blog, brushing off any contact with Oracle as nothing more than some informal initiative cooked up by a banker for Autonomy.Not so, according to Oracle, which went on to highlight a personal visit Mr Lynch paid to Oracle president Mark Hurd in April. The exact purpose of that meeting may be open to interpretation and Mr Lynch’s overt purpose at the time might not have been to sell his company. But it seems that he left enough evidence behind to give Oracle the chance of a PR coup. (Not according to Mr Lynch – see updates.)Why spoil the fun? Here’s the key part of Oracle’s statement:Either Mr. Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying. ‘Some bank’ did not just happen to come to Oracle with Autonomy ‘on a list’.” The truth is that Mr. Lynch came to Oracle, along with his investment banker, Frank Quattrone, and met with Oracle’s head of M&A, Douglas Kehring and Oracle President Mark Hurd at 11 am on April 1, 2011. After listening to Mr. Lynch’s PowerPoint slide sales pitch to sell Autonomy to Oracle, Mr. Kehring and Mr. Hurd told Mr. Lynch that with a current market value of $6 billion, Autonomy was already extremely over-priced. The Lynch shopping visit to Oracle is easy to verify. We still have his PowerPoint slides.Update: Mr Lynch responded through the press that he had indeed met Mr Hurd in April – but for a “lively discussion about database technologies”, not to try to sell his company. He added: “Frank was not engaged by Autonomy and there was no process running. The company was not for sale.”That brought another riposte from Oracle late on Wednesday, which promptly published the Autonomy slides online to support its claim that Mr Lynch had indeed been intent on selling his company.By Thursday, Mr Quattrone had been dragged into the row:The slides Oracle posted publicly were sent by me to Mark Hurd in January, were prepared by Qatalyst and were for the purpose of our independently pitching Autonomy as an idea to Oracle. These slides were not used in our April meeting with Mark and Doug.So was Mr Lynch’s visit to Oracle in April part of an informal courtship designed to prepare the ground for a possible sale? Probably. But it appears from this exchange that there was no formal process to “shop” the company.Now we’ve established that much, do you think think the mud-slinging will stop?
371;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-28T18:26:02Z;Boardroom dangers of Silicon Valley’s insularity;HP upheaval puts boardroom culture under the spotlight again, writes Richard Waters;"After the spectacular leadership bust-up at Yahoo, co-founder Jerry Yang and Carol Bartz, the just-dumped chief executive, probably don’t make for the closest of boardroom allies. Ms Bartz, you will recall, denounced her former colleagues on the Yahoo board as “doofuses” and attacked chairman Roy Bostock for a lack of class in firing her over the phone.Five miles east of Yahoo’s Silicon Valley HQ, though, Ms Bartz and Mr Yang still have to make nice. That’s the home base of another troubled tech titan, Cisco Systems, where both are on the board.Perhaps, as lead independent director at Cisco, the trash-talking Ms Bartz will one day get the chance to show the classy way to do these things: it would fall to her to deliver the bad news to chairman and chief executive John Chambers, should Cisco’s board ever decide he is the not the person to dig it out of its problems.This would seem to be a classic illustration of the perils that have long afflicted Silicon Valley boards. The geographic isolation and wilful insularity of the Valley’s tech industry have been both a strength and a weakness, fostering a highly tuned competitive culture as well as a certain blindness to the accepted rules of good corporate governance.The latest upheaval at Hewlett-Packard has put boardroom culture in the Valley under the spotlight once again.While it is easy in hindsight to spot the mistakes, though, there are no simple formulas for good governance in tech. Given the rapid shifts in technology markets, it is not apparent that a classic big-company board – one made up of outsiders versed in a range of disciplines unrelated to the core business of the company – would always do a better job.It is certainly the case that the tech world’s insularity, along with the overweening power of its founder-CEOs, has produced its problems.Boards whose members share a common worldview may not be well-adapted to the external forces faced by big concerns, particularly if they have grown so fast that they still carry many of the trappings of start-ups. And groups of directors who have never seen anything but huge success can also be blind to the external forces that eventually topple them.Exhibit A in this regard is the former Sun Microsystems, which wilfully refused to acknowledge that the world had changed after the tech bust a decade ago. Convinced that IT spending would snap back quickly, Sun clung to its high cost base and a technology strategy that worked well in the 1990s, but proved ill-suited to the cost-conscious, open-source world of the past decade.Sun eventually got the message and changed course. A boardroom overhaul was part of the response: by 2009, a majority of its 12 directors had been on the board for less than three years. But it was too late by then to make a difference: the company was sunk by the recession that followed the credit crisis and was swallowed by Oracle.Hewlett-Packard, of course, has become the master of futile boardroom overhauls. Beginning with an injection of new blood in the 1990s that led to the hiring of outsider Carly Fiorina as CEO, there have since been no fewer than five major reshuffles. Subsequent big changes came with the acquisition of Compaq Computer (which brought five new directors into the HP boardroom), the arrival of Mark Hurd after Ms Fiorina was forced out (four new directors) and the fallout from the boardroom spying scandal of 2006 (four more). This was capped by the spring-cleaning that took place after HP’s board drew more scorn for forcing out Mr Hurd in 2010, after it lost confidence in him in the wake of unsubstantiated sexual harassment claims: seven of its 13 directors have joined since last October.So what have HP’s shareholders got for all of this? A frequently faction-ridden, dysfunctional boardroom that has warred with itself and failed to supply consistent direction. With so many new faces and little personal credibility invested in earlier initiatives, it was easy for the board to back a sharp change of strategy this year, even in the midst of a fierce business downturn – something that proved too much for Wall Street to swallow and hastened the firing of another CEO, Léo Apotheker.Remaking a board on the fly in response to the rapid swings in fortune in the tech world clearly doesn’t work.This leaves two effective boardroom models: companies such as Intel, that enshrined traditional ideas of good corporate governance in strong boardroom cultures without waiting for a crisis; and those such as Apple, that have relied on a small, tight-knit group of directors to support strong-willed founder-CEOs.With Mr Jobs now gone, not the least of the issues before Apple will be whether this approach will continue to serve it well.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.com"
372;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-23T20:56:15Z;Wall Street extends losses on growth fears;;The S&P 500 suffered its second-worst week since the financial crisis, as investors’ fears for global growth increased.The Federal Open Market Committee’s warnings of “significant downside risks” to the US economy sent markets into a tailspin late on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling almost 3 per cent ahead of the close. It continued to slide on Thursday.The Fed’s much anticipated decision to launch “Operation Twist” to lengthen the maturity of its Treasury holdings in order to drive down long-term interest rates unnerved investors further. “I don’t know if I want to use the word desperate, but it feels like the Federal Reserve is out of bullets,” was the verdict of Scott O’Neil, president of equity research group MarketSmith.The S&P did rebound slightly Friday, up 0.6 per cent for the day. But the two previous days of heavy selling left the benchmark index down 6.5 per cent for the week at 1,136.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.4 per cent to 10,771.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 5.3 per cent for the week at 2,483.23.Some US bank stocks hit their lowest levels since the financial crisis.Commercial banks Bank of America and Citigroup touched lows not seen since 2009, after Moody’s downgraded their credit ratings, along with competitor Wells Fargo.Moody’s said the government would be less likely to rescue big banks once banking reforms were implemented.On Thursday afternoon, BofA shares hit $6 and Citigroup touched $23.19, although both prices were still more than double the lows recorded in March 2009. At Friday’s close, BofA was down 12.7 per cent for the week to $6.31, and Citi was down 13.8 per cent to $24.98.Investment bank Goldman Sachs also sunk to a post-March 2009 low. Its shares fell to $91.40 before recovering to $95.18, off 11.5 per cent for the week.Morgan Stanley, however, did break through 2009 levels. Its share price fell to $12.49 on Thursday afternoon, a level not seen since December 2008.Morgan’s market capitalisation has now almost halved in just eight weeks, as investors fret about the bank’s ability to fund itself.The bank has been at pains to emphasise its funding stability. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, told an investor conference earlier this month that it had increased the average maturity of its borrowings and reduced dependence on secured funding.“Post-crisis, we have moved to a model of much more stable funding,” Ms Porat said.On Friday, Morgan’s shares had staged a partial recovery, up 5.1 per cent on the day to $13.72, but still down 17.1 per cent for the week.Poor economic data from Germany and China and signs of reduced demand for raw materials pummelled materials and energy stocks.Alpha Natural Resources, the metallurgical coal miner, saw its market capitalisation drop by almost a third after warning of falling demand from Asia. Alpha lost 31.5 per cent for the week at $20.39.Cliffs Natural Resources, the international mining and metals group, fell 25.8 per cent for the week to $57.84. Mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global fell 20.1 per cent to $65.01.Despite a mini recovery for industrial stocks on Friday, the 10 biggest fallers in the S&P 500 for the week were all from the energy, materials or industrial sectors.Netflix fell 16.6 per cent for the week to $129.36, as investors assessed the impact on the brand after a decision to separate the physical DVD delivery and streaming businesses and raise the price of the joint service by 60 per cent.Hewlett-Packard fell 5.1 per cent to $22.32, after announcing Léo Apotheker would be replaced as chief executive by Meg Whitman.Goodrich was by far the best performer in the S&P 500, up 31.1 per cent per cent for the week to $121.75, after industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation said it would buy the aircraft manufacturer for $16.5bn, or $127.50 a share.UTC shareholders were less impressed with the decision that will increase the company’s debt to about 50 per cent of market capitalisation. UTC shares fell 8.7 per cent for the week to $68.92.Oracle fell 1.1 per cent for the week to $28.90 but significantly outperformed the market, after reporting better than expected earnings.The company’s software sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, grew more than 50 per cent compared with the same quarter last year, confounding fears that Europe’s debt crisis would hurt demand.
373;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-22T23:08:44Z;HP’s internal choice will fuel controversy;;The decision by Hewlett-Packard’s board to choose its new chief executive and chairman from among its own members is only likely to fuel the controversy that has dogged the company for years.Instead of announcing a new search and perhaps an interim chief executive late on Thursday, the board picked director Meg Whitman as chief executive and moved Ray Lane from non-executive chairman to full-time executive chairman.While many investors applauded the dismissal of Leo Apotheker as chief executive, they also showed concern about Ms Whitman’s lack of experience in running a computer company. Even more, they worried that the same board that had chosen the wrong leader last year could easily make another mistake in its haste to install new leadership.“To some people, it appears hasty and premature,” Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein Research – whose parent firm is a big stockholder – said in a conference call with the new leaders. “It appears investor confidence in the board is very low.”Mr Lane gave a vigorous defence, arguing that the board had gradually come to the conclusion that it needed to replace Mr Apotheker and that, from the search a year ago, it knew which candidates were available from within and outside the company.In an interview with the Financial Times, Ms Whitman said she wanted the job because she thought her skills – including leadership, execution and communications – fitted well with what HP needs now.“This company has been through a lot, it really has,” she said.For his part, Mr Lane said that taking an executive title was an honest recognition that he would be distant enough to fairly evaluate Ms Whitman, whom he had championed for the job and known for more than a decade, since the time he sold Oracle software to Ebay.“I’m going to help Meg, so I can’t be objective,” Mr Lane told the FT.Mr Lane could run the company himself, said Yale management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, adding that the pair could be extremely effective as a team with his added knowledge.On the conference call, Mr Lane stressed that a majority of the directors had been in place for less than a year. “This was not the HP board that was around for pretexting,” Mr Lane said, referring to the 2006 scandal in which the then chairwoman approved an invasive investigation of fellow directors suspected of speaking to the press. “This was not the board that fired Mark Hurd,” who dramatically increased HP’s size and proftability during his time as chief executive.Mr Lane, who joined HP last autumn at about the same time as Mr Apotheker, later interviewed the pre-existing directors and asked some to step down. He named five replacements in January, including Ms Whitman.Mr Lane said the present configuration, which includes more chief executives, will stand, though the board will pick a new, lead independent director now that Mr Lane is an executive.Governance experts were surprised by the moves, and some criticised both the choices of fresh directors to manage and the split executive role.“Directors are supposed to be monitors. You are not supposed to be managers, that’s concerning,” said Charles Elson of the University of Delaware. “If he is executive chairman and she is CEO, it sounds a lot like shared CEO. Co-CEOs rarely work”.But Mr Sonnenfeld cited some exceptions to the rule, including periods at Disney and Coca-Cola.“Sometimes you get the right one-two punch,” said Mr Sonnenfeld. He also said that the new HP board, members of which he knows well, was far more united than in the fractious days when it split over what to do with Mr Hurd.
374;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-21T21:04:08Z;US stocks fall after Fed announcement;;The S&P 500 plunged 30 points, or 2.5 per cent, in the last 30 minutes of trading, as investors reacted with alarm to the much anticipated monetary policy announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC said it would buy $400bn of long-dated Treasuries and sell the same amount of shorter-dated government bonds to drive down the long-term interest rate. It also said it would reinvest any early repayments from mortgage securities back into debt issued by mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae, to reduce household mortgage rates.“I don’t know if I want to use the word desperate, but it feels like the Federal Reserve is out of bullets,” said Scott O’Neill, portfolio manager of MarketSmith.The S&P closed down 2.9 per cent at 1,166.72, its lowest level in a week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.5 per cent to 11,124.84 and the Nasdaq was off 2 per cent at 2,538.19.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 4.9 per cent after Moody’s downgraded its credit ratings for Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, arguing the government would be less likely to rescue the big lenders if they face failure, following banking reforms.BofA shares fell 7.5 per cent to $6.38, Citigroup fell 5.2 per cent to $25.52 and Wells Fargo dropped 3.9 per cent to $23.71.Wall Street’s worries were compounded by concerns about falling demand from Asia for raw materials. A broad swath of material, industrials and transport stocks fell after Alpha Natural Resources warned it would ship less coal than expected this year due to falling demand.ANR dropped 17.2 per cent to $22.30, a two-year low, after it said it would ship between 102.5m and 109.5m tonnes of coal this year, down from a previous estimate of between 104m and 112m tonnes.Cliffs Natural Resources was down 12.8 per cent to $61.55 in sympathy. Joy Global, which manufactures coal mining equipment, fell 7.2 per cent to $72.29. Transport groups CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern, which transport coal to ports for export, both fell. CSX was down 8.1 per cent to $18.59, and Norfolk was down 8.3 per cent to $61.93.That pushed the Dow Transport Index, which analysts watch closely as a forward indicator of demand for goods and materials, down 3 per cent by lunch. But the index ended down 5.6 per cent for the day, after a further slump following the FOMC announcement.Software developers rallied strongly, however, as investors reacted to better than expected quarterly results posted by Oracle.Hardware sales declined, but software sales were up for the San Francisco-based company. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, software sales grew more than 50 per cent year-on-year, confounding fears that Europe’s debt crisis would hurt demand. Oracle also predicted revenues would grow 4 to 8 per cent in the current quarter. Its shares closed up 4 per cent to $29.49.“What we’re seeing is a relief rally,” said Richard Davis, software analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “People were scared out of their wits about what these results might be, given the weak macro data.”Adobe shares were up 1 per cent at $24.89, as it was caught up in the software relief rally despite posting quarterly earnings that were below expectations.Shantanu Narayen, chief executive, said the company could still deliver 10 per cent revenue growth for the year, based on a strong fourth quarter.But Steven Ashley at Baird pointed out “guidance assumes normal fourth-quarter economic activity, which might raise eyebrows with some investors”.A key differentiator among software companies may be the level of exposure to businesses, which have stronger balance sheets than consumers.With 55 per cent of Adobe revenues coming from creative professionals, Mr Ashley said this could be a problem. He expects Adobe to deliver 7 per cent growth in revenue from sales to creative professionals this fiscal year.Hewlett-Packard jumped 8.7 per cent to $23.98 on reports it may replace Léo Apotheker, chief executive.Microsoft shares were down 3.7 per cent to $26.35 after the company announced a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend late on Tuesday. Microsoft will increase quarterly dividends by 4 cents to 20 cents.At close to 3 per cent, Microsoft’s dividend is one of the highest among tech companies on the S&P 500, but the company is under pressure to compensate investors for a stagnant share price.Shares in Range Resources, an independent oil and gas explorer, were up 4.7 per cent to $67.96 on buy-out speculation.

The index climbed 2.7 per cent to 2,513.Nuclear power producers rose after it was reported Beijing may resume approvals for nuclear projects next year. Dongfang Electric jumped 7.1 per cent to Rmb23.05 while Shanghai Electric Group surged 8.5 per cent to Rmb6.13.SAIC Motor was another bright spot, rising 5.3 per cent to Rmb16.47 after the automaker announced plans to develop electric cars with partner General Motors.Hong Kong failed to capitalise on the stronger Chinese sentiment, however, and the Hang Seng index fell 1 per cent to 18,824.2, closing at its lowest level in two years.Esprit Holdings, the clothier that gets more than 80 per cent of its sales from Europe, sank another 9.3 per cent to HK$8.96 in Hong Kong. It has more than halved in value in the four trading sessions since announcing grim financial results last week.Belle International, the footwear retailer, fell 4.3 per cent to HK$13.02In Tokyo, Renesas Electronics climbed 5.4 per cent to Y512 after US technology consulting giant Oracle reported a 36 per cent jump in fiscal-year profit, dispelling concerns of a drop in technology spending.Toshiba rose 1.6 per cent to Y326 after announcing plans to raise dividends for the fiscal first half.The Nikkei 225 Average climbed 0.2 per cent to 8,741.16.In Sydney, retailers gained ground with David Jones climbing 2.2 per cent to A$2.76 after the upmarket department store operator stuck to its fiscal first-half outlook despite a drop in profit.Myer Holdings was up 1.9 per cent to A$2.11 and Harvey Norman jumped 3.5 per cent to A$2.05.

377;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle: time to abandon prejudice;The company continues to grow and it generates heaps of cash;Oracle hasn’t had a lot of respect in the stock market recently, and the results the company delivered on Tuesday are unlikely to radically change investors’ minds. But this is more to do with attitudes towards technology stocks than with Oracle.Over the past year, returns on Oracles’s shares (up 6 per cent) lag peers IBM (36 per cent) and Microsoft (11 per cent) and the Nasdaq (13 per cent). The stock now trades at an unassuming 12 times prospective earnings, despite having several characteristics that might merit a premium. Oracle sells mostly to large businesses, which have stronger balance sheets than consumers (which it skips altogether) and governments (about 15 per cent of sales, according to Citi estimates).More than half of revenues come from services and software updates that are sticky and high-margin. Its core database, server and applications businesses do not face the same sort of disruptive competition that, for example, threatens Microsoft’s operating system business as personal computers go mobile. Unlike many tech companies, Oracle is disciplined about using its ample free cash for acquisitions.The main worry is how much the soft economy will affect sales growth, especially for the new software licences that give rise to those service and update revenues. In the quarter just reported, new licence growth did slow sequentially on a constant-currency basis, but only from 12 per cent to 11 per cent. Guidance for the next quarter suggests that total sales growth will be flattish or down. But Oracle continues to grow, margins are expanding, and the company generates heaps of cash.

378;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-20T23:02:31Z;Oracle earnings point to IT resilience;;Sales of information technology to big companies and governments may have held up better than expected in the face of financial market volatility and fears of renewed economic weakness, to judge by the latest quarterly earnings from Oracle.The US software company, whose unusual August quarter-end makes it an early barometer of broader demand for IT, reported late on Tuesday that sales and earnings had not been dented by recent events. It also issued a forecast for the current quarter that was in line with Wall Street’s expectations.Announcing the results, Larry Ellison, chief executive, also counted Oracle out from making a rival bid for Autonomy, the UK software company that last month agreed to a $10.3bn acquisition by Hewlett-Packard – a price that Mr Ellison described as “shockingly high”.Relief that Oracle expected to maintain its current sales momentum, with revenues projected to grow 4-8 per cent in the current quarter, pushed its shares up more than 3 per cent in after-market trading, reversing a decline of more than 2 per cent earlier in the day.“We were strong in all the sectors you may be reading are struggling, both in Europe and the US,” said Safra Catz, co-president. Oracle did not see a slowdown in sales to government or banking customers on either side of the Atlantic, she added.Meanwhile, Mr Ellison mounted a strong defence of the hardware business that Oracle assumed with last year’s acquisition of Sun Microsystems. While the division registered a continued decline, with sales falling 11 per cent on the same quarter last year after adjusting for currency swings, to $1.03bn, the Oracle boss said the focus on higher-margin products was starting to pay off. “I don’t care if our commodity [server] revenues go to zero,” he said. “We don’t make money selling that stuff.”Oracle’s latest figures were underpinned by new software licence sales of nearly $1.5bn, a rise of 11 per cent after adjusting for currency swings. Overall, revenues rose 12 per cent to $8.37bn, though growth was only 5 per cent in constant currencies.On the pro-forma basis on which Wall Street judges the company, Oracle reported earnings per share of 48 cents, up from 42 cents the year before. Under formal accounting conventions, earnings per share rose to 36 cents from 27 cents.
379;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-20T16:05:14Z;America’s Cup: New, faster format promises TV-friendly thrills;;"The awkward years are over for the America’s Cup – at least if the sailing regattas associated with the world’s most venerable sporting trophy are judged for their ability to enthuse spectators, engage some of the world’s top athletes and tacticians, and extend the boundaries of marine technology.In terms of commercial success, the outlook is still clouded by the crisis of confidence in western economies and a consequent shortage of sponsors and well-funded entrants.But there was no doubting the excitement generated this summer in Cascais near Lisbon, the first venue for the preliminary competitions, by the sight of the powerful, new AC45 catamarans hurtling down the racecourses off the beach with their helmeted crews.For three years, the competition – so called after the victory of the schooner America over its British rivals off the Isle of Wight in 1851 – had been mired in arcane legal disputes between two billionaires, Larry Ellison of software group Oracle and Ernesto Bertarelli, a Swiss-Italian pharmaceuticals tycoon.That excluded other eager claimants from around the world, but Mr Ellison’s victory in a bizarre two-boat contest off Valencia last year has finally cleared the way for a new start.Gone are two-hour races almost out of sight of land, and elegant monohulls for which tiny design changes could produce infinitesimal increases in speed and ensure ultimate victory. Now, spectators and television viewers will be treated to tense 15-minute contests in overpowered racing machines liable to capsize or collide.It is a kind of Formula One of the sea, based on the successful Extreme 40 series of catamaran races that have been held everywhere from Venice and Cowes to Istanbul and Hong Kong.While the preliminary regattas are raced in identical 45-footers, the cup itself in San Francisco in 2013 will be contested in even larger boats, as will the Louis Vuitton Cup qualifying races that precede it to choose the final challenger to USA/Oracle. All have aerodynamically efficient mainsails in the form of solid wings with flaps, akin to vertical aircraft wings, rather than conventional sails.“The 72-ft cat will be spectacular,” says Torbjörn Törnqvist, the commodity trader who finances Artemis Racing, the Swedish challenger. “You’re going to race in San Francisco at 40 knots. You’re going to see fitter and leaner crews. You’re going to see action.“To manage these wings in 30 knots [of wind] is not a matter of having the fastest wing. The teams agree that it’s about reliability and skill. You’re going to have to build a boat that stays together, rather than one that’s so sophisticated that you are two-10ths of a knot faster.”Every twist and turn of the race, and every grunt, swear word and facial expression of the crews, can be recorded by cameras and microphones on helicopters and on the boats themselves to create gripping video footage online and on television.Bruno Troublé, long-time sailing consultant for the Louis Vuitton luxury goods company that has backed the event for nearly 30 years, says the new format of high-speed catamarans and short, video-friendly races is winning adherents, despite initial scepticism.It helps that the strong, lightweight boats can race in a broader range of wind conditions than the old monohulls, which often had to wait at the dock for the weather to change.“We were very supportive of this revolution from day one,” says Mr Troublé. “We believed we needed to modernise the event.”Even so, below the three top teams of Emirates Team New Zealand, Oracle and Artemis, some of the remaining five that have entered so far are struggling to attract sponsors and are still reliant on the race organisation set up by Mr Ellison.One strategy has been to try to limit running costs – for example, by reducing the number of sailing crew on each of the 45-ft boats to five (previous America’s Cup boats had 17) – although sailing experts reckon that anyone who wants to win the Cup from Mr Ellison is still going to have to spend as much as €100m ($136m).“We are lacking teams, the organisers are lacking sponsors and the teams are lacking sponsors,” says one executive from a commercial sponsor involved in the racing at Cascais. “It’s a difficult financial environment – F1 is struggling; a lot of sports are struggling.”If anything can bring in the money, it will be the sailing action, which has already been to Cascais and Plymouth, and continues at San Diego, Venice and Newport, Rhode Island.Yves Carcelle, Louis Vuitton chief executive, is hoping for a “snowball effect” of increasing television coverage and sponsorship arising from the early events. “I’ve been running Louis Vuitton for 22 years and there are always cycles and crises,” he says.“It’s got off to a good start. And if it’s started like this, you can be sure that in 2013 there will be a really impressive technical and professional level.”"
380;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-09-12T22:58:35Z;Manager’s $5m for Buffett lunches pays off;;"A hedge fund manager who paid more than $5m in charity auctions to have lunch with Warren Buffett has been hired to be part of the team that will oversee Berkshire Hathaway’s investments after the “Oracle of Omaha” leaves the company.Ted Weschler, manager of Peninsula Capital Advisors, a Virginia-based hedge fund with $2bn in assets under management, will join in 2012 to manage a $1bn-$3bn slice of Berkshire’s $66bn in equity securities, the company said on Monday.Mr Weschler is expected to serve alongside Todd Combs, formerly manager of hedge fund Castle Point Capital, who was appointed in 2010, as part of a new generation of managers who will oversee Berkshire’s equity and debt investments. Berkshire said it might add a third new manager.Berkshire will also have to find a replacement for Mr Buffett, who is 81, as chief executive of Berkshire itself. Thinking on that part of the succession was thrown into turmoil when David Sokol, a senior lieutenant, was found to have bought shares in a company he later recommended to Berkshire. Mr Sokol resigned, and Mr Buffett apologised to shareholders.In a statement on Monday, Berkshire said; “After Mr Buffett no longer serves as CEO, Todd and Ted – possibly aided by one additional manager – will have responsibility for the entire equity and debt portfolio of Berkshire, subject to overall direction by the then-CEO and board of directors.”Mr Weschler, who is not widely known in the fund management community, first came to Berkshire’s attention when he spent more than $5m in charity auctions to have lunch with the legendary investor, according to an interview with Mr Buffett in Fortune magazine.The unusual nature of their meeting raised questions about the level of involvement of Berkshire’s board in the process of choosing a replacement, said Alice Schroeder, author of The Snowball, a biography of Mr Buffett. “Only at Berkshire Hathaway can you get a job by paying $5m for an interview,” she said.Earlier in his career, Mr Weschler also attracted attention when Peninsula helped finance the merger of airlines US Airways and America West in 2005.Media groups are a focus for Mr Weschler’s fund. As of June 30, holdings included Liberty Media, Valassis Communications and Cogent Communications. The fund also owned $491m in shares of WR Grace, a chemicals and materials group where Mr Weschler worked in the 1980s.“You can observe from Mr Weschler’s portfolio that he’s focused on Berkshire-esque companies – stronger balance sheets, strong, visible future cash flows, and relatively inexpensive valuations,” said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. “It appears Mr Buffett is trying to continue the philosophy.”"

382;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Judge overturns $1.3bn award for Oracle;;A US judge has overturned a $1.3bn jury award won earlier this year by Oracle against rival software company SAP and laid the ground for a new trial in the copyright infringement case.Based on evidence presented at the trial, Oracle should have been entitled to collect damages of no more than $272m, according to the ruling by Judge Phyllis Hamilton in federal court in Oakland.The case stemmed from the unauthorised access gained by TomorrowNow, an SAP subsidiary in the US, to Oracle’s computer systems. The German software company admitted that its subsidiary had copied large amounts of software code it had not been entitled to, though it rejected Oracle’s large damages claim, leading to a trial earlier this year to assess the level of the payment.The jury in the case sided with Oracle executives, including Larry Ellison, chief executive, who testified that SAP should meet the costs of a “hypothetical licence” for accessing the software. The damages should equal what Oracle would have been able to collect from selling a commercial licence covering the same software, the US company argued.In a written judgment on Thursday, however, Judge Hamilton criticised Oracle’s executives for having given “self-serving testimony … regarding the price they claim they would have demanded in an admittedly fictional negotiation.”She also said the Oracle camp had “proffered the speculative opinion of its damages expert, which was based on little more than guesses about the parties’ expectations.”The rejection of the award was welcomed by SAP, which said it hoped the decision would quickly bring an “appropriate final resolution” of the case. The German company’s admission of wrongdoing by its subsidiary was a black eye for the company in the US.Oracle said it would continue to push for the “full level of damages”, which it said had been based on “voluminous evidence regarding the massive scope of the theft, clear involvement of SAP management in the misconduct and the tremendous value of the IP stolen.”Rather than trying to assess the value of a hypothetical licence that TomorrowNow would have needed to access the Oracle software, Judge Hamilton said the jury should have based its award on the actual harm to Oracle from lost customers, which was unlikely to have topped $272m.
383;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-31T18:00:55Z;Android patent war hurts Gemalto;;The disruption suffered by companies in the recent spate of technology patent wars became apparent last week when Gemalto, the French smartcard company, revealed a €13.5m shortfall in its patents revenue, following a dispute with makers of Android smartphones.The Paris-based company launched a suit against Google, Motorola, HTC and Samsung last October, alledging that they had used Gemalto’s smartcard technology in Android devices without a licence.While the patent dispute is being fought out in court, Gemalto has had to put its patent licencing operations on hold, meaning that the unit, which generated €11.6m in sales in the first half of last year, made a €2.2m loss this time.“We cannot sign new contracts while the lawsuit is going on. The technology must be licensed on an open and non-discriminatory basis. If Google is not paying for the licence then we cannot get anyone else to pay either, ” said Olivier Piou, chief executive.The shortfall is not a devastating one for Gemalto. Patent licensing only accounts for around 10 per cent of the smartcard company’s revenues, and sales were up 14 per cent at €928.5m in the first six months of the year, thanks to strong growth in other parts of the business. Profits were also up nearly 8 per cent.However, the experience is clearly frustrating for the company, which has a portfolio of around 5,000 patents.“We have been doing research and development for the last 20 years and the patent revenue is meant to be a reward for our shareholders for taking that risk,” said Mr Piou. “Then someone like Google comes in, who has not invested in that R&D and develops a system without paying.”Oracle has also sued Google for software used in Android systems. Microsoft has sued Motorola and Apple has sued HTC over their Android phones.Google’s recent $12.5bn purchase of Motorola’s mobility division was heavily motivated by the need to get ownership of some mobile-phone related patents so it can better protect itself from such attacks.So many different companies have developed components or software used in mobile phones, that handset makers commonly form patent pools or cross-licence technology to each other in order to get devices built without excessively high costs or fear of litigation. Companies effectively trade off patents against each other.But with no history of handset making, Google has no portfolio with which to trade. Hence it bid – but lost – for Nortel’s patent portfolio earlier this year, and then bought the Motorola business.In the meantime, Google’s Android development has potentially trampled on the toes of a number of patent holders, who, as they have seen the growing sales of Android handsets around the world, have become more determined to try to assert their rights.If Gemalto were to win the dispute with Google, the settlement would likely be large enough to make it worth suffering a few quarters of shortfall.“We are talking about millions of devices,” Mr Piou said. “The settlement could be very large.”

385;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
386;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-30T17:56:53Z;Oracle hits back at HP in legal dispute;;Oracle has filed a sharp legal riposte against Hewlett-Packard in a dispute over a longstanding technology partnership, marking the latest deterioration in relations between the US technology companies.A series of flashpoints and repeated public mud-slinging between the giant tech suppliers over the past 18 months has turned what was once a close business alliance into one of the most fractious relationships in Silicon Valley.The disintegration of the former alliance between the two has also threatened to leave big companies and governments in the lurch by raising doubts about the future of an important technology platform, according to HP and to representatives of users who run systems based on the technology.The latest outbreak of enmity concerns the future of IT systems based on Itanium chips, processors made by Intel for computers that carry out the most demanding tasks for big corporate and government customers. HP first introduced systems based on Itanium a decade ago and remains the biggest supporter of the technology.In March, Oracle said it would stop developing future versions of its software to run on Itanium, a move likely to weaken the attractiveness of the technology to customers. HP shot back, accusing Oracle of backing out of a partnership between the two companies and in June filed a lawsuit alleging breach of contract.On Tuesday, Oracle struck out at HP with a series of claims including fraud and defamation and accusing it of “incessant Oracle-bashing”.In its counter-suit, Oracle described the Itanium partnership as an informal one and said it had “always retained complete discretion to support whichever HP technologies it chose”.Relations between the two companies began to deteriorate early in 2010 after Oracle bought Sun Microsystems, making it a direct competitor to HP in server hardware.Things turned worse a year ago after Oracle hired Mark Hurd, who had been ousted as head of HP over sexual harassment allegations, as a co-president, prompting a lawsuit from his former employer.In settling the dispute over Mr Hurd, Oracle and HP also agreed to extend their previous business partnerships – an agreement that HP has now called on to back its argument that Oracle should continue to support Itanium.Disputing the strength of that agreement, Oracle also accused HP of fraud for promising a continuing partnership when it was about to bring in Ray Lane and Leo Apotheker as, respectively, its new chairman and chief executive – executives “who HP knew Oracle distrusted so completely – justifiably – that ‘partnership’ would be impossible.”
387;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Sovereign spreads challenging cherished notions;Seventy large US companies now considered better credit bet than state;"A few years ago, I pointed out in a column that the cost of insuring the US government against a default in the credit derivatives market, had risen above that of McDonalds, the US fast food company, for the first time.Back then, in 2008, it seemed a shocking development. After all, Western finance has traditionally assumed that governments were the safest entities in the markets; indeed the yield on US Treasuries was considered the “risk free” benchmark. Thus paying more to insure loans to Uncle Sam than those to Ronald McDonald (or any other company) seemed distinctly bizarre.No longer. At the end of last week, trading in the credit derivatives markets implied that no less than 70 large US companies are now considered a better credit bet than the American government, according to Markit data. More specifically, the cost of insuring US government bonds against default for five years is currently trading around 50 basis points (meaning it costs $50,000 a year to insure against default for $10m of bonds), while the cost is less than 30bp for companies such as AT&T, New Cingular Wireless and Oracle. The spread for Google, HP, Coca Cola – and, yes, McDonald’s – is also well below the sovereign spread.And this is not just an American pattern: the credit default swap spreads for Telefonica and Iberdrola in Spain, for example, are also now well below that of their government. The idea that large companies are safer than governments, in other words, is no longer such a bizarre aberration in the derivatives world; on the contrary, it is almost accepted.Now some people might argue that this simply shows the danger of relying on CDS as a credit guide. After all, the market for many CDS contracts is thin. Thus prices can be erratic. Indeed, Creditsights, an industry newsletter, reckons that at present only eight US CDS contracts currently have net notional values in the market of more than $5bn, and just 27 more than $2bn.However, the CDS world is not the only place where the relative safety of companies and governments is changing. When Standard & Poor’s, the US rating agency, removed the AAA rating from US sovereign debt two weeks ago, for example, it left the AAA rating for four US companies unchanged. Thus Automatic Data Processing, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft are now rated higher than their own government – a pattern that used to be largely seen just in emerging markets.And if you dig into the reasons why those CDS rankings have changed – or why S&P left those four American companies rated above the government – it reveals some fascinating longer-term structural shifts. One way to read this trend is that it presents a verdict on relative levels of corporate governance, and transparency. More specifically, the reason why so many large companies command tight CDS spreads is that investors feel confident that they understand their balance sheets, and that these entities have plenty of cash on hand, and tangible, easily tracked revenues.Sadly, however, many public entities currently lack that sense of transparency; on the contrary, it is painfully hard to disentangle where the liabilities and tangible assets lie. Hence the high(ish) level of CDS spreads for US Treasuries: although investors know that America is highly unlikely to default on its bonds, the political climate is so volatile that it is hard to predict cash flows. However, a second factor is the issue of globalisation. Most of America’s best-run and healthiest companies these days are not really “American” anymore; on the contrary, they draw a growing proportion of their revenues from outside America’s shores, and hold vast pots of cash overseas.That gives them the ability to hedge themselves against an American, or Western, economic downturn; or, to put it another way, they can flee, with their cash if economic or political circumstances turn sour. So can many “European” companies; just look, for example, at the global nature of “Greek” shipping lines, or those “Irish” information technology groups. However, that option is not open to public sector entities; for better or worse, their credit risk is tethered to the West.Now, this swing may yet turn out to be temporary. And it should be noted it has not really affected actual funding costs yet: irrespective of CDS prices, the US government is still able to borrow money in the bond markets more cheaply than large American companies, including the 70 which now have tighter spreads. But, if nothing else, that 70-strong list shows again the degree to which the fall-out from the financial crisis is challenging some cherished 20th century ideas in finance. Investors should take note. Not to mention Western politicians.The writer is the FT’s US managing editorgillian.tett@ft.com"
388;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-24T20:11:35Z;Admiral suffers rear-end shunt in UK underwriting;;Abrupt deceleration is the usual cause of whiplash, a common injury in car accidents. FTSE 100 motor insurer Admiral Group suffered the stock market equivalent on Wednesday. Compensation claims held back its UK underwriting profits and triggered a 12 per cent retreat in the shares. Ironic that growth in “ancillaries” – including the controversial referral fees that personal injury lawyers channel to insurers for sales leads – were singled out for praise by analysts.That suggested Admiral is more exposed to prosaic difficulties in its core business than a supercharged prior performance had suggested. The wider question is whether the government should rein in an injury claims industry whose main professional beneficiaries are lawyers and claims farmers.Admiral said the best method would be to cap legal charges. It thereby broke step with the Association of British Insurers. The body wants a ban on referral fees, a stance endorsed by Axa, owner of Iggy Pop’s favourite insurer Swiftcover (winner of the Lombard Award for the Most Disturbing Use of a Rock Star in Advertising, Ever).The negative consequences that Admiral believes could flow from a ban appear modest. Lawyers might indeed advertise more. But resulting sales leads would be expensive. Yes, insurers could set up their own claims handling offshoots. But that would be an odd diversification.Desirably, a ban would stem growth in injury claims. A proportion are surely fraudulent, as reflected in the slang name “Florida Neck” for whiplash. Admiral – an excellent company whose first-half group profits rose 27 per cent – could then expect to recoup lost referral fees via lower compensation pay-outs. The reputation of all insurers would benefit from severing its over-cosy ties with the claims industry.Needy partnerSpeculation that a rival to Hewlett-Packard could counterbid for Autonomy, the Cambridge software company, seems, well, just a little greedy. What more could shareholders want, having been offered an 80 per cent premium for their shares? Their own weight in gold and jewels, like Mughal princelings?The list of names available to rumour mongers is necessarily limited. The ability to pay more than £6.7bn ($11bn), 23 times forecast earnings is the entry requirement. Oracle, which might wish to pep up its database offering, and reputedly has a $24bn war chest, would, one assumes, have bid by now, were it inclined to. Microsoft, which is also cash rich, could fancy deploying Autonomy’s technology within Bing, its surfer-ambushing search engine. But that idea is also discounted by an Autonomy share price 2 per cent below HP’s offer.What emerges from the slew of investor meetings and press interviews undertaken by Léo Apotheker is just how much he wants Autonomy. The HP boss expects the unit to contribute a shade less than 10 per cent of revenues by 2015, largely, one surmises, via software sales that would often piggyback on HP’s server business. Autonomy is HP’s route escape out of the low-margin PC business and into the wide, woolly yonder of cloud computing. Without the deal Mr Apotheker, could, to paraphrase a cliché, be stuck on a burning platform with nowhere to jump. In that context, HP’s hefty offer for Autonomy looks less like overpayment than the shock and awe required to forestall counter bids.Running gnus storyThis column has unkindly characterised Charter as the corporate equivalent of a gnu, victim species of the African savannah. But in the event, the manufacturer of power and welding kit is giving would-be predator Melrose a run for its money. The turnround specialist is now far less sure of a kill than it was when the pursuit began in late June.The going has been tough for Melrose, which asked for an extension to its bid deadline on Wednesday, because shares are the main currency for its £1.4bn bid. These have dropped 20 per cent since their euphoric peak in early July, albeit following a return of cash and a share consolidation. Every market panic increases the dilution that Melrose shareholders would suffer in return for buying Charter at 840p per share.Charter’s dust trail has meanwhile attracted a rival, unnamed bidder (an imminent rule change would outlaw such incognito approaches). If a rumoured 870p all-cash bid materialises, the board led by combative chairman Lars Emilson would surely recommend it.

389;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-21T18:03:53Z;HP directors defend shift in strategy;;Hewlett Packard bosses have come out fighting in defence of their sharp change in the tech group’s strategy last week, which saw a share price collapse and growing shareholder alarm.Léo Apotheker, chief executive, will meet shareholders in New York, Boston and London to argue that the company’s bet on business software and its planned exit from personal computers are needed to keep pace with convulsive change in the technology industry.Mr Apotheker said in an exclusive interview on Sunday: “We are at a pivotal part of our history”.He predicted that HP would regain the $40bn in revenue lost in an anticipated spinoff of the world’s best-selling PC line, while “my assumption is that in the long term we will have better margin profile and a better growth profile”.HP shares have shed 25 per cent of their value since word spread on Thursday that the company would pay $11bn, or more than 10 times sales, for Autonomy, the UK’s biggest software concern. The company also said it would move toward a PC spinoff or sale, and would stop producing its main tablets and smartphones.Mr Apotheker and Cathie Lesjak, HP chief financial officer, have already spoken to dozens of investors, while Ray Lane, non-executive chairman, will make further calls this week.Mr Lane said: “What I will tell investors is that I fully appreciate that changes of this magnitude are hard to comprehend and swallow at the current share price”.Even some long-term value investors attracted by HP’s depressed price were alarmed by the moves, Mr Lane conceded.Mr Lane, a former president of Oracle, database software leader and HP rival, said he would stress that the PC business was a drag on HP’s profit margins and it could thrive independently.He said: “Right now they have to compete with one arm behind their back. They are not free to put [Google’s] Android on their devices.”Mr Lane said “only one company has been successful in integrating hardware and software, and that’s a very special case because of one man”, referring to Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive.Instead of running HP as a conglomerate with independently managed products and services, Mr Apotheker said, “we have to start running this as an integrated company” with software at the centre. “If HP did not make this move, we would be on the fringe.”Yet the pursuit of an integrated offering for large business customers is driving what Mr Apotheker called a “strategic transformation” toward software at HP.Although HP will trail Oracle, IBM and Mr Apotheker’s former company SAP in software sales, he said HP could “disrupt” that market.
390;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-19T09:47:09Z;Autonomy shares soar on $11bn HP deal;;Shares in Autonomy soared after Hewlett-Packard announced an $11bn (£6.7bn) deal to buy the UK’s largest software company in the latest takeover of a FTSE 100 company by a foreign acquirer.If completed, the deal would be the largest in Europe’s IT sector and the second-largest software deal after Symantec secured Veritas for $13.5bn in 2005.On Friday morning Autonomy’s share rose 79 per cent to hit HP’s £25.50-a-share cash offer price, before falling back slightly to £24.93 in late morning trade.Analysts were in agreement that the deal, which is being recommended by Autonomy’s board, offered excellent value for Autonomy shareholders but were more sceptical about the benefits for HP.Paul Morland, a tech analyst at Peel Hunt, called it an “amazing” premium for a company whose earnings grew by just 6 per cent in the first half of the year. “It doesn’t get any better than this, and holders should accept the offer before HP changes its mind. HP’s CEO used to be in charge at SAP, so he should understand software, but this bid seems to defy logic. We believe HP shareholders should be worried.”US rivals could seek to make a counter offer for Autonomy. Oracle, IBM and EMC are all licensees of Autonomy’s Idol technology. “However, Mike Lynch’s ongoing contribution will probably be deemed vital, making gatecrashers less likely. Any rival offer would need to be at a substantial premium to that from HP,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.The acquisition was announced on Thursday as HP revealed disappointing quarterly earnings along with plans to spin off its personal computer business. It also said it was cancelling its attempt to compete with Apple iPad.Founded in Cambridge in 1996 by Mike Lynch, Autonomy has been one of the stand-out successes in UK technology on the global stage– a pioneer in creating search software that can make sense of complex, unstructured information.Mr Lynch still holds an 8 per cent stake in the company, worth more than $800m at the takeover price, not including stock options. He will continue to lead Autonomy within HP after the deal, reporting directly to Leo Apotheker, HP’s chief executive.Autonomy’s takeover has already provoked political concerns over the foreign acquisition of another big UK company.John Denham, shadow business secretary, said: “There is no doubt that the British economy needs a critical mass of clearly British-owned, domiciled and led companies if we’re not going to be all too vulnerable to shifts in the world economy.”The business department in June launched a review into the effect of equity markets on the competitiveness of Britain’s business.Business secretary Vince Cable will want to avoid a repeat of Kraft’s purchase last year of Cadbury, the chocolate manufacturer, which led to the rapid closure of a Bristol factory to the fury of unions and MPs.HP investors alarmed at the 79 per cent premium for Autonomy and a much-reduced financial outlook from the Silicon Valley company sent HP shares down 15 per cent in regular and after-hours trading to their lowest point in years.Autonomy and HP agreed a 1 per cent break fee to the UK company if the deal falls through. At £25.50 a share, the acquisition price would be equivalent to about 23 times forecast 2011 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the company, according to consensus estimates.Though HP has fared better in PCs than many of its rivals, the margins in that business remain much lower than in software and services.Barclays Capital and Perella Weinberg are advising HP, with legal counsel from Skadden Arps and Gibson Dunn. Advisers to autonomy were led by Qatalyst, along with Citi, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch International, UBS and JPMorgan.Reporting by Tim Bradshaw, Joseph Menn, Anousha Sakoui, Helen Thomas, Richard Waters, Jim Pickard and Neil Hume
391;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-18T22:57:04Z;HP / Autonomy: cue embarrassed applause;Smiles all round at Autonomy but HP shareholders must grit teeth;It’s been a long wait, but chief executive Mike Lynch looks to have found someone willing to buy Autonomy for a price approaching the dizzy heights reached during the dot.com boom. He has done extremely well to get Hewlett-Packard to pay an enterprise value of $11bn for the Cambridge-based software company. That is a punt-sinking 10 times prospective revenues. Over the past five years, by contrast, the average European software company has sold for 10 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, according to Bloomberg data.Although an agreed deal with HP, Autonomy may even fetch a higher price from another bidder. Specialist software makers at the lunatic end of the valuation spectrum trade at similar multiples to HP’s offer, and the truth is that Autonomy’s data search technology fits more snugly with the likes of Oracle, SAP or IBM. Then again, if HP ends up selling its personal computer business – which currently accounts for 19 per cent of operating profit – it is slowly earning the right to become whatever type of company it wants to be.So smiles all round at Autonomy. But how should HP’s shareholders be feeling? To be fair they probably have not even crunched the numbers to realise that $640m of annual synergies are needed to justify the 78 per cent premium paid to Autonomy. That is because investors will still be reeling from the announcement that HP is giving up on making tablets and smartphones, and is considering “strategic alternatives” for personal PCs (most likely spun off).Gloom is the appropriate response to a lowering of earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and to the memory of $1.2bn so recently paid for Palm. But on balance HP’s management should be applauded for making some difficult decisions, however embarrassing. HP looks serious about fixing itself this time.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
392;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-17T19:58:02Z;Dell: warning for tech industry;What happens to margins at the company over time may have wider implications;"American tech companies have had a very sound earnings season. Revenue growth has been robust, and companies’ outlooks have been reassuring. Dell, alas, has broken the trend: its shares fell 10 per cent on Wednesday after its quarterly update included a cut to revenue growth guidance for the year, from high to low single-digit per cent expansion. This seems alarming inasmuch as Dell reports relatively late and so gives a more up-to-date window into demand for information technology. But the reduced revenue expectations for growth should not have surprised anyone.Management attributed all of the softness to demand weakness from US consumers and the US federal government. Any company with exposure to these two groups can expect some pain in the quarters to come; this should do little to spook companies entirely focused on corporate customers such as Oracle and IBM. (Hewlett-Packard, however, with its large consumer computer business, may be a different story: its shares fell in sympathy with Dell’s.)What happens to margins at Dell over time may have wider implications. While the company increased its expectations for operating income growth for the year, even the new outlook still implies that operating margins will be lower (at about 7 per cent) in the second half of the year, relative to the first (slightly shy of 9 per cent). Profit growth over recent quarters has been driven by margin expansion accompanying Dell’s move away from the consumer.The tech industry as a whole has enjoyed an impressive run of margin expansion since 2001, according to Bloomberg data. If Dell proves unable to continue its margin growth story, despite a change in strategy, that may suggest that, after a decade, parts of the industry are approaching an inflection point.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
393;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-17T18:23:07Z;Vertical success requires more than just a Motorola;Further consolidation in the industry could put pressure on Google, writes Richard Waters;“Verticalisation” is an ungainly word for what has become a highly fashionable trend in the tech world. With Google slapping down $12.5bn in cash this week to buy Motorola Mobility, the idea just received another big boost. But like many business fashions, there is a risk that this one is about to become an uncontrollable bandwagon – with unhappy consequences.Until recently, the idea that the best products come from companies that combine both hardware and software expertise under the same roof went against the grain of accepted thinking in technology. The PC era was built on a horizontal model, with different companies supplying everything from the chips to hardware and operating system. That was itself a reversal of an earlier computing era dominated by IBM’s integrated mainframe computers.It took Apple to bring things back to the future. With the iPhone – and now the iPad – it has gone even further, building out its own chain of retail stores and, through the App Store, corralling the services that breathe life into its devices. With a move into chip design, it has even taken control of the most important component in its hardware.The idea has been invading the corporate computing market as well, where Oracle’s acquisition of Sun Microsystems last year was seen as a milestone. Combining everything in a single “box” is now seen as a way to increase a technology vendor’s share of a customer’s IT budget.Not that Oracle initially had designs on being a computer maker. It had set its eyes on owning only Sun’s software assets – particularly Java. But the exigencies of corporate dealmaking took over, Oracle was forced to buy the lot, and pretty soon it was claiming that hardware had become a key element of its strategy after all.There are intriguing parallels here with Google. The search company has been signalling hard this week that it does not have any particular interest in hardware, but is drawn by the defensive attractions of Motorola’s patent portfolio, which it can use to defend the smartphone ecosystem built around its Android operating system from legal attacks. This may be a bluff. Certainly, some of its biggest rivals argue privately that it has just embarked on a deliberate and aggressive attempt to copy Apple’s success in integrating hardware, software and services – with other hardware makers that rely on Android, principally Samsung and HTC, the first victims. But if so, then this should give Google’s investors pause for thought.Even leaving aside the question of whether a high-margin software and services company should bother itself with the low-profit distraction of hardware, there are significant management and business challenges. As Oracle is finding out, a hard-headed move to slash unprofitable hardware sales can backfire: its share of the corporate computing market has slumped over the past year.Nor has a vertically integrated approach proved to be a panacea in the smartphone business. Palm’s stumbles over the years, and the troubles of BlackBerry maker Research in Motion, point to the difficulty of mastering all the skills needed to create a hit product. Even Microsoft dabbled in going vertical as it struggled to catch up with the iPod, and later the iPhone – but all it could come up with were marginal products like the Zune music player and shortlived Kin phone.This warning should be heeded in Mountain View. What Google is best at is being Google – not Apple. With a business model that relies on advertising, it has been free to carve its own course in the mobile world. Whatever the talk of direct rivalry between the two companies, Google and Apple have both been able to prosper so far by following different paths.Google has at least promised to run the Motorola hardware business at arm’s length. Indeed, when asked whether he would consider spinning off the Motorola hardware business entirely, Andy Rubin, head of Google’s Android division, told me that he has no particular objection to the idea – though he added that it was not something he had studied.Google’s rivals argue, privately, that such comments are disingenuous and accuse the company of bluffing. The prospect of a Google-made handset running Android software, with a Google search box prominently displayed and deep integration with the Google+ social network, was guaranteed to command the attention of a raft of rivals, among them Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and Facebook.In the current competitive environment, in fact, merely the spectre of such a device is likely to prompt competitive responses. Further vertical consolidation seems the most likely answer, with a Microsoft acquisition of Nokia the most talked-about deal of the moment.This could leave Google facing unintended consequences from its Motorola sortie. The horizontal world in which it has thrived will have been pushed faster into a vertical industry structure in which Apple is the best adapted to survive.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.com
394;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-15T23:38:30Z;Google snaps up Motorola Mobility;;Google has outlined its largest and boldest acquisition yet with the agreement to pay $12.5bn in cash for Motorola Mobility, the US smartphone company, in a deal that escalates the search company’s rivalry with Apple and gives it control over more wireless patents.Google will also gain a new and valuable channel into the living room through Motorola Mobility’s profitable set-top box business which makes receivers for cable TV operators.The deal will see Google pay $40 per share for Motorola Mobility – a 63 per cent premium to the company’s closing share price on Friday – and gain the $3bn of cash sitting on Motorola’s books. Google had $36bn in cash on its balance sheet at the end of June.The acquisition, expected to close by the end of the year or in early 2012, will put Google and Apple head-to-head in the battle for dominance in the fast-growing smartphone market, as both companies will control the hardware and software of their products.But the deal also gives Google direct access to Motorola Mobility’s portfolio of more than 17,000 patents and 7,500 pending patents, ammunition Google believes it needs to repel a patent assault by Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and others on its Android mobile phone operating system.Larry Page, the Google co-founder who took over as Google’s chief executive in April, said the deal would “supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers”.FT reporters in London, New York and San Francisco look at the implications of the acquisitionThe operating system, licensed for free to mobile phone handset makers, has surged in popularity since the first Android phone was launched in 2008. It claimed 48 per cent per cent of the global smartphone market in the latest quarter, according to Canalys, a market research firm, well ahead of rivals including Nokia, Apple and Research in Motion.But acquiring a handset manufacturer will put Google into direct competition with many of the companies that rely on Android to power their own smartphones, including Samsung and HTC.Andy Rubin, senior vice-president of mobile at Google, said: “Google remains firmly committed to Android as an open platform and a vibrant open source community. We will continue to work with all of our valued Android partners to develop and distribute innovative Android-powered devices.”HTC, Samsung, LG and Sony Ericsson issued short statements welcoming the deal, which, they all said, showed that Google was defending Android and its partners.The potential value of Motorola’s patent portfolio was highlighted last month by Carl Icahn, the billionaire Wall Street investor and Motorola Mobility’s largest single investor, who called on management to “consider its options” for maximising the value of its patents.Google was recently outbid by a consortium led by Apple which paid $4.5bn for 6,000 wireless patents owned by Nortel Networks, the defunct Canadian telecommunications equipment maker – a deal that helped highlight the value of intellectual property in the mobile phone industry, which has been rocked by a series of patent infringement suits, many filed by Apple.Motorola Mobility was demerged from Motorola this year after the handset maker was left behind in the touchscreen smartphone revolution ushered in by Apple’s iPhone in 2007.Shares in Motorola Mobility, advised by Qatalyst and Centerview, closed up 56 per cent. Google, advised by Lazard, saw its stock fall 1.2 per cent.Motorola Mobility’s handset business ran into severe difficulties about five years ago after missing the trend towards touchscreen smartphones and the use of third-generation wireless technology, which enables web surfing on mobiles.The business ran up large losses, but the turnround plan led by Sanjay Jha, chief executive since 2008, has made significant strides. The company reported an operating profit of $76m in 2010, compared with a loss of $1.2bn in 2009.The broad challenge for Motorola Mobility has been to differentiate its Android-based products from the competition using the same operating system. Nokia decided to use Microsoft’s smartphone operating system earlier this year after concluding that Android-based handset makers faced commoditisation.Some antitrust experts warned that, with investigations into Google already underway in Washington and Brussels, the deal would face protracted regulatory scrutiny.In a sign of the lengths it has gone to to win over Motorola despite the risk, one person familiar with the transaction said that Google has agreed to pay a $2.5bn break-up fee if it abandons the transaction, a figure that is thought to be one of the highest on record relative to the value of the deal.Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw and Andrew Parker in London and Helen Thomas in New York
395;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-15T20:58:07Z;Google deal leads US stocks higher;;Motorola Mobility shares soared after Google bid $12.5bn to buy the handset group, helping to extend a rally in US shares from the end of last week.Mobility’s shares were up 56 per cent to $38.12, catching up to the $40-a-share price that Google offered.That was a 63 per cent premium to the company’s closing price on Friday.Google shares slipped 1.2 per cent to $557.23, reflecting some of the risks of the all-cash deal at a time of intense competition in the mobile market.Stifel Nicolaus lowered its price target to $675, from $690 “due to the increased business risk from integrating Motorola Mobility”, said analyst Jordan Rohan.A main motivation behind the deal was to secure some of Motorola’s patents and “protect the Android ecosystem”, said Stuart Jeffrey, analyst at Nomura.Android has been slowed by competitive concerns in Europe where some groups have claimed competing licences. Shares in Oracle, one software company with whom Google is locked in a dispute over licences, added 0.9 per cent to $27.64.Larry Page, Google’s chief executive, stressed that the Android platform would remain open to competing handset makers, such as Samsung, Nokia and HTC.Analysts said the deal could boost some competitors if mobile carriers opted to diversity their offerings, fearing a tie-up between Android and one of the biggest hardware markers.“Anything that slows Android momentum helps RIM and Nokia,” said Mike Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “Carriers are frightened of a choice of two carriers globally…. They’re even more likely to support a competing platform like Microsoft’s.”However, Mr Jeffrey at Nomura said it also signalled the end of further industry acquisitions.Shares in Microsoft added 1.6 per cent to $25.51 while US-listed shares of Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, added 10.4 per cent to $27.11.Apple, maker of the competing iPhone and iPad products, was up 1.7 per cent to $383.41. Hewlett-Packard, which recently released its own tablet operating system, was up 0.3 per cent to $32.43.The broader S&P 500 index was up 2.2 per cent to 1,204.49, seeking its third one-day gain in a row for the first time since the beginning of July.It has erased its losses from last week, up 0.4 per cent since last Monday, overcoming that day’s 7 per cent drop, its steepest one-day loss since 2008.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.9 per cent to 11,482.90. The Nasdaq Composite index was also higher by 1.9 per cent, at 2,555.20.There was still concern that the rally might not last. Volumes in US equities were their lowest for the session since July, just over 8bn shares, behind the near-record volume, above 16bn, seen early last week.The release of the Empire State manufacturing survey, a leading indicator of New York-region factory production, showed shrinking activity for the third month in a row.“Whether this is a hardened bottom, or just a technical bounce on the way to lower levels depends on macro indicators,” said Myles Zyblock, institutional strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “The first leading data has disappointed again. We’re still recommending a defensive posture,” he added.Utilities, one of RBC’s defensive recommendations, led all sectors in the S&P 500 on Monday, adding 3.5 per cent.Financials were up 3.2 per cent, reversing some of their 5 per cent decline last week, the most of any sector. Bank of America shares were up 7.9 per cent to $7.76 after the bank said it was selling a Canadian credit card unit to Toronto-Dominion for $8.6bn, alleviating some capital concerns.Shares in Transocean, the offshore drilling group that has bid $1.4bn for a Norwegian competitor, added 3 per cent to $57.26.Lowe’s, the housing goods retailer, added 0.8 per cent to $19.68 after earnings for the quarter topped expectations, at 68 cents a share versus the 66 cents expected.However, US homebuilder confidence remained near its historic lows, unchanged in August versus July.Disappointing earnings led Estée Lauder, the cosmetics group, lower by 6.5 per cent, to $94.27. Earnings were 24 cents versus the 24.9 cents expected.Analysts at Barclays Capital lowered their price targets on soft-line retailers, citing falling consumer demand amid an economic pullback and still-high input costs.Time Warner Cable dropped 0.8 to $65.02 after it said it sealed its acquisition of Insight, a regional US cable television provider, for $3bn in cash.Interpublic Group, the advertising and marketing conglomerate, rose 3 per cent to $8.90 after it said it was selling a stake in Facebook to fund a share buy-back.
396;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-15T15:50:28Z;Race to finance F1 of the sea;;A successful high-speed sailing regatta near Lisbon, the first event of a new and radically different America’s Cup series, has revived the hunt for corporate sponsors to supplement the billionaires who have largely funded the competition so far, according to team owners and race organisers.“It’s important to get commercialised, to have a Formula One,” said Torbjörn Törnqvist, the commodity trader who finances Artemis Racing, the Swedish challenger for the coveted prize. Artemis came second to Emirates Team New Zealand in the dramatic final race on Sunday of the nine-boat Cascais event.The oldest trophy in world sport, the America’s Cup has been contested since 1851 and has long attracted wealthy entrants and sponsors. But the increasing costs of participation, as well as three years of financial and economic crisis, have thinned the ranks of potential entrants.“We are lacking teams, the organisers are lacking sponsors and the teams are lacking sponsors,” said one executive from a commercial sponsor involved in the racing. “It’s a difficult financial environment.”Some teams, including one of the two French entries and China Team, are still struggling to attract big commercial sponsors. But organisers are trying to bring in an Italian and a Middle Eastern team and hope the success of the Cascais regatta will help attract new sponsorship interest from sectors such as banking and airlines.“I’ve been running Louis Vuitton for 22 years and there are always cycles and crises,” said Yves Carcelle, chief executive of the luxury goods company that has linked itself to the competition since 1983.
397;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-09T21:37:26Z;Oracle goes on European hiring spree;;Oracle, the business software company, is launching a recruitment drive aiming to bring 1,700 new employees to the company across Europe.Oracle, which has more than 108,000 employees across the world, said it was responding to increased demand in Europe for technologies such as cloud computing, where companies move their IT functions into remotely-hosted data centres. Europe accounts for about a third of the company’s revenues.Silicon Valley-based Oracle might also be looking to accelerate organic growth as it has temporarily stopped considering acquisitions. The normally acquisitive company said in June that the valuations of companies had become too high for deals to make sense. Oracle has already announced plans to boost the number of sales people at its hardware division.A number of US companies are also increasing overseas activities because they hold vast reserves of cash abroad, which is costly for them to repatriate. Oracle reports that it holds about 90 per cent of its cash outside the US.Oracle said the 1,700 new jobs would be across all lines of its business, and for all levels of staff, from graduates to senior sales staff. True to its technology credentials, Oracle will be recruiting not just through traditional employment agencies, but also on Twitter and Facebook. The company employs 22,000 people in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, so the hiring plan would increase staff levels in the region by just under 8 per cent.The hiring will reverse the trend seen in 2009, when Oracle cut several hundred jobs in Europe following the acquisition of Sun Microsystems and the economic downturn.The announcement echoes a number of other IT companies who are planning to recruit in Europe. Logica, the IT services company, recently said it was looking for 1,000 new graduates in France, while its peer Capgemini has also increased its hiring of junior-level staff in the region. IT recruitment companies report that demand is high for IT skills in areas such as mobile phones, banking and cloud computing.Oracle saw strong growth in its fiscal year to the end of June, with revenues rising 33 per cent to $35.6bn. Larry Ellison, chief executive, said at the time that the company’s core database business had seen its fastest growth for a decade.
398;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-04T00:12:33Z;Google comes out swinging on patents;;David Drummond, Google’s top lawyer, has just issued the search company’s most outspoken denunciation yet of rivals who have laid legal siege to Android.The barrage of lawsuits is nothing less than “a hostile, organized campaign … by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents,” he says.Drummond’s blog post is a thinly veiled appeal to Washington to block what would be a serious setback for Android: the purchase of 6,000 patents from the bankrupt Nortel by a consortium led by Apple (and also comprising Microsoft, Research in Motion, EMC, Sony and Ericsson).As Drummond points out (and we reported previously), the DoJ intervened in a similar case earlier this year in the acquisition by a different consortium (Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and EMC) of a sheaf of patents from Novell. With much more now at stake, some sort of regulatory action would not be surprising, though it may stop short of what Google would like.Google has another good reason to join the rhetorical war that has been raging around this issue: to talk down prices for other patents now up for sale. As we pointed out last week, a patent bubble is now being inflated and Google, as the most needy acquirer, is facing a steep bill.“This patent bubble will pop,” predicts Drummond, when the regulators act to prevent the “accumulation of dubious patents for anti-competitive means.”Perhaps. For now, though, Google is playing with a weak hand.
399;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-08-03T05:16:17Z;Android boss on the alternatives to licensing Java: “They all suck”;;Every good corporate executive knows that carelessly worded internal emails can turn into damning evidence in future trials. In its high-stakes legal fight with Oracle, though, Google has just discovered that an email that was never actually sent – let alone even completed – may turn out to be just as dangerous.The draft email in question was from Andy Rubin, head of Google’s Android business. It was written last year – just before Oracle filed its lawsuit claiming that Android infringed on patents surrounding Java.Google failed earlier this week in an attempt to have the draft communication declared privileged, which would have had reference to it removed from the court record. Mr Rubin’s email itself has not been made available, but this is Oracle’s lawyer, quoting from it at a court hearing late last month:“What we’ve actually been asked to do by Larry and Sergey” – those are the co-founders of Google – “is to investigate what technical alternatives exist to Java for Android and Chrome. We have been over a bunch of these and think they all suck. We conclude that we need to negotiate a license for Java.”This apparently striking admission was not lost on Judge William Alsup:Court: That’s a pretty good document for you.Oracle lawyer: YesCourt: That ought to be, you know, big for you at the trial.Oracle lawyer: YepAnd, in another reference, Judge Alsup said that Mr Rubin will be “on the hot seat at trial and have to explain this email.” This was the sort of thing, he added, that carried the risk of an injunction against Android if Google was found to have willfully infringed the Java patents.Google’s representatives, at the same hearing, made it clear how they would seek to defend against the apparently damning admission in the Rubin email.It was written only when Oracle was threatening legal action, they said: it was not a view that was reached back in the early days of Android, when the open-source mobile software was being created. At the time, Sun Microsystems – which owned the Java patents until its acquisition by Oracle early last year – was wholeheartedly supportive of Android’s use of Java.Soundbites, however, have a way of reverberating beyond their context. For Mr Rubin, that must really suck.
400;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-07-27T19:17:50Z;SAP gaining market share from rivals;;SAP, the business software maker, said it was gaining market share from competitors, including archrival Oracle, after reporting a strong set of second-quarter results that buoyed its shares for a second day.In an interview with the Financial Times, Jim Hagemann Snabe, co-chief executive, said SAP was “taking significant market share in all geographies.”“I actually believe that this marks a tipping point of a structural change in the industry which is pretty significant. You’ve seen companies go out in the second quarter with very different messages. Some are claiming IT spending is not growing. And we are obviously seeing the opposite,” he said.Once considered a rather staid provider of enterprise software that helps companies run more efficiently, SAP is betting that mobile, cloud computing and in-memory computing – a new way to quickly analyse large amounts of business data – will help it gain ground on its rivals.Mr Snabe and co-chief executive Bill McDermott have pushed these innovations since taking over last year and analysts said they could be beginning to bear fruit.“The bottom line is this is a company with two new CEOs who have been making management changes … and you’re starting to see a lot of that change starting to take effect,” Donald Feinberg, vice-president at Gartner, said “Now they’re going to have to deliver on it”.Mr Snabe said SAP was targeting €100m in revenues for mobility and in-memory computing this year. “This is quite significant given they were first launched as an idea and delivered to the market at the end of last year,” he said.Rajeev Bahl, analyst at Matrix Capital Partners, said: “Mobility products are the most significant in the short term. It allows SAP to sweep up business that would otherwise go to others. It also extends the reach of SAP in businesses. On average just 23 per cent of employees in a company would come into contact with SAP software. Mobility takes that much further.”Larry Elisson, Oracle’s founder, once infamously described in-memory technology as “wacko, ridiculous, complete nonsense”.But SAP insists it is now answering its critics. “The pipeline for in-memory computing is the fastest pipeline growth in our history,” said Mr Snabe.“A year ago competitors were laughing at us,” he said. “And now they realise that this is significant and will change the industry fundamentally.”“We have definitely proved [the critics] wrong – you are seeing many companies in the industry desperately acquiring small companies that have any flavour of in-memory computing in their portfolio,” he added.SAP raised its full-year earnings and revenue guidance late on Tuesday, causing its shares to jump 3.6 per cent. The share gained a further 1.6 per cent on Wednesday, on a day when most German blue chips lost ground.SAP expects 2011 operating profit to be at the upper end of its previous range of €4.45bn-€4.65bn ($6.5bn-$6.75bn).
401;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-07-27T18:02:37Z;US groups hit as tax keeps cash overseas;;As much as half US companies’ record $1,240bn in cash balances is being held overseas, according to Moody’s research, with groups wary of incurring a 35 per cent repatriation tax.The foreign holdings are limiting corporate flexibility in managing balance sheets and adding to pressure from the business community for wide-ranging tax reforms.While debates rages in Washington about the state of public finances, the rating agency said on Wednesday that cash held by non-financial companies had risen 11.2 per cent during 2010, even as capital expenditure, deal-making and distributions to shareholders increased.Strength in overseas operations, as well as aggressive international tax planning, suggests growth in foreign cash is outpacing that at home. Moody’s estimated that $500bn to $700bn of the total is held abroad.The figures could fuel debate about reform of the US tax system, under which companies face a hit of up to 35 per cent in repatriating foreign earnings.A group of US lawmakers in May proposed legislation to give US companies a temporary tax holiday, apeing a 2004 reduction in the tax rate when about $300bn was returned to the US.But the administration opposes the idea, with evidence suggesting repatriated funds were returned to shareholders rather than invested in job creation.The last tax holiday may have exacerbated the problem. “The irony of the repatriation holiday was that it created a mentality of more aggressive international tax planning,” said one tax specialist. “It encouraged [putting] facilities, employees and cash-generation offshore.”With limited disclosure around overseas cash, analysts and investors could seek reassurance from companies that they are not hamstrung by the issue. ““If, as we believe, companies are unlikely to repatriate cash without another tax holiday, companies’ liquidity is not as strong as it appears,” said Steven Oman, senior vice-president at Moody’s.In sectors such as technology and healthcare where intellectual property is often held abroad, overseas balances are much higher. Companies such as Oracle and Cisco report about 90 per cent of their cash abroad.Global industrial companies, including General Electric and Honeywell, are also affected.“We have an outdated tax code that basically rewards companies or incentivises companies to keep cash offshore,” David Anderson, chief financial officer of Honeywell told the Financial Times. “It artificially distorts your investment incentives and …in the US you have to borrow because a lot of your cash is used for dividend and other payments.”But some experts question the benefits of reform, especially while US companies have uninvested cash piles at home.“Companies would rather have a system that does not recognise a taxable event just from the movement of cash,” said Stephen Shay, tax professor at Harvard Law School. “But the costs of having a second-best system are not obvious, beyond the marginal additional cost of borrowing in the US when needed.”US companies have been deploying overseas cash in international mergers and acquisitions, such as Microsoft’s $8.5bn deal to buy Luxembourg-based Skype.They have also increasingly made use of complicated structures, which use internal reorganisations as part of US deals to bring cash home. Those work best, say experts, where a target’s value is predominantly in patents and intellectual property.
402;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-07-24T17:45:19Z;Technical difficulties: but good earnings;Taken as a whole, the tech sector deserves more respect;"Someone please let the technology industry know that the economy is slumping. Of the 10 largest US tech companies, eight (Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm, and EMC) have reported earnings recently. Their news has been good.Aggregate revenue grew by nearly 30 per cent, or $25bn; net income grew by nearly 40 per cent, or $8bn. Apple contributed about half of the dollars, but strip Apple out and the sales and earnings growth rates are still 16 per cent and 23 per cent respectively. All eight managed to beat Street expectations. Guidance (leaving aside Apple’s habitual caution) has been fine.This latest quarter comes after the industry had already compiled a respectable record. Since world stocks peaked in late 2007, the S&P information technology index is up slightly, and 10 per cent ahead of the total S&P.Tech did no worse than the broad market on the way down and outperformed it on the way up; the only sectors it lags over that period are consumer staples and consumer discretionary. And the tech index’s earnings have risen nearly 80 per cent since the peak, far overshooting the index’s price.Given this, is it too much for tech investors to hope for a little multiple expansion? The eight big companies to announce earnings so far trade at an average forward price/earnings ratio of 11. At the top in 2007, the sector traded on a multiple roughly double that. All are thoroughly global, and hence exposed to healthy and growing emerging markets. Most have higher exposure to corporations’ strong balance sheets than to consumers’ weak ones.These bullish arguments must contend with the shadow cast by fallen tech angels such as Nokia and Research In Motion (and, to a lesser extent, Cisco). These companies’ recent history shows that, in tech, revenue momentum can reverse and margins collapse very suddenly. This is a reason not to overpay for any one company. But taken as a whole, the sector deserves more respect.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
403;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-06-24T21:42:40Z;Sharp losses for technology sector;;Risk assets took another beating in the final session of a volatile week on Wall Street, with technology stocks suffering particularly sharp losses after disappointing earnings from some of the key players in the industry.Micron Technology, the chipmaker, saw the deepest losses on the S&P 500, falling 14.5 per cent to $7.21 after reporting a 92 per cent drop in earnings late in the previous session.Oracle, the business software and hardware giant, fell 4.1 per cent to $31.14 after reporting lacklustre growth in its hardware segment. The losses came despite a 36 per cent rise in overall fourth-quarter earnings.These losses helped weigh on the technology sector, which was down 1.8 per cent, the worst performing on Wall Street.Other cyclical sectors also suffered as investors continued to worry about the uncertain situation in Europe and were mostly reluctant to buy in case of bad news over the weekend.The industrial and financial sectors were down 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively. Among those stocks to lose ground were General Electric, which fell 2.2 per cent to $17.97, and Morgan Stanley, which declined 0.6 per cent to $22.21.These losses left the S&P 500 down 1.2 per cent to 1,268.45, a loss of 0.2 per cent over the week, leaving it on track for its worst month of losses in a year.The declines came despite some slightly better than expected economic data. The session saw GDP growth for the quarter revised up to 1.9 per cent from 1.8 per cent by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This was an improvement, but still a far cry from the 3.1 per cent GDP growth posted in the fourth quarter of last year.Durable good orders also rose by a stronger-than-expected 1.9 per cent in May on a rebound in demand for transportation equipment.“The economic data were a little better, but there was so much uncertainty going into the weekend that investors were reluctant to buy into the markets,” said Jeff Cleveland, senior economist with Payden & Rygel.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent to 11,937.30, leaving the index down 0.6 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent lower to 2,652.89 on Friday, but still up 1.4 per cent over the week.In deal news, Williams, a natural gas group, launched a $4.9bn cash bid for Southern Union in an attempt to break up an already agreed deal between the target and Energy Transfer Equity.The prospect of a bidding war left shares in Southern Union up 16.9 per cent to $39.92 and ETE down 5.6 per cent to $43.03. Williams was down 2.3 per cent to $28.55.Airline stocks suffered substantial losses in the session led by United Continental Holdings, which fell 8.5 per cent to $23 after providing a disappointing guidance. Delta Airlines declined 4.9 per cent to $9.45 while Southwest Airlines lost 0.4 per cent to $11.36.Airline stocks pared all of the gains that has been won in the previous session on the sharp drop in the oil price.The week on Wall Street began upbeat as investors bought into a depressed market that had seen nearly seven straight weeks of losses.But sentiment reversed on Wednesday after Ben Bernanke gave a cautious assessment of the US economy in a news conference, which then set the tone for the rest of the week.The markets reacted badly to news that the Federal Reserve had cut US growth forecasts, raised inflation estimates and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.Sentiment throughout the week was also weighed on by concerns over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, which absorbed much of the interest and attention of traders.“The 800 pound gorilla is still the uncertainty over Greece,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Financial stocks were some of the worst performers of the week, weighed on by these concerns.Bank of New York Mellon was down 6 per cent over the week to $24.64 while SunTrust Banks fell 4.5 per cent to $25.

405;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-06-23T20:36:55Z;Cloud computing will change your IT purchase plans;;“Is it possible to change my business model overnight?” This question has haunted the dreams of technology vendors since the introduction of cloud computing. It’s led to some interesting changes in position as well. A year ago, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, went from promoting cloud computing as a secondary option to saying that everything may be in the cloud. Over at Oracle, Larry Ellison went from questioning the credibility of cloud computing a year ago, too, but now he’s saying Oracle is the largest cloud computing vendor in the world. How can these leaders — the giants of the IT world — have felt so different a year ago? And what forces are driving them to question whether that haunted dream has become a frightful reality?In our continuing series of articles on the business of cloud computing, we examine the effect it’s having on vendors and the effect this might have on your business.Now, if you’re like the two chief information officers and three business executives I had dinner with a few weeks ago, you probably roll your eyes at the notion that IT vendors need to change at all, let alone do it overnight. Well, that’s partly true. Overnight changes to business models don’t happen much, but the need for change is evident in several key indicators.First, margins on software license sales are dropping. Declining margins may lead to declining profitability and possibly, declining sales. Second, outsourcing, open source, the web and now cloud computing are forces driving the mindset that IT isn’t just a set of products you need to buy - it may not even be work you need to do yourself. Now, you can get someone else to own the products and do the work. Third, new service providers are setting up new expectations for better, faster and cheaper solutions.All these forces are pushing vendors to re-evaluate their current models or risk falling out of the spotlight.So, how does this affect the IT user’s business? Just think of all the contracts you have today and who negotiated and paid for them. It was probably your IT department buying from trusted IT vendors. But now you have business leaders bypassing IT to get applications (called software-as-a-service, or SaaS) from the cloud because it’s so easy. You have new relationships and dependencies being built on immature service providers who you may know little or nothing about. You have line-of-business activities now dependent on someone else’s business practices and infrastructure, and you have no insight into whether or not these “providers” are ready for prime time in supporting your business.Can anyone say “house of cards”? Think of it. In cloud computing, the “pure” cloud vendors currently perceived as leaders are Amazon and Google. But they aren’t your normal enterprise IT vendors — they aren’t even really primarily IT vendors. Amazon is a web retailer, which survives quite well on 4 percent margins, and Google is fundamentally an advertising/media company, with 97 percent of its revenue derived from that source. Both are advanced users of technology, but they don’t have deep relationships with your IT group, nor the track record of success you may have grown used to.In enterprise computing, which supports your most critical business functions, there are many perceived leaders in various segments — from IBM and HP, to Oracle and SAP. Let’s call them the “traditional” IT vendors. Their goal? To be trusted partners with large enterprises. They’re the ones you depend on and have built your confidence around. Unfortunately, they’ve been relatively slow to adopt cloud computing. These vendors are betting more on the status quo rather than the disruption that cloud computing brings.But the disruption is already here. So, the traditional IT vendors have to scramble to change, and business users have to scramble to make sure those changes don’t bite them in the back office over time. And the problem is, not many of the old or new vendors will be good at both enterprise IT support and premier cloud support.The new cloud vendors are standing proud. And how could they not, with their rapid rise to visibility? But even though they offer viable cloud services for the enterprise, they still haven’t spent enough time courting the enterprise mindset and need. The traditional IT vendors are doing their best to keep up. Some will try anything to gain an image of “cloudiness,” regardless of whether or not they have credible cloud service offerings. This is called “cloudwashing,” and it can hurt your business if you commit to the “new” capabilities they provide, but don’t execute particularly well. Not only that, but since cloud computing is about service delivery, there are a significant number of lessons to be learned about how the vendor’s partner ecosystem will need to change. Their channels, value-added resellers, and suppliers aren’t exactly prepared for the shift to the cloud any more than these vendors themselves.So, is that the worst news? Well, no. Companies are about to have your financial planning redefined by moving to an operating cash flow model that overlaps the license models they have already committed to. That means companies will need to continue dealing with the traditional IT vendors and their old product lines, while investing in their business and IT operations as they start paying for new cloud subscriptions, sometimes even from the same vendors.So, it’s time to start planning again. Start planning for your legal staff to engage the cloud vendors to see what they’ll guarantee and what they won’t. Start planning to push your traditional vendors to get real about the cloud. Start planning for a changing of the guard in your investment portfolio and data center. And, more congenially, start planning for the day when someone might say, “Nobody ever got fired for buying Amazon” instead of “IBM.”Daryl Plummer and David Mitchell Smith are research fellows at Gartner.Click here for earlier pieces in this series on cloud computing.
406;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Growth in sales of business software;;Business software sales are growing strongly as global economies emerge from recession and companies begin to invest in IT infrastructure again in order to reduce costs, improve efficiency and expand markets.Figures published by Gartner, the IT research firm, suggest that worldwide enterprise software spending is likely to grow by 9.5 pe rcent this year and top $267bn, up from $244bn last year. Gartner predicts the global market will continue to grow in 2012 reaching $288bn, welcome news for enterprise software vendors including Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.“The market for enterprise software continues to recover, following the 2009 downturn, with signs of ongoing growth on the horizon,” said Joanne Correia, managing vice-president at Gartner. “Economic recovery is evident across all regions, although concerns have arisen in some countries in Europe and Asia,” she said. However she also cautioned that “the earthquake and tsunami in Japan has created additional marketplace uncertainty with a multiplicity of effects that are beginning to be determined.”Overall, enterprise infrastructure software spending is expected to reach $153.3bn this year, a 9 per cent increase from 2010 revenues. The market is led by the operating systems segment in which revenue is projected to reach $32.6bn in 2011, followed by database management systems at $25.5bn.Enterprise resource planning software is the largest segment of the enterprise application software market and is expected to account for $23.3bn out of the total $114.4bn spent on business applications this year, up from $103.8bn last year. Sales of office suites including Microsoft’s flagship Office package, will total about 15.7bn.“With this latest research, we see short-term currency uplift for US dollar-denominated growth for the period of 2011-2012 and downward adjustments in GDP across all regions,” Ms Correia said. “We have identified a strong correlation between GDP growth and enterprise software spending growth, where software tends to grow 4 to 6 per cent above GDP in normal market conditions. However, we do have concerns about the rising cost of commodities, including oil, and its impact on certain regional and country economies.”Emerging countries such as Poland, India, China and Brazil, which were less affected by the latest economic downturn than the US and Europe, are expected to continue to invest heavily in enterprise software over the next few years as they build the IT infrastructures necessary to do business on a global basis.Meanwhile Gartner expects enterprise software spending in North America to increase from $112.9bn last year to $121.2bn in 2011. The market will experience consistent growth through 2015, when spending in North America will surpass $158.1bn.“Gartner believes that oil prices and the outcome of the federal budget deliberations are the largest threats to economic stability in North America. However, current indicators are positive with consumer and business spending on both equipment and software holding up. With the extension of federal tax cuts – including the tax relief on capital equipment depreciation – due to expire at the end of the year, additional stimulus revenue could further boost enterprise spending on technology and other capital goods.”Enterprise software spending in Western Europe is forecast to reach $78.3bn in 2011, up from $70.3bn last year. “In Western Europe, enterprise software spending could see slightly stronger growth in the latter half of 2011, but the headwinds are getting stronger. The pace of growth in Europe is slowing, mostly because of recent currency appreciation, fiscal tightening, higher commodity prices and concerns about debt in countries such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain,” said Fabrizio Biscotti, research director at Gartner. “The result of these additional constraints on growth will exacerbate some country growth trends in the region. However, countries on the upside of this trend are Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and Sweden.”Gartner predicts that the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) will have the second fastest growth, after Latin America, in enterprise software revenue growth this year with spending expected to reach $26.4bn in 2011, up from 2010 revenue of $23.6bn.“Overall, emerging markets’ growth will slow over the forecast period, but will continue to be faster than those of the developed world,” said Yanna Dharmasthira, research director at Gartner. “However, economic growth in almost all the emerging countries is also likely to be affected by the slowing trends in Europe and Japan. Among the largest emerging markets, China and Brazil will see the most pronounced slowing trends, while growth rates in India and Russia will be less affected.Gartner’s report, ‘Forecast: Enterprise Software Markets, Worldwide, 2008-2015, 2Q11 Update,’ is available at here. Gartner is due to report the latest overall worldwide IT spending forecast on 30 June.
407;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-06-15T23:42:07Z;Hewlett-Packard sues Oracle over…stuff;;In the latest salvo in a continuing battle between former allies, Hewlett-Packard on Wednesday filed suit against Oracle over the latter’s announced refusal in March to keep making new versions of its database software for HP servers based on the Itanium chip. But it is hard to know whether the case has much hope.That’s because the public version of the 26-page complaint filed in California’s Santa Clara County Superior Court not only redacts many of a sealed version’s factual claims, but also three of the ten legal grounds for the suit.What remains suggests that HP thinks it has a secret contract with Oracle that guarantees continued support for the database software on Itanium servers. In an apparent one-word elision, the suit claims that Oracle’s action “constitutes a breach of xxx and implied contract”.“There are confidential components to the relationship between Oracle and HP that cannot be released”, HP communications head Bill Wohl explained via email.Oracle, in a statement, made clear it sees no actual contract. “HP explicitly asked Oracle to guarantee continued support for Itanium, but Oracle refused,” the company said.Some of HP’s remaining arguments seem a bit weak, such as the claim that old Oracle announcements about serving the Itanium market constitute an enforceable “collaborative partnership”.Generally speaking, software companies are free to distribute versions for whatever hardware platforms they choose.There are two other unredacted claims of interest, though. The first is that Oracle has been giving away servers from its Sun Microsystems division to Oracle customers, theoretically violating state laws on fair competition.And the second is an old-fashioned claim of libel. When Oracle announced that it was dropping Itanium support, it accused HP of knowing that Intel was planning to stop making the chip and “knowingly withholding” that information from customers.Intel denied having any such plans, and HP says Oracle should have known the claim was false because its co-president Mark Hurd had until last year been CEO at HP.Oracle stuck to its guns in its statement. “Intel’s plans to end-of-life Itanium will be revealed in court now that HP has filed this utterly malicious and meritless lawsuit,” the company said.It is hard to see where the public arguing between the big companies will end. Perhaps it would come with an HP victory in this case– except that some of its requests for legal relief are redacted too.
408;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

410;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-05-27T03:10:14Z;PayPal sues Google over mobile payments hire;;PayPal has filed a lawsuit against Google over the hiring of one of its key payments executives, hitting back on the same day that the search company unveiled a long-awaited move into the mobile payments business.The online payments company, which is owned by Ebay, on Thursday named as defendants two of its own former executives, who are now leading Google’s payments initiative, as well as the search company itself.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit, which revolves around the alleged disclosure of trade secrets and breaching of a non-solicitation agreement.Californian courts are generally reluctant to enforce the “non-compete” agreements that executives often sign and which technically prevent them from working for competitors for a set period, said Robyn Crowther, a lawyer at Caldwell Leslie in Los Angeles.But she said the type of claims in the PayPal case had a better chance of being upheld.Legal wrangles over the hiring of key employees have become increasingly common as technology companies have moved more directly into each others’ markets.Last year Hewlett-Packard filed a suit against Oracle over its hiring of former HP chief executive Mark Hurd, while IBM took legal action over Apple’s recruitment of hardware executive Mark Papermaster.PayPal’s claims surround Google’s hiring of Osama Bedier, who left to work for the search company in January of this year. Mr Bedier had worked as PayPal’s vice-president for platform, mobile and new ventures, and has filled the same role at Google, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in a California state court in Santa Clara.In its lawsuit, PayPal accused Mr Bedier of misappropriating its trade secrets in his work on Google’s rival mobile payment system.It also said that Stephanie Telenius, a former Ebay executive who left the e-commerce company in 2009, and who is now Google’s head of e-commerce, had breached a non-poaching agreement by hiring Mr Bedier at Google.
411;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-05-17T18:32:43Z;HP: vertical model starts to lean;The magic of integration is nowhere in evidence;The vertical model in technology is starting to lean a bit, if Tuesday’s results from Hewlett-Packard are any indication. Consumer computer sales shrunk by a quarter from a year ago and margins in the services segment are expected to drop from more than 15 per cent this quarter to 14 per cent or lower next quarter.PCs may not matter much. They are still a third of HP’s revenues, and consumer sales are enough of that to drag the whole segment’s revenue down. But margins and expectations are already badly beaten up. If HP announced tomorrow that it was selling the PC business, even on the cheap, the stock would probably rise.The services business, by contrast, is cause for genuine worry. The vertical or “integrated stack” model that companies such as HP, Oracle and Cisco are embracing is built on the notion that if you sell a client the full set of lower-margin hardware it needs, high-margin software and services will follow. Services are especially important for HP because it has only a small base in software. Alas, while there was solid performance in enterprise hardware, HP’s business mix in services is trending towards lower-margin infrastructure outsourcing and away from high-margin applications and business-process work. HP says it must invest more in the sales force to change this. The magic of integration is nowhere in evidence.It may well be HP’s execution, and not its model, that needs retooling. In the near term though, the most important change might be in its investor base. The stock now trades at just over seven times the lowered 2012 guidance, lower even than unloved Cisco (10 times) and Microsoft (nine times).

After decades of diversification, the organisation and its strategy have become baroque. John Chambers, the boss, said as much in a memo last month. And Cisco’s switching business, a third of revenue, is facing margin pressure.The two problems are in fact one and are not unique to Cisco. At every big tech group, competition turns profitable products into margin-killers. To protect earnings, companies must move into adjacent – or not-so-adjacent – areas. This can lead to overpaying for acquisitions and drifting priorities. But the other option is sticking with businesses as they wither.It is pointless, then, to criticise large tech groups’ often awkward efforts at diversification. But is there a right or wrong way to branch out? While luck may be most important, a few broad rules appear to hold. Crossing the line between consumer and enterprise technology looks like a mistake. The differences in product cycles, sales channels and customer needs may be too great. Put the big US tech stocks on a five-year chart. Outperformers Apple, Oracle, and IBM (average total return 230 per cent) have respected the divide while the underperformers Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, Microsoft (12 per cent) have straddled it.The same focus must be placed on leaving old businesses as on entering new ones. A Boston Consulting Group study of conglomerates found that those with the best returns were not distinguished by particularly high exposure to high-growth segments. Instead, the winners allocated more capital to more profitable businesses and underinvested in, or divested, the least profitable. IBM, arguably the most successful diversified tech company, has sold $7.7bn in businesses in the past 10 years, according to Dealogic. HP, Cisco, and Microsoft have, together, sold less than half that. If you want to be reborn, you have to die first.E-mail the Lex team in confidence

415;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-05-10T19:51:46Z;Vodafone skips Footsie gains ahead of results;;Vodafone missed out on the FTSE 100’s biggest gain in three weeks amid concerns that its results next week might disappoint the market. Its shares were one of only three blue-chip fallers in London as analysts cut numbers.Credit Suisse, Nomura and Exane BNP Paribas all trimmed earnings forecasts by about 3 per cent to reflect competition in Europe.Profit warnings from KPN and Belgacom have pointed to smartphones cannibalising voice usage, suggesting consensus expectations for Vodafone’s margins still need to fall, Nomura said.It cut forecasts to “pre-empt cautious margin guidance” at full-year results next Tuesday.Credit Suisse also predicted that Vodafone Europe would miss forecasts for 2011, though it expected US and Indian operations to compensate.Vodafone ended weaker by 0.3 per cent to 169½p even as all three brokers kept “buy” advice.“We do not see results as a great positive catalyst but believe that consensus is now sufficiently cautious,” said BNP.Strong corporate earnings and gains among the commodity stocks helped lift the wider market, sending the FTSE 100 higher by 76.2 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 6,018.89.A better than expected US performance lifted InterContinental Hotels by 3.9 per cent to £12.98 while Imperial Tobacco gained 3.1 per cent to £22.24 after boosting investor returns.Schroders’ voting shares rose 5.6 per cent to £17.50 after Numis Securities added the fund manager to its “buy” list.Quarterly results last week were disappointing but the stock had fallen to 13 times forward earnings, compared with a historical average of 15.5 times, analyst David McCann said.Reed Elsevier climbed 3.3 per cent to 549½p after it hosted a seminar on its risk information unit, the publisher’s first investor day for four years. The meeting “marked a significant turning point in the company’s communication strategy”, said Credit Suisse.Sage Group rose 3.6 per cent to 296p on talk that the accounting software maker was a takeover target for Oracle or SAP.Dealers doubted the talk and noted that Sage management was on a US investor roadshow this week. But they added that the disposal of Sage’s perennially underperforming US healthcare unit looked more plausible.Misys, which has also been the subject of rumours about a bid or the disposal of a division, added a further 1.4 per cent to 348¼p.Fiserv and SunGard Data Systems would be potential bidders, though they might need more evidence that Misys’ banking unit had been turned round, said analysts.Premier Foods led the mid-cap gainers, up 6.4 per cent to 38¾p, after Citigroup turned positive with a 40p price target.A debt restructuring last October cleaned up the company structure but left investors nonplussed, it said, and added: “We believe that as performance stabilises, the market will be increasingly willing to ascribe a ‘sensible’ valuation to the stock.”EnQuest, the North Sea oil producer, rose 5.2 per cent to 136¾p on news that it had taken majority control of the 26.8m-barrel Crawford oil field. It raised its stake from 19 per cent to 51 per cent in exchange for shouldering $56m of development costs.TalkTalk, the UK internet provider, lost 2.5 per cent to 134¾p after it cut package prices, a move analysts said was likely to have been in response to competition from BT’s Plusnet brand.Set-top box maker Pace slumped 39.2 per cent to 93p on a warning that it had paid too much to stock up on inventory this year. Analysts said that, while there was no confidence left in management or forecasts, the distressed valuation might make Pace a takeover target for a rival.
416;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-05-09T21:42:01Z;Bain approach intensifies Micro Focus debate;;The recent approach for Micro Focus by Bain Capital, the US private equity group, has intensified the debate about the long-term growth prospects of the British software company.Bain’s preliminary inquiry over the Easter weekend – a precursor to a possible bid worth up to £890m– followed a turbulent year for Micro Focus. The departure last June of Nick Bray, its well-regarded financial director, worried investors, as did last month’s resignation of Nigel Clifford after only 11 months as chief executive.The stock suffered a single-day fall of 26 per cent in February after the management said revenue and earnings for the year to April would be about 10 per cent lower than expected – guidance repeated in a trading update on Monday.Investor concern, analysts said, is founded on the company’s focus on Cobol, one of the oldest programming languages that is increasingly unfashionable.Companies will look to move their systems away from Cobol, said George O’Connor at Panmure Gordon, due to fears that the number of technicians familiar with the code is declining. “Cobol was the baby boomers’ lingua franca,” he said. “If you’re a young graduate, you won’t want to learn Cobol.”However, Cobol remains by far the most widespread code, used in all IBM mainframes and relied upon to some extent by most of the world’s biggest companies, including leading banks, utilities and retailers. While its reach is unlikely to expand in the coming years, demand will endure for Micro Focus’ software, which updates Cobol-based systems, said Tintin Stormont at Singer Capital.“Some of these applications are quite core in some of these big enterprises. [Micro Focus] is extending the life of this software …the only other option would be to replace it with package [off-the-shelf] software, so any competitive advantage they’ve built into it would be lost,” Ms Stormont said. “You lose all that individual tailoring.”That suggests a steady stream of cash-generative sales in the long-term future – potentially boosted as companies enlist Micro Focus’s services to help move their data from IBM mainframes to lower-cost servers made by the likes of Dell and Hewlett-Packard.This strong cash flow makes it attractive fodder for a private equity takeover. Bain is familiar with the software industry: its $65bn (£40bn) portfolio includes enterprise software companies, such as SkillSoft in Ireland and Applied Systems of the US.In February, the company highlighted its business in automated testing of companies’ computer systems, which accounted for a third of turnover in the first half of the financial year, as a central focus for future growth. Kevin Loosemore, who moved to executive chairman from a non-executive chairman role after Mr Clifford’s resignation, is expected to continue this strategy.Alexandra Jarvis, analyst at Peel Hunt, said a quarter of the group’s business was in “high-growth testing products” that could begin to reap strong dividends as early as next year.A Gartner study in January put Micro Focus third in the world by revenues in testing, ahead of Microsoft and Oracle, and behind only IBM and HP. “The company has a solid product line that it has invigorated, [and] it has provided a clear direction for customers,” Gartner said.Bain is believed to be planning a bid worth up to 450p a share, compared with 338p when it made the approach. However, analysts expect the buy-out firm to wait for Micro Focus’s next trading statement on Thursday before deciding on the quantum of its bid – or whether to pull out altogether.Micro Focus has forecast sales of $434m-$442m for the year to April, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $141m-$153m.“The update will tell us if they’ve made their numbers or not,” Ms Jarvis said. “If not, it provides strength to the ex-growth theory.”
417;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-05-04T14:31:49Z;Sony under fire after new breach;;Sony continues to face withering criticism from its gaming customers for cyberattacks that have potentially exposed their financial information. But the disclosure of a second breach has given more credibility to the Japanese technology company’s internal view that the hackers had a level of sophistication that would have been hard for any company to withstand.Sony on Monday shut down a second network for its gamers, Sony Online Entertainment, and later said that one or more criminals had made off with the credit and debit card numbers or other sensitive financial data of more than 23,000 users of the network.That is a small proportion of the 24m people who use multiplayer games such as EverQuest on the network. Sony also maintained there was no evidence the intrusion at the main PlayStation Network two weeks ago had involved hackers extracting financial data on its more than 70m players.“It is an incredibly sophisticated attack,” said one person working with Sony. “The scale is enormous.” The company’s existing database and security providers, which include Oracle, are continuing to sift through data reports to understand how far the hackers have gone.Because the two online gaming networks share few resources and had separate security structures, Sony should not be faulted for discovering the second breach more than a week after the first, experts said.“I am not going to indict them for that,” said Jeremiah Grossman, founder of WhiteHat Security. “You can assume it could take them a long time to check the whole system.”Company executives in Japan said at the weekend that the hackers had broken in through an application server, which processes electronic requests for specific programmes, and established a communications channel. They used that access to attack the database server, and from there reached the store of user passwords and addresses on the Play­Station Network.Mr Grossman said that suggests the hackers had made use of a technique known as SQL injection, in which the database fails to recognise that it is executing an improper command. That approach is preventable but remains a widely successful method for hackers. Others said SQL injection alone would not have been enough to enter the second network.“Most probably it was a ‘spear-phishing’ attack that fooled a system administrator into installing an infected piece of software, from where the attackers could pivot to do the rest,” said Alan Paller, research director at the non-profit Sans institute for computer security. “Spear-phishing” refers to an e-mail or instant message that targets a specific person or small group. That has been the dominant method for a spate of intrusions revealed in the past 18 months at companies such as Google and RSA, the security company owned by US data storage group EMC.
418;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-05-03T00:32:01Z;Second Sony network shut by hacker fear;;Sony closed a second online network for its gaming customers and said for the first time that hackers had stolen account information on thousands of payment cards.The company disabled the Sony Online Entertainment system, which serves players of its EverQuest and other games played from personal computers.It said that at around the same time that one or more hackers broke into the larger PlayStation Network for console gamers, there was a similar breach at the PC service.Names, e-mail addresses, home addresses and phone numbers for 24m users were stolen, and a database from 2007 was also compromised, exposing more than 12,000 debit and credit card numbers and more than 10,000 debit transaction records from Austria, Germany, Netherlands and Spain.The Japanese electronics group is still discovering fresh attacks, according to people close to the company, but a spokeswoman said the latest decision to close the Online Entertainment System related to the discovery of a previous breach rather than a second attack.The move stunned gamers and showed that Sony is still struggling to understand the extent of the flaws in its technology defences nine days after it took down the PlayStation service.Sony apologised and said it would pay for identity theft protection for users of both networks, though it said it has no evidence of payment card data theft on the PlayStation service.Security experts said it was not surprising that more problems are still being discovered.“If a hacker gets in through the front door, you have to look at every single room,” said Hemanshu Nigam, former chief of digital security at News Corp. “Sony is finding out what happens if you don’t do security right.”Sony is working with Oracle and three smaller security companies, which designed parts of its system, to help in its internal inquiry. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating.On Sunday, company executives apologised for the first breach, which exposed the e-mail addresses and Sony passwords of more than 70m consumers.Sony said it is strengthening its security and hiring a new head of data protection.Also on Monday, Sony declined an invitation to testify at a US House hearing on data protection scheduled for Wednesday. A spokeswoman for congresswoman Mary Bono Mack said that Sony had promised to answer written questions about its delayed announcement of the hacking by the end of Tuesday.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall
419;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-04-28T12:41:51Z;SAP disappoints with slow profit growth;;Shares in SAP fell more than 6 per cent on Thursday morning after the world’s largest enterprise software maker failed to meet market expectations for profits in the first quarter.Pre-tax profits at the German company rose 4 per cent to €403m ($599m) for the three months to the end of March, but were below analysts’ forecasts of just under €500m. Earnings were held back by €112m in costs related to the acquisition of US rival Sybase last year.SAP bought Sybase to accelerate its business of adding mobile connectivity to corporate computer systems, one of the key growth areas for the company.SAP also recorded a charge of €52m for “stock-based compensation” as dozens of executives rushed to cash in their stock options following a strong rise in the share price. The shares have nearly doubled in value since the end of 2008.The results were disappointing after very strong figures for the fourth quarter of 2010, and left analysts concerned about SAP’s prospects.Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe were brought in as new co-chief executives of SAP last year, with a brief to streamline the business and make it more innovative. But investors still need convincing that a real change has been made.“There doesn’t seem particular evidence of SAP having solved its fundamental problems of being a bit of a welfare state for software engineers. How much have they really innovated in the last few years?” an analyst said.Mr McDermott said the Sybase charges were not unexpected and that SAP was “exactly where we thought it would be” in terms of its strategy.Mr McDermott said the company was still on track to hit full-year targets, as well as its medium-term goal of being a €20bn revenue company with 30 per cent operating margins by 2015. Revenues for 2010 were €12.45bn.Sales at SAP increased 21 per cent to €3.024bn in the first quarter, fuelled by demand for mobile connectivity and for a new type of computer memory that allows faster processing speeds. SAP’s software helps power computer systems for thousands of companies worldwide, for example, processing orders on Apple’s iTunes music download system.Last month, SAP’s US main rival Oracle, saw a 29 per cent rise in sales, while this month strong results from Intel and IBM pointed to a general rebound in business spending on software and computer services.
420;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-04-28T04:48:18Z;BEA’s Alfred Chuang plots a new revolution in enterprise software;;You would never accuse Alfred Chuang of a lack of ambition. Having sold BEA Systems to Oracle for $8.5bn, he is back in business for himself – with $10.6m in his pocket from Andreessen Horowitz and a goal of transforming the way business applications are written.When I caught up with Chuang on Wednesday, he was just taking the wraps off his latest venture – Magnet Systems – and enthusing about the opportunity to rewrite corporate software from the ground up. At BEA he championed the middleware layer that underpins much of today’s e-commerce – a mixed blessing, since it eventually brought an unwelcome (but irresistible) takeover bid from Oracle.Now, he says, it’s time to look past all that: enterprise applications need to reflect the new technological realities that have already been reshaping consumer behaviour. Cloud computing, social networking and the proliferation of new mobile devices are forces that are still not reflected in the silo-ed approach to corporate applications. So why not rip it all up and start again? (This is how Chuang describes his ambition on his corporate blog.)Coming from anyone else, this might sound like the height of hubris. Corporate IT departments are heavily invested in the current architecture, and the sort of ideas that Chuang is championing – like opening up access to a company’s systems so that its customers have better visibility of their overall relationship and transactions – sound like anathema to security-minded CIOs. With a staff of 17, what chance does Magnet have of advancing such a revolutionary agenda?But Chuang has the track record and the connections at least to get a serious hearing. After two years operating under the radar, he has just raised the money from AH (along with a further $2m put in by himself and angel investor Bill Janeway of Warburg Pincus, an early backer of BEA). He also has a beta version of his first application to show off his ideas.Eventually, Magnet plans to open its platform (called WIN – for Workplace Interaction Network) for companies to build and deploy their own applications on.It is a grand ambition, certainly. But Ben Horowitz, who has joined Magnet’s board, doesn’t mince words in a blog post of his own, declaring Chuang “the greatest CEO of my time”. Setting expectations high is a fine way to start out, but such statements will take some living up to.
421;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-04-25T20:32:12Z;The reality of a career switch;;Fired from Salomon Brothers, in the 1981 recession, Michael Bloomberg used his pay-off to start Bloomberg, the eponymous financial information business. The career swap set the merely wealthy ex-banker on the road to membership of the world’s super-rich club and, eventually, political celebrity as mayor of New York.Yet crossing from Wall Street or the City to main street can be a perilous step, even for the talented and powerfully connected. Only some of the management tricks learnt working in a big money-markets business can be applied to a start-up.Ron Packard, chief executive of on­line education business K12, had the start-up funds to pursue his vision in 2001 of taking online learning into the schoolroom, thanks in part to having the financier Michael Milken and Oracle’s Larry Ellison as his principal investors.But it has taken him a decade to get to the point where, with annual revenues of $500m, he feels the business can afford the management information systems and analytical tools that he took for granted in his earlier career as a Goldman Sachs banker and as a McKinsey consultant. “You know what state-of-the-art is,” he says. “But you cannot afford the sophistication you have seen in other businesses, which is very frustrating.”Attempting to build a sophisticated business on a shoestring is one of many reality checks awaiting those who quit Wall Street or the City of London to run their own business. Many foresee – but may underestimate – the effect of going from receipt of a big monthly salary to paying other people, whether or not the business is turning a profit. But add to that the emphasis that elite institutions place on ironing out risk through exhaustive analysis, coupled with a management culture that buys the loyalty of ambitious high-fliers with tantalising bonuses, and it bec­omes apparent that a money-market background is lacking as a training ground for building a business.As former technology investment banker John Prendergast – who quit Wall Street’s Jefferies & Company in 2008 to co-found Blueleaf, a US online money management start-up – puts it: “The deal as a young banker is that you will accumulate wealth and in return take as much pain as [your employer] cares to heap on to you.”That is not a formula for company founders, who must inspire people to believe their business has a future before they can hire them.Just how banking-style sol­utions, in which the emphasis is on getting deals done and moving on to the next project, can come to grief on the factory floor was brought home to Karim Sekkat. A former mergers and acquisitions specialist at Barons Financial Services, the City investment boutique, Mr Sekkat put his banker’s theories on how to create value to the test by starting his own acquisitions-led manufacturing busin­ess, KAS Technologies, in 2004. Reasoning that an injection of brain power would transform the solid engineering companies he bought into world-class outfits, he recruited managers from blue-chip corporations to knock the operations into shape. To his dismay, competent long-standing employees were soon handing in their notice, while the manufacturing glit­ches and missed deadlines were still not fixed.“My mistake was to imagine that people who had worked for a world- class organisation would know how to [create a high-performance culture],” says Mr Sekkat. “Actually, what they knew was how to run a company that was already world class.”His response was to perform a U-turn in early 2008. With the help of the shopfloor employees, he turned his old analytical skills to the task of identifying production bottlenecks and designing easy-to-follow procedures, illustrated on wall-mounted visual boards. “When you are in the City, you can make a lot of things work on paper,” says Mr Sekkat, whose group last year achieved revenues of £19.3m. “But when you are [a manager], you really have to und­erstand what makes a business tick.”Nevertheless, some practices can be imported directly to the new business.Former HSBC banker Ian Zilber­kweit, co-founder of LPQ Russia, which trades as Nash Khleb (Our Bread) Bakery Group and operates the Russian franchise for Le Pain Quotidien – as well its own retail chain and a wholesale business – imported a practice from his old employer to tackle a problem of managers ducking responsibility for commercial performance by getting them to set their own targets. Introducing a vested employee share scheme has also encouraged experienced staff to stick with the business, which has a turnover of just over 600m roubles ($21.5m).“There are definitely [practices] from banking that are applicable [to running a small business],” says Mr Zilberkweit, “but you may have to simplify them.” Without the help of the Russian HR director, he says he and his business partner would have struggled to explain the City-inspired concept of vested shares to the workforce.The realisation that the buck now stops with them can leave some new owner-managers, used to working in a City peer group, feeling exposed and isolated. Mr Zilberkweit says: “In banking it is easy to make friends [because everyone has a similar background]. In the company you create there is much less of that.” For instance, “you cannot afford the sort of people [that you used to work with]”.In such cases, joining business networks can prove a pick-me-up for ex-City suits in search of peer group support, says David Molian, director of the business growth and development programme at Cranfield School of Management. He says former City colleagues can help open doors with introductions but their ability to ad­vise new entrepreneurs on running a business or even to identify with their daily dilemmas is limited “because they are not doing it themselves.”Having just opened his fifth London ice-cream parlour, and with three more plan­ned, Carlo Del Mistro might not seem in need of advice on entrepreneurship. In fact, the ex-Lehman Brothers banker turned founder of Gelato Mio, an upmarket Italian ice-cream brand, admits he found old habits hard to shake off. “At the beginning, I might spend four or five days trying to get a promotion or a poster completely perfect,” says Mr Del Mistro. He opened his first parlour in 2008 while doing an MBA at London Business School, on sabbatical from Lehman. “But, if you want to be an entrepreneur, you have to take risks.”So far, his risk-taking strategy ap­pears to be paying dividends – which, as he mischievously points out, is more than can be said of his erstwhile employer.
422;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-04-25T02:25:42Z;Autonomy keeps powder dry on acquisitions;;After a tricky end to last year, there was some relief last week when Autonomy followed IBM and Intel in saying that its customers were spending more, and on a wider range of IT products.Adjusted pre-tax profits of $95m for the first quarter, on sales up 13 per cent to $220m achieved by the UK software group were ahead of expectations, albeit modestly.And comments from Mike Lynch, chief executive, that Autonomy was seeing a “gentle sustained recovery” and that current market estimates for the year could “turn out to be conservative”, helped lift the company’s shares more than 7 per cent on Thursday.But absent from last week’s statement was any significant update on Autonomy’s long-anticipated North American acquisition.The Cambridge-based software company raised £500m via a convertible bond in February 2010 that, based on current exchange rates, gives Autonomy a war chest of $1.1bn to spend on an acquisition.Autonomy rather confidently, and analysts say in hindsight foolishly, hemmed itself in to a time frame by saying a deal was likely to be signed by the autumn of 2010. However, in November it issued a short statement saying that while it had been working on an acquisition, developments within these talks had “given rise to an additional opportunity” that warranted further examination.Meanwhile, analysts speculated that this could mean that Autonomy had been looking to buy part of a business but had since widened the scope of the deal, or that it had pinpointed an additional takeover target.Others suggested that Autonomy’s had been beaten by a competitor in its quest to find a company to complement its portfolio of software.There was even a suggestion that Autonomy had gone after ART Technologies, which Oracle agreed to buy for about $1bn last year. But at the fourth-quarter earnings in February, Mr Lynch said that the target had not been acquired.Open Text was seen as a possible target, something that the Canadian company has dismissed.In fact Autonomy’s previous record – which saw it buy Interwoven in 2009, Zantaz in 2007 and Verity in 2005 – shows it rarely buys the number one in sector. And with so many software players of about $1bn falling within the scope of Autonomy’s net, market observers have stopped guessing.Autonomy’s purchases over the past few years have led some to ponder what constitutes real underlying growth at the group. Decent third-quarter results that were accompanied by a warning on the fourth have also rattled some investors and weighed on the share price.Some analysts speculate that without an acquisition Autonomy’s run of consecutive quarters of double-digit growth looks unsustainable.“Given that M&A is a very important part of bottom-line growth, the dynamic if Autonomy can’t close a deal is not good,” says Gunnar Plagge, an analyst at Nomura. But he says that investors would prefer Autonomy to find the right deal than press ahead with a transaction that had any potential pitfalls.And Thursday’s results provided the bulls with something to cheer about. Michael Briest, analyst at UBS, says that while first-quarter revenues were not miles ahead of forecast, licence growth was up 17 per cent, much better than the mid single-digit growth forecasts.He adds: “The main takeaway for those people who were worried about growth, is that the business is accelerating not decelerating.”
423;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-04-06T20:57:29Z;M&A lawyer charged in $32m insider trading scheme;;A mergers and acquisitions lawyer and a stock trader were accused by federal prosecutors of masterminding a 17-year insider trading scheme that reaped $32m in illegal profits by stealing deal information from three corporate law firms.Prosecutors filed charges in a New Jersey federal court against Matthew Kluger, a former senior associate at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, and Garrett Bauer, a trader who worked at several proprietary trading firms, over the alleged scheme.Mr Kluger allegedly stole confidential information from Wilson Sonsini about deals involving high-technology companies including Oracle, Sun Microsystems, McAfee and 3Com, and passed tips to Mr Bauer through a third unnamed co-conspirator, with instructions on how many shares to buy, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The scheme also involved trading on non-public information obtained from Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, two law firms where Mr Kluger previously worked. None of the law firms were implicated.“Mr Kluger was careful to steal and disclose information about deals on which he did not personally work, but which he learnt about by searching his law firm’s computer system,” according to the complaint.The case comes amid a wider government crackdown on what prosecutors have called the professionalisation of insider trading on Wall Street. Elite firms, including McKinsey & Co, the management consulting group, have been shaken in recent months as former executives and employees have been swept up in insider trading cases.Among the deals Mr Kluger and Mr Bauer were accused of trading in advance of an announcement were Oracle’s acquisition of Sun Microsystems and Adobe’s successful bid for Omniture. The illegal trading dated back as far as Johnson & Johnson’s acquisition of Neutrogena in 1994 and IBM’s bid for Lotus in 1995, the complaint said.Mr Kruger and his cohorts allegedly invested more than $109m during his five years at Wilson Sonsini. Their profits ranged from nearly $200,000 from the merger of HP-3Com to nearly $11.4m from the Oracle-Sun deal. Mr Bauer spent more than $7m of his share of the proceeds on a condo on New York’s Upper East Side and a home in Boca Raton, Florida, according to prosecutors.The trio went to lengths to conceal the scheme, using pay phones and “throwaway” prepaid cellular phones to discuss the trades, the complaint said.They learnt last month they were under investigation by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service, prompting Mr Bauer to tell the third co-conspirator to burn $175,000 in cash from a recent trade, according to transcripts of telephone conversations included in the complaint.Mr Kluger and Mr Bauer were charged with 17 counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy to commit insider trading, conspiracy to commit money laundering and obstruction of justice. The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed a civil complaint.Lawyers for Mr Kluger and Mr Bauer were unable to be reached for comment.“We were shocked to learn of the conduct the government has alleged a former employee committed against us and two other prominent law firms”, said Courtney Dorman, a spokeswoman for Wilson Sonsini. “We have provided our full support to the federal investigation and will continue to do so.”Mr Kluger was arrested at his home in Virginia and Mr Bauer was arrested at his home in New York on Wednesday morning, according to Rebekah Carmichael, a spokeswoman for Paul Fishman, US attorney for New Jersey.Additional reporting by Kara Scannell in New York
424;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-04-05T00:21:24Z;Nasdaq sets date for alpha options launch;;Nasdaq OMX is to launch a new type of options contracts this month that will allow investors to take a position on the performance of popular individual stocks relative to the wider market.The “alpha index” options, which are being launched on April 18, measure the outperformance or underperformance of individual stocks versus the general market and converts the difference into an index value.Nasdaq is hoping to attract interest in the product from both retail and institutional investors, which currently trade an over-the-counter version of the contract, or construct a similar position by buying combinations of listed options.Nasdaq OMX, which operates two of the US’s nine options-trading platforms, sees alpha contracts as one way to gain market share in the fiercely competitive US options market.“This gives you the value of Apple, for example, as Apple, as opposed to the value of Apple as the rest of the market moves around,” explained Eric Noll, executive vice-president of transaction services at Nasdaq OMX.“It will allow you to make an investment decision unrelated to the overall market,” Mr Noll said. “If my stock goes down 10 per cent and the overall market goes down 15 per cent, I’d still lose money. But with this product I would make money. Of course, the reverse is true – the stock could rise slower than the overall market.”Robert Whaley, a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who designed the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s widely watched Volatility Index or “Vix”, is one of the new creators of the new contract.The idea received regulatory approval last year and will launch based on the performance of 19 individual stocks – including Apple, Cisco, GE, Oracle, Google and Amazon – relative to the S&P 500 index.Mr Noll said the product could also be expanded to the performance of oil and gold relative to the S&P 500, while Mr Whaley has suggested it could also be used to track Treasury bonds and emerging market indices against the S&P 500, or individual stocks against their sector’s exchange-traded funds.Susquehanna, International Group, Wolverine and Citadel have agreed to be market makers for alpha options.
425;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-04-04T18:54:23Z;Google bids $900m for Nortel patents;;Google has sought to bolster its weak position in the smartphone industry’s patent wars, bidding $900m for a stack of patents put up for sale by Nortel, the bankrupt Canadian communications equipment maker.The bid, announced on Monday, comes as the search company, along with handset makers and others that use its Android mobile operating system, find themselves beset by lawsuits over the software.Companies including Oracle, Microsoft and Apple have taken aim at Android as it has risen to become the most widely-used software on touchscreen handsets, potentially slowing its adoption and raising the spectre of high licensing fees for hardware makers.Bulking up on its patent holdings would give Google a stronger defence against such attacks, software industry experts said.In part, that is because it would leave it with a war chest of its own intellectual property to counter-sue aggressors.“[Google’s] patent portfolio is too weak for what they have undertaken with Android,” Florian Mueller, an open source software advocate, said.“If you’re going to make a foray into such a litigious area of business, you’d better have an arsenal.”Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, said in a blog post that one of the best defences against legal attack “is (ironically) to have a formidable patent portfolio, as this helps maintain your freedom to develop new products and services.”While not referring directly to smartphones, he warned of an “explosion of litigation, often involving low-quality software patents, which threatens to stifle innovation”. The Nortel intellectual property, which has been on the block since the middle of last year, covers around 6,000 patents and patent applications in a range of communications technologies. These span optical networking, voice and semiconductors as well as the wireless and data networking areas that are closer to Google’s business.Google said its offer was a “stalking horse” bid that would be used by Nortel as a base to try to elicit other offers.With the price tag already approaching $1bn, few others would be able to bid against Google, said Eric Goldman, an associate law professor at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley. Apple, which has been reported in the past to have an interest in the patents, was one of the few that could compete, he added.Mr Walker blamed Google’s weak IP holdings, which amount to some 600 patents in the US, to its young age as a company. By contrast, Microsoft, which embarked on a concerted campaign to boost its IP portfolio early last decade, has more than 17,000.If Google did not buy the patents, they could well end up “with a competitor, or in the hands of trolls who are going to go out and start trouble”, Mr Goldman said – a reference to buyers who acquire patents purely to start legal actions.
426;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-31T23:43:47Z;Yahoo’s Bartz slips in employees’ eyes;;An unscientific survey of employees at major US technology companies found that only 50 per cent of Yahoo workers approved of chief executive Carol Bartz’ leadership during the past year, down from 77 per cent as she got started.That was the most remarkable change in the views among visitors to a Silicon Valley jobs site, Glassdoor.com, which entices employees to anonymously evaluate their companies and provide salary information in exchange for greater site access.The second-biggest drop in CEO popularity wasn’t nearly as severe, with Microsoft leader Steve Ballmer falling 6 percentage points. But he ended up with a lower rating than Ms. Bartz, with just 40 per cent backing, the worst in the group.Glassdoor said it averaged CEO ratings from at least 65 self-identified employees per company, but since many drawn to its site are looking for work, participants could easily be more negative than the norm.Still, not everyone hates the boss. Google’s Eric Schmidt, who is leaving his post tomorrow, racked up 96 per cent approval. That is up 3 percentage points from a year earlier and puts him at the head of the pack, eclipsing even Apple’s Steve Jobs (down 3 points to 95 per cent.)CEO approval is related to how well employees rate their company overall, but is not the only factor. Google had the most satisfied rank and file, followed by a three-way tie among Apple, Adobe and Intel.The least impressed with their own company were at Dell, eBay and Oracle. The full poll will be on Glassdoor tomorrow.inside a dozen firms during the
427;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-29T15:13:49Z;Climate change agenda;;Energy management and information are complementary technologies which, applied collaboratively, can make a huge contribution to the planet’s carbon economy.There are concerns, however, that despite this potential to deal with the problems of global warming, sufficient momentum has yet to be created to make a real difference. And this despite powerful political pressure for change, linked to the low-carbon agenda.There are three elements to the equation. First, the need to overhaul and modernise the generation, distribution and pricing of energy – the introduction of the “smart grid”.Second, the need for organisations worldwide to manage and control their energy requirements through improved information and communication technologies.The downside here, according to a survey by the consultancy IFS, is that environmental monitoring is not popular with companies – almost two-thirds of those canvassed would only invest in monitoring equipment if required to do so by law or if it helped to sell their products or services.Third, the IT industry itself, which contributes some 2 to 3 per cent of greenhouse emissions annually, has an obligation to put its own house in order.This latter issue has led to some interesting innovations: one data centre in Switzerland is cooled by water from a nearby lake.The commercial potential of developing intelligent energy management has not been lost on the IT industry: companies including IBM, Xerox and software suppliers such as SAP, Oracle and Cisco have been to the fore in announcing products that promise sustainability and climate change management.The IT industry as a whole, however, is still “immature” in its offerings according to an analysis of some 19 vendors published last year by WWF Sweden, the conservation organisation, and the Gartner group.It found that BT, IBM, Cisco, Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu and SAP were “leaders in integrating sustainability into ICT”.This was based on their commitment to managing environmental issues in their operations and supply chains, together with what they were doing to advance low-carbon products and services and develop products to reduce emissions.But, according to Dennis Pamlin, an independent consultant working for WWF Sweden, “We were surprised at the lack of disruptive innovation with the majority of responses essentially focused on incremental client-driven developments. If the ICT industry is to deliver on its promise of making a significant contribution to enabling a transformation to a low-carbon economy, it is going to contribute substantially more than marginal incrementalism.”Fujitsu, for example, was the only company with a carbon reduction goal based on its customers’ emissions rather than just its own.This disillusionment is shared by Lyndon Hedderly, a partner with Centrix Consulting.“IT is contributing to a more sustainable world, but the question arises as to how the large software companies are helping reduce carbon emissions. The answer is disappointing.“While most companies have the usual internal targets, their software products do little to reduce CO2 emissions.“Where reduction claims are made, it is usually a reference to virtualisation or a marketing angle giving an existing product a sustainable spin …If IT is to increase its role in managing energy, the big software companies need to innovate”.Nevertheless, there has been enough activity for green technology bloggers to wonder whether enterprise energy management has become “the new customer relationship management”.Start-ups developing and delivering this kind of software include Hara Software, C3 and ENXSuite.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies such as SAP are buying in expertise – it recently acquired Clear Standards, a privately held provider of carbon management tools.Richard Scott, head of carbon consultancy for the Sustainable Energy group at Eon, the UK power and gas group, says the IT sector is playing a big role in shaping the way organisations manage and report sustainability.“Partnerships between the renewable energy and IT sectors are now vital, as the combined knowledge is shown to produce solutions that help achieve energy efficiency goals while being cost-effective.“The best carbon accounting software adds considerable value to the process, bringing the ability to mine, capture and analyse energy use and carbon emissions data at a granular level.”Liz Parminter, energy specialist with PA Consulting, argues that the world is at a tipping point for lowering carbon emissions and that there is a need to bring several industries together to generate changes.“In the past in the electricity industry, we have thought about it from a network perspective. Now, we have to involve the automotive industries, manufacturing industries, white goods, networks companies and communications groups.”International standards – say for charging electric vehicles – will have to be agreed, people’s demands for power will have to be monitored, 40-year-old distribution infrastructure will have to be updated.Even with the best will in the world, it could be 15 to 20 years before the planet benefits fully from the marriage of energy and the information technologies.…………………………………………..Smart grids: Pilot projects assess consumer preferences and the best ways of improving power deliveryThere are a number of ways to define smart grids.To some, the term simply means smart metering – the use of computer and communications technology to measure the consumption of electricity better.Energy professionals, however, prefer a broader definition. The European Union Technology Platform’s is as good as any: “Electricity networks that can intelligently integrate the behaviour and actions of all users connected to it – generators, consumers and those that do both – in order to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies”.Smart grids, therefore imply the addition of computer intelligence to the generation of electricity, its storage, transmission and distribution, together with its consumption by, for example, electric vehicles.Smart metering, on the other hand, is based on consumer demand and can be used, along with differential pricing, to persuade customers to reduce power use.By the EU’s definition smart grids do not exist anywhere yet, although elements of the technology are being tested in a number of countries and cities. Liz Parminter, energy specialist with PA Consulting, says: “Smart grids are the future rather than something that is here and now”.There are, however, a number of high-visibility trials in progress. In Boulder, Colorado, for example, the mid-Western utility Xcel Energy has created SmartGridCity, a pilot to help the company understand which energy management tools its customers prefer and which technologies are best at improving the way power is delivered.The company has installed some 23,000 automated smart meters across the city.Singapore’s Energy Market Authority has been operating a pilot smart grid since the end of 2009 to address the problems of unexpected power outages and the intermittent nature of some renewable energy sources such as wind and wave power.The pilot involved the installation of smart meters allowing homeowners to see how much power they are using minute by minute. It also envisages that electric vehicles could be used as a distributed storage system, which could be tapped into at peak periods.These pilots and others, such as the Duke Energy Envision Centre in Erlanger, Kentucky, a demonstration smart-grid-equipped “home” built by Duke Energy, the power company, with the consultancy Kema, are proving the case for the intelligent management of energy provision.There are questions yet to be answered: what measures, for example, must be taken to protect communications systems against hackers, but governments and the energy industry are enthusiastic about smart grids and the need to improve energy efficiency is on their side.

429;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-25T20:44:00Z;Stocks rally for seventh session;Renewed optimism about global recovery;Friday 20.30 GMT. Hopes that the global economic recovery is sufficiently robust to see off a combination of Japan’s travails, Mideast unrest and eurozone fiscal woes is delivering another positive day for many riskier assets.The FTSE All-World equity index has retreated from early gains but is up 0.1 per cent, the seventh day in a row that the global benchmark has recorded gains, leaving it 4.9 per cent above last week’s post-Japan earthquake low and 2.2 per cent below February’s cyclical high.Developed and emerging market equities have recorded their best weekly performance since late last year.The S&P 500 on Wall Street has closed up 0.3 per cent, with a better than expected final reading of fourth-quarter US GDP cancelling out a slightly disappointing March University of Michigan consumer optimism index.Overall sentiment is being bolstered by signs of continuing improvement in US labour markets and as corporate earnings underpin valuations. Oracle is the latest technology group to deliver solid profits and an upbeat outlook, illustrating its confidence by sharply increasing its dividend.Meanwhile, some gauges that signal optimism over the global economy are stuck on green. The Aussie dollar, a so-called commodity currency, has hit a fresh 29-year high versus its US namesake of $1.0294.Investors seem happy to absorb the possibility of a bail-out for Portugal and signs of ruction within the eurozone as Germany secures an agreement to reduce the initial contributions to the bloc’s €500bn rescue fund. Another downgrade of Portugal’s credit rating by Standard & Poor’s has barely caused a flicker.Likewise, the ongoing problems at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan and worsening unrest in the Middle East and north Africa appear to have been discounted by battle-scarred traders.Europe – Bourses opened with decent gains, tracking Wall Street’s rally overnight and after a wobble midday, are strengthening into the close. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is up 0.2 per cent and London's FTSE 100 is higher by 0.3 per cent as financials continue their recovery. News that German business sentiment fell less than expected in March is lending support to stocks.Lisbon’s PSI is a fraction lower, with investors seemingly not fussed about political turmoil or the prospect of a bail-out, particularly as the latter may draw a line under the current uncertainty.Asia-Pacific – Shares rose for a fourth day this week on Friday amid renewed optimism about the global economic recovery and strong corporate earnings.The FTSE Asia Pacific index added 0.7 per cent with Japan’s Nikkei 225 average gaining 1.1 per cent despite the slow progress in containing radiation from the stricken nuclear power plant in Fukushima. Tokyo was buoyed by technology plays, which surged in line with their US peers. Meanwhile, Toyota Motor advanced 1.9 per cent on news that it would restart some suspended production in Japan on Monday.In Seoul, chipmakers advanced on foreign buying after recent losses, helping the Kospi rise 0.9 per cent, while in Sydney banks and resource stocks gained ground with Woodside Petroleum 2.5 per cent firmer on speculation about Royal Dutch Shell’s 24 per cent stake in the group. The S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.9 per cent, its sixth consecutive gain.In Hong Kong, robust bank earnings pushed the Hang Seng up 1.1 per cent. Bank of China jumped 2.6 per cent after reporting a 29 per cent rise in 2010 net profit. Financials were also one of the main drivers behind a 1.1 per cent advance for the Shanghai Composite. India’s Sensex has jumped 2.5 per cent to a two-month high. Buyers returned after the index heavily lagged behind the global market since the start of the year on inflation concerns.Forex – The euro was earlier showing little sign of being overly perturbed by the possibility of a Portugal bail-out – after all, traders have been here before, with Greece and Ireland – but has retreated steadily in New York trading. The single currency is down 0.7 to $1.4079 and off 0.2 per cent versus the yen at Y114.52.The yen has broken above the Y81 level as investors remain reluctant to challenge the G7 central banks’ commitment to intervene and start to feel the path of least resistance is for the Japanese unit to weaken. The yen is off 0.6 per cent versus the dollar Y81.42. The Canadian dollar fell 0.7 per cent to C$0.9816 after the minority government lost a motion of no confidence.Commodities – Gold has reversed early gains and is down 0.2 per cent at $1,428 an ounce, and that follows a swift $20 sell-off late on Thursday. The bullion had hit a new intraday record of $1,447 when profit-taking kicked in.This looked to be exacerbated by a sharp drop in silver after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange raised margins to trade silver futures, a move that tends to briefly spook the contract in question. Silver, which had traded at a fresh 30-year high of $38.13 an ounce dropped below $37 on Thursday, but is now back to $37.21, up 0.2 per cent for the session.Action elsewhere in the complex is mixed. Copper is up 0.2 per cent to $4.43 a pound after Chinese inventories dipped for the first week in three, according to Bloomberg, while Nymex crude is down 0.1 per cent to $105.50 a barrel.Rates – Benchmark Treasuries are being hit by selling as the session has progressed, with sentiment bruised in part by a record week of US investment grade debt sales at higher yields over government securities. The US 10-year yield is up 4 basis points at 3.44 per cent, though the equivalent Bund at 3.27 per cent, is up 1 basis point.Benchmark bond yields for Ireland and Portugal remain at or near record highs, while the cost of insuring peripheral eurozone debt against default, as measured by credit default swaps, are mixed but are also near peak levels.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul and Michael Mackenzie in New York
430;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-25T20:40:04Z;Daimler and BMW motor ahead in Europe;;European equities finished a week of strong trading positively, as investors’ bullishness on economic growth overcame concerns about Japan and Libya.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 3.3 per cent to 1,124.65 over the week, including a 0.1 per cent gain on Friday.Cyclical stocks performed well with the FTSE Eurofirst construction and materials index rising 5.1 per cent to 1,525.38 over the five days and the general industry sub-index up 3.8 per cent to 2,667.67.Carmakers had a volatile week, gaining ground as they were lifted by increasing optimism about growth but damped by concerns that the Japanese crisis would disrupt their supply chains.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 auto and parts sub-index gained 4.7 per cent to 1,137.14 during the week. In Germany, Daimler rose 6.7 per cent to €49 and BMW was up 3.9 per cent to €57.46.Banks closed the week ahead as eurozone ministers continued to make progress on structuring a bail-out mechanism acceptable to Germany, as well as nations with weaker credit, including Spain and Italy.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 banking sub-index gained 2.5 per cent to 552.13 for the week, though fell 0.5 per cent in Friday trading. Deutsche Bank analysts found that sentiment towards financial stocks in Europe had improved strongly throughout February – investors are the least underweight in financials for two years.“The sector is no longer among the most disliked sectors in Europe,” the analysts said.For the week, Commerzbank in Germany gained 1.2 per cent to €5.76 while Banco Santander in Spain gained 2.7 per cent per cent to €8.52.The Lisbon equity market proved a counterpoint to the country’s debt markets as stocks closed the week down only slightly, even as a political crisis and the spectre of a bail-out drove the cost of Portugal’s short-term borrowing to euro-era highs.The main Portuguese index closed down 0.1 per cent at 7,854.18 for the week. Nuno Serafim, an analyst with IG Markets in Lisbon, said that the withdrawal of investors from the market was being tempered by the fact that they had largely priced in the chances of the bail-out.Yet Portugal’s banks dragged down the market on Friday as their liquidity problems were seen to deepen after rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded the nation’s debt.Espirito Santo, Portugal’s biggest bank by market capitalisation, fell 1.9 per cent to €3.07 and Banco BPI fell 0.3 per cent to €1.30.Also on Friday, Edison, the energy group, jumped 4.5 per cent to €0.78 after the Italian media reported that it was discussing a plan with Enel, the Italian utility, under which Enel would buy some assets from Edison if it were unable to resolve restructuring talks with its largest shareholders.Enel retreated 0.8 per cent to €4.27.
431;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-25T20:35:51Z;Tech stocks help Wall Street to extend gains;;Oracle ticked higher after delivering solid profit and an upbeat outlook, helping to boost the technology sector and lift sentiment surrounding US stocks.The software maker reported a 37 per cent jump in revenues and a 78 per cent upturn in earnings for the third quarter, sending its shares up 1.6 per cent to $32.64. Oracle also issued a forecast for its current quarter ahead of most estimates and raised its dividend 20 per cent.Related stocks received a boost. IBM was up 1.3 per cent to $162.18 while Teradata added 1.5 per cent to $51.41. The S&P computer services index climbed by 1.1 per cent.But it was not all good news in the tech sector. Research In Motion, the maker of BlackBerry smartphones, was down 11.2 per cent to $56.89 after current-quarter guidance fell short of analysts’ expectations.RIM said the disappointing guidance in part reflected the cost of developing the BlackBerry Playbook, its answer to Apple’s iPad tablet.Shares in Apple were up 1.9 per cent to $351.54.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 index closed up 0.3 per cent to 1,313.79, bringing the total gain for the week to 2.7 per cent. Traders again seemed more focused on optimism about domestic economic recovery than concerns over uncertainty in Japan, Libya or Portugal.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,220.21 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,743.06. The indices were up 3.1 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, over the week.Helping to lift sentiment on Friday was news that the US economy had grown faster than previously thought at the end of last year. The fourth-quarter gross domestic product for the US was revised up from an annual rate of 2.8 per cent to a more healthy 3.1 per cent.Elsewhere in the markets, Accenture climbed higher after the consulting firm raised its full-year outlook and reported a 22 per cent jump in its second-quarter earnings. Shares in the group rose 4.6 per cent to $54.33.Wall Street began the week in recovery mode. The first three days of last week had seen sharp losses on the S&P after the disaster in Japan. But the index then began to recover as worries about the financial impact of the disaster on US companies subsided and the 1.5 per cent gains on Monday were a continuation of that rebound recovery. By Tuesday, the index was back to where it had been before the earthquake hit.The markets paused for breath midweek before allowing optimism to gain sway. As the week went on, traders turned their attention away from global pressures and focused more on the strengthening domestic economy.On Thursday data showed that the number of people in the US taking jobless benefits had fallen by 5,000 to 382,000 the previous week. The four-week average of claims fell to its lowest point since July 2008.“The growing strength in the US economy looks like it is finally starting to show up in the jobs market and this has been lifting sentiment on Wall Street,” said Dick Del Bello, a senior partner at Conifer Group.The S&P 500 has put on 1.4 per cent since the disaster in Japan, though it is still 2.2 per cent lower than before the eruption of conflict in north Africa and the Middle East in the middle of February. The Vix index, a measure of market volatility, was down 27.1 per cent over the week but was still up 8.5 per cent since before the tensions surfaced in the Middle EastAmong those stocks in focus over the past five days was AT&T, which announced it was buying T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39bn in a deal that would create the largest wireless carrier in the US. The stock was up 3.3 per cent over the week to $28.85.Its rival Sprint Nextel, which had also been in talks with Deutsche Telekom to merge with T-Mobile, tumbled 7.1 per cent to $4.69 over the week and was the worst performing stock on the S&P over the period. Overall, the telecoms sector added 2.2 per cent.Technology stocks saw gains after strong earnings results from a number of key industry players.Red Hat, the developer of open source software, was up 18.5 per cent to $46.34 while Micron Technology, the chipmaker, added 14.7 per cent to $11.55 over the week. Oracle was up 6.1 per cent to $32.64.Bank of America was in focus following news that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its planned dividend increase. The stock was down 4.5 per cent to $13.34 over the week. The sector, however, was up 0.8 per cent over the week.

433;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
434;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-24T23:50:34Z;Sun finally shines under Oracle;;In its last full year as an independent company, Sun Microsystems suffered an operating loss of $775m. Now, less than two years later, Oracle says it’s well on the way to making a $1.5bn profit from the same businesses.So did Sun shareholders make a big mistake in selling out too soon, or has Oracle really pulled off an overhaul in record time?A bit of both, to judge from Oracle’s latest earnings.Never ones to miss the chance to brag (or to put down a rival), Oracle executives couldn’t resist comparing the Sun purchase to the sky-high price that HP paid in its acquisition of 3Par last year: had it paid a similar earnings multiple, buying Sun would have cost Oracle more than $100bn. But net of cash, the Sun deal only cost $5.7bn, so this is starting to look like a steal.Oracle has lifted the gross margin on Sun’s hardware business to 55 per cent, according to Safra Catz, an Oracle president. That compares with the overall 41 per cent margin that Sun made in its final year. Besides cutting costs in the supply chain, Oracle’s main contribution to the Sun business has been to end many of the low-margin resale agreements it had with other hardware makers, she said.HP CEO (and now Oracle president) Mark Hurd, who was also speaking as Oracle announced its results on Thursday, added that part of the turnaround simply reflects the removal of the customer doubts that hung over Sun’s long-term viability while it was an independent business.But Sun’s final year was clouded by the financial crisis, which (given its heavy dependence on sales to Wall Street) hit the company hard. The year before, Sun had notched up a 47 per cent gross margin, and had shown steady improvements since the middle of the decade. With the market crisis over, Sun would probably have seen a sharper rebound than many.Oracle doesn’t plan to stop here, though. Ms Catz, never one to duck a challenge, had this to say about future margin improvements in hardware:It’s becoming clear that we’re going to ultimately bring the margins very close, if not [actually] to, where they were when we were just a software business… We don’t see it topping out yet, or even close.There’s some way to go. Due to the profit dilution from hardware (which only accounts for a fifth of its revenues), Oracle’s pro-forma operating margin has dropped to 44 per cent, from 49 per cent in the quarter before the Sun deal. If Oracle’s management really can claw their way back, it will provide strong evidence that the company’s amazing takeover machine is still firing on all cylinders.
435;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-24T23:46:59Z;Oracle earnings beat expectations;;Oracle, the US software maker, claimed market share gains from rival SAP on Thursday as it reported quarterly earnings that showed a further rebound from the economic downturn.A better than expected 29 per cent rise in revenue from new software licences pushed the company’s earnings well above its own and Wall Street forecasts.Oracle issued a forecast for its current quarter ahead of most estimates and raised its dividend by 20 per cent. The company’s shares climbed 3 per cent in after-market trading, having already risen more than 2 per cent earlier in the day.Safra Catz, one of two Oracle presidents, would not attribute the group’s success to a broader recovery in IT spending, claiming it reflected the success of a wave of Oracle software products and the successful integration of Sun Microsystems, which it acquired early last year.In applications software, where Oracle competes most directly in SAP, new licence revenue grew by 31 per cent, to $639m, after stripping out the effect of currency movements.With revenues up more than 50 per cent in the past two years, Oracle’s applications business had grown 10 times faster than that of SAP, Ms Catz claimed, though the German company produced surprisingly strong software sales in its most recent quarter.Spending on applications is usually closely tied to economic recovery, as companies look to expand their operations or move into new markets, and the Oracle president said the company had seen a solid recovery take hold last year.New software sales in the group’s database business grew by 26 per cent at constant currencies, to $1.58bn.Oracle said it was on the way to its target of generating $1.5bn in operating profits from the Sun business by the end of its fiscal year in May.Oracle reported a 37 per cent increase in revenues to $8.8bn, with net income rising 78 per cent to $2.1bn, or 41 cents a share. On the pro forma basis that Wall Street assesses the company, earnings reached 54 cents a share.
436;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;The latest corporate technology news;;Lawson Software set to be bought by rival InforHunter turns prey. Lawson Software, a mid-range enterprise software vendor, looks set to be acquired by bigger US rival Infor for $1.8bn in cash. The unsolicited bid, if successful, would create the industry’s third-largest enterprise software player behind Oracle and SAP, and the largest vendor focused on mid-market companies. It also marks the end-game in the decade-long consolidation of the mid-range enterprise software industry. The advent of cloud computing means that the industry’s traditional business model is coming under threat. Mid-range vendors with mature products and a heavy dependence on maintenance revenues have most to lose from this fundamental shift. Lawson denies that it has been slow to react to the changing landscape. Its 2005 acquisition of Swedish rival Intentia helped transform the company and last year it belatedly tried to jump aboard the cloud bandwagon with the launch of Lawson Cloud Services on Amazon’s EC2 cloud infrastructure. But analysts describe it as a defensive move that falls short of a true software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering. Infor also has a cloud strategy but it is based on Microsoft’s Azure platform. Infor seems much better placed to weather the current storm. It is a private company unlike Nasdaq-listed Lawson, which has activist investor Carl Icahn on its shareholder register. Infor also has a dependable if unimaginative business model that consists of buying up the mature product lines of one-time competitors and milking their customer base for maintenance revenues. This is what it intends to do with Lawson’s 4,500 customers and given Infor’s record, the execution risk seems minimal. Lawson shareholders no doubt hope Infor’s unsolicited approach will flush out a higher rival bid. A few years ago a counter-offer from Oracle would have been almost certain. But these days, enterprise software is increasingly seen as a mature, low-growth sector and even Oracle will think twice before overpaying.Browsium offers solutions for running legacy software on ageing IE6Microsoft boasts that the forthcoming Internet Explorer 9 is its best browser yet. But what happens if your business runs applications that only work with Microsoft’s decade-old Internet Explorer 6? US start-up Browsium has the answer. Its UniBrows software runs these “legacy” applications in a tab on Internet Explorer 8 — and on IE9 when it gets officially released. Many businesses have old custom-built web applications that were developed for IE6 either by in-house staff or by third parties who are no longer in business. To convert them to work with newer browsers would be both costly and time-consuming, and so businesses take the easy way out and keep using IE6. But IE6 does not run on Windows 7 and so companies that stay on IE6 are obliged to keep running the ageing Windows XP operating system, even though Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows XP in 2009. This problem has been known for some time and while there are ways to support the IE6 browser on Windows 7 — Symantec offers a virtualisation product, for example — Browsium’s solution seems a lot simpler. But it is also expensive, with a $5,000 base licence fee plus $5 for each PC that uses the product. IE6 currently has an 11 per cent share of the browser market, down from 18 per cent a year ago, according to web analytics firm Net Applications. IE8 has a 35 per cent share.Pentaho launches latest version of BI softwareUS software company Pentaho has announced the latest version of its open-source business intelligence software, Pentaho BI Suite 3.8. One of the new features is interactive dashboards, which allow dynamic filtering of the data displayed in the pie-charts and other widgets embedded in a dashboard. Pentaho has also added in-memory data caching, which improves performance when working with large paginated reports. The company argues that the new features in this latest release reduce the functionality gap between commercial open-source and proprietary BI products. Its enterprise-focused BI Suite is not free but Pentaho claims it can reduce licence costs by about 90 per cent when compared to a proprietary BI product.
437;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-23T18:17:03Z;Oracle ends all Itanium development;;File this one under “Oracle takes another dig at HP” or “Oracle kicks Intel when it’s already down”.In a statement overnight, the database company said it had decided to stop all software development for the Intel Itanium microprocessor, where HP is one of the few server makers still supporting the chip.Oracle said it had taken its decision “after multiple conversations with Intel senior management”.“Intel management made it clear that their strategic focus is on their x86 microprocessor and that Itanium was nearing the end of its life.”Intel disputes that last part. In a statement, Paul Otellini, chief executive, said:“Intel’s work on Intel Itanium processors and platforms continues unabated with multiple generations of chips currently in development and on schedule.”“We remain firmly committed to delivering a competitive, multi-generational road map for HP-UX and other operating system customers that run the Itanium architecture.”Apart from HP, Supermicro in the US, Bull in Europe, NEC and Hitachi in Japan and Inspur in China are the other manufacturers still making Itanium-based servers.However, Itanium has seemed like a dead chip walking for many years, despite the semiconductor giant insisting it has a niche market in high-end computing.Its own x86 microprocessor server chips and those of rivals have advanced enough to fill nearly all of the market segments that Itanium was originally aimed at when it began as a joint venture between Intel and HP in 1994 to create a new 64-bit chip architecture.As Oracle pointed out, both Microsoft and RedHat have already stopped developing software for Itanium and, here comes the dig, “HP CEO Leo Apotheker made no mention of Itanium in his long and detailed presentation on the future strategic direction of HP.”Oracle chief Larry Ellison has seized every opportunity to have a go at Mr Apotheker, who is the former chief executive of Oracle’s bitter rival SAP. They are rivals once again, with Oracle having bought Sun Microsystems, whose Sparc processors and servers compete with HP’s.Oracle does say it will continue to provide customers with support for existing versions of Oracle software products that already run on Itanium.So, on second thoughts, file this under “Move along now, nothing really to see here”.UPDATE: Except for this statement from HP, hitting back at Oracle:“Oracle continues to show a pattern of anti-customer behaviour as they move to shore up their failing Sun server business,” said Dave Donatelli, executive vice president and general manager, Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking, HP.“We are shocked that Oracle would put enterprises and governments at risk while costing them hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity in a shameless gambit to limit fair competition.”UPDATE 2: The war of words continues with Oracle hitting back:“Plans to replace Itanium with X86 are already in place. HP is knowingly withholding this information from our joint Itanium customers,” it says in another statement.Although its target is HP, this is also tantamount to calling Intel’s chief executive a big fibber. Watch this space.
438;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-13T20:42:10Z;HP chief faces Wall St scrutiny;;Léo Apotheker, Hewlett-Packard’s chief executive, will on Monday try to convince restive investors in the world’s top-selling technology company that he can push deeper into more profitable businesses and limit the damage from disappointing sales of personal computers.In his first meeting with Wall Street professionals, Mr Apotheker is set to present an overall vision that calls for HP to keep its major position in computing hardware and add more profitable software to the mix while tying both to profitable services.The session will be a coming-out party for the former head of business software maker SAP. Mr Apotheker has kept a low profile during his four months atop HP, spending time travelling the company’s far-flung empire and meeting big customers.Nevertheless, his performance will be critical. Mark Hurd, Mr Apotheker’s predecessor, was well regarded by Wall Street for cutting costs at HP even as he made big bets on new business with acquisitions of services group EDS, networking concern 3Com and smartphone pioneer Palm.“The company needs to lay out strategically where they want to take the business,” said Daniel Flax, the HP analyst at investment firm T Rowe Price, which is one of HP’s 20 largest stockholders. “They need to lay out what the margin and earnings potential of the company is.”Mr Hurd was forced out last year after a sex harassment probe led the board to conclude that his expense reports concealed a personal relationship with a marketing functionary and to lose trust in him. He has since joined as a top officer at Oracle, which had already deepened its rivalry with HP by buying high-end computing specialist Sun Microsystems.Mr Apotheker has implicitly criticised Mr Hurd’s tenure, opining in one interview that the company had “lost its soul”.Mr Apotheker has his work cut out for him. HP is now so large, with $126bn in annual revenue, that massive change would be difficult in the extreme. And as it has moved into new areas, it is facing entrenched competitors. Joining a list that already included IBM and Dell in services and computing gear and Oracle in high-end software and machines are Apple in tablets and Cisco Systems in networking.Mr Apotheker has suggested he wants to start by doing more with what he has, yoking together an enlarged sales force to make sure that the former EDS consultants tout HP products and that HP hardware ships with HP software. He also plans to continue making acquisitions, especially where he can use his knowledge of the software industry.But investors want to hear more than that, especially because HP’s first quarter entirely under Mr Apotheker ended in disappointment. HP shares fell as much as 12 per cent in a day last month after it missed the revenue targets for its first fiscal quarter and slashed sales expectations for the full year by $2bn.On the earnings call, Mr Apotheker blamed two temporary problems: a 12 per cent drop on consumer PC revenue as notebook PC demand slumped, especially in China, and a shortfall in short-term services contracts. But it would help Mr Apotheker’s cause if he could do more to convince investors that the Microsoft-based PC, already a low-margin item, is not being ushered into permanent decline by tablets and smartphones – or that if it is, the WebOS operating system HP bought with Palm is the perfect hedge.
439;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-03-08T17:33:03Z;The latest corporate technology news;;Salesforce.com launches Service Cloud 3Salesforce.com has launched Service Cloud 3 to help organisations respond to the customer service challenges posed by social media. This update to its cloud-based customer service offering lets companies manage customer interactions with their Facebook fan page, converting the comments posted there into cases which can then be managed as if they came via traditional channels. Service Cloud 3 also lets customer service agents join in on conversations that affect their company on Twitter. Salesforce.com emphasises that the real-time nature of social media requires that companies respond in equally rapid manner to issues or complaints that surface on Twitter or Facebook. However, customer service is a notoriously difficult area to automate and some organisations could be reluctant to switch agents from “front-line” customer support functions to spend their days answering tweets. Nevertheless, Salesforce.com argues that many customers now expect this type of “social customer service”. It says 15,000 companies have signed up for Service Cloud, and an independent survey that found that many of them have boosted agent productivity and obtained other benefitsNetSuite’s cloud-based ERP package to help subsidiariesNetSuite, specialist in cloud-based business software, is offering large enterprises the best of both worlds. They can run traditional enterprise resource planning (ERP) software back at head office and deploy NetSuite’s cloud-based alternative to their divisions or subsidiaries. Many multinationals and large enterprises have tried to standardise on a single ERP package from the likes of SAP or Oracle. But cost and resource constraints mean that it can often take years to fully deploy the new software to all divisions and foreign subsidiaries. So deployments often stall once the most important divisions are running the new software. NetSuite argues that smaller offices need no longer be left out in the cold. Thanks to a deal with data integration specialist Informatica, NetSuite makes it possible for the ERP systems running at head office to exchange transactional data with regional offices running NetSuite’s OneWorld cloud-based ERP package. This type of “two-tiered” ERP implementation is not a new idea, but NetSuite argues its approach, which involves pairing cloud services with enhanced integration, makes the concept more workable.V3 pitches virtual PCs to businesses with limited IT budgetsDesktop virtualisation just got interesting, particularly if you are a business with a limited IT budget. US start-up V3 Systems has unveiled a Virtual Desktop Accelerator that supports up to 300 “virtualised” desktop clients — which can replace a traditional PC for most users — at an annual cost of just $200 for each desktop. For comparison, a traditional desktop PC gobbles $2,400 a year from your opex budget, while rival desktop virtualisation solutions cost around $1,800 a year to run, according to V3 Systems. The relatively modest difference in opex between a full-blown PC and a conventional virtualised desktops has been a big stumbling block for advocates of the virtualised desktop approach, which seeks to save money on hardware and software costs. V3 Systems argues its VDA device dramatically reduces running costs and, in addition, requires half the capex of rival virtualisation offerings. The idea behind desktop virtualisation is to shift the “heavy lifting” back to a central server, so allowing businesses to swap their PCs for cheaper “thin client” devices that consist of little more than a screen and a keyboard. The devil is in the detail, however, and die-hard PC fans argue that virtualised desktop devices offer inferior performance — an accusation V3 refutes. Gartner predicts that by 2012, 50m desktop PCs will be virtualised, or around 10 per cent of the desktop PC market.Egnyte offers solutions for enterprises wanting to use iPadsEgnyte solves the enterprise iPad dilemma. Many enterprises would like to use iPads, but they are worried about the security and IT management issues. Apple’s trendy tablet computer was conceived primarily as a consumer device and firms such as Silicon Valley-based Egnyte are rushing to address the shortcomings when using the iPad for enterprise computing. The Egnyte Enterprise for iPad app offers 256-bit encryption of data travelling to and from the iPad, and other “enterprise-class” security features designed to help IT security managers sleep at night. Egnyte is one of the companies to receive funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers’ iFund, whose portfolio consists of young technology companies hoping to piggy-back on Apple’s iPhone and iPad.

The index is still down 0.9 per cent from its mid-February highs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.6 per cent to 12,258.20, its biggest one-day gain since December 1, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.8 per cent to 2,789.74.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, tumbled 10.5 per cent, although it is still up 12.6 per cent since February 22 when the market began to react sharply to the Mideast crisis.Sentiment was aided by unexpectedly strong weekly employment numbers. Unemployment claims fell to their lowest level since May 2008 last week, declining by 20,000 from the previous week to 368,000. The less volatile four-week
moving average was down 13,000, to 388,000 claims.“The underlying downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable and provides strong evidence that the labour market recovery is for real,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data bodes well for the official non-farm payroll figures which come out on Friday. Economists are expecting that about 192,000 jobs will have been created in February, well ahead of the 36,000 created in the previous month.Separate data from the Institute for Supply Management showed strong growth in activity in the US service sector. The ISM non-manufacturing index was up to 59.7 from 59.4 theprevious month, which was the highest reading since August 2005.

441;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;The latest corporate technology news;;SAP overhauls BusinessObjectsGerman software giant SAP has radically overhauled its flagship BusinessObjects platform in a move that highlights the strategic importance of business analytics in the enterprise software industry. Version 4 of the BusinessObjects software ticks all the right boxes for today’s technology-centred organisations, with better support for mobile users and, inevitably, social networks. For power users, the good news is that the BusinessObjects platform is now optimised to work with SAP’s high-performance analytic appliance. The latter is a new SAP offering that lets organisations analyse vast quantities of data on the fly using a technology called in-memory computing. SAP and other high-end BI vendors are pushing this technology as a way to do real-time analysis of so-called “big data” and gain insights that would be simply too time-consuming using traditional technologies.SAP also introduced six new BusinessObjects analytic applications for specific industries — media, oil and gas, healthcare, insurance, life sciences and public sector industries. SAP bought its seat at the top table of the business intelligence market with the $6.7bn acquisition of industry leader Business Objects in 2007. Last year, it spent a similar sum on Sybase, which once rivalled Oracle in the database market. The latter acquisition puzzled some analysts at the time as the German group seemed to have overpaid for an also-ran database company. But now the fog is clearing. This latest version of BusinessObjects platform will use Sybase’s mobile software technology to create a “comprehensive mobile BI suite” that allows mobile workers to analyse data from both SAP and non-SAP applications.Citirx unveils GoToMyPC app for iPadLeft that all-important presentation back at base?

While there are various ways to access systems remotely, they usually require a fair amount of technical knowledge or are complicated to set up with corporate firewalls. Used in conjunction with the main GoToMyPC program, which must be installed on the “host” PC or Mac, this app lets the iPad securely pass data through the corporate firewall and so access files and programs stored on the host computer. While the iPad app is free, the main GoToMyPC program costs $9.95 a month for each host PC or Mac.Primadesk offers back-up for back-upAnother outage hits Google’s Gmail. With exquisite timing, US start-up Primadesk launches a service that lets you back-up personal data stored in cloud-based services. Even if you already back-up your cloud-based personal data, Primadesk’s offering may still interest, particularly if you use several online services and have a hard time remembering what is stored exactly where. From Primadesk’s homepage, you can log in to multiple services simultaneously and search personal content — emails, contacts, documents — stored across the various services such as Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. The service is free and Primadesk has just announced Citrix has come onboard as a key investor. While Google says the disruption caused by last week’s Gmail outage was minimal — about 150,000 accounts were reset — and the loss of data only temporary, the outage highlights the importance of backing up important data in today’s brave new world of cloud computing.Google’s new Cloud Connect for Microsoft Office plug-inTired of playing attachment tennis? Instead of sending document revisions back and forth by email, try Google’s new Cloud Connect for Microsoft Office plug-in. It uses Google’s cloud-based Google Apps service and lets co-workers share, back up and simultaneously edit Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel documents. Co-workers must all have Microsoft Office 2003 or later on their PCs — no Macs unfortunately — and obviously someone must have a Google Apps account. The latter is used not just to share the documents but also keeps track of revision history. The service also supports offline editing, so even if you are not connected to Google Apps, the service will update the online version of the document when you next connect.
442;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-02-28T21:11:14Z;When props pay for production;;At the Sundance Film Festival last month, one of the break-out hits was not an independent art-house film but a flagrantly corporate affair. POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold is the latest documentary from director Morgan Spurlock, whose previous films include Super Size Me, which targeted the fast food industry. His new feature, funded entirely through corporate sponsorships of up to $1m each, takes on another perceived evil: product placement.Wearing a jacket emblazoned with the logos of his sponsors – which include Mini Cooper and Hyatt hotels as well as POM Wonderful, the pomegranate products group – Mr Spurlock makes the rounds of advertising executives for some relatively non-accusatory conversations about the practice of placing branded products in films and television shows in exchange for payments to broadcasters and producers. But while his tone is tongue-in-cheek, his point is clear enough: around the globe, and in the US in particular, product placement has become ubiquitous.In Mexico, telenovela scripts are passed on to the sales team for product inclusion before they go to production. In France, Spain and Germany, companies have embraced the practice since the relaxation of European Union product placement laws in 2007. Meanwhile, this week, new rules will allow product placement for the first time in the UK.But advertisers, brand owners, producers and broadcasters need to tread carefully if they are to benefit from the practice’s growth.“A lot of companies spend heavily on it and it has gained momentum in recent years,” says Wes Nichols, chief executive of Market Share, a media measurement firm. “But it can be taken too far.”Global product placement spending totalled $6.25bn in 2009 and is on track to grow at a double-digit rate across European media from 2010 to 2014, according to research group PQ Media. In the US, product placement in film and television has never been more widespread, accounting for $3.61bn, or half of global spending.Film and television are the prime targets. On the 12 main broadcast and cable networks in the US, there were 5,381 big product placements during primetime in 2010, up 22 per cent from 2006, according to Nielsen, the market research company. In Iron Man 2, released last year by Disney, there were 64 brand placements, including ones for Audi, Oracle and LG.“If you’re a brand and you’re able to align yourself with some key actors in a movie, that’s pretty powerful,” says Eric Smallwood of Front Row Marketing Services, which seeks to measure the lifetime value of product placements. “Movies never die.”The rise of product placement is being fuelled by a combination of factors, including relaxed attitudes from consumers inured to the practice and an advertising industry feeling pressure from digital media and increasing digital video recorder penetration, which allows viewers to skip ads on television.“The whole goal of product placement is to build awareness of a product,” says Jeff Greenfield of C3 Metrics, an advertising measurement company. “It used to have this negative connotation and brands didn’t want to be associated with it. Now it’s become this accepted thing.”Myriad mainstream brands rely on product placement, from enterprise companies such as data storage company EMC, which featured its wares on television show 24, to Apple, the most prolific brand, which saw its products appear in more than a third of all number one films at the US box office during the past 10 years.Some people within the marketing community feel that product placement can get out of hand.“I think there are more interesting ways to get products embedded in people’s minds,” says Donovan Neale-May, executive director of CMO Council. “For some brands it works well, for others it’s very questionable what value they’re getting out of it.” Taken too far, egregious product placement can inspire scathing consumer critiques on blogs and social media.Richard Brooke, communications and buying manager at Unilever, the fast-moving consumer goods group, advises that, like any new format, it needs to be understood in the context of a broader marketing strategy.“The great thing is you embed your brand in audio-visual content, which is platform-neutral. But it can’t be viewed on its own,” he says. “It has to be viewed as part of the overall armoury to talk to consumers.”Indeed, the onscreen “P” logo that must be displayed at the start and end of programmes and between ad breaks to warn UK viewers when shows contain product placement is likely to be a scarce sight for now.Few people in the broadcasting industry are salivating at a huge new source of revenue: estimates from Barclays suggest that it could generate up to £150m a year by 2016 – 4 per cent of total UK advertising spending at current levels. Much of that could well be diverted from existing TV ad spending.“We are going into the unknown as an industry here,” says David Charlesworth, head of sponsorship, placement and funded content at Channel 4. “I don’t think anyone is looking at it as a fast buck.”The UK’s rules, set out by Ofcom, the media regulator, in December, are more stringent than most other countries. There is a long list of the kinds of shows that are exempt, such as children’s or religious programming, and brands that are not allowed to use it, including foods high in fat, salt or sugar, prescription medicines, gambling products and alcoholic drinks.More significantly, products must not be given “undue prominence” or exert too much influence over the plot lines.“We are pretty clear we don’t want UK brands to appear on UK programmes like American brands do on American programmes: really in-your-face,” said Ian Twinn, public affairs director at Isba, an advertisers’ body. “But advertisers will push for a certain amount of prominence. That is what you are paying for.”Striking that balance between the rules against “undue prominence” and being sufficiently memorable will be a tough task for producers.“It’s not easy. It’s a tightrope act but it’s not impossible,” says Dean Baker, head of JWT Entertainment, a branded content producer owned by WPP. Most industry practitioners advocate subtle integrations that fit seamlessly into the TV programme.“But, because it looks natural, almost by definition, people will hardly notice it,” says Hugh Burkitt, chief executive of the Marketing Society. “It’s incredibly difficult to measure its success.”Nonetheless, Nielsen claims that “brand recall” and “improved opinion” – two standard measures of advertising effectiveness – have seen consistent increases after product placements.When UK audiences were asked to remember products placed in shows imported from the US, 25 per cent were able to do so, compared with 34 per cent of Americans.To boost the profile of placed products, agencies advise backing it up with standard TV ad spots or other so-called “activation”, such as in-store promotions tied to the placement, an arrangement that is common in the US. No limit has been set on the number of paid insertions per programme but Mr Charlesworth believes that three to five items would be “comfortable”.But, as America has learnt, product placement is a slippery slope. In last year’s sequel to Wall Street, famously liberal director Oliver Stone included cameos from Dunkin’ Donuts, Bulgari and Moët & Chandon. “We needed help,” he told a trade publication last year, sounding somewhat defeated.The spectacle of Mr Stone bowing to the powers of the advertising world suggests to some that product placement may be approaching its zenith in the US, at least for now. “I think you’re going to see some push-back,” says Mr Greenfield. “It’s gotten a little bit over the top.”In spite of Mr Spurlock’s tone, perhaps it is not so ironic that the backlash could begin with a commercially sponsored film.
443;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-02-27T19:27:29Z;3M chief warns Obama over business regulation;;The head of one of the US’s biggest industrial groups has launched a scathing attack on Barack Obama’s attempts to repair relations with companies, dubbing him “anti-business”.Manufacturers could shift production out of the US to Canada or Mexico as a result, warned George Buckley, chief executive and chairman of 3M.“I judge people by their feet, not their mouth,” he told the Financial Times. “We know what his instincts are – they are Robin Hood-esque. He is anti-business.”The Obama administration has struck a more conciliatory tone towards business since the Democratic defeat in November’s midterm elections.Last month, the president created a jobs and competitiveness council, chaired by Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of GE, and including chief executives such as American Express’s Kenneth Chenault, DuPont’s Ellen Kullman, Antonio Perez of Kodak and Southwest Airlines’ Gary Kelly. Mr Obama also convened a meeting this month with technology chief executives, including Steve Jobs of Apple, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.Mr Buckley, who has run the diversified manufacturer since 2005, said: “There is a sense among companies that this is a difficult place to do business. It is about regulation, taxation, seemingly anti-business policies in Washington, attitudes towards science.”He added: “Politicians forget that business has choice. We’re not indentured servants and we will do business where it’s good and friendly. If it’s hostile, incrementally, things will slip away. We’ve got a real choice between manufacturing in Canada and Mexico – which tend to be pro-business – or America.”The 3M chief also criticised US immigration policy, saying the difficulty of obtaining visas was forcing companies to move research and development overseas. “About 68 per cent of our science PhD candidates are from outside the US,” he said. “Many want to stay here afterwards but we’re not allowed as many visas as we would like.”“We are now exporting science overseas to China, India, Germany, building labs there. There’s a good strategic reason for it, but we also have no choice – if we can’t get the people here and we’re competing with the people there, we have no choice but to do it locally.”Mr Buckley struck a gloomy note on the US economy. “The macro numbers seem to be improving but when we look at the micro numbers – at what’s going on in housing, automotive, in manufacturing in general – it’s hard to get enthusiastic about it,” he said.
444;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-02-15T16:41:18Z;The latest corporate technology news;;HP to buy Vertica SystemsHP is acquiring data warehousing and analytics vendor Vertica Systems in a fresh attempt to raise its profile in the fast-growing business intelligence market. HP recently pulled the plug on a homegrown data warehousing product Neoview which failed to live up to its expectations. The decision to jump straight back in, this time using Vertica’s real-time analytics technology, shows HP has recognised that business intelligence — which marries powerful databases called data warehouses with clever analytics software — is one of the few enterprise software markets that has yet to turn into a two-horse race. Teradata, SAS, Microstrategy, SAP, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft and a clutch of lesser-known specialists such as Vertica all offer data warehouses and/or analytics tools and the market is growing at about 14 per cent a year according to IDC. Analysts say growth is being fuelled by the advent of all-in-one data warehouse “appliances” and new generation of analytics tools aimed at non-expert users. These innovations are bringing BI to a wider audience by making it easier and faster to “mine” the data generated by operational systems for trends or insights that would otherwise be difficult to spot. Research firm 451 Group recently described five-year-old Vertica as the “biggest independent challenger to the data warehousing giants.” Not anymore. Terms of the Vertica acquisition were not disclosed.Linux is no longer just for start-upsStill think Linux is for start-ups? The London Stock Exchange’s new Millennium Exchange trading platform went live on Monday and it runs on Suse Linux Enterprise Server, a high-end version of the open source Linux operating system. The LSE previously used Microsoft technology but switched to Linux because of the previous system’s unacceptable high levels of latency — the speed with which trades are carried out. The LSE is facing increased competition from rival trading platforms that offer lower latencies. According to the LSE, the new Linux-based platform will give customers superior technical performance and “ultra low latency.” The deal is quite a coup for Novell, which supplied its Suse Linux Enterprise Server product modified with a real-time “kernel” to reduce latency times. Linux is not just for stock exchanges, however. A recent survey by Gartner found that more than half of organisations surveyed have adopted open-source software as part of their IT strategy. “Users are beginning to look at open source software differently – if they can customise the code to make it unique to their company, they have created a competitive advantage,” says Laurie Wurster, research director at Gartner.SAP’s Business By Design aimed at subsidiary offices of multinationalsSAP has a new release of Business By Design, its cloud-based business software. This latest release allows enterprises that are already running SAP Business Suite, its flagship on-premises product, in their main business operations to integrate with subsidiaries that are running the cloud-based upstart. The integration focuses on consolidating accounts, particularly at the subsidiary and transaction currency level, as well as tax jurisdictions. Deeper integration for sales and distribution functions is planned for the next version. SAP faces a particular challenge when it comes to cloud computing in that the organisations most likely to use SAP software in the cloud probably already own SAP’s “on-premises” software. The German group does not want to cannibalise this customer base and so it is looking for cloud computing opportunities that complement rather than substitute the need for traditional on-premises software — such as in the subsidiary offices of multinationals.Fujitsu has a solution for managing smartphonesToo many smartphones, not enough time? Fujitsu has the solution with a managed smartphone service aimed at large enterprises. It consists of a package of cloud-based services designed to take the hassles out of managing multiple devices and mobile operating systems. Fujitsu, formerly known as Fujitsu-Siemens, has long offered this type of managed service for desktop PCs and laptops. It argues the time is now ripe to extend it to smartphone and tablet devices, which create particular headaches when it comes to infrastructure management. As well as offering device management and diagnostic capabilities, Fujitsu will take care of all the security aspects, including authentication, backup, virus protection, firewall and spyware software. Pricing starts at about €5 per handset per month.
445;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-02-09T00:48:19Z;Facebook to Build its own Real Life Facebook-ville;;While many Facebook employees are just a few years past decorating their college dorm rooms, the seven-year old company is now renovating a new 9-building, 57-acre campus it plans to move into this summer.Facebook’s staff is growing faster than its current offices in Palo Alto can handle, so the company announced today its intention to move seven miles up the road to the former Sun Microsystems headquarters in Menlo Park.The barren industrial park will be a big cultural shift from the university neighborhood employees are used to. So Facebook will simply build its own “urban experience,” adding shops and amenities to the courtyard running in between the two rows of buildings.The campus already has an amphitheater, a fitness gym, a basketball court, and two cafes, which the company will “repurpose and rebuild in the Facebook way,” said John Tenanes, director of global real estate. “Our chef is excited about that.”Facebook currently has 2,000 employees. Two thirds of them are based in Silicon Valley in the US, the rest are scattered in about 20 offices around the world. The workforce is currently growing at a rate of 50 percent a year, said David Ebersman, chief financial officer, and is expected to grow at the same rate through 2011.The new space, currently occupied by Oracle, can seat about 3,600 people, but Facebook believes it can renovate it to accommodate many more. It will recreate its signature open floor plan, knocking down offices and removing cubicle partitions.“We feel it’s really important to have our employees in one location that maximizes their ability to interact with one another,” Mr Ebersman said. “That leads to better sharing of ideas.”It’s this informal, energetic way of doing business that will help them attract the talent to fill the new space, Mr Ebersman said. The campus design and Google-type perks will be just perks.Facebook agreed to a 15-year lease on the new campus, with the option to buy in five years. The first wave of Facebook employees, about 500 at first, will begin moving into the new space by June or July, with all remaining operations joining them in the following year or so.The company also purchased an additional 22 acres of nearby property from a General Motors affiliate, connected to the main campus by an underground pedestrian tunnel, for further expansions.“We see this as future flexibility for us,” Mr Tenanes said.
446;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-01-26T09:27:18Z;SAP looks to reduce $1.3bn Oracle fine;;SAPsaid it would file a motion to a US court asking to reduce the $1.3bn in damages it has been forced to pay to arch-rival Oracle over copyright infringements.The damages awarded last November have triggered a sharp drop in profit at the world’s largest business software maker by sales in the fourth quarter, as it was forced to lift its provisions for the case by €933m ($1.27bn).Operating profit under international accounting standards dropped by almost half year-on-year to €543m in last three months, SAP said on Wednesday..Oracle last year successfully sued its German rival over the illegal downloading of software by SAP’s former US subsidiary.The arch-rivals are engaged in one of the fiercest corporate competitions in the software industry and have repeatedly locked horns.Bill Mc Dermott, SAP’s co-chief executive, said: “We absolutely don’t agree with the $1.3bn [fine].”“Depending on the outcome of the post-trial motion process, SAP may consider an appeal,” Europe’s largest software maker said. It added that the continuing dispute over the amount of damages could trigger another change in provisions.“From a shareholder’s perspective, it can only get better,” Mr McDermott said.The group on Wednesday unveiled a target to grow revenues by between 10 and 14 per cent this year, as it hopes that new products such as mobile solutions will accelerate its business.Mr McDermott told the FT that the product offensive could within the next five to seven years catapult SAP’s sales to €20bn from €12.5bn last year and expand its operating margin by 4.5 percentage points to 35 per cent. “This is our ambition,” he said.Thomas Otter, analyst at Gartner, conceded that SAP had for the first time in a while a genuine new product opportunity. “The true judge of innovation, though, is not whether vendors label products innovative, but how customers do,” he added.Mr McDermott dismissed talk that SAP was a strong bid target for either a US competitor or an Asian sovereign wealth fund.He said SAP was better run as an independent company and pointed out that since he and Mr Snabe took over, the company’s valuation had increased by $10bn making it less attractive as a target.Mr McDermott and his co-chief executive, Jim Hagemann Snabe, took SAP’s helm almost a year ago, after the group had been rattled by a drop in customer and employee confidence as well as falling sales.They have since improved morale within the group, increased the speed and customer involvement in software development and broadened the group’s technological range with the $5.8bn takeover of mobile software specialist Sybase.
447;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-01-25T16:10:32Z;Risk mitigation: There is no substitute for local staff or knowledge;;With industrial companies going ever further afield in their quest to strike a balance between the quality and price of materials, the need for a well-oiled, low-risk supply chain is becoming more urgent.“Companies used to very much be of the mindset of who are you, and why should we do this,” says Simon Chard, director of contract risk and compliance at Deloitte, the consultancy.“But, over the past two or three years, people have started to take the issue of managing the potential risks in their supply chains much more seriously.”Mr Chard’s thoughts are echoed by a wide range of supply chain professionals in heavy construction companies, cement producers and specialised manufacturers.From keeping a closer watch over the financial health of key suppliers of goods and services, to tightening security around sensitive intellectual property and data, management teams are placing increased importance on making sure they have the right suppliers to minimise risks for their own businesses.A key reason for the focus on supply chains is the rapid expansion in goods coming from the emerging economic powers of China and India in particular, but also Brazil and smaller south-east Asian countries. Companies are turning to a mixture of technology and risk management professionals, to deal with the complexities of buying materials and businesses services.Andrew Spence, supply chain business development director at Oracle, the information services group, says that the right computer systems can mitigate risks associated with working with a long list of foreign suppliers.“Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products provide a mechanism for sharing product information to ensure everyone is working to the same specification and that product quality is measured,” he says.“However, technology alone can’t solve the potential risks of working with remote suppliers. Companies must build close relationships and trust with a supplier, and this can’t be achieved without face-to-face meetings.“Software technology enables and supports the opportunity to work with remote suppliers, but without human contact, organisations will stumble in the early stages of working with the supplier,” he adds.Lance Taylor, chief executive of Rider Levett Bucknall, a construction consultancy that has managed the supply of goods and services for multimillion-pound building and infrastructure projects, agrees.“You need that culture of understanding and knowledge that only comes from being on the ground. As a purchaser, you need to have a local on the ground who can understand the market, the supply chains and the culture and, when necessary, can intervene,” he explains.The march towards a truly global supply base for industrial companies has, if anything, been accelerated by the downturn in developed economies, but it has also altered the way businesses manage their buying of goods.Indeed, the financial hypersensitivity spawned by the global recession, while not the cause of the sharper focus on supply chain management, has added to the attention many organisations are paying to the purchasing of goods and services.As well as expanding the geographical scope of their supply bases, many businesses have increased the number of services and products from single suppliers in an attempt to cut costs.One manufacturing executive says suppliers will always be keen to move up the value chain and offer a wider range of goods and services, but companies must then adjust their risk profiles to reflect greater exposure to problems at certain suppliers.“A lot of companies will outsource the work you have contracted them to do, meaning you have hidden exposures you really cannot factor in,” the executive adds.Instead of holding extra inventory to offset the risk of faults in their supply chains, businesses – where short of finance and reluctant to have money tied up in working capital – have sought to tighten control over suppliers.However, while a more globalised supply chain can be economically beneficial, it can bring additional risks, such as financial instability and production problems, that are harder to predict and prepare for.“Political uncertainly and labour disputes are almost impossible to factor in, but as the supply chain grows and the goods and services become more complex and intricate, so the ability to manage the chain becomes much harder. It is also hard to have technology to support risk management when the supply chain is so disparate,” Mr Chard explains.
448;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-01-23T18:34:59Z;Air Products ruling will set takeover benchmark;;Defining moments in corporate law are pretty infrequent. Less often still do they resonate beyond an elite cabal of dealmakers and legal wonks.But this week promises one such juncture as a Delaware court assesses the latest legal battle in the year-long hostile takeover attempt by Air Products of its industrial gases rival Airgas.“We’re heading into the biggest M&A case in 20 years,” says one lawyer. “No matter which way this goes, it will define the law.”Air Products, having declared its latest pitch “best and final”, is asking the court to strike down its quarry’s poison pill, designed to protect against a takeover.The pill can be activated once anyone acquires 15 per cent of the company and acts to dilute the stake of the would-be acquirer by offering shares to other shareholders at a discount.William Chandler, the Court of Chancery judge expected to step down shortly, has a rare opportunity to order the removal of a pill when the case gets under way on Tuesday.If the pill stands, the case could solidify the notion that power resides with boards in business-friendly Delaware. Striking down the pill would indicate that such devices are temporary, designed to allow boards to make their case and seek competing offers. Ultimately, however, shareholders should decide.That outcome would edge Delaware – and by extension the US – closer to the UK, Australia and Canada, where pills are either frowned upon or strictly limited.Such defining cases are rare. The last with this profile ended in 2004 within days of a hearing, when PeopleSoft agreed to a $10bn takeover by Oracle after 15 months of wrangling.People familiar with Airgas’s thinking argue that the fact that even Air Products’ own three board nominees have dismissed its $70-a-share offer shows that their defences remain justified. Moreover, they add, Airgas shareholders can call a special meeting to throw out the board.Only six of 85 Fortune 500 companies that staggered elections for their boards – which only allows a specified number of directors to be replaced at one time – have a similar provision.Jim Morphy, senior M&A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, is sceptical that the courts will knock out the pill. “The Delaware Supreme Court in 1989 rejected the idea that boards have any obligation to abandon their long-term business plan in the face of an inadequate offer,” he says. “It will no doubt be an interesting day in court but I believe ultimately the pill will be sustained.”The fact remains, however, that no would-be buyer has successfully navigated both a pill and a staggered board, suggesting to some that the combination oversteps the mark in legitimate defences.In December, the state’s Supreme Court found that Airgas could not be forced to hold its next annual meeting early. Air Products’ proposal, supported by shareholders, was designed to circumnavigate Airgas’s staggered board.Either way, the pill ruling will come at an interesting time for Delaware.“Delaware wants to continue to be the pre-eminent jurisdiction on corporate law issues,” says Prof Guhan Subramanian, a corporate governance expert at Harvard Law School. “If it strays too far in the balance between boards and shareholders, there is potential for the federal government to step in and take over certain aspects of corporate law.”With financial regulation on areas traditionally left to the states, Washington could act.At issue is whether the US will remain an anomaly in favouring a director-centric model of corporate governance over so-called shareholder democracy.Prof Subramanian sees merit in a change. “For the past 25 years, the US has been an outlier in the global arena,” he says. “There is a strong theory, supported by empirical evidence, that some vulnerability to a hostile takeover has an important disciplinary effect on corporate America.”
449;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2011-01-13T22:18:06Z;Strong fourth-quarter results boost SAP;;SAP reported record fourth-quarter results that beat its own as well as market expectations, pushing up the shares of Europe’s biggest software group by sales.The German group’s operating margin rose to 39 per cent in the last three months of the past year, higher than the 35.5 per cent reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. The news triggered a 3.5 per cent jump of SAP’s share price to €40.40 late on Thursday.The reaction came as relief to SAP’s management after several setbacks in the past few months. In November, the world’s largest business software maker by sales was forced to pay $1.3bn plus interest in damage claims in a copyright infringement verdict, which followed a lukewarm response to the group’s third-quarter results the month before.Bill McDermott, SAP’s co-chief executive, said: “We are pleased to announce the best software sales quarter in the history of SAP. We achieved outstanding growth in all regions and customer segments.”SAP said its full-year revenues rose by 17 per cent year on year to €12.45bn. Its full-year operating profit, reported in non-IFRS standards, came in at more than €3.9bn, pushing its operating margin from 27.4 per cent in 2009 to 31.5 per cent.Revenue from software and software-related services, reported in non-IFRS standard and excluding currency effects, grew by 13 per cent, exceeding the group’s 9-11 per cent target.SAP’s strong results reflected a boost in the software market in the past year as companies in emerging markets, the US and parts of Europe splashed out to underpin their economic recovery. It followed similarly upbeat results by Oracle, the group’s US-based arch-rival, in the past quarter.“These are really good numbers,“ said Thomas Becker, analyst at Commerzbank.SAP took some of the gloss of the results when it warned that the copyright infringement verdict in the US would have a “significant negative impact” on its – yet to be announced - operating result under IFRS.Last November, Oracle successfully sued SAP for illegally downloading its software. The damage award from the court battle is eight times higher than the $160m provision that SAP had previously made in its balance sheet.SAP has not yet made a decision whether it would appeal against the verdict. It said in November that it was “considering all options”.

451;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-29T22:38:53Z;SAP in hot pursuit of investor happiness;Management has to convince founders of standalone strategy;When Jim Hagemann Snabe and Bill McDermott became SAP’s co-chief executives in February they promised to turn the business software maker into a “ happy company”.Ten months on and company insiders say the mood at the world’s largest business software maker by sales has indeed recovered from two years of bewilderment and anger with perceived management aloofness. However, management is still struggling to achieve another, equally important task: to make SAP’s investors happy.Analysts say next year management will have to convince the group’s three founders, who hold a combined 24 per cent of the shares, about SAP’s standalone strategy. Otherwise the group could become a takeover candidate.Thomas Otter, research director at Gartner, says: “2011 is a crunch year for the management. SAP has significantly improved as a company when compared with one year ago. But what I don’t know is whether this will be enough to keep the founders happy.”SAP’s share price has been trailing US arch-rival Oracle’s performance for yet another year. Management suffered a further blow last month when SAP had to pay $1.3bn in damages to Oracle in a copyright infringement verdict.On Wednesday, the court ruled that the group would also have to pay interest on the damages claim sum. Already SAP’s comparatively low market value of €47bn ($62bn) is starting to attract investors.People close to SAP’s main shareholders say several investors from the east, presumably sovereign wealth funds, have asked if Klaus Tschira, one of the founders who owns about 8.4 per cent of the shares, would be willing to sell his stake.But Mr Tschira told the Financial Times he has no plans to sell at the current share price: “At the moment, I have no intention to sell. And I don’t see any pressure to act.”Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executive, is equally convinced of the three main investors’ backing. “The three founders stand by SAP, not only as investors but also with their hearts,” Mr Snabe said in an interview with Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper.But analysts and industry insiders say the large shareholders, all of whom are more than 65 years old, might decide eventually that the sale to a strategic partner would be the best way to secure SAP’s future.The list of possible buyers is led by Hewlett-Packard, as the group is looking to expand its reach in software. Of other companies big enough to mount an acquisition, IBM turned its back on the applications business in the 1990s and has shown little indication of returning, while Microsoft, which tried to acquire SAP three years ago, is focused on competing with Apple and Oracle in the mobile and online markets.Speculation about interest by HP was fuelled by news in September that Léo Apotheker, who was forced out as SAP’s boss in February, would become the US company’s chief executive. “For the three founders, HP would be a good exit,” says Helmuth Gümbel, managing partner at IT research firm Strategy Partners.But with its stock market value only 50 per cent higher than SAP, HP would face a challenge absorbing the German group. Stuart Williams, software analyst at TBR, a technology research firm, says: “It’s a lot of money and execution risk.”Mr Gümbel says: “The big question is: will the current management be able to prove that it can reinvent SAP [without a partner]? I don’t see the visionary who could meaningfully drive such a restart.”Mr Snabe, an intellectually minded manager, and Mr McDermott, a charismatic salesman, are making a big effort to convince markets that SAP has already reinvented itself.The group, which traditionally sells desktop software for business processes such as personnel planning and accounting systems, is trying to broaden its customer base and expand into mobile devices with new products and May’s $5.8bn takeover of US database and mobile software specialist Sybase.Mr Otter says that so far these initiatives have failed to bring significant growth. “The next six months in particular will be crucial for SAP to show that its new products will make some revenue impact,” he says.
452;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-22T16:32:22Z;Tech news briefs;;Alternative to Microsoft’s OfficeHands up all those who’ve never used an Office macro. So why is your business paying top dollar for a product that is overkill for most users? A new Forrester Research study reveals 72 per cent of organisations make limited or no use of the macros feature in Excel and a startling 85 per cent make limited or no use of macros in Word. The study addresses the challenges in upgrading to Microsoft Office 2010 from earlier versions.But Forrester surprisingly omits the most glaring observation: if three quarters of businesses make little or no use of the high-end features in Office, perhaps they shouldn’t be looking to upgrade Office at all. Lower-cost alternatives may lack the bells and whistles of Microsoft Office but they can easily handle humdrum word processing and spreadsheet tasks. One such is Open Office, which now gets its first release under new owner Oracle. Based on the Open Document Format (ODF), Oracle Office 3.3 is compatible with Microsoft Office documents and, more importantly for existing Oracle customers, it comes with “connectors” to link it to other Oracle software in areas such as business intelligence, financials or customer management. Open Office was originally an open-source software project sponsored by Sun Microsystems, which Oracle recently acquired.Larry Ellison’s philanthropy has its limits and so Oracle Open Office becomes a commercial product, albeit at a licence cost up to five times lower than Microsoft Office, Oracle claims. Oracle also unveiled Oracle Cloud Office, its attempt to take on the likes of Google Apps and Microsoft’s forthcoming Office 365 cloud-based productivity suite — although for Oracle Cloud Office, you’ll have to bring your own cloud.Chrome for Window’s XPStill running Windows XP? Google has the browser for you. The search giant hopes to win businesses over to its upstart Chrome browser by making it easier to install Chrome on large numbers of Windows-based PCs, including those running the ten-year-old – but still popular – Windows XP operating system.Ironically, Microsoft’s forthcoming IE9 browser will not work on Windows XP as the software giant wants businesses to upgrade to Windows 7. But many businesses are fearful of the upheaval and cost involved in upgrading hundreds of PCs to Windows 7 and so they stick to Windows XP.Microsoft warns these laggards risk missing out on the unspecified “beauty of the web” which only those running the latest browsers like IE9 will enjoy. But there is an alternative: keep Windows XP and replace Microsoft Internet Explorer with Google’s rival chrome browser, which like IE9, employs the latest web technologies. Google has just announced some tools to make it easer for IT staff to do such a large-scale browser swap and replicate company-wide security settings. While Google’s Chrome browser has been a big success with consumers — Google claims more than 120m users — it has not been widely adopted by businesses. Procter & Gamble is one high-profile customer win for Chrome and Google no doubt hopes to pick up a few more from Microsoft’s decision to turn its back on diehard Windows XP fans.Avira warns fellow antivirus vendors against overloadingComfort for all those who wasted hours trying to remove a bloated antivirus program from their PC …only to repeat the process a few weeks later. You are not alone. According to Germany antivirus firm Avira, more than 60 per cent of users have tried multiple antivirus products over the course of a year. In addition, 25 per cent of respondents admitted to turning off their antivirus protection because they thought the programs were slowing down their computers. Avira warns its fellow antivirus vendors against overloading the security software with features which may have a great impact on system performance. “It is better to have minimal protection that goes unnoticed than protection with all whistles and bells which the user deactivates in order to be able to use his computer,” says Sorin Mustaca, data security expert of Avira.
453;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-22T00:27:23Z;SEC to investigate Hurd over EDS deal;;"The US Securities and Exchange Commission is to determine whether Mark Hurd, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, told then-contract employee Jodie Fisher that the company planned to buy Electronic Data Systems and if any laws or rules were
violated as a result.The information would have been worth a great deal to an investor who acted on it, setting the stage for a classic insider trading investigation.People familiar with the inquiry, which was confirmed by HP late on Monday, said on Tuesday that the agency was looking into whether anyone traded as a result of Mr Hurd’s alleged words.Ms Fisher has denied any such trading and told others that she only passed the information on to her mother, who likewise did not trade, according to
people familiar with her account.The claim that Mr Hurd told her in advance of the 2008 acquisition was contained in an eight-page letter to Mr Hurd that eventually led to his forced resignation from the company he ran for five years.Even if no one profited by trading ahead of HP’s bid for EDS, the SEC could still try to find out whether Mr Hurd ran afoul of fair disclosure regulations the agency adopted in 2000, according to John Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor.“The SEC would respond almost like Pavlov’s dog to any allegation that a CEO leaked the word of an acquisition target,” Mr Coffee said. “The SEC doesn’t want CEOs leaking names.”Regulation FD bars selective disclosure of material information to financial analysts, brokers and shareholders who are likely to trade, requiring that such data be distributed to all interested parties at once.It is understood that Ms Fisher did not own any stock, however, so the SEC probe could end quietly. Ms Fisher’s attorney, HP and Mr Hurd all declined to comment.Even if she did own shares, Mr Hurd might have valid defences, Mr Coffee said. Under some circumstances, executives can share advance information if confidentiality is pledged, according to the agency’s website.If the SEC does find grounds to believe a violation occurred, it might seek a consent decree from Mr Hurd in which he pledges not to violate securities law in future, Mr Coffee said.Since leaving HP, Mr Hurd has joined Oracle as a co-president, while HP tapped a former Oracle foe to succeed him.Mr Hurd has hired a defence lawyer, Daniel Bookin, who did not return a call seeking comment.“Mark acted properly in all respects,” said Glenn Bunting, a spokesman for Mr Hurd. “It is understandable that the SEC is looking into the events surrounding Mark’s departure, which was followed by a precipitous drop in the value of HP’s stock.”"
454;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-17T22:30:28Z;Eurozone worries weigh on US stocks;;"Positive earnings from Oracle and Research in Motion boosted technology stocks, while the S&P 500 edged lower.Oracle climbed 3.9 per cent to $31.46 after it beat expectations in its second quarter and forecast third-quarter profit above current analyst estimates.New software sales soared 21 per cent year-on-year and the acquisition of Sun Microsystems helped revenue surge 48 per cent.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets raised their price target for the stock to $36.“We fully expect Oracle to deliver better-than-expected revenue and cost synergies and exceed its goal for Sun to deliver $1.5bn of operating income in its first year,” they said.“In addition to the Sun opportunities, we believe the company’s integrated systems strategy, coupled with the upcoming release of Fusion . . . will allow Oracle to take market share from its toughest rivals, including IBM and SAP.”Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive, predicted that the company would take market share in some of the most profitable businesses of its rivals Hewlett-Packard and SAP.Shares in Hewlett-Packard were flat at $41.96 but SAP shares gained 1.2 per cent to $50.06 and IBM added 0.3 per cent to $145.Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, also issued a forecast above analyst expectations as it said demand for its Curve and Torch models helped sales rise 40 per cent year-on-year. The company predicted revenue in the current quarter would be between $5.5bn and $5.7bn, compared with analyst projections of $5.46bn and earnings per share would be between $1.74 and $1.80, more than the $1.61 predicted.But analysts at RBC Capital Markets, who class the stock as a “top pick”, still warned that fears over its competitiveness could hang over RIM in the short term.“Despite strong results, near-term sentiment is expected to remain polarised over RIM’s competitiveness (particularly ahead of a Verizon iPhone), pending visibility catalysts (spec-leading Smartphones, Playbook) which in our view should help re-establish investor confidence regarding RIM’s innovation and competitiveness,” they said.Shares in RIM, which also beat expectations this quarter, added 1.6 per cent to $60.20 and the wider technology sector gained 0.1 per cent.Meanwhile, concerns about Europe weighed on investor sentiment after
rating agency Moody’s downgraded Ireland’s credit rating by five notches.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 at 1,243.90 but was up 0.2 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.1 per cent to close at 11,491.91, higher by 0.8 per cent on the five days, while the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,642.97, almost flat over the week.The Vix, which measures expected volatility, fell 7.3 per cent to 16.12.Overnight the US House of Representatives approved the tax bill, which, once the president signs it, will extend Bush-era tax cuts.“The tax bill is a major positive for next year. I know some people say that it’s not that stimulative but it is that stimulative,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds. “Economic growth should step up a gear to 4 per cent.”In deals news, Marshall & Ilsley Corp jumped 18.3 per cent to $6.85 after the regional bank said it had agreed to be acquired by the Bank of Montreal in an all-stock transaction.“If you look at Canadian banks, we like the strength of their balance sheets, profits growth and the very strong Canadian economy and we think they will continue to be net buyers of troubled bank franchises in the US,” said John Pandtle, portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management.Other regional banks rose as investors hoped for more deal activity in the sector. The S&P 500 regional bank index was up 1.5 per cent."
455;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-17T20:06:21Z;Vodafone boosted by US venture Verizon Wireless;Banks feel effects of Ireland downgrade;Vodafone hit a one-month high even as the wider London market struggled for direction.Shares in Vodafone rose 1.4 per cent to 170p amid expectations that Verizon Wireless would start selling Apple’s iPhone early next year. The US joint venture is Vodafone’s biggest unit, contributing about 39 per cent of group earnings.Citigroup forecast that Verizon Wireless would sell 10m iPhones in 2011, a roll-out that will initially weigh on margins. But the expected boost to subscriber growth and average user revenues led Citi to raise its Vodafone earnings forecast by 4.6 per cent for 2012.It recommended that US clients favour Vodafone shares over Verizon’s to benefit from the growth.The last options expiry of the year meant volumes across the wider market were up on recent levels, but the FTSE still ended down 0.2 per cent, or 9.37 points, to 5,871.75. That gave the index a 1 per cent gain for the week.Financial stocks moved lower after a profit warning by Lloyds Banking Groupon bad debts in Ireland.Lloyds, down 3.6 per cent to 66½p, said a 10 per cent of its £26.7bn Irish portfolio would be impaired by the end of the year, meaning more than half the book was classed as non-performing.Royal Bank of Scotland, which has a £55bn Irish loan portfolio, fell 5.7 per cent to 37¾p.Taking Lloyds’ write-off rates would imply another £11bn of impairments at RBS, equivalent to about 10p of book value per share, analysts said.AstraZeneca dropped 6.7 per cent to £29.41 after US regulators unexpectedly requested additional trial analysis for its Brilinta blood thinning drug.“Approval for Brilinta in the US was essential for a positive investment case, as the drug was set to represent 50 per cent of the pipeline’s value out to 2014,” said Raymond James analysts. Even if the drug were to be approved it would not now be on the US market before 2012, when it would face head-to-head competition with generic pills, they said.Fresh snowfalls across Britain weighed on the retailers, with Marks and Spencerdown 1.7 per cent to 375½p, Next off 1.8 per cent to £19.85 and Dixons Retail4.5 per cent weaker at 24¼p.Supergroup lost 3.8 per cent to £13.61. Goldman Sachs cut earnings forecasts by 13 per cent to reflect new tax guidance.Leading the blue-chip risers, Autonomy climbed 5.3 per cent to £15.43 following better than expected results overnight from technology companies including Oracle and Accenture.GKN rose 1.4 per cent to 216¾p, helped by a SocGen upgrade to “buy”.SocGen said: “The recent announcement by carmakers indicating only very short Christmas holidays is likely to mean that GKN’s fourth-quarter sales are ahead of the flat guidance given with the trading statement in mid-October.”Punch Taverns jumped 11.7 per cent to 74½p after the pub operator said it was likely to meet full-year forecasts after sales improved at its managed division.Punch gave no update on its structure but Citi, the company’s house broker, said it could walk away from its debt-burdened tenanted divisions at no cost.The broker upgraded Punch shares to “buy” with a 100p target price.ITE Group, the exhibitions organiser, gained 11.8 per cent to 244p after it bought Moscow-based peer MVK for €33m.Beleaguered fund manager Gartmore climbed 6.1 per cent to 104¾p on a report that it may agree a takeover by Henderson Group within weeks.Traders believe any deal would be largely funded with shares, given Henderson is very unlikely to pay Gartmore’s current price in cash.Among the fallers, Misys slipped 1.4 per cent to 309p. UBS, downgrading to “neutral,” argued that a bid approach appeared unlikely in the near future.888 Holdings jumped 12.6 per cent to 49p on a revival of rumours that the internet casino was a target for Caesars Entertainment, the US gambling group previously known as Harrah’s.Tribal Group rose 10.7 per cent to 47¼p after admitting it was back in talks with a potential bidder, just over a month after its last takeover proposal collapsed.Phorm soared by 72 per cent to 107½p after it raised survival funding. The internet advertising group secured £6m through the issue of convertible secured loan notes carrying an annual coupon of 15 per cent. “The group’s aim is to validate the business model and then secure further funding in order to pay off this to minimise the dilution impact to existing shareholders,” said Mirabaud Securities.Southern Cross Healthcare rose 2.8 per cent to 18½p after dealers picked up on recent stakebuilding. Waterfall, a vehicle for a Guernsey-based fund, took a 9.4 per cent stake in the care homes operator, which said last month it was in talks with potential bidders.Bezant Resources rose 6.6 per cent to 41¼p after the miner published estimates showing total recoverable reserves at the flagship Mankayan project in the Philippines of 811,000 tonnes of copper and 2.21m ounces of gold. Investors expect another update on the project early next year.Noricum Gold rose to 6.13p on its first day on Aim following a placing at 4p to raise £2.1m. The money would be used to fund the first stage of exploration at its primary asset, the Rotgülden gold project in Austria, the company said.

457;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-16T22:22:43Z;Oracle turns up heat on rivals;;Larry Ellison, the chief executive officer of Oracle, turned up the heat on rivals SAP and Hewlett-Packard on Thursday as he predicted that the US software company would eat into some of the most profitable parts of both companies’ markets next year.His comments came as Oracle reported an unexpectedly strong bounce in new software sales in its most recent quarter, lifting its shares to their highest level in more than eight years and giving it a stock market value roughly equal to that of HP and SAP combined.The figures capped a year in which Oracle has registered a faster rebound from the recession than most other tech companies that sell to large companies and governments, cementing its push into new markets.Underpinning the latest figures was a 21 per cent increase in sales of new software licences to $2bn, with growth coming equally from the database and middleware division as well as the more volatile applications software business. Oracle had predicted growth of between 6 and 16 per cent in the closely watched indicator of new demand.The company’s shares jumped more than 4 per cent in after-market trading to touch $31.60 – nearly double their level at the start of last year.Mr Ellison’s latest attack on SAP and Hewlett-Packard followed his goading of both companies during the recent trial that resulted in a $1.3bn damages award against SAP for copyright infringement.Commenting on Oracle’s latest figures, Mr Ellison pointed to a 32 per cent increase in application software sales in Europe as evidence of market share gains against SAP, and predicted that a long-awaited range of software to be launched next year would extend Oracle’s gains.Mark Hurd, the former HP boss who is now co-president at Oracle, added of the latest advance: “It was broad-based, when you look at the [applications] business in Europe. This has been a pretty steady progression.”Mr Ellison also said Oracle was taking aim at HP’s high-end server business, the most profitable part of the market, with an integrated database product called Exadata that has already attracted orders of $2bn.Overall revenues advanced to $8.6bn, compared to Wall Street expectations of $8.4bn, partly reflecting the acquisition of Sun Microsystems earlier this year.The higher sales boosted pro-forma earnings per share – the basis on which Wall Street assesses the company – by 33 per cent to 51 cents, compared to forecasts of 46 cents.
458;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-14T20:54:38Z;Obama meets with billionaires over wealth pledge;;President Barack Obama met with two of the richest men in the world – Bill Gates and Warren Buffett – to discuss the two moguls’ “Giving Pledge”, which asks the wealthiest individuals and families in America to commit most of their wealth to philanthropy.There was no word from the White House, however, about whether or not Mr Gates and his wife Melinda or Mr Buffett raised concerns over another issue that is close to their hearts: the estate tax.A deal between Mr Obama and Republicans on Capitol Hill includes a provision that would drastically cut an inheritance tax for the wealthiest American families. The change in the estate tax – sometimes referred to as the “death tax” by conservative critics – has outraged Democrats who say it will only help about 6,400 of the richest estates in the country.Mr Buffett and the Gates family have long argued in favour of a more progressive tax on the rich. In 2007 testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr Buffett said: “A progressive and meaningful estate tax is needed to curb the movement of a democracy toward plutocracy”. The White House has admitted that it is no fan of the provision, but said its inclusion was necessary to reach a broader deal with Republicans.The meeting on Tuesday included a discussion of how to grow the economy and make America more competitive, including investments in education, the White House said.Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and financiers Carl Icahn and Michael Milken, and Larry Ellison of Oracle have signed on to the Giving Pledge. Mr Buffett has pledged nearly his entire $45bn fortune to charity. The bulk of his wealth is directed to the Gates Foundation.
459;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Accounting: The impact of speed on cost is substantial;;"Most large enterprises and many medium-sized and small businesses have installed enterprise re­source planning (ERP) systems, often from the market leaders SAP or Oracle, to provide the technological underpinning for their business activities.These large, complex software suites have taken automation to a new and much improved level, but for optimum financial efficiency – and that includes closing the monthly or quarterly accounts quickly and accurately – technology alone is not enough.Experts agree the watchword today is: get the finance right and enable that through technology.Peter Lumley, business intelligence specialist with PA Consulting, argues that even with the best ERP systems, organisations will struggle if they have not paid attention to good accounting practices.“Just getting the basics right is what delivers speed in closing the accounts. I have been working with a company that had multiple general ledger structures: when it came to consolidating their results they had to do a huge amount of re-orienting, restructuring and moving data around.“We helped implement a new general ledger structure across Europe and that has made a big difference”.How do you move finance on to a technological footing? Mr Lumley says there are a number of factors to consider.“The first is about master data: getting the organisational structure right – common data structures, consistent use of document types, common policies, common controls. The next is about end-to-end business work flow, where you can have lots of people all doing things slightly differently”.He gives the example of an issue whose resolution may lie outside the finance department – clearing an invoice for a customer payment. “Technology can help, but it will not solve the problem. You have to understand where these external processes affect you” he says.Craig Jepson, a financial consultant with IFS, an ERP vendor, points out that financial information in an ERP system has often to be manually checked against data in other systems or documents in order to verify, and close accounts.“Does the stock valuation in the general ledger, for example, agree with the stock valuation analysis by product code in the ERP application’s distribution module? Or, do wage control accounts balance, and did the business pay the correct deductions to the pension company?”Mr Jepson says this pro­cess can be made easier using software tools such as automated postings and general ledger matching, available in ERP applications. These integrate financial systems with other areas of the business such as human resources, payroll and distribution. However, “in ERP applications that are not integrated,” he warns, “such automated processes are more difficult to do and usually require customisation”.An efficient “financial close”, the process by which a company completes its accounting cycles and produces financial information both for internal management analysis and for legally required external reporting, is a cornerstone of good business practice.The benefits include: rapid access to financial data that can allow managers quickly to identify and deal with problem areas; more time for accounting staff to analyse data and provide information and improved control systems.According to a discussion document by SAP, “the cost impact of a fast close is substantial. A streamlined close process offers time savings in terms of manual intervention, error reconciliation, variance analysis, and data processing and collection …These time savings can then be quantified into numbers of staff days, which, in turn can result in reduced headcount, fewer temporary staff working on low-value activities, and reduced recruitment costs.”Prizes well worth having. And the answer may well lie in the ERP system itself.Paul Massey, managing director IFS Europe West, calculates that up to 90 per cent of ERP systems in use feature financial applications that are linked to other applications and can be used to facilitate the closure process.The level of integration varies significantly, however. Only 30 to 40 per cent are integrated to the level at which some kind of manual reconciliation will be unnecessary, he thinks.The issue is complicated by companies taking project dimensions into account – that is, accounting for work in progress in a period when there have been no sales. So what should an organisation do if its current ERP system is less than fully integrated? “Buy a fully integrated system” Mr Massey smiles.Using the system to drive the business is good practice, experts agree, but the need is for one that is scalable and able to cope with the numerous upsets business will throw at it.Built-in alerts to warn of problems and the creation of a work flow system to improve efficiency are all part of the solution according to Mr Lumley of PA.Building a work flow system is reasonably simple, but a sound understanding of the way the organisation works is critical, he says.Large companies will have those skills. Smaller organisations may struggle without help."
460;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-07T23:23:52Z;Competitive difference is in the analysis;;People, not computers, drive corporate strategy. But modern information technology is a vital tool in ensuring that plans are turned into reality.The workhorse of corporate IT systems is enterprise resource planning, an integrated computer-based system for managing internal and external resources. Now entering its third decade, ERP is being constantly updated as software suppliers and their corporate clients seek to make it more effective as a management tool.“Many organisations worldwide have successfully optimised their business processes by using ERP,” says Oracle, a leading supplier, in a plug for its latest ERP enhancement called enterprise performance management or EPM.It comments: “Most organisations have access to ample data on both the market and their internal operations. The competitive difference comes from the analysis, interpretation and actions based on this data.”The aim of these enhanced systems is to provide ever faster and more comprehensive information, to shorten financial reporting and planning cycles and to reduce the cost and complexity of managing IT.The challenge facing companies after the economic turmoil generated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers is to respond to increasingly volatile markets. They need to interpret the mass of data generated by IT systems and to respond effectively over ever-shortening timescales.“In the world we are in now, every company needs to run scenarios around their strategy,” says Andrew Meade, UK head of finance and performance management for Accenture, the consulting business. “You can’t make assumptions and hope they will work out.“IT allows you to compare actual outcomes with your forecasts and scenarios, pulling in outside sources of information alongside internal metrics and data. There is no real stability at the moment.“There are so many moving parts that understanding how they impact and what tweaks you need to make to strategy is really important.“If you are a global player, currencies can have a huge impact on the performance of your business,” Mr Meade says. “A manufacturing company may be heavily dependent on volatile inputs such as oil or metals. When the chief financial officer looks at his strategy, he wants to know what will be the impact on profitability from a shareholder point of view.”Faced with the mass of information generated by modern IT systems, companies are increasingly making use of “dashboards” to present the most vital data in an easy-to-read format.“You acquire the information on production, stocks and customers and create a dashboard that allows you to do the executive planning in the boardroom,” says Nigel Trapp, sales manager for global accounts at SAP, a software group.The screen shows top-level information in the form of bar charts and dials like the dashboard of a car but allows users to “drill down” to the data the screen presentation is based on, to query assumptions and gain a fuller knowledge of developments.One client – an oil company – makes use of dashboards in its central control room to monitor production volumes at different rigs in real time.“Companies that don’t use this technology may have to wait several months for the information,” says Mr Trapp.“Companies that do, can manage daily operations and set strategy. They can see which direction they are going in and whether they are creating value and adjust plans accordingly.”A key feature of IT management systems is their ability to bring together managers across dispersed locations. “The best systems allow people to bring together ideas and objections on a particular topic,” says Jean-Claude Delcroix, vice-president for research at Gartner, an IT consultancy.Large companies have traditionally had the need and the resources to install complex IT systems, but suppliers are attempting to extend their use to smaller businesses.SAP is targeting the small and medium-sized sector with Business ByDesign, making use of the internet to provide a low-cost business management tool.“Big companies will have IT departments and data centres and make use of large numbers of consultants,” explains Mr Trapp. “Smaller companies don’t want that. This provides the same business processes to anyone with an internet connection.”As mobile devices become more sophisticated, they offer the opportunity for companies to put sales people and service engineers in immediate touch with the head office computer.Partners in a supply chain and customers can check on stocks and the progress of orders. “Information locked up in the back office is of no use to customers,” says Mr Trapp.Despite these attempts to make ERP and other business management systems more widely available, many companies are still failing to employ the latest technologies or are not using them effectively.“More than 35 per cent of the top 5,000 global companies will regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets” in 2012, because of a lack of information, processes and tools, according to a report last year from Gartner.
461;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-06T21:36:56Z;Corporate tech news briefs;;Federal agency aims to cut costs with Gmail and Google AppsThe US General Services Administration (GSA) is ditching in-house email in favour of Google’s cloud-based email and its Google Apps suite of collaborative software. Over 17,000 federal employees and contractors will switch to Google’s cloud-based software and the GSA expects that the move will save around 50 percent of the costs of running its current in-house email system over the next five years. The deal is a big coup for Google and a blow to critics who argue that cloud-based computing is inherently less secure than keeping emails and other data on premises. Earlier this year, Google became the first vendor of cloud-based software to gain the Federal Information Security Management Act (Fisma) certification, which is mandatory for federal agencies.NetSuite disses SAP’s cloud-based software appsLike German cars, SAP’s business software has a reputation for solid performance – and premium pricing. But is the pricey reputation deserved? US rival NetSuite has done the sums and calculates that its own cloud-based enterprise software works out from 40 percent to 70 percent cheaper than SAP’s cloud-based Business ByDesign software, which was launched belatedly this summer. The savings vary according to the number of “seats” licensed and the chosen industry. NetSuite’s total cost of ownership over five years is just over $187,000 for ten users while for an equivalent ten-user installation of SAP’s software, the rival firm calculates a TCO of at least $496,000 using the TCO calculator on SAP’s website. Like many traditional software companies, SAP is struggling to find a strategy for cloud-based computing that does not cannibalise the revenue stream it gets from conventional software.Oracle launches dedicated database hardwareSAP’s nemesis Oracle, meanwhile, is showing off some new hardware – or rather the hardware it inherited from its controversial acquisition of Sun Microsystems earlier this year. The Sparc Supercluster is a high-end dedicated database machine that can include dozens of rack-mount servers. It is based on the 16-core Sparc T3 processor, solid state storage and Oracle’s Real Application Clusters software. Many businesses must scratch their heads at the sight of a software giant that now also wants to sell them computer hardware, but if anyone can pull off this trick, Oracle probably can.Malware’s shrinking lifespanEver wondered where all the malware went? It’s still out there of course, but security software vendors have become a lot more effective in rapidly neutralising threats before they reach pandemic proportions. Spain’s Panda Software reports that the average lifespan of malware has reduced dramatically in recent years, with 54 percent of malware surviving just 24 hours. But the number of malware variants just keeps growing, from 55,000 a day in 2009 to 63,000 a day this year. As antivirus software detects new malware more quickly, hackers modify them or create new ones so as to evade detection. Panda Software says businesses need to ensure their protection software is capable of detecting new threats in those critical first 24 hours.Red Hat may rule roostRed Hat could soon be the only game in town for enterprises looking to run their business on the Linux operating system. Last month, Attachmate acquired Novell, whose Suse Linux slugs it out with Red Hat’s Enterprise Linux in the “business-class” Linux market. Attachmate has little track record in this particular market and so analysts expect it will ultimately choose to sell the Suse Linux business to a big-name software vendor such as an IBM or Oracle. There’s no immediate threat to businesses that currently use Suse Linux, as Attachmate looking forward to the support revenue streams generated by Suse Linux customer base. But because of the long-term uncertainty, there is a risk that the ongoing development of Suse Linux will stall, allowing Red Hat to gain a lead in the innovation race. Indeed, Red Hat has just acquired Makara, a software tools vendor, in a bid to make it easier for businesses to develop Red Hat Linux-based software for cloud computing.
462;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-12-03T22:19:02Z;Microsoft buys stake in IBM accuser;;Microsoft has made an investment in TurboHercules, a small French software company whose complaint of anticompetitive business practices against IBM helped to stir up a European investigation into the US computer group.News that the world’s biggest software company has backed a company at the centre of a dispute involving a rival is likely to be watched with interest in Brussels, given a wider pattern that has emerged in investigations involving the technology industry.Other small tech companies or trade groups which launch antitrust complaints often have links to the industry’s biggest players.TurboHercules accused IBM of illegally “tying” its dominant mainframe operating system to mainframe hardware, making it impossible for other companies to sell technology to the large installed base of customers for IBM’s mainframe machines. The complaint led Brussels to open a formal inquiry into suspected abuse of a dominant position by IBM this year.Microsoft sought to depict its investment as a natural alliance. “Microsoft shares TurboHercules’ belief that there needs to be greater openness and choice for customers in the mainframe market,” it said. “Customers tell us that they want greater interoperability between the mainframe and other platforms, including systems that run Windows Server. For that reason, we continue to invest in companies like TurboHercules to develop new solutions for our mutual customers.”The move echoes investments Microsoft has made in companies that have become thorns in IBM’s side. For instance, T3, which complained about IBM’s behaviour in the mainframe market, also had Microsoft as an investor. The software company also put money into PSI, which complained to Brussels over the mainframe market, though it was eventually bought out by IBM.In another current case, three complaints were made about Google’s behaviour in the online search market. One came from a company owned by Microsoft and another from a member of a trade group in which Microsoft has a strong hand.But complaints about Microsoft’s behaviour in the browser market – investigated at length by Brussels – were also backed by a different trade group which counted IBM and Oracle among its members.Microsoft’s investment was announced by TurboHercules, set up to market open-source mainframe “emulator” software, allowing mainframe applications to run on non-IBM hardware. It said Microsoft’s funding was its first “outside investment” although it says it hoped to bring in other investors.IBM denies acting illegally in the TurboHercules/T3 case, and said it was entitled to defend its intellectual property.
463;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-29T22:19:11Z;Leadership is not just for the extroverts;Introverts often do better because they actually listen;One of the paradoxes of leadership is that the people who most want to lead are often the last people we would want given the responsibility. The pushy hack, the selfish careerist and the ruthless opportunist are just some of the unpleasant types who tend to force their way to the top. They thrive in hyper-competitive environments. Decent people, who might actually make better leaders, seem to have a harder time scrambling upwards. They may have exactly what it takes to lead, but lack what it takes to get the chance.My smell test for business leaders is if they talk about the importance of humility. The moment the word leaves their mouth, I assume they are the worst kind of corporate hypocrite, on the very simple basis that truly humble people don’t boast about being humble.One way academics have sought to categorise the character traits required to succeed has been to divide us into extroverts and introverts, and much research has found that it is the extroverts who do best.Extroverts like to be the centre of attention, seek status and approval and talk a lot in social settings. They are good at motivating employees and leading change. Consequently, they earn more and get more promotions. Larry Ellison of Oracle and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase are prominent extrovert leaders, thrusting themselves forward in their company’s interests.So what hope is there for introverts? Are they simply to bask in the sun of the extroverts? Or can they lead too? Absolutely, say Adam Grant, Francesca Gino and David Hoffman, business school professors and authors of an intriguing new paper, “Reversing the Extroverted Leadership Advantage: The Role of Employee Proactivity”, published in the Academy of Management Journal. They argue that one key variable has been underestimated in the argument over which character-type does best in business. And that is the degree to which a manager’s employees are proactive.If employees are passive, they found, an extrovert thrives by giving a clear lead. If employees are more proactive, the introvert does better because he actually listens and incorporates their advice into his decision-making.What is novel here is that up to now, the advice for introverts in business has generally been to be more extroverted, to follow the old salesman’s mantra, “act enthusiastic to be enthusiastic”. But many forced grins later, is this really the best way for them to succeed?It is clearly not necessary to be the life and soul of a party in order to run a great business. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are neither natural glad-handers nor extroverts, but all have the bullheadedness and genius that drags others along. Anna Wintour at Vogue and Giorgio Armani are frosty characters who are nonetheless accomplished managers in a highly creative industry. Sir Richard Branson has turned himself into an extrovert for the public but is said to be an introvert in private.The academics drew on two sets of data. The first was from a chain of pizza restaurants, where they analysed financial performance and the nature of the managers and employees. The second came from a lab experiment, where they asked people to act either extroverted or introverted in managing a group folding T-shirts. The evidence showed that a proactive group either butted heads or felt underappreciated working for an extrovert leader and performed better under an introvert. The passive groups worked best for an extrovert and felt lost under an introvert.Prof Grant told me that introverts do especially well at engineering and accounting companies, which tend to emphasise technical skills over personality. But other industries, especially those “with a lot of velocity and environmental turbulence”, could benefit from hiring, valuing and promoting more introverts.Extrovert leaders might succeed in these environments, but it’s rather like putting all your money on a single number on the roulette wheel. Far better to have an introvert leader ready to absorb a lot of input in order to discover the best processes or business models.To get to be leaders, introverts must still prove themselves terrific individual contributors. Without the noise and flash of the extrovert, they will have to find subtler ways to show they can lead. But once in a leadership or managerial position, they no longer need to worry about loosening up at parties and becoming more extroverted.Instead, they can succeed by surrounding themselves with proactive employees, and giving them the autonomy and responsibility they require to perform at their best. They can focus on encouraging behaviour that complements their existing style rather than trying to acquire an awkward new one.philip@philipdelvesbroughton.com
464;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-29T17:11:26Z;Oracle court win casts pall over 3rd-party application maintenance providers;;When a jury in California last week settled on a record-breaking $1.3bn damages award against SAP for copyright infringement, the reverberations could be felt far beyond the software company’s mheadquarters in Walldorf, Germany.Oracle, which brought the case, has sent a dramatic message to other companies that offer cut-rate maintenance and support for its applications software. The result will be a set-back for a corner of the IT market that promises to save some companies large amounts on their software bills, according to industry observers.“It clearly casts a pall over third-party maintenance,” said Josh Greenbaum, an analyst at Enterprise Application Consulting. “It brings a fear-factor into the marketplace.”The stunning award against SAP stemmed from its 2005 acquisition of TomorrowNow, a small US services company that offered low-cost support contracts to customers of PeopleSoft. With Oracle having just acquired PeopleSoft, SAP hoped it would be able to lure away some of its customers, first by selling them maintenance before eventually switching them to its own software.The broad legality of selling third-party maintenance and support like this is not in dispute, and its financial attractions are clear: independent services companies generally promise to halve a customer’s maintenance bills. Maintenance fees account for roughly half of the $45bn enterprise applications software business and generate operating profit margins of more than 90 per cent, says Paul Hamerman, an analyst at Forrester, making the TomorrowNow case of more than academic interest.The precise practices of the third-party service companies, however, had not tested in court previously - and that continues to be so after the TomorrowNow case, since SAP admitted liability before the start of the trial, which was held only to determine the level of damages.The case should prompt customers to take a much closer look at the practices of the services companies, says Mr Hamerman. Customers may not share any legal liability, but they face the risk of operational disruption if it turns out their service provider has acted illegally, he adds.That consideration has not been lost on Oracle, which earlier this year also sued Rimini Street, one of the more prominent third-party companies, which was set up by a former TomorrowNow executive.The legal problems at TomorrowNow stemmed from the way it handled software “patches” and regulatory updates that PeopleSoft created for its customers. It is common practice in the industry that when customers give up paying for support contracts to a company like PeopleSoft, they download all the software updates to which they are entitled in case of future need.TomorrowNow, acting on behalf of customers, performed this task, keeping the software on its own servers - and then using some of the patches for other customers, even if they were not entitled to them.Rimini Street, for its part, denies acting in this way and says it has not violated any of Oracle’s copyrights. The company has its own team of developers that write software patches for clients that don’t have the right to them from Oracle directly, says Mr Hamerman.But given the lack of clarity around practices in this area, the admitted flaws at TomorrowNow will make many potential customers think twice. Third-party maintenance is already a minority practice beyond the interest of most customers - since they would lose access to future upgrades to the software, most companies pay up rather than try to find a way around the high annual fees. They are even less likely to show an interest now.“The general impression from this ruling is that it will be harder and harder to get out from under high maintenance costs. Customers will just have to bite the bullet and pay,” says Mr Greenbaum.That is something about which established software companies seem only too well aware. Earlier this year, after buying Sun Microsystems, Oracle made changes to maintenance and support terms for Sun’s customers that have drawn complaints in some quarters. The Service Industry Association, which represents independent support firms, recently protested to the US justice department, claiming that Oracle was acting anti-competitivley by penalising companies that opt out of its support contracts.Sun customers are presented with an “all or nothing” option, preventing them from choosing to buy support for only some of their technology, and suffer penalties if they drop a support contract only to return later, according to the SIA. Oracle’s response: changes to Sun support contracts represent a simplification that enhances the value to customers.Escaping potentially onerous maintenance costs is getting more difficult. In the applications business, an annual fee equal to 22 per cent of original purchase price of the software has become the norm, thanks to companies like Oracle and SAP. One alternative, says Mr Greenbaum, might be to consider switching to Microsoft, which charges lower maintenance fees for its enterprise applications. But given their existing sunk investments in existing systems, few are likely to be able to avail themselves of options like this.

It beat expectations in its third quarter as same-store sales rose 7 per cent. It also raised its earnings forecast for the full year to a range above analysts’ expectations.Durable goods orders unexpectedly fell in October, down 3.3 per cent, in the biggest drop since January 2009. The jump in September was revised higher to an increase of 5 per cent.But S&P 500 industrials still managed to rise the most in the wider indices, up 2.1 per cent, with Caterpillar up 2.5 per cent to $84.69, Textron up 4.2 per cent to $22.44 and Cummins up 3.9 per cent to $98.65.Deere fell 0.1 per cent to $76.23, even though the maker of farm equipment issued a profit forecast for 2011 that fell short of analyst estimates. It beat expectations in its fourth quarter as sales shot up 35 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Shares in Dynegy rose 2.6 per cent to $5.13 after it was reported that it might get an offer of more than $6 a share from Seneca Capital and another investor.On Tuesday Dynegy ended an agreement to sell itself to Blackstone Group.
466;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-24T19:54:58Z;SAP considers its options after $1.3bn fine;;SAP said it would “consider all available options” and hinted it would seek a settlement after a US jury imposed a $1.3bn fine on the German group for illegally downloading rival Oracle’s software.The decision, dubbed Oracle’s “toxic Christmas present” by one analyst, is a significant setback for SAP’s new management just as it had started to boost morale at the world’s largest maker of business applications software.“This is an embarrassing debacle for the management but they will blame it on the prior regime and say that they will move forward,” said Paul Hamerman, analyst at Forrester.“The $1.3bn is higher than we expected and marks an all-time high with respect to software patent infringement cases,” said Thomas Becker, analyst at Commerzbank. The damage award is eight times higher than the $160m provision that SAP has made in its balance sheet.The ultimate fine will still have to be decided upon by the judge, and could well be lower than what the six jurors have deemed appropriate. SAP said on Wednesday that it would “consider all available options”.It also hinted that it was still hoping for an out-of-court settlement with Oracle: “We continue to hope that the matter can be resolved appropriately without more years of litigation.”However, the US group has refused to consider a settlement up to now, opting instead to make full use of the high-profile case, and SAP’s admission of wrong-doing, to put its rival on the defensive.Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executives, have repeatedly claimed that they have boosted employees’ confidence since they took over in February in the wake of a management shake-up.SAP had been hit hard in the past year by a loss of business momentum, as well as employee and customer trust.The new management duo accelerated software development and said it aimed to “disrupt” Oracle’s business model with the $5.8bn purchase of database and mobile software specialist Sybase.However, the decision by a jury in Oakland, California, is a huge setback.During a three-week trial, SAP had admitted that its former TomorrowNow subsidiary had illegally accessed Oracle’s servers to download millions of files. But it had said it owed Oracle not more than $40m in damages.The trial featured harsh accusations against SAP’s former and current top management by a number of Oracle’s executives, including Larry Ellison, chief executive. It also saw Mr McDermott apologising for the patent infringements.Analysts said it would be unlikely for SAP to challenge the expected court ruling, given the unpredictable outcome of an appeal and the fact that it would trigger more bad publicity.SAP’s shares shed more than 1 per cent on Wednesday, cutting nearly $600m from its stock market value. Analysts said that the damages award would inflict little financial harm on the company, which would be able to pay the amount out of existing cash reserves, or out of its cash flow. Oracle’s shares rose 2 per cent on Wednesday.
467;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-24T16:57:21Z;SAP / Oracle;German software company’s path to innovation is temporarily blocked;How valuable a few extra days of due diligence might have been. SAP has been ordered to pay $1.3bn in damages to arch-foe Oracle, for software stolen by a subsidiary the German software company acquired for $10m in 2005.It was a blockbuster end to a dramatic trial but SAP’s investors seem unruffled by the verdict, with the shares falling a mere 1 per cent or so in response. Why so relaxed? The damages may well be reduced on appeal, the case was well known and even the full amount is equal to only 2 per cent or so of SAP’s market capitalisation. Technology companies sue each other so often it is almost a cost of doing business.Still, investors should not be complacent. Lawsuits in the technology sector might be 10 a penny, but this one is big enough to draw attention. At the risk of stating the obvious, it does not look good to have an (albeit defunct) subsidiary found guilty of stealing another company’s software. And Larry Ellison, Oracle’s pugnacious chief executive, will not let SAP or its potential clients forget it.There could be strategic repercussions too. Morgan Stanley expects SAP to generate about €2bn in free cash flow this year and €2.6bn next year. So while SAP can afford to pay the full amount, and leave the €600m or so dividend unaffected, it may delay major investments or acquisitions. SAP, always very conservative in its financing, has net debt after paying $5.8bn for Sybase in May. It usually waits until it is back in the black before splashing out again.Bill McDermott and Jim Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executives who took over nine months ago, promised they would inject more innovation and urgency into a company dogged with an old-school reputation.

468;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;SAP ordered to pay $1.3bn to Oracle;;SAP has been ordered to pay $1.3bn in damages over a case of admitted copyright infringement in the US, handing a major victory to arch-rival Oracle after a four-year legal battle.The award was made on Tuesday by a jury in Oakland, California after a three-week trial that pitted the US and German software giants in open court.SAP had admitted that a Texas-based subsidiary, TomorrowNow, had illegally accessed Oracle’s servers and stolen its software, though it argued that the damages should not top $40m.”We are, of course, disappointed by this verdict and will pursue all available options, including post-trial motions and appeal if necessary,” SAP said.The verdict by six jurors came after a day of deliberation, and amounted to a sweeping vindication of arguments that had been presented by a succession of Oracle executives, including Larry Ellison, chief executive officer.Oracle had claimed that it was owed at least $1.7bn, or what it said it would have charged SAP for a license to use the software legally. The German company, on the other hand, had argued that the damages should be limited to the value it had got out of its actual use of the software, which it described as negligible.The damages award came on top of with a $120m payment that SAP had already agreed to make to cover Oracle’s legal costs.According to Bloomberg, the award is the largest ever in a US copyright case, and nearly ten times the damages in the next-biggest case.
469;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-23T00:23:52Z;HP sales climb 8% in fourth quarter;;Hewlett-Packard reported a better-than-expected 8 per cent climb in fourth-quarter sales, led by a 25 per cent jump in server and storage revenue.The world’s biggest technology company by revenue raised its profit forecast for the year just begun and executives said they were committed to increasing services and software sales, with each rising by 1 per cent or less in the quarter.In his first earnings call since taking the helm of HP a few weeks ago, chief executive Léo Apotheker said he had met thousands of employees.He said he had also been ignoring jibes from Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive.Mr Ellison has been lashing out at HP’s board for appointing the former head of Oracle’s rival SAP at a time when the two are battling in a US federal court.The lawsuit, over SAP’s liability for improper access to Oracle code, went to a jury on Monday.“A competitor has tried to distract us and you,” Mr Apotheker said in a call with reporters. “We have an impressive ability to execute and a strong momentum going into next year.”HP earned $2.54bn in the quarter just ended, or $1.10 a share, up from $2.41bn and 99 cents, on $33.3bn in sales.On a non-GAAP basis adjusted mainly for amortisation of intangibles and restructuring charges, earnings per share rose 17 per cent to $1.33, beating consensus estimates.HP raised its forecast for the new fiscal year, to sales of between $132bn and $133.5bn and non-GAAP earnings per share of between $5.16 and $5.26, up 13 to 15 per cent from the year ended October 31.In after-hours trading, HP shares rose more than 3 per cent to $44.60.Mr Apotheker and other executives made clear that they were doing away with some of the austerity imposed by his predecessor, Mark Hurd.They said they would resume paying rises and bonuses and would raise spending on salespeople and research and development.Executives said they were happy with the quality and quantity of service deals lined up for the next few quarters and planned to make software a bigger part of the company’s revenue, both on its own and by integrating it with hardware offerings.Sales of servers and storage rose to $5.3bn in the quarter, throwing off $730m in operating profit compared with $481m a year earlier.
470;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-15T19:36:57Z;EMC to acquire data storage rival for $2.4bn;;EMC, the largest data-storage company by revenue, is to buy Isilon, its much smaller rival, for $2.4bn in cash, giving a further boost to an already lively market for technology mergers as companies seek to broaden their product portfolios.The purchase price of $33.85 a share in cash, announced on Monday, represents a 29 per cent premium to Isilon’s closing price on Friday. The stock surged 28 per cent on Monday , after having already doubled in value this year.The Seattle-based company has made a loss every year since it was founded in 2001, turning in revenue of just $123m in the 2009 financial year. EMC said the deal would cement its position as the leader in the increasingly important data storage sector, as customers shift to cloud computing – the use of technology to access remote computing power and data over the internet.“Together Isilon and Atmos [a similar offering from EMC] represent [a] great one-two punch,” Joe Tucci, chief executive, told investors on a conference call. EMC shares slipped less than 1 per cent in late trade.Other storage companies surged as investors bet that consolidation in the sector would accelerate. Anticipated demand for high-end storage is leading the acquisition frenzy. EMC, which has made some smaller storage deals, needs to stay active because deeper-pocketed and more generalised technology rivals are also spending heavily in the sector. Hewlett-Packard, the leading technology company by revenue, in September beat rival Dell in an intense bidding war for 3Par, the data storage company, agreeing to pay $2.4bn.IBM later that month bought Netezza , which makes storage appliances and analytics, for $1.7bn. Oracle and Cisco are all vying to become one-stop shops for cloud computing.Storage and analysis tools are vital as businesses shift toward the cloud. Mr Tucci said the amount of electronic data being amassed is more than doubling every 18 months and could increase more than 40-fold in the next decade.Companies therefore need cost-effective access to remote data and tools to process it. But the prices being paid raise the stakes for the new competition.Isilon has just 500 employees. It offers network-attached storage that can be built out rapidly as the need arises. Its 1,200 customers include Sony and Eastman Kodak.Mark Moskowitz, analyst at JPMorgan, said the deal was modest in impact but “a good strategic move” despite the expense, in that it keeps Isilon’s still-emerging technology out of the hands of other companies.EMC’s most valuable asset is its majority stake in VMware, a leading virtualisation software company that allows technology buyers to leverage their hardware assets by running simultaneous tasks on the same computer servers.
471;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-12T22:47:52Z;It is time to beware the sound of trumpets;True market panics come once or twice a generation;We may not listen to such advice in the heat of the moment – in fact by definition we do not on average – but we’ve all been told that it’s wise to go against the crowd during extremes in stock market sentiment.Whether it is through old chestnuts such as Baron de Rothschild’s “buy to the sound of cannons, sell to the sound of trumpets” or the Oracle of Omaha’s more modern advice to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful”, avoiding the madness of crowds is hardly a novel idea.This is fine as far as it goes, but true market panics or manias and their opportunity for rich profits or avoidance of crippling losses come perhaps once or twice a generation.What about the numerous smaller peaks and valleys in-between? They are hard enough to identify for individual stocks – how many predictions were there that Apple shares were frothy $50 or $100 ago? – but tools exist. For example a classic paper, Dumb Money by Owen Lamont and Andrea Frazzini identifies frothy stocks or sectors based on mutual fund inflows.If getting it right on the scale of a single stock is tricky, then doing so for the market as a whole should be far harder. Many traders track data such as equity mutual fund inflows for clues but this has a spotty record.Consider how well precious metals and bond funds have done while absorbing record inflows in the past several months. But there is at least one freely available indicator that nicely captures the public mood: the American Association of Individual Investors weekly sentiment survey. This non-profit investor education group allows its 150,000 paying members to vote once a week on how they think stocks will do in the next six months.Some 58 per cent of respondents said they were “bullish” about equities in the survey conducted during the week ending November 10, a rise of 9.3 percentage points and the highest since early 2007. Since the survey began in 1987, there have been only 65 weekly observations with a higher percentage of bullish respondents, placing the current mood near the top 5 per cent overall.Such optimism is most assuredly not a good sign. On average, the S&P 500 lost 2 per cent in the year after such a high reading. Among the most bullish weeks overall were surveys just before the 1987 and 2000 stock market crashes. Overall, the market was lower 30 out of 65 times, a very bad ratio.By contrast, if one looks at the 65 instances when bullishness was lowest, there were only three times that stocks were lower a year later and all three came in 2008, before or during the Bear Stearns crisis.This was a prelude to bigger problems at Lehman, AIG and elsewhere that year and a market bottom in March 2009. Even including these big drops, the market rose by an impressive 15.2 per cent on average after lows in bullishness.Of course this is an erratic series and many respondents report that they are “neutral” each week. But some savvy market watchers have included the AAII survey in more complex timing models.Indeed, the last peak in AAII bullishness coincided with a prescient warning from fund manager John Hussman, a former finance professor who has outperformed the market in part by being hedged when conditions seemed unfavourable.The most extreme set of negative conditions on his spectrum are dubbed “hazardous ovoboby”, short for “overvalued, overbought, overbullish conditions, coupled with upward pressure on yields”.The January 2007 peak came several days before a sharp market plunge and the initial brush fires of the subprime crisis that would soon engulf the markets.Dr Hussman’s ‘ovoboby’ conditions prevailed just before a veritable rogue’s gallery of market swoons such as April 1965, January 1973, August 1987 and March 2000, plus a handful of false alarms. Not all the criteria exist today but he is cautious nonetheless.Still, with leading stock indices hitting two-year highs recently and investors having bought furiously ahead of last week’s announcement of quantitative easing, one can almost hear the trumpets.spencer.jakab@ft.com
472;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-10T22:26:35Z;Ellison is not Silicon Valley’s judge;The Oracle chief’s accusations against Hewlett-Packard’s Léo Apotheker are overblown;"The world of enterprise applications software is short on entertainment, so we can thank Larry Ellison for providing some. This week, Oracle’s co-founder and chief executive hired private detectives to serve a court subpoena on Léo Apotheker, Hewlett-Packard’s new chief executive.Mr Ellison is irate at various targets – at HP for ejecting his friend Mark Hurd as its chief executive (Mr Ellison has since appointed Mr Hurd as co-president of Oracle); at SAP, his German competitor, for allowing its former subsidiary TomorrowNow to take Oracle software; and at Mr Apotheker, formerly SAP’s chief executive, for his role in both companies.Hardly a day goes by without Mr Ellison assailing Mr Apotheker – notably for allegedly overseeing “an industrial espionage scheme centring on the repeated theft of massive amounts of Oracle’s software” at SAP. Mr Ellison did not mention his bête noire in testimony in the SAP-Oracle trial this week but he wants him to be grilled by David Boies, Oracle’s lawyer.Mr Ellison’s accusations against Mr Apotheker are overblown. While SAP’s executives ought to have spotted that something was wrong at TomorrowNow and acted to prevent it more quickly, there is no evidence of Mr Apotheker condoning theft of Oracle’s property – or that he is morally unfit to head HP.Oracle’s chief executive should take some deep breaths and calm down. Perhaps HP should have stuck with Mr Hurd, and maybe Mr Apotheker ought to have done more to stop copyright infringement at TomorrowNow. But Mr Ellison is ill-suited to his self-appointed role as Silicon Valley’s ethics tsar.Oracle is a highly competitive company. It has been sued by the Department of Justice for fraudulently overcharging public sector customers, which it denies. The tone is set by Mr Ellison, who is a hard-charging, aggressive entrepreneur. I sympathise with his indignation over TomorrowNow but he should leave it to judges and juries to dispense justice.In the absence of Mr Apotheker, the court has heard evidence of wrongdoing at TomorrowNow, and SAP’s admission to “contributory infringement” of Oracle’s copyright. This does not, however, equate to Mr Ellison’s grand conspiracy.TomorrowNow was a provider of support for software sold by PeopleSoft, a company Oracle bought in 2004 for $10.3bn. Oracle charged customers a fee equivalent to 22 per cent of its software licences per year for fixes, software updates and upgrades, but TomorrowNow offered a limited service at half that price.The PeopleSoft deal made Oracle, which until then had mainly been a database software company, a much stronger competitor to SAP. So the latter’s executives hatched a plan to buy TomorrowNow for $10m and use it to lure PeopleSoft customers over to SAP’s rival applications.In January 2005, SAP’s executive board, including Mr Apotheker, saw a presentation that warned of potential legal problems over the acquisition. It said that Oracle might sue because TomorrowNow stored copies of PeopleSoft software on its servers, rather than solely using customers’ own copies.As it later transpired, that was merely the tip of the iceberg since TomorrowNow was infringing on copyright far more egregiously than that. It was downloading huge amounts of PeopleSoft software and copying not only software fixes and patches but passages from manuals – in other words stealing.After Oracle sued, SAP admitted in July 2007 that TomorrowNow had made “inappropriate downloads” and wound it down in October 2008. Mr Apotheker, who took charge of the sales effort to migrate PeopleSoft customers to SAP, became co-chief executive in April 2008.Despite Mr Ellison’s promises, Oracle has not come up with proof that Mr Apotheker was aware of TomorrowNow’s full misdeeds. His sales role gave him less insight into its software operations than Gerhard Oswald, the SAP executive responsible for software support (who also failed to stop it).The fact that SAP’s board feared legal action does not prove they knew TomorrowNow was so reliant on theft. Software maintenance is a highly profitable part of Oracle’s business, with sales margins of more than 90 per cent, so the company had a strong incentive to try to block any competition.Third-party support of the kind TomorrowNow was overtly engaged in involves what Josh Greenbaum, a technology consultant, calls “a very complex and opaque area of contract law”. Oracle thus might have had scope to sue on lesser grounds.Mr Boies told me Mr Apotheker ought to have known that something was wrong because TomorrowNow offered a support service with 150 employees, compared with Oracle’s 15,000 engineers. “Where did he think all that came from? The software fairy?” he asks.Even Oracle, however, described TomorrowNow’s operating model as a “puzzle” in its complaint against SAP. SAP should have dug deeper, but nothing in all the e-mails and other documents indicates that Mr Apotheker knew the answer.HP was entitled to give the job of chief executive to Mr Apotheker and he should carry on doing it – no matter what Mr Ellison says.john.gapper@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/johngapper"
473;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Stakes raised in Oracle and SAP download battle;;Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive, has put a value of $4bn on software from his company that was downloaded illicitly by a subsidiary of German rival SAP.The amount is 100 times larger than the damages that SAP has argued it should pay for the infringement, and raises the stakes in a courtroom showdown that has brought a rare public confrontation between the software rivals.Called on Monday as a witness for Oracle, Mr Ellison also abandoned his characteristically dismissive public stance towards SAP, instead describing as “brilliant” a strategy that the German company had used to try to outflank his own company.The trial, which began last week, stems from SAP’s admission that a US subsidiary, TomorrowNow, downloaded documents and software from Oracle’s servers, despite not having authorisation.TomorrowNow was bought by SAP at the start of 2005 as a way of countering Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft, a deal that catapulted Oracle into stronger contention with SAP in the business applications market.By offering support and maintenance services to PeopleSoft customers through TomorrowNow, SAP hoped to lure them away from Oracle and eventually convert them to its own software.The strategy eventually flopped, with only 358 of PeopleSoft’s 10,000 customers making the switch. SAP was later forced to admit that TomorrowNow had illicitly downloaded data from Oracle to offer its support services, leading to a trial to agree the scale of damages it should pay.In spite of the failure of SAP’s plan, Mr Ellison went out of his way on Monday to stress the threat he once believed it posed to Oracle.He said: “The acquisition of TomorrowNow was a brilliant idea and we were at grave risk, depending on what they did with it”.The Oracle chief executive added that he had personally believed at the time that SAP stood “to get at least 20 per cent, as much as 30 per cent of our [PeopleSoft] customers”.Oracle’s lawyers have argued that the scale of the threat to the US group should be used as a yardstick for the size of the damages award. Because it paid $11bn for PeopleSoft, the loss of customers could have cost it $3.3bn, with another $600m in damages caused by similar customer losses from another acquisition, that of Siebel Systems.A lawyer for SAP challenged Mr Ellison’s claim that he had been deeply concerned about the threat and said that no written evidence had emerged pointing to his fears.
474;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Supply chain: Useful cuts – to wasted time and materials;;Computers have transformed the number-crunching aspects of the finance director’s job in recent years. In today’s volatile markets, the ability to provide accurate and timely information on the state of the business and its finances is even more vital for survival.“Transaction processing is not the most engaging part of finance,” says Andrew Meade, head of finance and performance management for consultancy Accenture in the UK and Ireland. “But it is a fundamental process so the company can pay its vendors and collect its cash. The fact that modern accounting systems do what they do so well at speed allows the chief financial officer to focus energy on other things.”Before the development of accounting or treasury management systems it could take a company months to close its books on a reporting period. It can now complete the process in two to three days.Manually recorded data were also more susceptible to error with the result that resources might not be deployed to greatest effect and planning assumptions could be compromised.Accounting systems began to emerge in the late 1980s when company treasurers started to realise the potential of the software. “There were the big systems that the banks used but there was nothing for corporates to use apart from spread sheets,” explains Ken Lillie, founder of Lillie Associates.“Treasurers decided to write their own. They concentrated on managing risk and cash but these became very powerful systems with a lot of experience built into them.”Some companies continue to use proprietary systems but most make use of the accounting functions available in enterprise resource planning software provided by the likes of SAP or Oracle. Other leading providers include SunGard and Wall Street Systems but there is a host of smaller ones.For some smaller companies a cash management facility provided by their bank is adequate.Finance and treasury heads can opt to install internal systems with varying degrees of customisation to their needs or sign up for what is known as “software as a service” – SaaS – which makes the product available on demand over the web and avoids the need to install and maintain the system in-house.The move from the manual collection of data to computers has relieved finance departments of a considerable burden but it is only a means to an end.“Finance needs to be a ruthlessly efficient transaction engine that provides the capacity and the time to focus on the commercial decision-making.” says Mr Meade.“These systems allow you to run the analytics in real time and be more scientific about where your business and your customers are heading.”But treasury management systems do not function in a vacuum, he warns. They need to be backed up by the right processes, systems, policies and organisational support.The in-house accounting management system will have a lot of interfaces with outside systems run by the company’s banks, suppliers and customers. In choosing a system, the finance director and treasurer need to be certain that it will allow seamless links with these outside organisations. Staff will need to be trained.And glitches can occur with even the best products. Something as simple as the different financial terminology used in various accounting jurisdictions can cause confusion. “You don’t want to have to guess what something means because the financial language is different,” says Mr Meade. “If everyone is not using the system in the same way, speed of aggregation and transparency are reduced.”Systems that have been in place for some time can start to show their age.“Many treasurers still use systems that were initially sound but, over the course of time and with the increased demands now placed on them, many are now be found wanting,” Mr Lillie wrote in The Treasurer magazine.“Workarounds may have been implemented in the form of home-built extras or the acquisition of third-party systems, perhaps on a piecemeal basis and without proper integration or planning.”Mr Lillie advises finance directors to review their technology every three to five years both to check it is still performing well and to assess what has come on to the market since. “People tend to think: ‘If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.’ But it is good discipline to review the technology on a regular basis.”The credit crunch and subsequent financial turmoil have put a premium on companies managing their money in an effective and timely manner.Counterparty risk has become a concern for finance directors in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This makes accounting systems that track a company’s exposure to individual banks even more important.More volatile markets mean finance directors must keep an even closer eye on their exposure to the foreign exchanges, interest rates and the derivatives they use to hedge exposure. “Instability is the new normal,” says Mr Meade.
475;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-04T18:04:20Z;Jury deliberates over EMI;;Guy Hands and David Wormsley were still waiting for a verdict on Thursday afternoon in the three-week trial on which their reputations and those of Terra Firma and Citigroup depend.Mr Hands, the usually restless private equity investor, sat reading quietly in his usual seat in the courtroom, flanked by a full team of highly paid lawyers, with the exception of David Boies, his lead counsel, who had flown to San Francisco for the Oracle-SAP trial.Mr Wormsley, who as head of Citigroup’s UK investment banking business advised Mr Hands on some of his biggest deals before the EMI buyout drove them apart, read a novel called The Help. He was joined by his wife, Vicky, as his lawyers and others in the court flicked through newspapers.Jurors ate lunch in the jury room having earlier requested pages of the transcript of the trial. They have been instructed to return a verdict by no later than 5pm on Friday.The jury must reach a unanimous verdict, with the burden on Mr Hands’ Terra Firma group to prove that David Wormsley, once his closest adviser, misled him about a competing offer and that he would not have bid without this alleged advice.Judge Jed Rakoff sent the eight-person jury off after the two sides’ lawyers presented impassioned final arguments in a case that could decide the fate of EMI and the reputations of Mr Hands and Mr Wormsley.Mr Boies told the jury Mr Wormsley had made “false statements”, while Mr Hands’ testimony was supported by his colleagues. “He couldn’t have made it up if he told other people at the time,” he argued.Ted Wells, Citigroup’s lead counsel, said: “David Wormsley did not lie to Guy Hands.” Mr Hands’ argument that he bid 265p per EMI share on May 21 2007 only because Mr Wormsley had purportedly told him there would be a rival Cerberus bid at 262p, “defies common sense” and was supported by “not one e-mail, not a text, not a file memo”, Mr Wells said.“These people write everything down,” he charged, noting that the copious documentation disclosed in the trial had revealed myriad other details, including the smoked salmon and pea and cucumber soup appetisers the two men ate at the Royal Opera House.Mr Boies argued that Terra Firma routinely avoided auctions and had hoped until the final hours of the process to negotiate a lower bid price. Mr Wells countered that Terra Firma documents showed it had been planning a 265p per share bid “from day one”.Mr Boies noted the £70m in fees and £400m in interest Citigroup had earned from the transaction, arguing that the bank encouraged Terra Firma’s bid in a search for “a way out” of its already troubled unsecured loans to EMI.Mr Wells said Citigroup had lost $2bn (£1.2bn) on the deal in loan write-offs. “We have got to live with our bad business decision and so does [Mr Hands],” he said. Instead, he argued, Mr Hands had “made up” his case to shift responsibility for a bad deal, and had “[thrown] David Wormsley over the side” because he had 60 to 70 per cent of his own wealth tied up in EMI.Terra Firma argued for damages of £1.32bn, while Citigroup argued that damages should be nothing, or no more than $46.5m.Terra Firma had believed it could turn a £1.5bn equity investment into £4bn, Mr Wells said. “They believed it was a gold mine. [It was] fool’s gold.”
476;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-03T23:34:19Z;SAP in $120m payment to Oracle;;SAP has agreed to pay its rival Oracle $120m in return for it not pursuing punitive damages in the bitter legal fight between the two software groups.The German company still faces a claim of $2bn in actual damages over the admitted case of copyright infringement, though this week it argued in court that it should pay only the $42m in damages it estimated its US rival suffered because of the offence.News of the payment emerged on Wednesday, a day after opening statements in a trial that has provided a highly public stage for the fierce transatlantic business rivalry.Oracle has used the case to embarrass Hewlett-Packard, whose chief executive, Léo Apotheker, was an SAP executive at the time of the copyright infringement.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, accused Mr Apotheker of knowing about the offence and challenged him to appear as a witness. On Wednesday, Oracle said it had been unable to find Mr Apotheker to serve a subpoena on him to appear at the trial and that HP had refused to accept it on his behalf.The trial stems from SAP’s admission that a Texan subsidiary, TomorrowNow, downloaded information illegally from Oracle’s servers. Jurors in the trial, at federal court in Oakland, are being asked to assess the level of damages.The $120m payment by SAP was agreed ahead of the opening of the trial in a closed session before judge Phyllis Hamilton, according to one person close to the situation. While copyright infringement, the main focus of the case, did not carry punitive damages, SAP could have faced a claim under other statutes that ban computing hacking, the person said.The initial $120m was described as a payment towards Oracle’s legal fees, though the US company is not expected to face legal bills that large. It reported costs of less than $100m in its 18-month legal fight with the Department of Justice over a more involved case springing from its proposed acquisition of PeopleSoft – the deal that eventually threw it into direct competition with SAP.Oracle has spared little expense to put pressure on SAP and draw attention to the case. Its legal team is led by David Boies, who represented the US government in its antitrust case against Microsoft.
477;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
478;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-03T23:16:23Z;A new route from idea to reality;;Bob Ianucci, the former chief technology officer at Nokia, used to give a talk about the evolutionary patterns in the technology industry called “I’ve seen this movie before”. In it he described how every big technological change, from mainframes to minicomputers to PCs, had followed the same path.PCs, for example, began with several companies – Apple, Commodore, Wang and others – offering their own incompatible hardware and software. Then a standard platform emerged in IBM. Compatible hardware followed – Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Compaq – before the value shifted to software – Microsoft – and finally to services and companies such as IBM, EDS and Oracle.This pattern appears to be unfolding again in mobile phone technology. First, we had an array of separate systems. Now a platform war is being waged, most aggressively between Google’s Android and Apple’s iPhone operating systems.Last month, Steve Jobs lashed into Android saying “we think Android is very, very fragmented and getting more fragmented by the day”. Nokia is pitching in with new phones powered by its revamped Symbian OS, and Research in Motion’s BlackBerry OS is another potent rival.But already we are seeing hardware makers and the developers of software and mobile services circling this piranha tank, trying to decide which platforms will thrive or die, and which to invest in.The difference between the history of mobile technology and PCs is the pace of the change. Product development cycles are now faster than traditional corporate innovation structures seem able to cope with. And while some, such as Apple and Google, seem comfortable with the speed of change, others such as Nokia and RIM are criticised for playing innovation catch-up with the Silicon Valley swells.“There are so many opportunities, technologies and ideas, all of which are easily accessible,” says Roberto Verganti, professor of management of innovation at Politecnico di Milano. “So, the key challenge for companies is not having the ideas, but making sense of them and having a vision. The companies that are most successful are the ones that understand the meaning behind the technology.”As a percentage of revenue, Nokia spent four times as much as Apple on research and development last year, and yet it has no market-changing products to show for it. Companies that try to compete on features or performance, Prof Verganti says, only briefly have an edge before everyone else catches up.Moreover, consumers are not that interested in the features that might excite an internal research lab. When RIM came up with the BlackBerry, it perceived that what many users most wanted from their phones was e-mail, and they could happily do without the rest of the OS software. Apple was not the first to make an MP3 player, but the good-looking iPod combined with iTunes removed the whiff of illegality around music downloads. Apple was similarly the first to make sense of touchscreen technology with its iPhone. It was more than a gimmick: it changed how people thought of their phones.Eric von Hippel, professor of technological innovation at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says a technology company should divide its re­search and innovation tasks “into those it can solve internally and those that can most effectively be solved outside”. The ones that can be solved within are “dimension-of-merit” im­provements such as better screen resolution, ergonomics or interface des­ign. Those that must be solved outside are those that involve new customer needs. In 2007, for example, when Apple first released the iPhone, thousands of users decided to “jail-break” the software in order to customise it. Prof von Hippel says this prompted Steve Jobs to release a software developer kit, which in turn led to the explosion of the App Store. Apple was forced by outside events to open up its platform, although it remains controlled.“Senior managers have to recognise that the innovation system has to be fundamentally reworked,” says Prof von Hippel. “It’s not a matter of tweaking. There is a fundamental new paradigm out there.” This new model was created by falling design and communication costs, which have en­abled more people to be part of the process. Prof von Hippel says managers need to venture out to the leading edges of their market and engage with users. He calls it “democratising innovation”.Prof Verganti agrees, saying technology companies must listen to “interpreters” – individuals in­side and outside the company capable of un­derstanding cultural and social forces beyond the immediate world of technology. These are not traditional market researchers, but people from other industries and professions who look at what you are doing with fresh eyes.Few companies could use an innovation boost more than Nokia. Ari Hakkarainen, a former marketing executive at Nokia, says the company remains a serious business, selling more than 400m phones, from high- to low-end devices depending on the market. In order to avoid becoming just a low-cost competitor, however, it is trying pull off the trick of innovating without upsetting existing customers and profitable lines.In September, the company replaced Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, its chief executive, with Stephen Elop from Microsoft. While Mr Elop finds his feet, Nokia lacks a powerful CEO, in the mould of Mr Jobs or RIM’s Mike Lazaridis, who can establish a vision and impose it on an organisation. “You need a strong leader to make these kinds of innovations become reality,” Mr Hakkarainen says.There is hope. With Apple entrenched at the high end of the mobile phone market, both Mr Hakkarainen and Prof von Hippel see a huge opportunity for Nokia innovating in emerging markets.Andrew Hargadon, a professor of technology management at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management, worked at Apple in the early 1990s. “We were reinventing the wheel left and right,” he says. “But to do that we built a factory that could never be profitable.”When Mr Jobs returned in 1996, says Prof Hargadon: “Apple chose not to be a technological leader. It said we’re going to take technologies that are already out there and build a more seamlessly integrated network around that.”What Apple does, he says, “is identify a vision, then assemble the right team to pull that off”. Such focus on a handful of products and highly tailored processes in marketing and distribution, such as the Apple Stores, is a contrast to companies where “top managers want to to be focused on new business units, but don’t have time, yet refuse to cede authority” – so they end up “with one foot on the dock, one foot in the boat”.Rather than reorganising existing assets to try to come up with a new vision, Prof Hargadon says, technology companies must have the vision and then assemble the assets needed from outside and inside in order to make it real.RIM’s unveiling of its iPad rival, the Playbook, he says, is worrying. “I love RIM’s products, which stay true to the original vision and do exactly what they do really well. To the extent they’re trying to turn that hedgehog into a fox, they risk losing it.”
479;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Why tech companies need the discipline of a dividend;Pay-outs a reminder that the cash ultimately belongs to shareholders, writes Richard Waters;When Cisco announced last month that it would start to pay its shareholders a dividend, it looked as though years of urging from Wall Street had finally paid off. Bowing to the greater financial discipline of a regular dividend payment looked like a sign that another tech company addicted to piling up cash (in this case $40bn) was growing up.The stock market’s reaction since then? Cisco’s shares have done worse than the Nasdaq Composite.So it goes in Techland. Investors have harassed companies for the better part of a decade to cough up more of their cash and accept the yoke of regular dividend payments. Little good it has done them.Exhibit A in this sorry tale is Microsoft. Since it first announced a dividend in early 2003 – a watershed event that, accompanied by a big one-time pay-out, was meant to transform Wall Street’s perception of the company – its stock has crept up a meagre 2 per cent. The Nasdaq has risen 83 per cent in the same period.Shares in Oracle, which announced its first dividend payment early last year in the midst of a severe recession, subsequently failed to keep up with the wider market, at least until a bounce in the past couple of months. A dividend is no magic bullet, but you might have expected a more grateful response.Of course, tech companies pay out billions of dollars to repurchase shares, so the dividend should not be seen in isolation. But there are three sound reasons for committing to a regular cash payment to shareholders: on all three, the tech companies have been found wanting.One is to appeal to a new class of investor. Particularly with fixed-income yields at rock-bottom levels, companies with solid and reliable cash flow are in a position to expand their shareholder bases. Yet even after raising its dividend by a quarter in September, Microsoft’s dividend yield stands at only 2.3 per cent.Downgrading the company’s shares last month, Goldman Sachs said the software company would have to bump the yield up to more like 5 per cent if it truly wants to attract a new set of investors. That would put it above many big power utilities, and Philip Morris, the tobacco company – a comparison that Microsoft, which still likes to think of itself as a growth company, would not invite.Most other tech stocks offer even lower yields, with Oracle and Hewlett-Packard below 1 per cent.A second good reason for a dividend is its use as a signal of value. Managers can use the payment to project confidence in hard times, as Oracle did last year. But if the payments are minimal, it is hard to read much into the message. HP has stuck with the same dividend since 1998, through thick and thin.Third, and perhaps most important, dividends add to the financial discipline on business managers, providing a reminder that the cash ultimately belongs to shareholders. Back in 2003, Microsoft was in the financial doghouse over $10bn of losses it had racked up from bad investments in cable and telecoms companies during the bubble. Bill Gates told the Financial Times at the time that he felt “chastened” by the mistake.Since then, Microsoft has amassed combined losses from its internet, video game and mobile software businesses of roughly the same amount. Some of these investments may pay off – the games business is at least profitable – but, to Wall Street, the process has hardly reeked of discipline.Behind all of this lies an uncomfortable truth for successful tech companies. Ultimately, the transition from being a growth stock to what the market would consider a value play is a painful one, usually taking years to complete. The decision to pay a dividend is often made early on in this transition. That explains why many tech entrepreneurs instinctively balk at the idea: it is like confessing to their own mortality.Cisco is the latest to struggle with this dilemma. It still has enviable gross margins above 60 per cent and growth in the double digits. But it also has an aggressive Chinese competitor in Huawei, and has turned for growth to areas where margins are far narrower – consumer electronics and computer servers.There is light at the end of this tunnel, as the case of IBM suggests. Big Blue has little to show in the way of growth, but it has found a profitable niche in selling heavy-duty IT to big customers. After slashing its dividend in the early 1990s, IBM has raised the pay-out in each of the past 15 years, recently at an accelerated rate. The five-year financial road maps it lays out for Wall Street have reeked of fiscal discipline. For much of the past two decades, IBM was held up in the tech world as a warning of how formerly great companies can lose their relevance as technology moves on. In future, it will increasingly be a model.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.com
480;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-11-02T22:12:00Z;US stocks higher on tech deal news;;MasterCard earnings and technology deals helped buoy US equities as investors awaited the results of the midterm elections and the Federal Reserve meeting.Investors were cautious as voters went to the polls in the midterms, expected to put Republicans back in control of the House of Representatives, and the Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting, in which it is widely forecast that quantitative easing will be extended.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,193.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.6 per cent to 11,188.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent higher at 2,533.52.MasterCard, the payment processing company, advanced 2.9 per cent to $245.98 after reporting that third-quarter profits had jumped 15 per cent as international shoppers spent more on their credit cards.The number of transactions declined in the US but soared in Asia and Latin America.“The key to long-term growth for the [payment] networks will be to make sure they position themselves for growth globally, and don’t fall back on their US comfort zone,” said Gwenn Bézard, Aite Group research director.The financial sector lagged behind the broader indices, rising just 0.3 per cent as regional banking stocks fell 0.2 per cent.Moody’s Investors Service cut the ratings on the stocks of nine regional lenders. Analysts at the credit rating agency said the government had “signalled its intent to limit support for individual banks” in a marked shift from policy in 2009.Zions Bancorporation declined by 1.3 per cent to $20.20, SunTrust Banks lost 1 per cent to $24.41 and Regions Financial Corp was lower by 1.8 per cent at $6.12.Regional banks have suffered since they reported third-quarter profits, falling 4 per cent in the earnings season compared with a rise of about 1 per cent rise in the broader indices, according to analysts at JPMorgan.“With loans declining again in the third quarter and yields on securities falling sharply, shareholders have less earnings in their pocket each quarter while they wait for loan growth to materialise, and the stocks have traded down accordingly,” said Steven Alexopoulos, an analyst at JPMorgan.But he added that while the lack of borrowing by consumers might be a fundamental issue, the hold-up for commercial borrowers seems to be more a lack of confidence, which might improve after the midterm elections.There was a spate of deal news in the technology sector, which rose by 0.9 per cent.Oracle announced it would buy Art Technology Group, an e-commerce software maker whose customers include Best Buy and Vodafone, for $1bn in cash.The $6 a share price is at a 46 per cent premium to ATG’s close on Monday. Shares in Oracle gained 1.4 per cent to $29.53 while ATG shares shot up 45.1 per cent to $5.95.But Dell nudged down 0.3 per cent to $14.37 after it bought Boomi, a cloud computing company, for an undisclosed price.The computer maker was locked in a bidding war in the summer with Hewlett-Packard for 3Par, another cloud computing group, a battle that HP won.Other cloud computing companies rose, with Rackspace Hosting adding 2.3 per cent to $25.95.In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer fell 1 per cent to $17.45 after reporting its quarterly results and raising its earnings forecast for the full year.The world’s largest drugmaker reported better than expected profits after it raised prices and cut jobs. Profits were also buoyed by adding products from its acquisition of Wyeth, helping compensate for declining sales of its cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.In the energy sector, shares in Anadarko Petroleum and BP rose after the companies reported their quarterly results, even though both raised their estimates for the cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Anadarko Petroleum, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the Macondo well, rose 1 per cent to $63.82, while the US-listed shares in BP advanced 1.6 per cent to $41.42.
481;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;High noon in Oakland? Not yet;;"Pulses quickened in a Federal courtroom in Oakland, California on Tuesday when a lawyer for Oracle promised jurors in the Oracle v SAP trial that they would get to hear evidence from Léo Apotheker, now the boss of HP.So does that mean Mr Apotheker has accepted the challenge thrown down last week by Larry Ellison, his counterpart at Oracle, to turn up and face the music? It sounded as though Mr Ellison’s taunt, about how the HP CEO might choose to stay “far, far away” from the courtroom, had paid off.Alas, it turns out that a showdown is still not guaranteed.As a former member of SAP’s management board, Mr Apotheker gave a video deposition to Oracle’s lawyers early on in their evidence-gathering for the trial. (SAP has admitted liability for infringement of Oracle’s intellectual property by a US subsidiary, TomorrowNow; the only thing to be decided is the scale of the damages.)Oracle only has that video testimony up its sleeve so far, and no commitment yet that Mr Apotheker will appear in person.Instead, jurors were promised a succession of other executives from SAP and Oracle, along with expert accounting witnesses from both sides to haggle over how much the German company should pay. In opening arguments, Oracle made a case for a damages payment in the “billions”, while SAP laid out the reasoning behind its offer of only $40m.Oracle bases its case on the competitive damage that SAP set out to cause with its 2005 purchase of TomorrowNow, a company which sold support contracts to customers of PeopleSoft, which had just been bought by Oracle.In their most fanciful visions, SAP executives dreamed of using this strategy to siphon off more than half of PeopleSoft’s 9,922 customers, and one executive predicted that news of the TomorrowNow acquisition would wipe 10 per cent, or $7bn, from Oracle’s share price.According to SAP, however, the damages award should only reflect the actual harm caused to Oracle, not SAP’s intent. This turned out to be minimal. Only 358 customers switched their support contracts to TomorrowNow – and of these, just 86 eventually ended up junking their PeopleSoft software and buying from SAP.The eight jurors now have a month of detailed testimony to look forward to on the arcane inner workings of the enterprise software market – and, if they are lucky, a date with Léo Apotheker of HP."
482;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-31T02:25:21Z;Apple sues Motorola amid litigation scrum;;"Apple has counter-sued Motorola, alleging the mobile phone maker violated patents including those that protect the iPhone’s interpretation of multiple finger-touches for making an image larger or smaller.The suit claims infringement of six patents and was filed in a US federal court in Wisconsin less than a month after Motorola sued Apple, arguing that the iPhone and other products violated Motorola patents in core areas including mobile communications, software management and location-based services.The suit filed on Friday adds to a scrum of litigation that has also drawn in the top names in technology. Parties to one or more smartphone patent cases which have been filed include Google, which makes the Android operating software that is seen as the greatest threat to the iPhone; Oracle, which now controls the Java software used in most phones; Microsoft; top smartphone maker Nokia; and other handset manufacturers such as HTC.Unlike most areas of intellectual-property skirmishing, the mobile phone industry has a body that administers a pool of patents, to which all parties contribute, and assigns licensing fees.But as the stakes have risen, and some of the most desirable technology has come to resemble that in traditional computing more than phones, the coalition approach has fractured. The balance has been upset in particular by Apple, which has many fewer patents in phones than its rivals but can lay claim to some of the biggest advances.Patent wars are raging in the smartphone industry. This interactive graphic shows the technology companies involved in patent lawsuits and licensing agreements.Motorola on Saturday said it had not reviewed Apple’s filing in detail. But it pointed out that it had previously sued Apple and also made a complaint to the US International Trade Commission, another popular venue for such disputes.“Motorola has a leading intellectual property portfolio, one of the strongest in the industry, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter”, said company spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson. “We are confident in our position and will pursue our litigation to halt Apple’s continued infringement”.Without a grand compromise, the thicket of cases could drag on for years and might slow what has been a rapid pace of advancement.Apple faces a lawsuit from Nokia over its iPhone technology and has taken legal action of its own against the Finnish cellphone maker.Apple is also part of a wider legal challenge to Google’s Android smartphone operating system, having filed a lawsuit against handset maker HTC over its use of the software. That echoes Microsoft’s action against Motorola over its use of Android software and Oracle’s action against Google over the alleged use of its Java technology in Android."
483;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;SAP retreats in battle with Oracle;;On the eve of a hotly anticipated trial pitting it against business software rival Oracle, SAP has capitulated on much of the case by agreeing not to fight the claim that it knew a subsidiary was violating Oracle copyright.In an e-mail sent late on Wednesday to Oracle’s top lawyer, who passed it to the judge on Thursday, SAP attorney Greg Lanier wrote that “we will shortly inform the court that we are electing not to contest the claim for contributory copyright infringement”.Contributory infringement would mean SAP knew or should have known about, and assisted the improper access by a subsidiary to Oracle’s software.Vicarious infringement, which SAP has previously admitted, means it benefited from the activity.The about-face came as part of SAP’s effort to cut the time of the trial from about four weeks to two. It is arguing that because the only matter left for a jury to decide is the extent of the damage, there should be less time spent on rehashing what the TomorrowNow subsidiary did wrong.But Oracle wrote to the federal judge handling the case that the last-minute concession, after three years of litigation, was an unfair attempt to throw it off balance and recast its trial strategy. It asked for a hearing and a delay in the trial’s opening from Monday until Thursday.“Oracle welcomes the defendant’s admission of all liability, however belated,” wrote Oracle attorney Geoff Howard. But he added: “It is neither fair nor reasonable to assert on the eve of trial that Oracle must cut back its presentation by 45 per cent.”SAP’s response, to the judge, was that the type of infringement established would not dictate different financial damages, so that “it makes good sense to eliminate the issue now”.TomorrowNow handled maintenance on Oracle software, but it used Oracle customer logons to scrape the Oracle site for other code.While on the surface, a fight over whether such improper access caused a few million dollars’ worth of damage to Oracle’s business or more than $1bn of damage, as Oracle claims, it has deeper resonance for two reasons. The first is that Oracle wants to restrict the ability of other companies to perform such maintenance, which cuts into a revenue stream.The second is that Oracle is concerned about the possibility of bigger moves into business software, and perhaps software maintenance, by its sometime hardware partner Hewlett-Packard.
484;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Oracle boss turns up courtoom heat on SAP;;The software that resides in the guts of corporate IT systems does not normally make for high drama. But if Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, has his way, a trial due to start in a courtroom in northern California on Monday will turn the intricacies of how complex software programs are maintained into very public theatre.It will also shine a spotlight on a highly profitable corner of the software business that Oracle is very keen to protect – and over which it has already shown itself willing to fight.The case springs from the 2005 purchase of an obscure, Texas-based company by SAP, Oracle’s arch-rival in the applications software business. Called TomorrowNow, the company provided maintenance and support for software programs, making it a cheaper alternative to the fees charged by the software’s makers, which typically amount to 22 per cent of the original purchase price, payable every year.TomorrowNow was meant to play a central role in SAP’s counter-attack after Oracle bought PeopleSoft, turning it into SAP’s biggest rival in the applications market. By providing maintenance and support at a knock-down price, it hoped to lure PeopleSoft customers away from Oracle, before selling them SAP software as a replacement.The strategy proved a disaster for SAP. After Oracle changed course and promised to continue developing new generations of PeopleSoft applications, the incentive for customers to defect evaporated. TomorrowNow never attracted more than a few hundred customers or made a profit, according to one person familiar with its operations. Worse quickly followed. To provide its service, TomorrowNow’s employees used customers’ passwords to log on to Oracle’s systems and download updates and other information needed to maintain the software. But they took a disastrous short-cut: rather than accessing only the information needed to support a particular customer while signed on in that customer’s name, they downloaded data wholesale, “scraping” Oracle’s servers and taking millions of copies of its documents and software “patches”.To Oracle, this amounted to widespread theft of intellectual property, triggering a three-year legal battle that has resulted in damages claims that could reach $2bn.A beleaguered SAP has admitted to the illegal access and copying of Oracle data, leaving the jury in next week’s trial with only the task of deciding on the level of damages.As important as the financial compensation to Oracle will be the publicity it affords. Henning Kagerman, SAP’s chief executive at the time of the TomorrowNow acquisition, is scheduled to appear as a witness in the trial’s second week. But Oracle has even bigger game in its sights in the shape of Leo Apotheker, the former SAP executive who is now head of Hewlett-Packard – a company on the receiving end of a spate of competitive barbs from Mr Ellison in recent weeks.Oracle had added Mr Apotheker to a list of witnesses it wanted to call for the trial, but this week Mr Ellison went further, publicly goading the HP boss over whether or not he would show up in court.As a foreign citizen Mr Apotheker may not be obliged to appear, according to one person familiar with the case, and if he is outside California when the trial starts then Oracle will be unable to subpoena him.That prospect has not been lost on Mr Ellison, who called attention to it in a public statement this week that indirectly challenged Mr Apotheker to show up.“I hope I’m wrong, but my guess is that HP’s new chairman, [Ray] Lane, will keep HP’s new CEO, Mr Apotheker, far, far away from the courthouse until this trial is over,” Mr Ellison sneered.The theatre has obscured a more serious side to the TomorrowNow trial.Through its lawsuit – and another case against a similar company called Rimini Street – Oracle has left a chill over the independent maintenance business, according to some analysts.“Oracle is using that tactic to intimidate entrants into the market,” says Paul Hamerman, an analyst at Forrester Research.With more than 70 per cent of his software revenues coming from maintenance and support, the tactic is understandable.
485;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-27T05:39:17Z;Ellison v Apotheker: the goading begins;;With less than a week to go until a court showdown between Oracle and SAP in Oakland, California, Larry Ellison has turned up the rhetorical heat.As we said a couple of days ago, it will be hard to stop the Oracle CEO having his say, whatever efforts SAP makes to prevent this case turning into a media circus.Even by Mr Ellison’s standards, though, the statement from Oracle late on Tuesday carried a particularly venomous sting. Aimed at Leo Apotheker – the former SAP executive now at the helm of Hewlett-Packard – the message was blunt: turn up and appear as a witness at the trial, or risk being painted as a coward.This looks like the sort of clever gambit you would expect from Mr Ellison.With a war of words in full swing between Oracle and HP, there’s nothing Oracle would like better than to put Mr Apotheker on a witness stand and try to show that he was somehow implicated in the theft of Oracle intellectual property to which SAP has already admitted guilt (the trial is just to assess damages.)As we understand it, though, the HP boss could probably escape the appearance without too much trouble. For a start, Oracle would have to be able to serve a subpoena on him within the state of California during the course of the trial for him to appear. But even if it followed this procedure, as a foreign national, and without a permanent residence yet in California, Mr Apotheker would be under no legal obligation to show up.True, with HP a significant presence in the area, he may not want to risk alienating a local court so early in his tenure by snubbing his nose at a request to appear as a witness. But ultimately, it will be hard for Oracle to compel his appearance.Hence Mr Ellison’s latest public jibes. He promises to produce evidence of Mr Apotheker’s involvement – unless HP decides “to keep their new CEO far, far away from HP Headquarters until that trial is over.” He adds:I don’t think Ray Lane wants to risk Leo Apotheker testifying under oath as to why he allowed the theft of Oracle‘s property to continue for 8 months after he was made sole CEO of SAP. I hope I’m wrong, but my guess is that new HP’s Chairman, Mr. Lane, will keep HP’s new CEO, Mr. Apotheker, far, far away from the Courthouse until this trial is over.It’s starting to feel like the climax to one of those old Westerns, the part where the gunslinger dares the hero to turn up at noon for a final showdown or be branded a coward. Will he come? Watch this space.
486;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-25T21:59:05Z;SAP, Oracle… Infor?;;Enterprise software analyst Josh Greenbaum has a colourful way to describe Infor, the biggest application software company you’ve probably never heard of: “They are the Frankenstein’s laboratory for literally hundreds of products.”More than 70 acquisitions have turned Infor into the world’s third biggest applications company – and left it with the mother of all integration challenges. Now, in Charles Phillips, former co-president of Oracle, it has secured the services of a CEO with big-time experience in handling this kind of situation.Majority owner Golden Gate Capital got the ball rolling when it founded a predecessor company to Infor back in 2002. This has since become the vehicle for an ambitious private equity roll-up in the software industry, with deals like the $1bn purchase of Geac Computer and $1.6bn acquisition of SSA.Infor claims to have revenue of nearly $2bn but, as a private company, does not publish detailed financials. Outgoing CEO Jim Schaper (who will remain chairman) told me on Monday that it had done “better than most” during a challenging recession – though “quite frankly, not as good as a couple” (no names needed there.)Phillips’ challenge will be to raise Infor’s profile and make it more than the sum of its Frankenstein-laboratory parts. January is scheduled to bring what he describes as “a new skin” for the the company’s many apps, with a common user interface and tools like business intelligence.And, with 70,000 global customers, there ought to be plenty of scope for cross-selling. With that many accounts to call on, there’s a high probability “your next customer is already an existing customer,” says Phillips.This is where his track record could be telling. After a spate of acquisitions that left Oracle with a disparate set of products, points out Greenbaum, Phillips’ main contribution was to “pull together a really comprehensive story that the field sales force could take out and sell.”If he can get the sales machine working in the same way at Infor, then you can bet that Golden Gate will be looking to take the company public as soon as it decently can.And what of the new rivalry with former boss Larry Ellison? Phillips says he spoke to the Oracle CEO in recent weeks to discuss his next move, and that Ellison “agreed it was the best of the alternatives.”Left unsaid, in this cryptic comment, are what other options Phillips might have been considering. Joining Léo Apotheker at HP, perhaps?
487;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-24T17:51:00Z;SAP’s biggest challenge: Silencing Ellison;;Is SAP about to take the same sort of battering in the press from Oracle that has made HP’s board quail recently? Not if it can help it.Late on Friday, SAP asked a Californian court to put a gag order on Oracle’s legal counsel ahead of the scheduled November 1 start of the trial to decide damages in the TomorrowNow case. But even if it can silence Oracle’s lawyers, SAP probably has a bigger problem on its hands: Larry Ellison, who shows no inclination to hold back in public.Oracle is seeking $2bn for TomorrowNow’s admitted unauthorised access to its systems. The company, which sold maintenance support for Oracle software, was acquired by SAP as a way to get in a foot in the door with Oracle customers. SAP does not contest the claims, just the amount of the damages.The transgression was the subject of Ellison scorn in an email to us recently. While unleashing a tirade against HP over its removal of CEO Mark Hurd (now an Ellison lieutenant), the Oracle boss did not miss the chance to take aim at SAP as well:SAP has already publicly confessed and accepted financial responsibility for systematically stealing Oracle’s intellectual property over a long period of time. Much of this industrial espionage and intellectual property theft occurred while Léo [Apotheker] was CEO of SAP.SAP, trying to silence what it claims could be prejudicial publicity ahead of the trial, makes no mention of these comments. Instead, it takes aim at a New York Times piece on the same issue that came out several days later.In it, columnist Joe Nocera also lambasted HP’s board for taking on Mr Apotheker, who, he felt, must have been aware of the breaches at TomorrowNow. Only after the piece was published, according to a note later added to the column, did Nocera realise that Oracle’s chief counsel on the case is the prominent lawyer David Boies. Nocera’s fiance is head of communications for Boies’ law firm.“If generated by a lawyer’s publicist,” the SAP motion argues, this is the sort of thing courts in the past have frowned on.Plugging any leaks coming from Boies’ office is one thing. But getting Larry Ellison to hold his tongue in public will be a tougher job. Just ask HP.
488;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-18T22:01:37Z;Companies in appeal for US tax amnesty;;"US multinational companies are clamouring for a tax holiday to repatriate billions of dollars “trapped” overseas but are being rebuffed by Barack Obama’s administration.JPMorgan research estimates that 30-40 per cent of the almost $1,000bn in cash held by non-financial S&P 500 companies is in foreign jurisdictions.The treatment of “cash on the sidelines” is becoming an increasingly pointed political and economic issue in the sluggish recovery, with Republicans blaming uncertainty created by Democratic healthcare and financial reforms for companies’ reluctance to invest and create jobs.But some large groups say that US tax rules are a more important barrier. JPMorgan estimated that for some companies, so-called trapped cash amounts to more than 75 per cent of cash balances. To use the cash domestically, they would have to pay tax, typically of 25-35 per cent.“We do have overseas cash and we would be very supportive of a repatriation holiday,” said Keith Sherin, chief financial officer of General Electric. “If you think about it, there is a lot of cash trapped overseas. If companies could bring that back at more competitive tax rates, I think it would be good for the US economy.”Sceptics, including in the administration, say the cash level alone is not a good guide to investment firepower as it ignores corporate debt levels. They also warn that Congress could raise hopes of more tax holidays; that repatriated cash might well be paid to shareholders rather than lead to job creation; and that a lack of investment is not the most pressing economic problem. The Treasury declined to comment.The eight largest technology companies together have about $200bn in cash, with Cisco, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Oracle topping the list, when financial companies and those with large funding arms, such as GE, are excluded.“Some of our clients tell us that this issue is among the most distortionary elements of their financial policy,” said Marc Zenner, managing director in the corporate finance advisory group at JPMorgan. “It interferes with the optimal allocation of capital, restricting the use of that cash for strategic transactions or to return funds to shareholders.”Cisco has said that about 80 per cent of its $40bn cash pile is located overseas and has called for the US government to loosen taxation rules to enable companies to repatriate cash earned overseas.In 2004 and 2005, a temporary cut in the tax rate to 5.25 per cent prompted companies to return as much as $400bn to the US."

But lift the hood on its new customer relationship management software and you find that it is “powered by” Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Infor’s decision to use Microsoft rather than a home-grown solution reflects the growing maturity of the CRM market but is surprising nonetheless. Infor already has a couple of CRM offerings including Epiphany, a fallen star of the CRM industry acquired in 2005. Infor says mid-sized businesses wanted a more “cost-effective” solution tailored to their size and needs, so rather than reinventing the wheel, it opted to resell Microsoft’s CRM product. The CRM software market once supported dozens of specialist vendors, but most have now disappeared and businesses increasingly opt to buy CRM software from a mainstream vendor such as Oracle or Microsoft, or rent their CRM as software-as-a-service from a provider such as Salesforce.comVMware unveils Zimbra DesktopCan VMware succeed where Yahoo! failed? VMware’s latest product, Zimbra Desktop 2.0, is based on the open-source Zimbra email software, which it acquired from Yahoo! earlier this year. Zimbra achieved modest success with businesses as a cheap alternative to Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Domino. But it struggled to make greater inroads while under Yahoo!’s wing. VMware hopes to do better and has reworked this latest Zimbra product so that it acts as a desktop portal to cloud-based collaboration and webmail services, as well as social networks like Twitter or Facebook. The big selling point of Zimbra Desktop is that users can access their cloud-based calendars or emails even if there is no internet connection – the Achilles‘ heel of cloud-based services. VMware, best know for its virtualisation software, is trying to expand outside the data centre with cloud-based services and applications.IBM buys PSS SystemsPSS Systems, a software house specialised in compliance, has been acquired by IBM. Using software to enforce compliance and corporate governance is a relatively new field but it has grown dramatically with the explosion of data that needs to be monitored and increasing complexity of legislation. The big problem with compliance is that chief legal officers, faced with the threat of possible law suits, often err on the side of safety and “over-retain” information that can safely be disposed – over 70 percent of information is needlessly retained, according to IBM. PSS Systems’ software enables businesses to define suitable policies for retaining information and help rein in data storage costs.Twitter followers can call you via Zin.toStill unsure what Twitter is for? Zingaya, a UK start-up, has launched Zin.to, a service that lets your Twitter followers call you via the internet. By clicking on the Zin.to link in your tweets, followers can be connected direct to a regular land line, a mobile phone or a Skype account. Zingaya suggests one possible apllication: marketing departments offering special Twitter-only promotions –”Click this link before Friday to talk to our call centre and get a 10 percent discount”. Zingaya lets you forward 30 minutes of calls each day free of charge but currently only to US numbers. The “click to call” service uses Adobe Flash, which means it will not work if the Twitter follower is using an iPhone or other device that does not suport Flash.Skype to intergrate FacebookSkype 5, the latest version of the popular internet telephony software, comes with built-in integration with Facebook. The development may seem arcane unless you regularly use Skype and Facebook, but for those that do, it is a big productivity boost. It means that you can now call or chat with any contact who has listed their phone number on Facebook from within Skype – thus saving call charges as well. You can also check out your news feed, update your status, and comment on posts directly within Skype.Windows 7 via Microsoft’s MED-VDoes your CIO refuse to update your business PCs to Windows 7 because of compatibility issues?

491;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-11T23:42:42Z;New HP chairman claims Hurd ‘lied’ to board;;Incoming Hewlett-Packard chairman Ray Lane has issued a number of astonishing public accusations that Mark Hurd “repeatedly lied” to the company’s board during the investigation that led to his ousting, an upgrade in rhetoric that shows HP’s increasing hostility towards long-time partner Oracle.Mr Lane, a prominent venture capitalist who served as president of Oracle a decade ago, made the fresh accusation more than two months after HP forced out the well-regarded Mr Hurd, who more recently signed on as a co-president at Oracle.His outbursts came on Monday in a letter to the New York Times, which had run a column over the weekend suggesting that Mr Hurd’s missteps were minor compared with those of Léo Apotheker, the incoming HP chief executive.“Mr Hurd violated the trust of the board by repeatedly lying to them in the course of an investigation into his conduct,” Mr Lane wrote.An HP spokeswoman would not elaborate.A spokesman for Mr Hurd said he would not respond.Others involved in the long-running controversy said Mr Lane had felt compelled to defend the HP board, which he formally joins on November 1.But the clash of personalities also overlays strategic shifts that are pitting HP more directly against Oracle. HP continues to sell big computers that run Oracle’s database software, but wants to sell more of its own software. Oracle moved into computer sales this year when it completed the acquisition of Sun Microsystems.HP’s board has continued to come under fire for dismissing Mr Hurd, who made the company the largest in the technology industry.In the days after Mr Hurd’s August departure, the company said it had found improper expense reports that effectively concealed a personal relationship with an actress-turned-marketing contractor who hosted parties for HP customers.But that explanation has puzzled investors and industry executives because HP did not uncover a physical relationship between the two and did not substantiate her claim that her contract was not renewed because she would not have sex with Mr Hurd.Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch said in a television interview last week that HP’s board was “somewhat dysfunctional” and must have had some other reason for firing Mr Hurd.Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison has faulted the HP board before and after hiring Mr Hurd, telling the Financial Times this month that HP’s hiring of Mr Apotheker was further evidence that the company had gone astray.Mr Ellison was referring to conduct at a subsidiary of SAP, Mr Apotheker’s previous company, which has admitted in a pending suit that it improperly accessed Oracle software. That case was the main focus of the New York Times column, but Mr Lane wrote that Oracle had “never offered any evidence that Mr. Apotheker was involved”.
492;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-10T20:11:12Z;EDF / Constellation;Gallic hardball tactics clash with US concepts of fiduciary duty;It is rare for the Oracle of Omaha to get gazumped but when Warren Buffett’s $4.7bn offer for Constellation Energy was topped by France’s EDF two years ago, Mr Buffett said he had no hard feelings. Now Constellation’s shareholder might.EDF’s “demonstrably superior offer” to buy half of Constellation’s nuclear unit for $4.5bn came, almost as an afterthought, with an option for Constellation to sell EDF several fossil-fuelled power plants for their estimated value of $2bn. With the option expiring and the plants now worth about half as much, EDF had lashed out at Constellation for considering an exercise of the put, threatening lawsuits and commercial retaliation. A put would net Constellation an after-tax gain of $400m and land EDF with a $1bn loss and assets it does not really want or need.What EDF did want was a foothold in the US nuclear market, allowing it to sell French reactor designs. But its threats just blew up in its face as Constellation made a surprise announcement that it no longer supports their $5bn plan to build a new reactor. It is probably too late for EDF to find another partner eligible for federal loan guarantees.This is what happens when Gallic hardball tactics clash with American concepts of fiduciary duty. Constellation’s shareholders, who were told two years ago by EDF that its offer was worth the equivalent of $52 a share (versus $32 today), would have excoriated management for letting a $2-a-share option expire worthless. Perhaps the fact that Berkshire Hathaway’s utility subsidiary never sweetened its $26.50 share offer and promptly sold its equity in Constellation should have been a hint of trouble.As for Mr Buffett, he is laughing all the way to the bank as usual, having made a gain of more than $1bn with no remaining exposure to the sordid mess.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
493;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-10T18:50:42Z;We need more CEOs willing to speak out;Too many live in dread of getting into trouble;"“I’m speechless,” Larry Ellison said last week about the appointment of Leo Apotheker as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. Only it turned out the Oracle chief wasn’t speechless at all. He had rather a lot to say and e-mailed various newspapers to protest that HP had chosen “a guy who was recently fired because he did such a bad job of running SAP”, adding, “the HP board needs to resign en masse”.Two days later, Jack Welch turned out not to be speechless either when it came to rubbishing the appointment. The HP board had “committed sins”, he said. “They end up blowing up the CEOs and don’t have anyone else in mind to come in. Where the hell was the leadership development? Who are these board members?”What is happening? Is it now OK for business leaders to launch vigilante attacks on each other when they think they spot useless, incompetent behaviour? Has the dreary fashion for looking the other way and minding your own business come to an end? It would be great if it had.When I started as a journalist a quarter of a century ago, there were a few bold British business figures who were happy to say what they thought. But when Lord Weinstock and Sir John Harvey-Jones died, bad mouthing died with them. Modern CEOs seem to have no opinions, especially not negative ones. If they feel one coming on, they have been trained by their lawyers and PR advisers to suppress it.I have quite often had the experience of interviewing a business leader who said something about another company that was not interesting enough to print, only for them to phone up afterwards in a panic, pleading with me for their innocuous remarks to be scrubbed from the record. Everyone lives in mortal dread of getting into trouble. CEOs are all shacked up together in a glass house in which no stones ever get thrown.So does the crossness over HP mark a general change? I fear it doesn’t: Ellison has always done as he chooses, and in any case has a long and horrid history with SAP. And Welch feels able to throw stones because he is retired and will never need to do business with the HP board. He is a pundit, and being bland doesn’t sell books or fill lecture halls.I can’t help wishing that others would follow, as such vicious attacks serve two important purposes. The first is the sheer fun of it all; everyone loves a good punch up. On FT.com, the headline “Oracle fury at HP choice of chief” was infinitely more clicked on than, say “Eurostar places €600m trains order”– even though the latter is arguably more important.More than that, though, it is good for senior people to speak out, because it makes the discussion better. The internet bristles with the low-grade views of people who know nothing. Everyone slags off everyone else online; it’s a great global pastime. All leaders are used to having virtual rotten tomatoes slung at them from nobodies, so surely they are big enough to take the odd attack from people who actually know what they are talking about?Whether Ellison is right about Apotheker I have no idea. But Welch’s view about the inept changing of the guard at HP is correct and needed saying.HP has 150,000 employees – so it is impossible to believe that none of them was good enough to be groomed for the top slot. We know that internal candidates are far less likely to fail than external ones and we know that boards need to focus on this. I’m on a board myself and Welch’s reminder makes me feel properly anxious.At the very least, what the HP spat shows is that there is a gap in the market for more feather-rufflers among top people. Even if CEOs feel they have to keep quiet as holding their tongues is helpful when it comes to holding on to their jobs, free speech could be something they look forward to in retirement. The job of corporate hell-raiser strikes me as much more worthwhile than the more common retirement route of joining a government taskforce and keeping lips zipped tighter than ever.Off the top of my head I can think of one person who would fill such a slot perfectly: Carol Bartz of Yahoo. On YouTube there is a clip of her banging on about her business that has been watched by just 300 people. But there is another clip – “Yahoo!’s CEO Carol Bartz tells Michael Arrington to F-off” that has been watched by 209,506. If she does get kicked out at Yahoo for not being popular enough to lead the company, she would be just perfect as a corporate vigilante.lucy.kellaway@ft.com"
494;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Heron writes down value of its investments;;Heron International, the investment group run by property tycoon Gerald Ronson, was forced to write down the value of its investments by £54m ($86m) in its last financial year as it continued to feel the effects of the real estate crash.According to accounts filed at the group level, the value of Heron’s property portfolio fell by more than 8 per cent to £644m in 2009 at a gross asset level. This also includes about £13m of currency losses from the strengthening of sterling against its European assets. Heron made a pre-tax loss of £400,000, which has narrowed from a £6m loss made in 2008.Mr Ronson has been a property investor and developer since the 1950s and is well known for his strong views on the real estate market. He chose not to pay a dividend this year to himself or his American backers, which are said to include Larry Ellison, the Oracle chief, Michael Milken, the former junk-bond king, and Steve Wynn, the casino mogul. Heron paid dividends of £17.2m to its investors last year.Jonathan Goldstein, Heron deputy chief executive, said the company had taken a conservative approach on valuations. He added that the market had improved since the end of the financial year.Mr Goldstein said Heron was now focused on its two main projects in the City of London, the office tower that is nearly finished on Bishopsgate and an apartment block near Moorgate. Heron owns about a third of the office tower, with the rest owned by a group of Middle Eastern investors.The tower development was held at cost in the company’s balance sheet, so Heron has not benefited from the rise in values in City office buildings over the past year.Heron has recently begun to sign up tenants at its tower, including a firm of City solicitors at a rent of about £55 per sq ft, with other deals expected to be announced in the next two months. It has also sold almost half of the flats in its residential block.Mr Goldstein said Heron had not acquired any big investments in the financial period. Last year, Mr Ronson said he would selectively buy assets as the market recovered, and was linked with a bid to acquire Tower 42 this year.
495;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-07T00:29:07Z;Motorola targets Apple in lawsuit;;Motorola has added to the stack of legal cases building up in the smartphone business, taking aim at Apple over alleged infringement of 18 of its patents.The lawsuit comes days after Motorola itself became the target of legal action by Microsoft, and adds to a morass of litigation that has also drawn in Google, Nokia, HTC and Oracle.Smartphone makers have characterised the lawsuits as the unavoidable “teething troubles” of a promising new business, and the by-product of a convergence between what were once discrete cellphone and computing markets.However, some analysts have described the legal manoeuvrings as tactical, as companies fighting for leadership in the new market look for ways to stall their competitors or add to their costs. The head of one large tech company, who declined to be named, warned that the thicket of lawsuits could slow the development of the smartphone business.Echoing the legal tactics used by others, Motorola said it had lodged a complaint with the US International Trade Commission while also filing lawsuits in federal court, in its case in the northern district of Illinois and the southern district of Florida.A successful application could result in Apple being blocked from importing products said to contravene the patents, which Motorola listed as the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, as well as certain models of the Mac.Motorola described its 18 patents as covering core technologies in Apple’s products, touching on areas ranging from mobile communications to the management of software applications on smartphones, location-based services and synchronisation between multiple devices.The legal action is the first that Motorola has taken over the patents, at least some of which have already been licensed to other companies.“After Apple’s late entry into the telecommunications market, we engaged in lengthy negotiations, but Apple has refused to take a licence,” said Kirk Daily, in charge of intellectual property at Motorola’s cellphone division. Apple declined to comment.Apple faces a lawsuit from Nokia over its iPhone technology and has taken legal action of its own against the Finnish cellphone maker.Apple is also part of a wider legal challenge to Google’s Android smartphone operating system, having filed a lawsuit against handset maker HTC over its use of the software. That echoes Microsoft’s action against Motorola over its use of Android software and Oracle’s action against Google over the alleged use of its Java technology in Android.The spate of actions is a result of the collision of the cellphone and computing worlds, said Horacio Gutiérrez, Microsoft’s chief intellectual property lawyer.
496;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-04T19:06:24Z;VMware lays down corporate IT marker;;"If anyone should understand the threat from a competitive onslaught by Microsoft, it is Paul Maritz.The chief executive of VMware, the hottest software start-up in the new era of “cloud computing”, Mr Maritz was himself a top Microsoft executive in the 1990s, and ultimately responsible for such landmark products as the Windows 95 operating system.Now that he finds himself squarely in the sights of the world’s biggest software company, he is under no illusions.“If you look into Microsoft’s soul, they define themselves by competitiveness – it’s both their strength and their weakness,” he says.It is not hard to see why Microsoft should be taking aim. VMware has established what Mr Maritz calls a “beachhead” in corporate information technology systems from which it has the chance to outflank his former employer.“Today, the innovation [in software] is occurring above and below the operating system,” he says. In periods of upheaval such as this in the technology world, he adds, “history teaches you it’s the company you don’t know about that emerges the winner”.Wall Street has certainly warmed to Mr Maritz’s theme since he took over in 2008. In the past year, VMware’s shares have more than doubled: among software companies, its $34bn market value is now topped only by Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. It now accounts for two-thirds of the stock market value of EMC, the storage company that owns most of its stock, compared with less than 40 per cent a year ago.The beachhead to which Mr Maritz refers is VMware’s core business, known as virtualisation. This involves inserting a layer of software between a computer’s hardware and its operating system, making it possible for multiple computing tasks to work on the same machine at the same time, and so reduce the number of computers companies need to buy.Almost by accident, however, VMware’s hardware-saving technology has put it in pole position in the hottest area of the corporate IT world – cloud computing, which involves centralising computing tasks in larger datacentres, where the massed power of ranks of servers can be amalgamated for greater efficiency.Once companies started to virtualise their servers, says Mr Maritz, “they could start thinking of them as a single, giant computer”.A response from Microsoft was guaranteed. Two years after launching a rival virtualisation product, known as a hypervisor, as a free add-on to its Windows Server software, Microsoft already claims to hold a 25 per cent share of the virtualisation market.Faced with what Mr Maritz refers to as “trench warfare” – not a strategy he says he wants to pursue – VMware has been racing to expand the functions of its software layer, adding elements that make it easier for companies to manage and control how their applications run in big datacentres. The VMware chief compares Microsoft’s attack on virtualisation with an attempt when he was at the company to take on Oracle in the database software market by giving away copies of its own software, called SQL Server. “We thought all we had to do was give it away and the world would beat a path to our door,” he says. “But when we did that, nothing happened.”Like other software companies that have tried to outflank Microsoft, VMware is also counting on allies to make up for its own lack of scale. Instead of building its own datacentres and selling services directly to companies – creating something known as a “public cloud”, which Microsoft is attempting – it has been lining up telecoms groups including Verizon and AT&T as partners.Since Mr Maritz arrived, VMware has also opened a new front in the fight, expanding from the virtualisation layer that sits below a computer operating system to the layer that sits immediately above it and provides the support for applications running on the system.The acquisition of SpringSource, an open source software company, has given VMware a base for developers to work on, while the purchase of Zimbra, an e-mail company, has taken VMware into the realm of applications themselves, further extending its battlefront with Microsoft.This ambitious strategy, to get a toehold at many levels of software, is a direct echo of Mr Maritz’s experience at Microsoft, says Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC, although he added that it did not look over-ambitious given VMware’s strong starting point.With high stakes, meanwhile, Mr Maritz, believes he has little choice: “When you have the big guys trained on you, you have
no option but to be ambitious.”"
497;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-03T18:41:48Z;Oracle fury at HP choice of chief;;Hewlett-Packard’s choice of Léo Apotheker as its new head has enraged Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive, who said over the weekend that Mr Apotheker had been in charge of SAP at a time when it was stealing Oracle’s software.Mr Ellison was referring to events after SAP’s 2005 takeover of software maintenance company TomorrowNow, which admitted making unauthorised copies of Oracle products from the database maker’s customer accounts.According to a federal lawsuit that Oracle filed against SAP in Oakland in 2007 and which is scheduled for trial in November, the SAP board knew TomorrowNow routinely pilfered Oracle wares and continued the practice until October 2008, six months after Mr Apotheker rose to become co-chief executive at SAP.In pretrial filings, SAP conceded both copyright and computer violations but argued that the damage was in the tens of millions of dollars, not the $1bn or more Oracle is seeking.“SAP has already publicly confessed and accepted financial responsibility for systematically stealing Oracle’s intellectual property over a long period of time. Much of this industrial espionage and intellectual property theft occurred while Léo was CEO of SAP,” Mr Ellison wrote in an e-mail to the Financial Times.“The HP board must have been aware of these facts, yet they appointed Léo CEO of HP anyway. What happened to ‘The HP Way’ [the corporate creed published by HP founder Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett]?”HP declined to comment.Mr Apotheker does not play a significant role in the court papers thus far, but he has given an interview under oath to Oracle lawyers and is expected to be called as a witness.SAP was warned that there was a threat of litigation from Oracle over TomorrowNow even before it approved the acquisition in early 2005, according to court documents.SAP rushed into the purchase of TomorrowNow as competition with Oracle was intensifying, prompted by the latter’s purchase of PeopleSoft, which made Oracle the second-biggest maker of business applications and SAP’s biggest rival in that market.SAP acquired TomorrowNow, which provided maintenance services to PeopleSoft customers, to deprive Oracle of service revenue and eventually to try to convince the clients to switch to SAP products.HP and Oracle are now facing off more directly, underpinning Mr Ellison’s animosity.Oracle bought Sun Microsystems, a fading hardware competitor to HP, this year, and inflamed the company by hiring its ousted chief executive, Mark Hurd, as co-president.
498;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-02T00:23:02Z;Microsoft files lawsuit over Android;;Microsoft has mounted an indirect legal attack on Google over its highly successful Android smartphone operating system, accusing handset maker Motorola of patent infringement for including the software in its own devices.The action adds to a growing pile of lawsuits over Android that has been filed by some of the tech industry’s leading names in recent months.However, the legal challenges have not slowed the momentum of the software platform, which overtook Apple’s iPhone software in the second quarter of this year in worldwide shipments, according to research group Gartner.Earlier this year, Apple sued HTC, the Taiwanese handset maker, alleging patent infringement in its Android phones, while Oracle attacked Google last month, claiming Android illegally included elements of its Java software.On Friday, Microsoft filed claims with the US International Trade Court and in a Federal court in Seattle, accusing Motorola’s Android handsets of infringing nine of its patents. The claims cover some of the most basic functions on smartphones, including the way they synchronise with e-mail held on servers, as well as with calendar and contacts information.While the suit targets Motorola, “the patented features implicated in the action are in the Android platform” itself rather than in technology added by the handset maker, said Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel.Legal actions tend to be filed against a handset’s maker rather than producers of the underlying software or other technologies in the device, since the hardware producer takes on direct responsibility for “clearing” the intellectual property rights involved in their products, according to one legal expert.Motorola said it would “vigorously defend itself” against the Microsoft claim, while Google said: “We are disappointed that Microsoft prefers to compete over old patents rather than new products. Sweeping software patent claims like these threaten innovation.”The action comes shortly before the launch of handsets running Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 operating system, a delayed response to touchscreen smartphones such as Android handsets and the iPhone.The timing did not appear to be a coincidence, suggested Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC: “I have no doubt that Microsoft wants to make sure everyone understands the value of the IP protection that comes with licensing their products, as opposed to unprotected software like Android where the device makers have to fend for themselves.”However, Microsoft dismissed suggestions that the lawsuit was designed to slow down adoption of Android.“We have a very strong bias in favour of licensing,” said Mr Gutierrez.
499;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-01T21:26:52Z;HP keeps its latest CEO on a shorter leash;;After the mess of Mark Hurd’s departure, it’s good to see that Hewlett-Packard’s board has learnt a few lessons.Leo Apotheker’s employment contract, on file today with the SEC, reveals that the new CEO has no guaranteed contract term. Instead, he is employed “at will”, which effectively makes it easier for the company to dispense with his services any time it likes.Perhaps even more important is HP’s stipulation of the circumstances in which it can sack Mr Apotheker “for cause” – another glaring omission from the Hurd contract, and an issue over which HP has been heavily criticised.All of this will go down well with the corporate governance purists, who strongly favour “at will” arrangements like this. Mark Hurd, by contrast, had a five-year deal (though he was still in the process of renewing his previous, expired contract when HP’s directors felt compelled to push for his immediate departure.)Also, while Mr Hurd’s terms did not outline the circumstances under which he could be dismissed, Mr Apotheker’s contract spells them out:“Cause” will mean (i) Executive’s material neglect (other than as a result of illness or disability) of his duties or responsibilities to the Company or (ii) Executive’s conduct (including action or failure to act) that Executive knew or should have known is materially inconsistent with the best interests of, or is materially injurious to, the Company.Had the HP directors been able to brandish a broadly written clause like that against Mr Hurd, they might well have felt bolder about refusing him the giant severance payment which has since become such an embarrassment – particularly given his immediate defection to rival Oracle.
500;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-01T17:47:51Z;HP’s choice of chief worries investors;;Major investors in Hewlett-Packard have reacted nervously to the appointment of Léo Apotheker as chief executive.Concerns about his mixed operations record and inexperience with computer hardware appeared to outweigh enthusiasm for his strong relationships with top technology customers.Shares in the biggest tech company by revenue fell nearly 4 per cent on the uncertainty on Friday.Mr Apotheker, the former head of German business software supplier SAP, gave no timeline for setting out his own vision for HP.“I want to meet with as many HP people as I can. The same with customers and shareholders,” Mr Apotheker told investors on his maiden HP conference call with analysts. “Just stay tuned.”HP directors said Mr Apotheker had been their unanimous and only choice among six candidates qualified to succeed Mark Hurd, who was dismissed in early August amid controversy over his expense filings.“We wanted a strategic thinker with a passion for technology,” said lead independent director Robert Ryan, praising Mr Apotheker’s track record in helping make SAP the largest provider of business software applications.Mr Ryan and Wall Street analysts pointed to the new chief executive’s background in far-flung geographies, where HP is keen to expand.Mr Apotheker’s background, together with HP’s appointment on Thursday of former Oracle president Ray Lane as non-executive chairman, convinced investors that the company is bent on increasing its software offerings to compete on more fronts with IBM, Oracle and Cisco.All four companies are trying to make themselves into comprehensive suppliers of computer servers, data storage and networking gear, as well as services and software.Mr Apotheker called software the “glue” that distinguishes HP’s hardware, although it now makes up just 3 per cent of the group’s revenue. Analysts said they expected big acquisitions in software, which could accelerate technology merger activity.Mr Apotheker did not come cheaply. HP disclosed that in addition to a $1.2m base salary, the 20-year SAP veteran and polyglot will receive a $4m signing bonus, a relocation allowance of $4.6m, and 76,000 shares of restricted stock.Mr Apotheker lasted less than a year as SAP’s sole chief executive. He was ousted in February after annual software revenue fell 28 per cent.“The new CEO at HP had to be both visionary and operator to facilitate the company’s ongoing construction of a one-stop IT shop for enterprise solutions,” said analyst Mark Moskowitz of JPMorgan.“We believe Léo Apotheker possesses visionary qualities, given his contributions to SAP’s software applications business over the years.”
501;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-10-01T15:01:07Z;HP names Apotheker as chief executive;;Hewlett-Packard named Leo Apotheker, a long-time senior executive at SAP, the German business software provider, as its new chief executive, ending a search that began after the forced resignation of Mark Hurd in early August.The appointment on Thursday surprised analysts because HP reached not only beyond its own ranks but outside its home country, picking a man who lasted less than a year as SAP’s sole chief executive before his departure in February as annual sales fell 28 per cent.But the choice of a software veteran could foretell more aggressive moves by HP both into that higher-margin sector and overseas. Mr Apotheker, 57, told the Financial Times that software would be a high priority and that he saw no reason to alter HP’s aggressive acquisition strategy, which has continued since Mr Hurd’s departure.“HP has an unmatched set of products and services, among them software,” he said. “Our focus is going to be on innovation and growth.”The world’s largest technology group by revenue, HP moved heavily into services, with the purchase of EDS, under Mr Hurd, in order to compensate for slower growth and lower profits in the computer business.Mr Apotheker, who will move to California’s Silicon Valley from his current home in Paris and start work by the beginning of November, said that it would be “presumptuous to offer details” of his views before a worldwide trip to meet and listen to employees. He praised HP’s management team, financial strength and market share leadership in many categories.Robert Ryan, HP’s lead independent director, said that Mr Apotheker “has demonstrated success in the US market and also has vast international experience, which will be a major asset as HP continues to expand globally, particularly in high-growth emerging markets”.HP shares dipped as much as 3 per cent in after-hours trading shortly after the announcement. On Friday, they were off by 2.9 per cent to $40.85 in mid-morning trading.Mr Apotheker said that the downturn at SAP tracked the economic crisis and that he was proud of the 18 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in software sales to 2009.
502;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-28T15:11:47Z;Aerospace: Finding spares can be a complex challenge;;Modern civil airliners are complex pieces of equipment with as many as 4m components involved in their manufacture. Organising the supply chain that delivers anything from nuts and bolts to complete sub-assemblies is equally tricky.Enterprise resource planning systems are common throughout many industries as a way of managing a wide range of company functions, from finance through human resources to supply chain.Big ERP suppliers, such as SAP and Oracle, offer systems that can manage ordinary supply chains, but aerospace industry experts say specialist products to meet the sector’s requirements are needed.For all its high-tech image, the aerospace industry has proved less than leading-edge in managing its supply chain – as both Boeing and Airbus have found. Delays to recent launches by the two leading aerospace companies have revealed gaps.Boeing made the mistake of subcontracting large parts of the manufacture of its 787 Dreamliner while at the same time boosting the quantity of high-tech composite materials in the design. EADS, the European aircraft-making consortium, faced problems installing the 500 kms of electrical wiring in each of its Airbus 380s.“The aerospace industry has been very much a craft industry for a lot longer than the automotive sector,” says Peter Dickin, marketing manager for Delcam, a Birmingham, UK based developer of manufacturing software. “Until now, the industry didn’t make aircraft in anything like the volumes cars have been made in for decades.”“The sector is split between large groups, such as Rolls-Royce, that are global, and a very long tail of smaller companies,” explain Ed Savage and Tim Lawrence, supply chain experts at PA Consulting Group. “There are thousands of components in an aircraft and any one can stop it flying. There is a real logistical challenge in tracking all these components deep down into the supply chain.”The challenge facing the industry is complicated by the fact that aircraft may remain in service for decades and need spare parts for their entire working life.“Auto manufacturers bring out a new model every four to six years, but an aerospace company can be making the same components 40 years later,” says Andrew Mair, chief executive of the Midlands Aerospace Alliance, a UK regional grouping of suppliers.“Companies have to service, overhaul and repair aircraft, but that often involves only small volumes of a particular part.”Just as specialist logistics companies have evolved to handle deliveries in sectors such as food retailing and automotive components, similar organisations have emerged in the aerospace industry. Umeco, a London-listed company, works with customers, such as engine supplier Rolls-Royce, to establish their needs, create bills of materials required and match that with inventory that it holds from component suppliers.“We provide an outsourced solution for C-class parts, the nuts and bolts of the industry,” says Clive Snowdon, chief executive. “We inspect products and deliver to the point of use. We have a proactive vendor management programme and may put our people into suppliers if they default. We look for well financed, well-resourced suppliers, because a casualty can cause enormous disruption.”Umeco uses a common IT platform to link its five supply hubs around the world so it can see where it has a particular product in its network.It originally bought an IT package from a local supplier, but when that company said it would no longer support the software, Umeco bought the code and continued to update it and broaden its functionality.“A lot of mainstream distributors have tried to break in, but they realise their systems are not capable of dealing with the complexity,” says Mr Snowdon. “Our customers need full traceability, so we have to provide provenance back to the base metal.”Michael Burkett, managing vice-president of supply chain research at Gartner, an IT research company, says: “The aerospace industry has a need for basic supply chain management capability, such as demand planning and production scheduling, but there are also business processes that are unique to aerospace.“The big airline manufacturers have long order books but they don’t necessarily know the configuration customers want. When they get the final order, they have to be prepared for things to change. They need the capability to deal with that.”This has led to the creation of a web-based business-to-business hub called Exostar, formed by a partnership of BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. This allows customers to forecast their requirements and source material from suppliers.“The ERP vendors have achieved a deeper penetration of supply chains, but ERP its still not 100 per cent what the aerospace industry needs,” says Mr Burkett. “Spare parts planning, in particular, requires unique algorithms to forecast demand. The problem is still the ability to make rapid changes.”
503;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-27T16:40:08Z;Big Data, Big Blue and Going Green;;Forget buckets’ of data, think cloudsBig opportunities lie in big data. Storage giant EMC has teamed up with Cloudera, a specialist in database software, to create technologies to better support “big data”. Once only oil companies and retail giants could afford the technologies needed to analyse the huge and constantly growing quantities of data produced by operational systems – till receipts, image files, sensor log files and so on. But the tumbling cost of storage and the growth of cloud computing has transformed this market. Startup Cloudera is using the open source Hadoop software package to analyse very large sets of data. In similar vein, IBM last week announced it would acquire Netezza, whose data warehouse appliances reduce the cost of managing big data.Have BlackBerry, can printPrinters, printers everywhere. But with an increasingly mobile workforce, users are less likely to be tethered to a desktop PC and office printer. Hewlett-Packard has risen to this challenge with a clutch of new offerings. First off is ePrint Enterprise that lets BlackBerry owners send documents to any printer connected to the enterprise network – or selected external outlets such as a FedEx office or hotel. To ensure privacy, the document can only be printed when the user enters the correct code – sent by email – on the chosen printer. HP also announced a range of touchscreen-equipped multifunctional printer devices designed to eliminate the need for PC when performing simple tasks such as printing a boarding pass or accessing Google Docs to scan in a document that can then be printed at a later time and in a different place.Self service customer support from ‘Big Blue’If your call centre attracts more brick bats then praise, maybe its time to switch to web-based customer support. IBM’s Customer Experience Suite encourages customers to help themselves to information using blogs, chat forums, video, social networking tools and, increasingly, mobile devices. As well as improving post-sales support, the software can help clinch new sales by personalising each customer’s online experience – a more simplified site for mobile users, for example. The CES suite is aimed at large enterprises and comprises the latest versions of IBM’s WebSphere Portal and Lotus Web Content Management software.Proving green credentialsStruggling to go beyond good intentions and put some hard facts in your corporate sustainability report? Oracle has unveiled an environmental sustainability management offering for manufacturers keen to shed their smoke-stack image. The latest version of its Oracle Manufacturing Operations Center software handles sensor data and so can monitor energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions and other key performance indicators.Private clouds and mainframesMeanwhile, Oracle’s annual user conference produced the usual blitz of software announcements upgrades and “roadmaps”. More surprising was to hear the software giant announce a piece of hardware, the Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud. As its name suggests, it is Oracle’s attempt to steal the cloud computing spotlight. It comprises a mix of Oracle software and high-performance hardware and is aimed at enterprises that want to build their own “private cloud” using their own hardware. Sounds suspiciously like mainframe computer.Quick ERP?SAP is out to shake off the perception that its business software takes forever to install. It has launched a range of Rapid Deployment solutions that it claims can be deployed in as little as 12 weeks. The first ones are based on existing SAP software for managing customers, suppliers and business communications. Future offerings will be tailored to diverse industries and in areas such as analytics, manufacturing, mobility, recruiting, supply chain, sustainability and treasury.Cisco VPN app comes to iPhone/iPadBowing to market trends, Cisco has made its virtual private network software available on Apple’s App Store. The VPN software, previously aimed at laptop users, now lets iPhone and iPad users securely access their corporate network from a mobile device. If the wireless connection is lost, the software automatically switches to WiFi – or vice versa – and, in theory at least, any application that’s running should not notice the handoff.
504;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-24T21:00:32Z;US stocks rally on durable goods figures;;"US stocks rallied after data showed that spending on durable goods rebounded in August and that the figure for July was better than previously reported.The S&P 500 closed up 2.1 per cent to 1,148.67, up 2 per cent over the week, its fourth successive weekly gain.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.9 per cent to close at 10,860.26, rising 2.4 per cent over the five days and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.3 per cent higher to close at 2,381.22, up 2.8 per cent on the week.Data released on Friday showed orders for durable goods, excluding the volatile transportation sector, climbed 2 per cent in August. Economists had forecast an increase of 1 per cent for the leading indicator of manufacturing activity. Including transportation, orders fell 1.3 per cent as Boeing saw civilian aircraft orders decline sharply.“It’s the realisation that the double dip is receding in probability and I would say the durable goods data today is in some sense the frosting on the cake,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist with Principal Global Investors. Mr Baur said it was natural to see a weakening in economic growth after a sharp rise.“Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard was bare so manufacturers had to ramp up production very fast from a low level just to put stuff on the shelves. Then this began to decelerate and that’s where everyone starts to worry.”All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose – nine rising more than 1 per cent and six more than 2 per cent.Industrials led the risers, up 2.8 per cent, on hopes for a speedier economic recovery. Caterpillargained 4.6 per cent to $79.73 and Cummins added 2.9 per cent to $90.86.Housebuilders, which were yo-yoing all week in response to mixed data on the housing market, soared 3.1 per cent after new-home sales remained steady, at a low 288,000, in August. The financials sector, which has suffered after some analysts lowered their projections for quarterly bank profits, advanced 2.8 per cent, wiping out the week’s losses.Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $25.15, Goldman Sachs rose 1.6 per cent to $147.28 and Citigroup jumped 2.7 per cent to $3.90.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index added 2.6 per cent, lifted by news from Nike. The world’s largest manufacturer of athletics shoes beat expectations with its first-quarter profit and offered a positive outlook. Earnings per share were $1.14 compared with predictions of $1 per share after strong demand in China and the US.Sales soared 8 per cent and future orders jumped
13 per cent. Shares in Nike added 2.5 per cent to reach an all-time high of $79.57.But also in athletic apparel, retailer Finish Linefell 9.2 per cent to $14.25 after it missed estimates because it failed to restock popular items quickly enough.The technology sector, which has been the biggest riser so far in September, up 12.6 per cent, advanced 2 per cent. Amazon hit an all-time high, rising 5.2 per cent to $160.73.Chipmakers were in focus after Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, said the software maker might buy a chip manufacturer.Oracle fell 0.6 per cent to $26.96 but US-listed shares of ARM Holdings, which designs chips that power iPhones, surged 7.6 per cent to $19.79 on speculation that it could be a target.Advanced Micro Devices, a chipmaker, rose 6.9 per cent to $6.84 in spite of saying third-quarter sales would be weaker than predicted because of lower demand for notebook computers in Europe and North America.Rival Intel, which reduced its forecast at the end of August, gained
2.3 per cent to $19.42.Gold companies, which have risen this week with the price of gold, continued to climb, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold up 2.8 per cent to $86.61."
505;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-24T16:04:53Z;Intec Telecom shares surge on CSG offer;;"Shares in Intec Telecom Systems rose sharply on news that CSG Systems of the US had made an agreed offer that valued its UK telecom billing software rival at £236.7m.The combined company will have 3,500 staff around the world and revenues of $760m, creating a challenger to market leader Amdocs of the US in the business support systems sector.The 72p-a-share offer represents a 30 per cent premium to Intec’s closing share price on July 23, the last business day before the London-listed group entered into an offer period.Intec’s shares rose as much as 36 per cent on Friday to 76¾p, as investors speculated on a possible counter bidder from a rival such as Oracle.“We think that the offer represents a decent premium and provides certainty in what’s been a difficult market over the past nine months,” said Andrew Taylor, chief executive.Intec said that buy-out group General Atlantic, which has a 12 per cent stake in the company, was supporting the offer.Increased competition in emerging markets and the reluctance of large phone carriers to commit to heavy IT spending coming out of the global economic downturn, has hit Intec’s business over the past year. Intec issued a profit warning in March and another one after it lost a major contract, knocking the shares off since their 120p high in February.Intec – which has 400 clients including Vodafone, China Mobile and AT&T – held takeover talks in 2008 with an unnamed group but an offer never materialised.Ian Spence, principal analyst at Megabuyte, said that while Intec’s trading performance had been weak in recent months it remained “a real prize for any acquirer in our view; primarily because of its customer relationships”.Analysts said Nasdaq-listed CSG, which is focused on the North American market, and Intec were a good fit with little geographical overlap. However, they questioned whether CSG, which is valued at $715m, was large enough to digest Intec.“Intec is a pretty meaty buy for CSG whether measured by revenue or valuation, and would normally ring our ‘acquisition indigestion’ warning bells,” said TechMarketView.Greenhill advised CSG, while RBS Hoare Govett advised Intec."
506;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-23T17:39:00Z;Facebook founder’s wealth rises 245%;;Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune has risen 245 per cent to $6.9bn, outstripping that of Apple’s Steve Jobs or News Corp’s Rupert Murdoch, according to Forbes magazine, which ranks the Facebook founder America’s 35th richest person.The calculation, coming as a film shines an unflattering light on the 26-year-old, is based on private equity investments in Facebook, which assigned a theoretical valuation of about $23bn to the private company, Forbes said.It comes as Mr Zuckerberg is reported to be planning to announce a $100m donation to schools in Newark, New Jersey, on Oprah Winfrey’s television show. The donation, set to be announced with New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Newark mayor Cory Booker, would be the largest for any donor his age.The annual ranking of America’s wealthiest people estimates that the combined net worth of those on the Forbes 400 list rose 8 per cent to about $1,370bn in the past year. The “price of admission” to the list has recovered to $1bn, having dipped from $1.3bn to $950m after the financial crisis.Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder now better known for giving his money away, led the list of 400 wealthiest Americans for the 17th year in succession, with a net worth up from $50bn to $54bn – below its $59bn peak in 2007 and at the same level at which it stood in 2001.His bridge partner and Berkshire Hathaway’s chairman and chief executive, Warren Buffett, saw his wealth recover from $40bn to $45bn, although still below the $52bn reached in 2007. Larry Ellison, in the news for having hired Hewlett-Packard’s Mark Hurd to Oracle, held third position with $27bn.Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York City, lost the title of New York’s richest billionaire to David Koch, a prominent supporter of the Tea Party movement with an estimated fortune of $21.5bn.The rankings come as Forbes has faced criticism from the White House for a cover story by Dinesh D’Souza describing President Obama as “the most antibusiness president in a generation, perhaps in American history”.Steve Forbes, its editor-in-chief, has written editorials about the “horrors of ObamaCare”, and urged the repeal of a “Soviet-style diktat” that every American must purchase health insurance.Forbes sold a minority stake in 2006 to Elevation Partners, the private equity firm whose investment team includes Bono, U2’s lead singer.
507;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-21T21:44:56Z;TechMarketView eyes IT slowdown;;The development of Britain’s technology sector will soon mirror the static automotive sector of the 1960s, according to Richard Holway, chairman of TechMarketView and one of the UK’s top IT analysts.Public sector cuts and the sluggish economy will strangle growth in the industry for the next three years as operators struggle to find new models to make money, Mr Holway told the FT ahead of an annual address to 60 members of the technology community.He said that while the sector would start expanding again in 2013, it would do so at a slower pace than the rest of Britain’s economy largely due to cloud computing, which will see information transferred from users’ computers to remote centralised providers. “Cloud computing will provide major benefits for users but at a lower cost, affecting [certain tech companies’] revenues”, he said.“Companies such as Microsoft and Oracle have the challenge of keeping their business going with the old model and developing a new model in the cloud …It’s going to be a difficult period for many companies.”As corporate clients and ordinary users cut their outlay on IT, British tech companies will be hit by a 10 per cent drop in spending by the public sector between 2010 and 2011, according to Mr Holway.Until now the public sector has been the “lifebuoy” of the IT sector, representing more than 30 per cent of the industry’s revenues.Some industry analysts agreed with Mr Holway’s predictions regarding the decline in public sector spending, but expressed faith Britain’s tech companies would evolve in the face of a changing industry.
508;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-21T21:01:54Z;S&P retreats after Fed stance rattles investors;;US stocks finished an afternoon of choppy trading lower as the Federal Reserve said that it was prepared to take action to bolster the economic recovery but did not announce further quantitative easing.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,139.78, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,761.03 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent lower at 2,349.35.Shares, which had been lower before the Fed’s announcement, briefly rallied afterwards, before losing ground.The market had broken through the critical 1,130 level on Monday partly on the back of speculation that the Fed would introduce further measures to spur the economic recovery.The Federal Open Market Committee also decided to keep fund rates steady and said that, if needed, it would take action to return inflation over time to levels consistent with its mandate. “They rattled the sabres pretty heavily this time particularly the bit where they said they saw inflation below what is consistent with its mandate, which suggests that further quantitative easing is coming but not this time,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“I think they’ll provide additional accommodation further down the line – at the minimum after the election. But they’ll wait and see how the economic indicators come in. At the moment they are trending towards improvement so they could still shift enough to reassure.”Most sectors finished the day down, but the industrials index closed up 0.1 per cent. The dollar, lower after the Fed’s decision, could help export-driven industrials.Before the opening bell, a report showed builders started construction on more houses than expected and permits for future construction also rose.Housing starts climbed to a four-month high, suggesting the housing market could be starting to stabilise after the end of homebuyer tax credit.Analysts had expected construction to start on 550,000 houses, but it actually started on 598,000 units, on a seasonally adjusted basis.The S&P 500 homebuilders index initially rallied but later edged lower as some analysts were concerned that the rise was mainly due to a jump in the number of multi-family properties being built, a much more volatile figure than single-family housing.The homebuilders index ended the session lower by 0.7 per cent, with DR Horton losing 0.6 per cent to $10.98 and Pulte Group falling 1.6 per cent to $8.52.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 financials index led the fallers, down 1 per cent. Morgan Stanley retreated by 2.9 per cent to $26.06.M&T Bank fell 2.5 per cent to $88.69 after it was reported that it may give a majority stake to Banco Santander when it merges with the Spanish bank’s US unit. US-listed shares in Banco Santander nudged up 0.2 per cent to $12.90.Shares in travel companies from cruise liners to air carriers rose. Carnival Corp, the world’s largest cruise company, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings as sales climbed 6.9 per cent. Net income was $1.62 per share and the company forecast full year earnings above current expectations, of between $2.48 and $2.52 a share. Its shares were up 1.4 per cent to $37.57, after rising as much as 3 per cent earlier in the session.Airlines were lifted by an announcement by International Air Travel Association that carriers were likely to post sharply higher 2010 profits than previously forecast, even though the association also warned that 2011 could be disappointing.United Airlines’ holding company UAL Corp advanced 4.8 per cent to $23.50, Continental Airlines was boosted by 4.9 per cent to $24.66 and AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines, climbed 3.6 per cent to $6.88.Hewlett-Packard said it had resolved its differences with Oracle in their dispute over the appointment of Mark Hurd, former HP chief executive, as co-president of Oracle, and reaffirmed the partnership between the two companies.HP rose 1.4 per cent to $39.92 while Oracle fell 2.4 per cent to $26.82.
509;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-20T23:23:22Z;HP and Oracle end Hurd dispute;;HP and Oracle have resolved their differences in the dispute over the right of Mark Hurd to take up a post as co-president at Oracle.HP had sued its former chief executive shortly after he joined its long-time partner and latter-day rival this month. It also sought an injunction in a California court preventing Mr Hurd taking up his new role.In a joint statement on Monday, HP and Oracle said they were reaffirming their long-term strategic partnership, with 140,000 shared customers, and announcing the resolution of litigation regarding Mr Hurd.They said the terms of the settlement were confidential, but Mr Hurd would adhere to his obligations to protect HP’s confidential information while fulfilling his responsibilities at Oracle.In its court filing, HP had alleged Mr Hurd would “be in a situation in which he cannot perform his duties for Oracle without necessarily using and disclosing HP’s trade secrets”.It is understood that Mr Hurd’s severance deal did not have a non-compete clause, but the lawsuit said he had signed agreements with HP preventing him disclosing trade secrets.In a regulatory filing on Monday, HP said it was modifying the terms of Mr Hurd’s separation agreement as part of the legal resolution. It said he had agreed to waive his rights to remaining compensation due to him, namely 330,000 units of performance-based restricted stock and 16,000 time-based units.Cathie Lesjak, interim chief executive, said in the joint statement: “We look forward to collaborating with Oracle in the future,”Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive said: “Oracle and HP will continue to build and expand a partnership that has already lasted for over 25 years”.Mr Ellison had been sharply critical of HP when it allowed Mr Hurd to leave in August, calling it “the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago”.Mr Hurd resigned over code of conduct breaches at HP. Its board said it had found no violation of its sexual harassment policy regarding his relationship with a female consultant, but determined that expense reports filed by or for him were inappropriate.In spite of their warm words on a long partnership, Oracle and HP have increasingly been in competition as they have moved into each other’s core areas of business and made acquisitions.
510;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-20T08:48:07Z;Oracle;With Sun on board, Oracle is starting to look a bit like Apple;Oracle is starting to look a bit like Apple. Following last year’s $7bn purchase of Sun Microsystems, it now sells an integrated package of hardware and software. It is also getting the knack of surpassing expectations. Good first-quarter results pushed shares in the world’s second-largest software company up 8 per cent on Friday, taking them to a post-tech boom high.Larry Ellison talking about database products may not generate the same buzz as Steve Jobs showing off his latest consumer gadget. Yet aficionados will be no less excited as they throng the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco this week for Oracle’s annual product showcase. Oracle and Apple are also loved by the analyst community: according to Bloomberg, 94 per cent of Apple analysts have buy recommendations, to Oracle’s 83 per cent.Oracle’s strength stems in part from the ongoing recovery in business spending. While weaker consumer demand than expected has weighed on expectations in the PC supply chain, Oracle’s software licence revenues were a third higher than a year ago, the strongest such growth since 2004.The company is also outperforming peers, particularly SAP, its main rival. The integration of Sun is progressing well, with gross margins in the quarter rising to 48 per cent, even though revenues shrank. Oracle aims ultimately to reach 60 per cent gross margins, up from 30 per cent when Sun was acquired.There are differences between Oracle and Apple. The former is a serial acquirer. Its shares have risen 3½ times over the decade compared with the 40-fold rise at more organically minded Apple. Both trade on a high-teens prospective earnings multiple, and offer similar rates of profit growth. Investors trying to choose between them must decide whether they are more comfortable with acquisition risk at Oracle, or the danger of innovation faltering at Apple.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
511;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;US data and Ireland fears hit stocks;Gold breaches $1,280 for first time;Friday 21:45 BST. An attempt at a rally in equities has been cut short, as US economic data made another poor showing and eurozone sovereign debt fear spiked once again.The FTSE All-World index has given up strong gains and was up only fractionally, while highly rated sovereign bonds are in demand. The S&P 500 on Wall Street was also fractionally higher, at 1,125.Industrial commodity prices are up, though it is noticeable that one popular proxy of risk aversion, gold, has hit another record high, dragging silver along in its wake.European bourses had challenged five-month highs in early trading, after well-received earnings reports from Oracle and RIM boosted Asian technology stocks and pushed US equity futures to the top of their recent range.Unfortunately for the bulls, the re-emergence of eurozone sovereign debt woes and a weak survey of US consumer confidence has severely crimped this optimism.The credit default swaps of Ireland jumped 46 basis points to a record level of 433bp, after the Irish Independent newspaper highlighted a Barclays report which said Dublin may have to eventually call in the IMF, such was the precarious state of the government’s finances.Irish 10-year bond yields are up 25 basis points to 6.16 per cent, despite talk that the ECB has stepped in to buy and after the IMF said it did not foresee Dublin requiring its financial assistance.This caused a more reticent opening on Wall Street than had looked to be the case earlier in the day.Nevertheless, the S&P 500 still made an attempt to breach the 1,131 level that has proved such a barrier over the summer. But it failed, and then fell back further once news hit the wires that the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey had hit its lowest level since August 2009, reviving fears about the fragility of the US economic recovery.☼ Looking ahead. China’s financial markets will be closed from September 22 to September 24 for a national holiday. The developing volume problem – witness the flat-as-a-pancake market on Friday – will not get any better. ☼● Europe. Bourses gave up an early broad advance and moved into the red as the eurozone fiscal concerns took hold.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is down 0.2 per cent and FTSE 100 fell 0.6 per cent to 5508, having earlier breached 5,600 – its best level since April – as the heavyweight banks turn gains into losses on worries about exposure to sovereign debt.● Asia-Pacific. The FTSE Asia-Pacific Index climbed 1.1 per cent, advancing for a third week, although the region has seen differing fortunes for two of its most influential exchanges.Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.2 per cent, taking its gains this week to 4.2 per cent, the best weekly advance this year, after the government’s intervention to stem yen strength boosted exporters. Japanese markets will be closed on Monday for a holiday.In contrast, China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.2 per cent, for a 2.4 per cent decline on the week. Investors have been spooked by murmurs the People’s Bank of China is getting tougher with banks, in order to crimp speculative lending and after the central bank warned that problems in the financial sector were “hard to ignore”.South Korea’s tech-rich Kospi has added 0.9 per cent in response to the US earnings news. In Thailand, the country’s top three telecoms operators plummeted after a state-owned company filed a petition asking the country’s administrative court to halt the upcoming 3G auction, leaving the Thai SET index to buck the regional trend and close down 0.2 per cent.● Forex. The yen is stable following Wednesday’s intervention. The Japanese unit was flat versus the dollar at Y85.80, as traders do not seem prepared, so far, to test the Japanese Ministry of Finance’s resolve.The euro was initially benefiting from the better mood emanating from Asia but the Irish issue has caused a swift reversal and the single currency is now down 0.2 per cent at $1.3047.This has caused a change in fortune for the US dollar index, which tracks the buck against a basket of its peers. The DXY is up 0.2 per cent to 81.39, pulling away from a near 6-week low.● Rates. US benchmark yields were initially up another two basis points at 2.78 per cent, but haven seekers then moved in and yields are now down 2bp at 2.74 per cent. News that core US prices were unchanged in August is adding to the buying.Ten-year Bund yields also reversed direction and were down 6bp to 2.42 per cent as funds switched out of riskier plays such as Portugal, up 13bp to 6.16 per cent.● Commodities. Gold and silver are the focus, as the two metals continue to hit and challenge record nominal highs respectively. The yellow metal ended flat at $1,275 an ounce, having early in the session hit $1,282.8 for the first time. Silver was sporting a bid of $20.72, close to the March 2008 record high of $21.24.Industrial commodities are holding on to gains as risk appetite fades elsewhere. Copper was up 0.8 per cent to $3.52 a pound in Nymex trading, having earlier in London hit its best level since the end of April. Oil was down 1.5 per cent at $73.57 a barrel.Follow the market comments of Jamie Chisholm and Telis Demos on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm and @telisdemos
512;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-17T21:08:22Z;Wall Street rally runs out of steam;;Better-than-expected earnings from technology companies Research in Motion and Oracle failed to push the US stock market indices out of their summer trading range.The S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,125.65 by the close on Friday and up 1.5 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 10,607.93, rising 1.4 per cent over the five days, but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at 2,315.61, rising 3.2 per cent over the week.The S&P 500 briefly pierced the key resistance level of 1,130 on Friday but quickly fell back.In September, the US consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell to its weakest level in more than a year, while in August, the consumer price index showed inflation pressures were muted.“I think a lot of people saw this week [as] full of data and thought it looked pretty market-moving, with critical levels to break,” said Dan Cook, senior markets analyst at IG Markets, “but we’re still at those levels and its been like watching paint dry.”He added that this week’s economic data have been mixed but there has not been much of a reaction, even to the most negative releases – possibly because people wanted to stay in the market just in case the Federal Reserve announced fresh quantitative easing at its meeting next week.The S&P 500 information technology index, which has been the biggest riser so far this month, climbed further. The sector was up 0.5 per cent after earnings, reported after the closing bell on Thursday, pointed to a recovery in corporate spending on information technology.Oracle climbed 8.4 per cent to $27.48 after the software maker reported better-than-expected quarterly profit. The company said sales in the current quarter would be at least $8.4bn, above analysts’ estimates.Research in Motion, the BlackBerry maker, rose 0.5 per cent to $46.72 after it beat expectations on both quarterly sales and profit.Shares in Research in Motion have fallen 31.4 per cent so far this year on the back of concerns that the BlackBerry handset could be squeezed out by the rise of Apple’s iPhone and potential bans in countries from Abu Dhabi to India.Also in technology, Texas Instruments boosted its quarterly dividend and said it would repurchase $7.5bn of its stock in another round of buy-backs.

514;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-16T23:33:34Z;Oracle earnings soothe fears for tech sector;;Oracle eased anxieties in the technology sector with forecast-beating first-quarter earnings as its software business grew strongly in all regions and its hardware arm grew faster than expected.Intel had caused jitters three weeks ago with its warning of a revenue shortfall of about $500m in third-quarter sales as weaker-than-expected demand for consumer computers suggested a stalling recovery.Oracle, in contrast, reported strong sales of its database, storage and server products to its business customers.“Customers are buying from us and are buying more,” said Safra Catz, co-president, referring to Oracle’s growing market share and larger deals in the quarter.In the three months to the end of August, Oracle reported sales of $7.59bn, up 50 per cent on a year earlier and ahead of an analyst consensus of $7.32bn. Earnings of 42 cents a share were up 38 per cent and beat the Wall Street forecast of 37 cents.Oracle shares rose 4 per cent in extended trading in New York to $26.40.Mark Hurd took part in the earnings presentation, despite HP filing a lawsuit this month to try to block its former chief executive from taking up his new role as co-president at Oracle.Mr Hurd, who resigned last month over code of conduct breaches at HP, said he had joined Oracle because of its “clear growth opportunities” and the “sheer size” of its research and development investments, totalling more than $4bn this year.“I don’t believe there is any other company in the industry better positioned than Oracle,” he said.Larry Ellison, chief executive, said that Oracle would beat its rival SAP to market with “in-memory database” technology, which he had described as “whacko, ridiculous, complete nonsense” when SAP acquired Sybase for $5.8bn in May.“I never said we didn’t believe in in-memory database,” he said on Thursday. “I said I thought it was peculiar that SAP would choose to compete with us in the arena of database technology.”Mr Ellison said Oracle had also achieved its aim of profitability at Sun Microsystems, which it acquired in January for $7.3bn. “We think we can double the size of [Sun’s server] hardware business and we think we have to go out and aggressively take share from IBM and our other hardware competitors,” he said.●Shares in Texas Instruments rose more than 3 per cent in extended trading after its board approved a $7.5bn share buy-back and a 1 cent rise in its quarterly cash dividend to 13 cents. The chipmaker has reduced the number of its shares by 31 per cent over the past six years through repurchases.

In September, the reading was minus 0.7, showing industrial activity in the region contracted.The markets were unnerved in August when the index fell to minus 7.7. Shares fell after the September release, but quickly rebounded.“I would have thought there would be a little bit more of a negative reaction … with the negative Philly Fed plus FedEx which lowered its fiscal second-quarter outlook,” said Barbara Marcin, portfolio manager at GAMCO Investors.“But there’s now a lot of negativity baked in so in a way it doesn’t surprise even if something is more negative than consensus.”In separate releases, producer prices rose slightly more than expected and the current account deficit, a measure of international trade, was slightly less than economists had forecast.Investors looking for indicators of the pace of economic growth were disappointed by FedEx earnings, even though its quarterly profit doubled because of increased demand for package delivery services.Shares in FedEx sank 3.8 per cent to $82.72 after the first-quarter profit of $1.20 per share just missed the average estimate of $1.21 per share, and the group, often seen as a bellwether for global trade, said that it would cut 1,700 jobs.It forecast a second-quarter profit below analyst projections, but raised its forecast for 2011 for the second time.

516;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-14T23:23:27Z;Upbeat Cisco plans pay-out for next year;;Cisco Systems will be among the minority of technology companies paying a dividend to investors next year, joining Microsoft and Oracle in sharing some of its cash stockpile.The leading maker of networking gear said it would pay its first dividend, of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent, by the end of its fiscal year in July.The amount to be paid out would depend on a couple of tax issues, John Chambers, chief executive, said on Tuesday. First, is the tax rate on dividends, which could be changed by Congress. Second, is the rate payable on cash repatriated by companies from overseas. Cisco holds about $30bn of its $40bn in cash overseas, and Mr Chambers said he would bring all of that back to the US if Congress agreed to a tax rate of less than 10 per cent on the funds movement.“We’re coming to a ‘Y’ in the road,” Mr Chambers said. “I’m going to spend the money overseas if we can’t spend it here.”Microsoft also holds most of its $37bn of cash overseas, leaving it less financial flexibility to maintain its current pace of share buy-backs and dividend payments, according to Heather Bellini, an analyst at International Strategy and Investment Group.Mr Chambers said Cisco would commit to increased US hiring if it helped speed legislation to ease the repatriation of overseas funds which, he said, would help a national economy that he described as “bumpy”. European and Asian markets were performing better than expected, he said.Cisco executives stuck to projections of average yearly revenue growth of between 12 per cent and 17 per cent – well ahead of the past few years’ results – for the next three to five years.They said the company’s strong suit in networking switches and routers would produce a smaller share of Cisco sales with the company making significant headway in the market for servers for use in corporate data centres, where it is taking on incumbents IBM and Hewlett-Packard. HP, meanwhile, is competing more directly with Cisco by selling its own switches.Mr Chambers emphasised Cisco’s strengths in not paying more than a 30 per cent premium for acquisitions and integrating target companies’ product lines and employees, a thinly veiled criticism of HP.HP has agreed to pay more than $1bn for two companies – network security concern ArcSight and high-end storage maker 3Par – in as many weeks. Both came with pricetags of more than 50 per cent over pre-takeover stock levels.Mr Chambers said morale was high at Cisco as was investment in research and development, implicitly contrasting his company with criticisms by HP staffers of their own employer.HP’s buying spree accelerated after the forced departure of Mark Hurd, the former chief executive, who has joined database and server maker Oracle.Mr Chambers said he was seeking new ways to ally with Oracle, observing that Mr Hurd’s move and Oracle’s increased plays in hardware made it a significant rival to HP, while its database business competes with IBM.
517;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-13T21:40:25Z;Beware the superstar chief executive;Past successes can point to the right leader;The fascination of the Mark Hurd drama is that it contains all kinds of mysteries. A month after he was pushed out of Hewlett-Packard, we still don’t really know why. Was it because he fudged his expenses? Was it because there were questions about an inappropriate relationship with a female contractor? Or was the company looking for a reason to dump a chief executive whose advocates on Wall Street were far outnumbered by HP’s demoralised employees? After five years of violent cost-cutting, had he outlived his purpose?And then there is Larry Ellison’s decision to hire him as co-president of Oracle. Is it because he genuinely believes in his friend’s executive gifts and is lining him up as a successor? Or is it simply another example of Ellisonian trouble-making? Is he using the whole affair to stick one in the eye of a rival? It certainly seems as if he has HP dancing to his tune, filing a lawsuit to block the hiring of its former chief and looking Big Brother-ish in the process.What we do know, however, is that in hiring Mr Hurd, Mr Ellison has hired a very particular form of CEO, who, aside from his intimate knowledge of a rival, may be entirely the wrong man for Oracle.It comes down to the nature of Mr Hurd’s skills and record as a manager. At the two organisations where he has served as CEO, HP and NCR, he has been a cost-cutter. He arrived at flabby organisations that he was able to slash down to size. It is not work for the squeamish, and Mr Hurd proved himself a ruthless sacker, salary cutter and benefit trimmer. Margins improved, shares rose and Wall Street cheered.At Oracle, he arrives at a company already in rude financial health. His main challenge, assuming HP’s lawsuit fails, is said to be completing the integration of Sun Microsystems into Oracle and building the overall company’s strength in hardware so it can fight head-on with HP. It is a growth and expansion challenge that is very different from any Mr Hurd has faced in the past.Boris Groysberg, a professor at Harvard Business School, has written extensively on the distinction between cost-cutting and growth-minded CEOs, and the risk of hiring a “superstar” at one to do the other. In an article in 2006, co-written with Nitin Nohria and Andrew Maclean, he wrote: “The strategic skills required to control costs in the face of fierce price competition are not the same as those required to improve the top line in a rapidly growing business or balance investment against cash flow to survive in a highly cyclical business.”They studied the CVs of managers in different divisions of General Electric and categorised them as “cost controllers”, “growers” or “cycle managers” on the basis of their experience. They then followed 20 of them into new jobs. They found that when the managers were hired to do what they had done before, cost controller job to cost controller job, for example, the companies they ran saw annualised abnormal returns of 14.1 per cent. When they were hired to do something else, say grower to cost-controller, the returns were negative 39.8 per cent.A prime example was Paolo Fresco, a great success leading GE’s growth in Europe, who proved disastrous at Fiat when he took over as chairman in 1998. As a grower, at Fiat he focused on investments and acquisitions while the company’s liquidity problems piled up, leading to his eventual resignation in 2003.By contrast, Carlos Ghosn, a non-GE manager, moved successfully from Michelin to Nissan because both jobs required cutting costs and streamlining the organisation. Hence, his nickname at Renault, Nissan’s partner – “le cost killer”.The great rarity is the CEO who can cut costs and expand the business. Steve Jobs achieved it at Apple after he returned in 1997, stripping down a bloated company on the point of bankruptcy and then patiently rebuilding its entire product line and organisation.Mr Groysberg’s other key insight emerged from studying star Wall Street analysts. In his book Chasing Stars: The Myth of Talent and the Portability of Performance, he wrote that star analysts at one business struggled when they were hired away to work at another. What recruiters and the stars themselves underestimate is the importance of the support networks that make them successful in the first place, the colleagues and contacts who enable their work. Unless they can be transplanted too, the superstar will often fade in a new setting.If, once the hullabaloo of his firing fades, Mr Hurd can succeed in the very different setting at Oracle, he will have joined an extremely small executive super-group.philip@philipdelvesbroughton.com
518;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;America's Cup changes the rules for 2013;;The America’s Cup, the sailing competition that boasts the oldest trophy still contested in international sport, will be raced in revolutionary wing-sail catamarans at the next edition in 2013, under new rules unveiled on Monday.BMW Oracle, the racing team of US software tycoon Larry Ellison, announced the changes in Valencia, Spain, seven months after winning the cup in a giant wing-sailed trimaran by beating the Alinghi catamaran of Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli.The two men became embroiled in bitter legal disputes over details of the racing and the vessels used, in effect excluding sailors from other teams and discouraging commercial sponsors that had been heavily involved in previous cup regattas. Each team was believed to have spent more than $100m on the 2010 cup.BMW Oracle, although it is likely to enjoy the advantage of its previous investment in wing-sail technology, said on Monday it wanted to reduce costs and provide for a level playing field to encourage multiple entrants.Asked why multihulls had been chosen, Russell Coutts, chief executive of BMW Oracle Racing, cited “the coolness factor”. He said: “They just look cool …It’s an exciting boat for young sailors to look at and say, ‘Wow, that’s a boat I would want to race in the future’.”Most previous editions of the America’s Cup have been raced in monohulls. Multihulls – catamarans have two hulls and trimarans three – are generally much faster because they skim across the top of the sea rather than plough through it. Because they have no deep keels and therefore draw little water, they can also be raced close to the shore, adding to the excitement of spectators.Wing-sails, which are similar to aircraft wings placed vertically, are also more aerodynamically efficient than sails made of flexible material, although they have barely been tried on sailing boats.“Our research indicates more teams in a multihull format than a monohull format, more new teams in the game” Mr Coutts said. “The new format, in the opinion of many of these new teams, actually opens the game right up.”The hulls and sails of the new boats, initially a 45-foot version for racing from next year and then a 72-foot model for the Cup itself, will be built within tight parameters to try to ensure that the best sailors, rather than those with the most money, win races.The boats will be easy to dismantle so they can be transported from venue to venue, including by cargo aircraft, for the three years of regattas preceding the Cup competition itself.“We believe this new format and new boat will put the America’s Cup back at the pinnacle of our sport,” Mr Coutts said in Valencia. “These changes will give equal opportunity to competitors and long-term economic stability to all teams and all commercial partners. We promised fairness and innovation and this is what we’ve delivered.”To cut costs, crew numbers for each boat will be reduced to 11 from 17 and there will be limits on the number of boats and amount of equipment a team can use. No venue has yet been announced for the Cup itself in 2013, but San Francisco is a possibility.
519;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-12T18:48:09Z;Hapless Packard;Companies cannot expect lifelong loyalty from ex-CEOs;The upper echelons of the computer industry are not the obvious setting for a soap opera. That is what makes Mark Hurd’s exit from Hewlett-Packard so extraordinarily compelling. It does not, however, make this saga a guide worth following in terms of either corporate practice or attitudes to executive mobility.Mr Hurd left HP last month after admitting there had been times when he had failed to live up to standards and principles of trust, respect and integrity. After five years as chief executive, in which he had revived the fortunes of the world’s largest computer group, he was forced out by claims of mishandled expenses– albeit with a severance package said to be worth up to $40m. Within the past week, his appointment to a senior role at software maker Oracle has had HP reaching for its lawyers in an effort to block the move.HP’s legal foray looks like an uphill struggle, given Californian courts’ record of hostility towards “non-compete” conditions. That leaves the technology giant relying on the argument that to do his new job properly, Mr Hurd would inevitably divulge HP trade secrets. This lawsuit – which much legal opinion regards as likely to fail – is not even much of a warning shot for Mr Hurd and his new colleagues. On the contrary, it advertises the helplessness of his former employer now that HP can no longer command his loyalty.For Mr Hurd owes no continuing duty towards HP and its shareholders beyond whatever conditions were part of his contract. It is not Mr Hurd’s responsibility if HP cannot react as it might like to his behaviour, either in finding breaches of his original agreement with the group or in imposing conditions on his departure.There are two broad points here. First, freedom to move between jobs in the same sector benefits the economy in general. It would be a waste to insist that, once contractual obligations had been fulfilled, executives could not make the most of experience gained at one company to bring fresh ideas and expertise to add value at another.Second, companies should not work on the basis that former employees will behave with misty-eyed indulgence towards the group that has dispensed with their services. These are business relationships of finite duration, not lifelong commitments. Corporations are better off setting employment terms accordingly than expecting former staff to be carrying torches, especially if the parting has had its acrimonious moments. HP should move on– as Mr Hurd has done.
520;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
521;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-08T17:52:17Z;Hurd set for $11m pay deal at Oracle;;Mark Hurd could make nearly $11m a year in his new position at Oracle, putting him back among the tech industry’s highest-paid executives following his forced resignation as head of Hewlett-Packard last month.News of the pay deal came in the wake of a legal challenge from HP that was seen by some legal analysts as an attempt to recover some of the millions that the computer maker paid out to its former chief in a severance package.HP’s board has faced criticism over its agreement to pay Mr Hurd a severance package valued at $35m-$40m, with the final value dependent on HP’s future stock price.Mr Hurd was forced out after an HP investigation found he had falsified expenses linked to what it called an “inappropriate relationship” with former HP contractor Jodie Fisher.On Tuesday, HP sued Mr Hurd in state court in California, claiming he would inevitably divulge HP’s trade secrets and a confidential agreement with the company if he takes up his new role at Oracle.But legal experts said HP was unlikely to prevail, given the usual resistance of Californian courts to such claims.Oracle will pay Mr Hurd an annual salary of $950,000, and has made him eligible for a bonus of up to $10m in 2011, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday.Mr Hurd’s target bonus for next year is $5m, but he will receive the higher amount if he exceeds certain performance targets.The legal spat over Mr Hurd’s appointment has threatened to upset a close partnership between the tech companies which has already shown signs of fraying as they become more direct competitors. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, called the HP suit “vindictive” and accused it of making it “virtually impossible” for the two companies to co-operate.HP said it had no quarrel with Oracle itself, having sued Mr Hurd. “Oracle is an important partner, and HP will continue to work with them to deliver the solutions that our customers need,” the company said in a statement yesterday.Many customers run Oracle databases on top of high-capacity HP computers, and Mr Ellison’s blunt statements hit investor sentiment.HP shares fell as much as 3 per cent in midday trading. But even if Oracle does stop co-operating with HP, many technology consultancies will continue to bundle their products together, said analyst Dana Garder of Interarbor Solutions.Oracle considers IBM its top database competitor, yet many Oracle databases run on IBM machinery.Oracle had already moved into direct competition with HP through its acquisition this year of Sun Microsystems, and it highlighted its aim of selling integrated systems combining both hardware and software when it hired Mr Hurd.
522;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-08T17:40:14Z;Plot of Hurd soap opera reveals ugly cracks in IT sector;Legal spat highlights a deeper fracture;The Mark Hurd soap opera is turning into more than just a diverting tale of a chief executive’s foibles and a board’s willingness to countenance a severe dent in the share price to protect its company’s ethical values.A month on, the forced resignation of Hewlett-Packard’s former chief has taken a fresh twist. It is one that speaks volumes about the new battle lines that are being drawn up across the IT landscape.At the start of this week, Oracle, the biggest maker of the software used in large corporate IT systems, hired Mr Hurd for a senior role at the company. Less than 24 hours later, Hewlett-Packard – itself the biggest maker of computer hardware – sued to block the move.Given that close alliances between companies like these have been the foundation on which the modern IT industry has been built, the row highlights a deeper fracture. A nasty jibe from Oracle boss Larry Ellison, comparing HP’s directors to the “the idiots on the Apple board” who once fired its co-founder Steve Jobs, has rubbed salt into the wound.Oracle is impatient to carve out new chunks of the tech market for itself. Along with Cisco Systems, it has moved into the server and storage business against IBM and HP. Defensively, HP is branching out into networking equipment and has been looking to beef up its software.Mr Hurd’s arrival at Oracle is a clear sign that companies like these believe the greatest potential for future profitability lies in selling a wider package of software, hardware and services – a fact that Oracle has been only too eager to trumpet this week. HP’s defensive legal manoeuvre shows that it recognises the threat.It is not immediately obvious why anyone would want to get into computer hardware like this. According to tech research firm IDC, worldwide server sales will creep up to $52.2bn by 2013 – but even then, the market will still be nearly 10 per cent smaller than it was in the pre-crash year of 2008.The forces of technological progress all seem to be arrayed against companies in the hardware business. From the inexorable march of Moore’s Law, which guarantees that computing power will cost less each year, to the spread of virtualisation, which makes it possible to process the same work on fewer machines, most of the value seems to accrue to the tech industry’s customers, not its suppliers. Behind the pursuit of integration, however, lie two valid objectives.One is to protect the profit margins of a company’s core business. With competition spreading, these are about to come under attack as never before.The IT industry’s traditional way of defending margins has been to lock its customers in with proprietary technologies. But that game ended after the tech bust a decade ago, when the balance of power swung back towards the customer. Since then, the spread of open standards has made it easier to shop around for products.Selling integrated bundles of technology is one response to this. Even if the technology tie-in is weak, the single sales and support channel helps. Having all the weapons in the IT arsenal at their disposal also gives suppliers more options in pricing their products.The second purpose of vertical integration is to compensate for slowing growth in core markets by moving into new fields. In the jargon of the business, it’s all about winning a larger “share of wallet” from customers.The twin pursuits of market share and margin protection are not always compatible objectives – one reason why Wall Street feels in two minds about some of the diversification. But even if margins are shaved, the increase in overall profit dollars should compensate.The victims in this process are likely to be those companies that can’t protect their flanks from the all-out attack of expansion-minded rivals. That helps to explain the extravagant bidding war over storage company 3Par that ended last week in a victory for HP.The loser, Dell, may have been spared from over-paying, but at the cost of seeing its strategic options narrow.Short of outright acquisition, tech companies are quickly coming to rely on fewer but closer alliances. EMC, the largest maker of storage equipment, recently tried to make up for its lack of breadth through a joint venture with Cisco. As the loose partnerships on which the industry used to rely harden into competing blocs, old friendships will get jettisoned – a fact of which Mr Ellison seems only too well aware.The Oracle chief accused HP earlier this week of “making it virtually impossible” for the two companies “to continue to co-operate and work together in the IT marketplace”. Given his own recent actions, it’s hard to believe that this wasn’t the conclusion he had in mind all along.
523;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;HP sues to block Hurd’s move to Oracle;;Hewlett-Packard has sued to block Mark Hurd, its former chief executive, from taking up a senior role at Oracle, adding a twist to a saga that has transfixed Silicon Valley.The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in a California court, came a day after Mr Hurd became a co-president at Oracle, giving him a key role as the software maker competes with HP in computer hardware. The suit seeks an injunction preventing Mr Hurd taking up the role.Oracle agreed to pay Mr Hurd an annual salary of $950,000, making him eligible for a bonus of up to $10m in 2011. According to a regulatory filing, Mr Hurd’s target bonus next year is $5m.The appointment marked a quick return for one of the industry’s most highly regarded executives. He was forced out by HP’s board in August after being found to have breached its code of conduct by mis-stating expenses linked to a relationship with a former HP marketing consultant.HP said it had gone to court to protect important information. “In his new position, Hurd will be in a situation in which he cannot perform his duties for Oracle without necessarily using and disclosing HP’s trade secrets and confidential information to others,” the suit said.Mr Hurd’s severance deal did not have a non-compete clause, said a person familiar with the issue. But he had signed agreements with HP preventing him disclosing trade secrets, the lawsuit says.Lawyers predicted HP would struggle to prevail since California courts have been unwilling to bar executives from switching employers in cases involving “inevitable disclosure”.“California does not enforce non-competes and it does not allow you to shoehorn anything else into a non-compete,” said Stephen Kramarsky, a partner in Dewey Pegno & Kramarsky.HP has asked the court to block Mr Hurd from “holding a position with a competitor in which he will serve in a capacity that will make it impossible for him to avoid utilizing or disclosing HP’s trade secrets and confidential information”.Oracle reacted angrily to the suit. “Oracle has long viewed HP as an important partner,” said Larry Ellison, chief executive. “By filing this vindictive lawsuit . . . the HP board is acting with utter disregard for that partnership.”
524;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;HP challenges Hurd’s new role;;Hewlett-Packard may be fighting a rearguard action to stop its former chief executive, Mark Hurd, from taking up a position with rival Oracle, but it has conspicuously failed to dent Wall Street’s enthusiasm for the move.Shares in the maker of database software jumped by nearly 6 per cent on Tuesday on hopes that Mr Hurd will bring a sharp new operational discipline to the company. The latest evidence of investor confidence in Mr Hurd’s management abilities echoes the 8 per cent fall in HP’s shares the day after he was forced to resign.Wall Street analysts also predicted that Mr Hurd’s arrival would see Oracle push more aggressively into the computer hardware business against some of the industry’s biggest names – including HP.The stock market vote of confidence in Mr Hurd’s abilities came despite an HP lawsuit designed to prevent him from taking a position that the company claimed would lead inevitably to him divulging confidential information.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, has done little to disguise his reasons for bringing Mr Hurd on board. Oracle’s future, he said in a statement, lay in “engineering complete and integrated hardware and software systems”.Mr Hurd will bring much-needed experience of selling integrated products such as these, as Oracle moves beyond its traditional software base, and his arrival could well increase the chances the company will mount further hardware acquisitions to make it a stronger competitor to HP and IBM, said Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS.In a statement released by Oracle this week, Mr Hurd was quoted as saying that the company’s new integrated approach to IT systems would enable it to “beat IBM in both enterprise servers and storage”.The conspicuous reference to only one large competitor was highlighted by HP in its lawsuit, which claimed that Mr Hurd and Oracle were trying to distract attention from the fact that he would be turning his internal knowledge about HP against his previous employer.Mr Hurd’s move from the top of the world’s biggest computer maker to a lesser role at Oracle raised questions in some quarters about whether his friendship with Mr Ellison could turn into a successful working partnership.“He’s run a company four times larger than Oracle, so the obvious question is, will he become frustrated?” said Mr Thill. He added, however, that the Oracle had succeeded in the past at dividing up the company’s operations in a way that left a group of senior executives with their own defined areas of responsibility.Making room for Mr Hurd, Oracle said that Charles Phillips, its co- president in charge of sales and marketing, had resigned. Mr Ellison said that Mr Phillips had first approached him about leaving the company last December.

The better-than-expected headline figures on manufacturing and unemployment sparked a four-session rally, but details in the reports created concerns about the pace of the economic recovery.The S&P 500 financial sector slid 2.4 per cent on the back of worries about European banks. Bank of America fell 2.2 per cent to $13.21, Citigroup was lower by 2.1 per cent to $3.83 and JPMorgan Chase lost 2.3 per cent to $38.28. Credit card company American Express slid 4.1 per cent to $40.09.Bank shares also suffered after the Basel Committee said that Germany’s 10 biggest banks may need $141bn of additional capital under its new banking rules, prompting US-listed shares of Deutsche Bank to fall 3.2 per cent to $62.52.Shares in energy companies followed the oil price down, ExxonMobil fell 1.3 per cent to $60.55 and Anadarko Petroleum Corp lost 3.4 per cent to $50.27.Industrial stocks also fell on the back of concerns about the European recovery – with Textron down 3.5 per cent to $18.24 and Honeywell lower by 2.1 per cent at $41.93.Steel companies rose. US Steel was up 4.6 per cent to $48.09 and AK Steel advanced 1.3 per cent to $13.92. But the S&P 500 materials index was dragged lower by Dow Chemicals, which fell 3.7 per cent to $25.49, and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold which was lower by 0.9 per cent to $77.87.Oracle rose 5.9 per cent to $24.27 after the world’s third-largest software maker hired Mark Hurd, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. Mr Hurd, who left HP last month after the company said he violated the standards of business conduct, will become a president and member of the Oracle board. Hewlett-Packard sued Mr Hurd, saying his appointment at Oracle puts HP’s confidential information “in peril”. HP shares fell 1 per cent to $39.92.In deal news, Casey’s General Stores advised shareholders to reject a new takeover offer from Alimentation Couche-Tard, saying that an unnamed third party had made a higher bid of $40 a share. The board had authorised discussions with the anonymous potential bidder but said the offer, which would price the convenience store chain at $2bn, still failed to reflect the stock’s value. Shares in Casey’s rose
9.9 per cent to $42.76 after it also reported its first-quarter results.Air Products and Chemicals fell 0.9 per cent to $77.38 after it lifted its offer for its rival Airgas by 3 per cent to $5.5bn, in the latest round of the hostile bid. Shares in Airgas also fell, down 1.4 per cent to $65.75.Res Care, the homecare provider, added 6 per cent to $13.20. An affiliate of Onex Corp, the Canadian private equity group, would acquire all the remaining shares of ResCare that Onex affiliates do not already own in a deal priced at $13.25 a share.Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling company in the process of combining with the soft drinks maker Coca-Cola, raised its full-year earnings forecast for the existing company to a range between $1.78 and $1.82 a share. Its shares rose 0.7 per cent to $29.56."
526;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Hurd named co-president of Oracle;;Mark Hurd is to become co-president of software maker Oracle only a month after being forced out as head of Hewlett-Packard over breaches of the computer makers’ code of conduct.The rapid return by one of the technology industry’s best-known executives reflects the strong support he has continued to receive in some corners of Silicon Valley, in spite of his falling-out with HP’s board after an investigation of sexual harrassment allegations levelled by a former HP marketing consultant and actress, Jodie Fisher.Oracle late on Monday named Mr Hurd as one of its two presidents and a board director, giving him a key supporting role to co-founder and chief executive Larry Ellison.Mr Ellison has been one of Mr Hurd’s strongest public supporters since the surprise move by HP in early August to force out its former chief executive over breaches of its conduct of business rules tied to misstatement of expenses and his “inappropriate” relationship with Ms Foster. The two executives are friends and play tennis together.The outspoken Oracle chief criticised the decision to push Mr Hurd out as “the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago” in an e-mail to The New York Times.HP should have kept Mr Hurd on since it had found no truth to Ms Foster’s sexual harassment allegations, Mr Ellison said, adding: “In losing Mark Hurd, the HP board failed to act in the best interest of HP’s employees, shareholders, customers and partners”.Oracle would not comment on Monday on whether its board had carried out its own review into the circumstances of Mr Hurd’s departure from HP.However, Mr Ellison’s quick display of public support and the speed of the appointment suggested it did not feel the need to dig deeper given he had been cleared of the most damaging sexual harassment charges. “Their loss is our gain,” said one person close to the software maker.Mr Hurd replaces Charles Phillips, a former Morgan Stanley analyst who left the company on Monday, Oracle said. In a statement, Mr Ellison said that Mr Phillips had approached him about leaving the company last December, but had agreed to stay on for a transitional period following its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.As co-president, Mr Hurd will take over an expanded role that includes both Mr Phillips’ responsibility for sales and marketing as well as putting him in charge of the company’s 20,000-strong support organisation.Safra Catz, Oracle’s other president, will continue to oversee operations and finance, with Mr Ellison taking charge of the company’s engineering.
527;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-09-05T21:05:04Z;Oracle looks to give Hurd leading role;;Oracle’s board will meet within days to vote on a deal to bring Mark Hurd to the company in a top role, marking a rapid corporate rehabilitation for the ousted Hewlett-Packard chief executive.Mr Hurd is unlikely to win the title of chief executive, which has been held since 1977 by Larry Ellison, Oracle’s founder and chairman, who owns about a quarter of the database software giant. But almost any position would represent a coup for Mr Hurd after HP’s board forced him to quit the company he had led for five years.Mr Hurd was ousted from HP over questions about his handling of expenses following an allegation of sexual harassment of a female consultant. HP said that it had found no violation of its own sexual harassment policy but determined that expense reports filed by or for Mr Hurd were inappropriate.The impending hiring could rejuvenate Oracle’s efforts to compete head-on against HP, IBM and others in selling a variety of computing hardware. Early this year, Oracle completed its purchase of sophisticated computer maker Sun Microsystems for about $7bn after IBM and HP dropped out of the bidding process.“I don’t think you’ll see a profound change in strategy with the addition of Hurd, but I do think you’ll see a better ability to execute in the hardware business”, said Brendan Barnicle, Pacific Crest Securities analyst.That is more likely to involve further high-margin hardware acquisitions by Oracle than any move in computing services.Mr Hurd would bring deep knowledge of the hardware industry, where HP gets the lion’s share of its revenue. From a base in computers and printers, HP has been expanding through acquisitions into technology services, networking and, most recently, smartphones.Oracle has long been a force in the most sophisticated databases for storing and analysing corporate information. But the acquisition of Sun concerned some investors because Oracle lacks experience in selling computers and storage gear.Terms of the expected employment offer had yet to be finalised by Sunday, said a person familiar with the fast-moving developments. It was unclear whether Mr Hurd would outrank Oracle’s two co-presidents, former Wall Street analyst Charles Phillips and Safra Catz, a former investment banker who also served as Oracle’s chief financial officer until 2008.Mr Ellison is personally close to Mr Hurd and has supported him in public comments, calling his dismissal “the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago”.On Sunday, Mr Ellison, Oracle and a representative for Mr Hurd all declined to comment.Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco

speculation helped the FTSE 100 inch higher to its fifth consecutive gain.The water companies were in focus after Nomura Securities said the strong interest during EDF’s auction of its regulated electricity distribution unit suggested the failed bidders might be looking elsewhere.“We are likely to see M&A in the listed UK water space in the coming 12 months,” the broker said.“Debt financing for infrastructure deals is increasingly available, even if tighter covenants and higher spreads are being enforced.”The UK water sector’s low-risk cash flows make it an attractive alternative to government bonds, offering a post-tax return of 4.5 per cent against the 0.3 per cent offered by index-linked gilts, Nomura argued.United Utilities added 1 per cent to 587½p.The group, which has sold its non-regulated water business, was mooted before the credit crunch as a target for private equity and sovereign wealth funds.Applying the sector’s average takeover premium of 27 per cent to assets, United Utilities would be worth 800p, Nomura said.The broker was positive on Severn Trent, up 1 per cent to £13.31, and Pennon Group, up 0.9 per cent to 589½p.Buyers could afford to pay £19.50 and 770p respectively, it said.A choppy day left the FTSE 100 up less than 0.1 per cent, rising 4.63 points to 5,371.04.Profit-taking among the commodity producers limited the gain.Antofagasta fell 1.1 per cent to £10.82 after Citigroup cut the copper miner from its “buy” list on valuation grounds.Citi moved to “hold” on Lonmin, off 1.9 per cent to £15.77, and to “sell” on Hochschild Mining, down 2.5 per cent to 362½p.Man Group was the top Footsie gainer, rising 5.8 per cent to 362½p after shareholders approved its acquisition of GLG.Numis Securities upgraded Man to “buy” following a 6.2 per cent gain in August for its benchmark fund, AHL.“If the company is able to continue this strong performance, moving the fund closer to its high water mark, then flows are likely to improve faster than expected,” the broker said.Wolseley was 1.5 per cent higher at £13.57 after JPMorgan Cazenove upgraded to “neutral”, albeit on earnings forecasts sharply below consensus.Continued talk of technology sector consolidation helped boost Autonomyby 5.2 per cent to £17.16.The software maker has been marked as a potential target for companies including Microsoft, SAP and Oracle, though analysts questioned whether a trade buyer could match management’s valuation of the company.They noted that Autonomy’s chief financial officer bought stock last month, suggesting there was nothing to disclose.BAE Systems bounced 3.7 per cent to 313¼p following news late on Wednesday that its land division had won a £400m contract with the US military to upgrade mine-resistant vehicles.A “buy” note from Investec Securities helped BAE, with the broker arguing that pessimism about defence budget cuts had gone too far.A valuation of 6.8 times next year’s earnings looked extreme given about half of BAE’s sales came from long-term support contracts and nearly a third were to growth export markets such as Saudi Arabia and Australia, it said.Having been lifted last week by takeover speculation, Arm Holdings lost 3.8 per cent to 360p after Panmure Gordon downgraded it to “sell”.Last week’s sales warning from Intel pointed to softening demand from consumer electronics manufacturers, leaving 2011 forecasts looking too high, it said.“We believe the potential for a bid for Arm is extremely low given both strategic and valuation considerations,” analyst Nick James said.Debt-laden directories publisher Yell Group, down 70 per cent since April, moved higher by 13.2 per cent to 17¾p.Vague theories of a bid or sale of an overseas division helped spur short covering.Blinkx, the video search engine spun out of Autonomy, put on 10.8 per cent to 87¼p on bid speculation.Analysts said the rumours – Microsoft and Google were mentioned as possible predators – were unsurprising given Blinkx’s position in the growing market for online video advertising.They believe a trading statement, expected this month, would show further strong traffic growth.Churchill Mining added 9.8 per cent to 106½p on speculation that India power producer NTPC might make an investment in its East Kutai Coal Project in Indonesia.Last month, NTPC said it was in talks to buy stakes in two Indonesian coal

529;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-08-30T21:01:30Z;Dodd-Frank act presents companies with a PR minefield;;"Is a chief executive’s job 19 times more valuable than that of the US president and hundreds of times more valuable than the average worker in his or her company?Such comparisons might seem invidious to high earners such as Larry Ellison of Oracle, who made $85m last year – according to Equilar, an executive pay research firm – or Ray Irani of Occidental Petroleum Corp, whose $31m pay last year triggered shareholder unrest.But company chiefs are set to face a fresh wave of unflattering publicity over the many multiples of their average employee’s take-home pay that they deem themselves to be worth.A little-noticed provision in the mammoth Dodd-Frank financial reform act will force companies to disclose regularly the ratio of the median annual pay of all their employees to that of their chief executive.The measure raises potential public relations problems for some of the US’s biggest companies, as well as significant administrative burdens. The published ratios will vary significantly but some may look alarmingly unfair to the eyes of the average small shareholder.The $1,025,000 median salary of an S&P500 chief executive last year, according to the Equilar analysis, is 25 times the $40,174 that official statistics show was paid to the average US private sector employee. The chief executive’s $7.5m median total pay package, including bonuses and stock options, is 187 times that average private sector pay and some 19 times President Barack Obama’s basic $400,000 salary.The value or otherwise of such comparators in assessing boardroom remuneration has long been argued. Business fears the new disclosure requirement will simply add confusion to an already-emotive debate.The provision was inserted into the Dodd-Frank bill “at the last minute, with no discussion and not based on any particular problem”, says Charles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware. He categorised the pay ratio as a “thrill disclosure” that would generate headlines without offering meaningful comparisons.“This is a political disclosure, as opposed to an economic disclosure, and that’s the problem,” Prof Elson adds.Lawyers caution that the formula mandated by the act has some seemingly perverse consequences, in terms of factors that will produce a low ratio – an apparent but potentially misleading sign of a company without excessive executive remuneration.“It will favour companies that outsource and use independent contractors, and those that use
franchised rather than company-owned stores, since these relatively low paid jobs will not count towards the median tally,” says Richard Susko, a partner at law firm Cleary Gottlieb.Many of the crucial factors affecting the ratio have been left to the discretion
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has to draw up the regulations to implement the new rule. The act does not specify whether non-US employees need to be included in the total, the treatment of subsidiaries and affiliates, the date on which the pay needs to be calculated each year or the exchange rates to be used.Business groups say they want to work with the SEC to try to craft a “consistent and digestible” measure. “The big concern we have is that a lot of work and clarification needs to be done on this,” says Larry Burton, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of the biggest US companies.But whatever the SEC decides, the regulation is expected to create a potentially significant administrative burden. George Paulin, chairman and chief executive of the pay consultancy Frederick W Cook & Co, predicts that the “procedure will be so complex that you will have to hire someone whose sole job will be to manage the preparation of the CEO pay ratio”.Additional reporting by Francesco Guerrera"
530;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-08-13T17:36:26Z;Oracle’s threat to Google mobile push;;The legal war over software rights that Oracle launched against Google late on Thursday could hamper the internet company’s successful push into the smartphone market, industry analysts warned on Friday.Oracle’s aggressive move was also a “nuclear deterrent” that would spread much more widely across the mobile devices industry, with long-term implications for many handset makers and carriers, said Mark Driver, an analyst at Gartner.The lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco, accuses Google of patent and copyright infringement over the inclusion of parts of Oracle’s Java software in its Android smartphone operating system.Android, which Google makes available free of charge, has been taken up by handset makers including Motorola and HTC, and in the most recent quarter phones carrying the software overtook Apple’s iPhone in global sales.Oracle acquired rights to Java, a set of tools that make it easier for software developers to write applications that run on many different operating systems, as part of its purchase of Sun Microsystems earlier this year.The lawsuit shows that Oracle will seek to make more money from the rights to the widely used Java than Sun did, analysts said.“You’re definitely going to get a stronger licence enforcement policy – and rightly so, perhaps,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC.The lawsuit also serves as a warning to handset makers that are using Android and could tilt the balance in favour of other operating systems, including Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 software, which is due to be launched later this year, Mr Hilwa said.If Google is forced to pay Oracle for the use of its technology, it could lead it to charge for Android, also making the software less attractive to handset makers, he added.Many handset makers already have a licence that allows them to use Java. The prospect that Android would continue to grow fast raised the danger for Oracle that it would lose its power to charge a royalty on many new handsets, said Mr Driver.However, some experts also warned that Oracle’s lawsuit could backfire, encouraging companies to look for alternatives to the Java technology.At the time it bought Sun, Oracle executives said they would tread carefully in how they exercised their Java rights, since a heavy-handed approach could undermine the software’s standing as a de facto industry standard.Legal battles over patents are rare between the technology industry’s leading players. Most maintain large portfolios of rights and have enough mutual self-interest to agree broad cross-licensing deals that give companies access to each others’ patents.Oracle’s attack on Google highlights the internet company’s relatively weak patent portfolio, Mr Driver said.www.ft.com/google
531;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-08-13T00:41:08Z;Oracle sues Google over Android;;Oracle on Thursday filed a copyright and patent infringement claim against Google over its Android operating system, opening a legal war between the Silicon Valley giants over the fast-growing smartphone software platform.The lawsuit, filed in Federal court in San Francisco, accuses Google of breaching seven patents that Oracle assumed when it acquired Sun Microsystems earlier this year.The patents relate to the widely-used Java software, which Sun developed so that developers could write applications that could run on many different operating systems. Eric Schmidt, Google’s chief executive officer and a former chief technology officer at Sun, once headed the Java development team.In a statement, Oracle said that Google had “knowingly, directly and repeatedly infringed Oracle’s Java-related intellectual property.” Parts of the Java technology were included in the “stack”, or package of software that makes up Android, according to Oracle.Introduced on phones less than two years ago, Android has grown rapidly to become one of the most widely used smartphone operating systems. It plays a key role in Google’s efforts to ensure its foothold in the mobile world, guaranteeing a channel for its search and advertising services and providing a hedge in case it is ever barred from rival smartphones like the iPhone or BlackBerry.Android is based on a foundation of open-source software, which is freely distributed and can be used without needing to buy a licence. According to Oracle, however, some key elements of Java have also been added to the operating system.The lawsuit marks Oracle’s first attempt to exert its rights over Java since it acquired Sun in January. Larry Ellison, chief executive officer, justified the Sun acquisition largely on the grounds that it brought Oracle control of Java.Many mobile and other technology companies pay relatively small amounts to licence Java to run on large numbers of devices, and there were concerns in some quarters when Oracle bought Sun that it would seek to wring more money from its control of the software.
532;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-08-10T00:52:26Z;Friends like Larry;;Given the questions that have arisen over the extent of his ethical lapses – and the fact that he was cleared of the most most serious claim against him, involving sexual harassment – it’s not surprising that Mark Hurd’s supporters are starting to come forward.Oracle CEO Larry Ellison just unburdened himself of a typically outspoken reaction in an email to The New York Times. It includes this zinger:The H.P. board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago. That decision nearly destroyed Apple and would have if Steve hadn’t come back and saved them.How much longer before HP drops its stoical silence and is forced to mount a more detailed defence of its actions?
533;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-08-09T22:27:49Z;Hewlett-Packard;Board lets corporate history cloud judgment on CEO ouster;Hewlett-Packard’s board, suddenly presiding over a company worth $10bn less than it was before chief executive Mark Hurd’s resignation, is on safe ground. Its swift corporate defenestration was generally applauded by corporate governance experts while the company’s share price has already begun to claw back its losses.But the safe decision is not always the right one. Mr Hurd was, by most accounts, a superb executive. HP’s shares had outperformed the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ninefold since he took over in 2005 and net income grew handsomely. There is no evidence that Mr Hurd cut any ethical or legal corners while presiding over this success. Indeed, his transgressions appear minor enough to have warranted little more than a slap on the wrist at most American companies.But HP is not most companies. The prototypical Silicon Valley success story, its eponymous founders, who started it in a garage, are remembered for their ethics as much as their business acumen. That image came under threat with the tenure of flashy, divisive chief Carly Fiorina and a snooping scandal that ensnared HP’s board.Until Friday, Mr Hurd seemed like a made-to-order amalgam of traditional and modern corporate leadership. But this is not 1950s America, when chief executives were churchgoing boy scouts whose worst vice, as far as anyone knew, was a two-martini lunch. Technology giants Oracle and Apple are run by visionaries who are rightly forgiven for their colourful personal lives and even the occasional accounting lapse.

He was “delighted” by the response “and that so many have decided to not only take this pledge but also to commit to sums far greater than the 50 per cent minimum level”.Some of the signatories said they had already planned to give away the majority of their money before Mr Buffett and Mr Gates.“Many years ago, I put virtually all of my assets into a trust with the intent of giving away at least 95 per cent of my wealth to charitable causes,” wrote Larry Ellison, the Oracle co-founder, in one of many letters posted on the website.“Until now, I have done this giving quietly …So why am I going public now? Warren Buffett personally asked me to write this letter because he said I would be ‘setting an example’ and ‘influencing others’ to give. I hope he’s right.”Mr Rubenstein, who is about to turn 61, began devoting energy to philanthropic endeavours at the age of 54. He currently donates to a range of causes including in education, health, the arts and history.Almost as interesting as the list of those who signed the pledge was those who chose not to. While Mr Peterson, Blackstone’s co-founder, appeared on the list, his partner Steve Schwarzman does not. Both men made billions when Blackstone went public.The Giving Pledge does not accept money, but asks billionaires to make a moral commitment to give away their wealth to charity.

536;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;Outsider at the family table;;"This month, Kasper Rorsted will pack his running shoes and other essentials and fly to China. There is nothing too unusual for the chief executive of a big company to meet suppliers and customers in an important market – except that the head of Henkel will not return to Germany for five weeks.Such grand tours are a feature of Mr Rorsted’s stewardship of the consumer goods group, a stalwart of Germany’s blue-chip Dax share index and in its fifth generation of family control. Last year, the 48-year-old Dane spent six weeks on a similar US tour.“I went to all our major sites, I saw all our big customers and suppliers. I had 20 employee meetings, I was sitting in the cafeteria eating breakfast and lunch every day. So suddenly the CEO, normally 8,000km away, became very present to that part of the company,” Mr Rorsted says, seated in his ground-floor office at Henkel’s Düsseldorf headquarters.“A short cut for me to get a better understanding is to go out there, spend six weeks, go meet customers, partners, competitors, be part of it – and not go home on Friday night. Force yourself to be part of the local environment: then you understand the business better and get a better network.”It sounds partly gruelling but also immensely satisfying for an intellectually curious person, which Mr Rorsted – son of a university professor, who peppers a fast-moving conversation with plenty of questions of his own – seems to be. Asked if such trips are strictly business or really a covert form of pleasure, Mr Rorsted laughs. “You can only do a good job if you like what you do,” he says. “I won’t take my family, so that bit I don’t look forward to – but I have no doubt it will benefit the business later.”He is also, he says, an early riser who will not be spending time socialising until the small hours. On a trip to Barcelona, local executives had to find a restaurant willing to open at, by local standards, the unfeasibly early hour of 8pm. By the time Catalan children were ordering their starters, Mr Rorsted was keen to head to bed – to be ready to start the next day, as usual, at 5.45am with a run or an hour in the gym. “I find being in good shape gives you a mental edge,” says the former handball player.Open, engaging and happy to talk about family ties, Mr Rorsted is one of a new generation of chief executives in Germany that is easing companies away from some of the fustier, detached traditions of the German boardroom. In Henkel’s case, the transition is leavened with respect for the heritage of a company that has 19th-century roots, bears the name of its founder and is controlled by his descendants. Happily for Mr Rorsted – and as long as he keeps hitting the right corporate targets – Henkel’s owners seem to support the idea of a cultural and generational shift.Before Mr Rorsted joined, the youngest of Henkel’s seven-strong management board was born in 1948 and all members had been at Henkel for between 20 and 35 years. “I was 42 …I asked myself: ‘What do I talk to these people about in the break?’” Mr Rorsted says.Today, he has a smaller, younger management board, while in the next office is 40-year-old Simone Bagel-Trah, the first female head of a German blue-chip company’s supervisory board. Together, she and Mr Rorsted are by far the youngest, and arguably the most diverse, chairman-chief executive combination at a big German company.Criticism that the upper ranks of corporate Germany are “ too white, male and German” was first voiced by Peter Löscher, the Austrian-born head of Siemens. Mr Rorsted says he was clear before joining Henkel that promoting diversity to improve performance would be one of his important jobs. “A year after I started I was asked by an American: ‘Can I make a top career at your company if I’m not German?’” Mr Rorsted recalls. Notwithstanding that the question was put to a Dane, Mr Rorsted says: “If that is the perception then it becomes a hindrance to us getting the best people.”Until six years ago, Mr Rorsted worked in technology. After stints at Oracle and Compaq, he was Hewlett-Packard’s managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa when he was let go by then chief executive Carly Fiorina. Among the subsequent job offers was Henkel’s proposal that he join its management board – with an expectation on both sides that he would shortly become chief executive if he performed well. It was, he says, the right time to leave one industry and learn something new.Does he miss the old world? “I miss the speed – the best companies in terms of speed are the IT companies. What I don’t miss is the shortsightedness that companies sometimes have,” he says.Since taking over in 2008, Mr Rorsted has also championed closer customer links and better staff management to try to improve performance at the company. With €13.6bn ($17.8bn, £11.4bn) in annual sales, Henkel’s brands are well known – they include Persil, Schwarzkopf, Right Guard and Sellotape – but the company, where margins are now improving, was often unfavourably compared with more profitable rivals such as Procter & Gamble.Some of Henkel’s products sit on his offices’ windowsills, and the hair-gelled Mr Rorsted points out the haircare products he uses and the household products he used in his days as what Germans call a Strohwitwer – working away from his home and living in a temporary bachelor pad.Asked to give a reason for Henkel’s underachievement, the fluent and fast-talking Mr Rorsted falls silent for 10 long seconds. “I think complacency would be the wrong word …it is probably internal focus rather than external focus. The different business groups maybe looked at each other rather than at 3M and Procter & Gamble. It made us forget what the external world was measuring,” he says.Mr Rorsted’s way of changing things can be seen in his view of how to get the most out of Henkel’s 50,000 staff. Employees are made much more aware of performance and Henkel has also planned to identify a group of about 250 “super managers” for enhanced training.“What has dramatically changed is an immense focus on people and people management, starting at the top of the house,” Mr Rorsted says. “Everyone knows exactly where they are.” At the same time, the down-to-earth executive, a regular of the staff canteen, says he is “trying to push the hierarchy” – palpable in many German companies – “out of the system”.Straight talk is important to Mr Rorsted. “We had a tendency to be too polite to our people and politeness can also be negative. We were very good at telling people when they did a good job and sometimes we didn’t always tell them when they didn’t do a good job. You can’t really improve if you don’t know where to improve,” he says. “I think it is disrespectful not telling people where they can improve because if you then go and say ‘you are not performing’, the person will say: ‘Well, you never told me!’”For all his focus on change and his fascination with an international environment – he decided when he was 15 that his future lay outside Denmark – Mr Rorsted gives every impression of valuing tradition and familiarity. Three generations of young Rorsteds have attended the same summer camp in Wisconsin: most mornings, the father of four uses his morning commute to speak to his father in Denmark and to his best friend from university, saying: “If you don’t reach out, you won’t have a relationship.”His parents, he says, “gave us the freedom to go to the US, aged 13, when everyone else was not letting their kids out of the house”.His own children’s school appointments go into his BlackBerry; Saturdays are set aside for family and the tennis club – something he will miss during the next five weeks."
537;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;SAP aims to broaden customer base by 2015;;SAP’s co-chief executive sought to emphasise the software group’s returning mood of confidence when he hit out against its main rival Oracle and said SAP’s growth would pick up speed in the next five years.The world’s largest business software maker by sales will increase its customer base, which jumped by 10,000 to more than 100,000 in the past quarter, in the next five years, Bill McDermott, SAP’s co-chief executive, said.“You will definitely see SAP with significantly more customers by 2015,” Mr McDermott told the Financial Times at the group’s headquarters in Walldorf in the south of Germany.SAP hopes to broaden its customer base by bringing its mainly desktop-focused software solutions on to a wide range of mobile devices, a strategy for which it recently acquired US database and mobile software specialist Sybase for $5.8bn.With the help of Sybase, the group aims to increase the number of users from the current 35m to 1bn in the next five years, Mr McDermott said.The US citizen, who took over with co-head Jim Hagemann Snabe after a management shake-up in February, said SAP would “disrupt” its main rival Oracle’s business model with its mobile strategy and “in-memory” technology, aimed at reducing the speed and cost of data analysis by storing data directly on memory chips.Responding to repeated snipes by Larry Ellison, Oracle’s founder, the 48-year-old manager said: “Their story is to sell bite-sized chunks of yesterday’s technology . . . a company like SAP can disrupt their business model.”SAP and Oracle have never exchanged niceties, but their dispute escalated in the wake of the Sybase deal when Mr Ellison called the in-memory technology “wacko, ridiculous, complete nonsense”.While SAP says the rationale for the Sybase deal is to obtain cutting-edge technology in mobile software usage, it is also set to turn the likes of Oracle, IBM and Microsoft from SAP’s partners to rivals in the field of databases.Some analysts have sided with Mr Ellison’s view. “In-memory is still emerging from [SAP’s co-founder and chairman] Hasso Plattner’s lab and we have not seen many applications yet,” said Paul Hamermann, analyst at Forrester, a technology research group.“It is not clear what SAP’s road map for its technological innovation is,” he added.But Mr McDermott’s attack on Oracle has underlined how the management is seeking to lift self-confidence at SAP, which has been hit by an erosion of employees’ and customers’ trust as well as business momentum during the past year.The new spirit could be felt two weeks ago when the two co-heads staged SAP’s first summer party, attended by 23,500 employees and their families and featuring a show by one of Germany’s best-known circuses.Mr McDermott said he was “very optimistic” about SAP’s growth prospects. “Wherever I speak to customers, I see big signs of growth. Exponential? No. But solid.”He said there was a chance for SAP to exceed its full-year guidance for its software and related service revenues, which it recently lifted to 9 to 11 per cent.“If western Europe has a steeper recovery . . . could things get better? Of course they could. But right now we felt that this was the most realistic and appropriate thing to do,” he said.
538;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-07-28T04:22:05Z;SAP sales outlook disappoints investors;;SAP on Tuesday slightly raised its sales outlook for the full year, in a move that failed to achieve market hopes for a bolder forecast from the German business software maker.The world’s largest business software group by sales said it expected revenues from software and related services to climb by 6 to 8 per cent at constant currencies in the full year, at the upper end of the previously forecast range of 4 to 8 per cent.The company added that software and related service revenues would rise by 9 to 11 per cent if sales from database specialist Sybase, which SAP acquired this year for $5.8bn, were taken into account.The guidance was seen as overly cautious by some analysts and it disappointed investors, who sent SAP’s share price down by more than 2 per cent.Software and service revenues increased by 16 per cent in the second quarter year-on-year, a figure that shrinks to a growth of 8 per cent if adjusted by currency fluctuations.It came after rivals such as Oracle and Microsoft reported double-digit growth in recent months, underlining how customers are catching up with software investments that were being postponed during last year’s economic crisis.“Customers continue to invest for growth across large, mid-sized and small enterprises and within many industries,” said Bill McDermott, SAP’s co-chief executive.SAP’s management left the software group’s operating profit margin forecast unchanged at a range of 30 to 31 per cent for the full year, based on non-international accounting standards.In the second quarter, the operating margin stood at 27.8 per cent at constant currencies.SAP’s net profit rose by 15 per cent to €491m ($638m) in the months from April to June, missing analysts’ expectations.The German company, which sells software to manage client relations and supply chains, said it gained about 10,000 customers in the second quarter, lifting its total customer base to more than 100,000.“Reaching more than 100,000 customers is a testament to the inroads we have made in expanding our volume business and our success in the small and mid-sized enterprise segment,” said Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s second co-chief executive.Mr Snabe and Mr McDermott are on a mission to bring the company back on track after taking over in February from their predecessor Leo Apotheker, who was forced to leave amid a turbulent year 2009, when revenues and profits fell and SAP’s employees lost trust in the top management.
539;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-07-02T16:59:55Z;MySQL founder appeals against Sun-Oracle merger;;Monty Widenius, founder of the MySQL open-source database business, whose fate held up Oracle’s $7.4bn purchase of Sun Microsystems for months last year, has filed an appeal against the decision by European competition authorities to clear the merger.The European Commission said it was aware of the appeal, filed with the European courts in Luxembourg, but did not yet know the grounds. “We will defend our decision in court,” an official said on Friday.MySQL had been acquired by Sun, and for months last year competition officials at the European Commission investigated concerns – raised by Mr Widenius and others – that if Oracle took control of Sun’s business unconditionally, it could have an incentive to suppress or restructure a product that was given away for free and posed a disruptive threat to its own businessThe matter – which at one stage provoked transatlantic tensions with US competition regulators who had already cleared the deal – ended lamely given the hiatus caused. The US group published a 10-point list of commitments to reassure the commission that MySQL would remain a competitive force in the database market and, shortly afterwards, the deal was cleared.The commitments were not legally binding, however, and much criticised by Mr Widenius at the time.On Friday, the MySQL founder told the Financial Times that he did not want to make a full statement until Oracle had responded. But he said he believed the commitments which the US technology group gave vis-à-vis MySQL “weren’t worth the paper they were written on”.“I would like to see some true commitments”, he said.Mr Widenius also stressed that he was using his own money to fund the appeal and said that he was acting on behalf of the numerous people who supported an online petition seeking more protection for the MySQL business.Other opponents of the Sun/Oracle merger last year included Microsoft, a rival to Oracle.The non-binding commitments given by Oracle in respect of MySQL included the continued availability of storage engine APIs, certain licence-related commitments, increased spending on MySQL research and development, the creation of customer and storage engine vendor advisory boards and a pledge to maintain the MySQL reference manual.

It can also import real-time data for better energy management.Novell fights for Sun customersThe gloves are off. Novell has launched a campaign of special offers to convince businesses using Sun Microsystems’ software to switch to Novell.Following Oracle’s controversial acquisition of Sun, Novell argues that the future of Sun products, particularly the Solaris operating system and its identity management software is in doubt. Novell is pushing the Suse Linux Enterprise operating system and Novell Identity Management as replacementsOracle system seeks to capture ideasAgile Customer Needs Management. No, it’s not an ad in the “Personal Services” section but rather the latest addition to Oracle’s product lifecycle management (PLM) portfolio.The software aims to help with the “fuzzy” front-end of product design, namely capturing ideas, feedback and product requirements from internal and external sources. Oracle acquired PLM pioneer Agile in 2007.Cloudera could be one to watchYou may not have heard of Cloudera, but they once said the same about Oracle.Like Oracle 30 years ago, Cloudera is pioneering a new database technology, the Apache Hadoop open source database, which uses a radically different approach to Oracle and other so-called “relational” databases.Cloudera has now announced Cloudera Enterprise, a set of software and support services to help large enterprises get started with Hadoop. One to watch.
541;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-06-25T20:43:24Z;US banks rally after reform agreement;;US stocks rallied on Friday as lawmakers completed negotiations on financial regulation legislation, removing some of the uncertainty around reform.But a report showing first-quarter economic growth had been slower than estimated damped risk appetite. The main indices were all lower on the week, after two weeks of positive returns.“Investors are starting to take down their growth rate expectations for the next two to four quarters,” said Doug Cliggott, US equity strategist at Credit Suisse.“However, there are two positives for the market: valuations are pretty good and the balance sheets of the large caps are in great shape.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent to 1,076.59 but 3.5 per cent lower on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.1 per cent to 10,143.81 and fell 2.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher to 2,223.48 but had erased 3.5 per cent since the start of the week.The measures agreed in Congress overnight on Thursday will regulate banks’ capacity to trade in derivatives but will not force them to sell their derivatives businesses, a measure some lawmakers had been pushing for.“While some of the measures may be stricter than some [observers] may have predicted, at least now the industry and markets can move from wondering what the reforms may be to learning how to live with them and move on,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.Financials, the session’s best performing sector, were higher across the board on Friday. JPMorgan rose 3.7 per cent to $39.44, Citigroup rallied 4.2 per cent to $3.94, Morgan Stanley added 3.1 per cent to $25.01, Bank of America advanced 2.7 per cent to $15.42 and Goldman Sachs jumped 3.5 per cent to $139.66.However, credit card companies underperformed the main indices as the financial reform bill limited the fee levels they can charge customers.MasterCard dropped 0.7 per cent to $213.30,Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent to $42.68 but Visa rose 0.2 per cent to $76.61.Oracle, the world’s second-largest software company, rallied 2 per cent to $22.66 on Friday. It reported a fourth-quarter profit of60 cents per share after the market closed on Thursday, topping the average analyst estimate of 54 cents per share. Demand for its programmes has grown as the economy recovers from the recession and it has been able to renew support contracts.Research in Motion, which makes the BlackBerry smartphone, dropped 10.8 per cent on Friday to $52.23 after posting worse-than-expected first-quarter revenues after the market closed on Thursday. Revenues in the quarter were $4.24bn, against the $4.35bn average analyst estimate, as competition between the BlackBerry and Apple’s iPhone intensified.KB Home was down 9 per cent to $11.12 on Friday, as the homebuilder specialising in homes for first-time buyers reported a second-quarter loss of 40 cents per share. Analysts had on average estimated a loss of 31 cents per share.Homebuilders were among the week’s worst performers following data released on Wednesday showing new home sales had fallen to the lowest level since records began in 1963.Pulte Group was 4.6 per cent lower at $8.92 and Toll Brothers declined 4.1 per cent to $17.20 but Beazer Homes inched up 1.7 per cent to $4.12.Lennar Corp was up 0.8 per cent to $14.68 after reporting slightly better than expected second-quarter results on Thursday.US-listed shares in BP were 15 per cent lower to $27.02 on the week as oil continued to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. On Wednesday, New York’s state pension fund said it planned to sue the oil company to recover losses due to the fall in BP’s share price. The fund said it owned more than 19m shares in BP when the oil spill begun in April.Anadarko Petroleum, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the damaged oil well, fell 11.9 per cent to $37.68 over the week.
542;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-06-25T01:06:53Z;Oracle boost amid signs of Sun turnround;;A first sign of a turnround in the hardware business it assumed with the acquisition of Sun Microsystems helped Oracle to top Wall Street’s revenue and earnings expectations for its latest quarter, according to figures released on Thursday.A 14 per cent rise in new software licence sales added to optimism that the company’s fortunes were improving rapidly with the economic recovery, contributing to a 4 per cent rise in its shares in after-market trading.Oracle’s ability to return Sun to profitability has been closely watched since it purchased the struggling server maker this year.Sun had suffered a $2.2bn operating loss in its last year as an independent company as it was hammered by the collapse in corporate spending on servers during the downturn, and Oracle indicated last month it expected to make further substantial cuts in headcount. On Thursday it said Sun’s business had returned to profits, at least on a pro-forma basis, in the most recent quarter, with operating income of $400m – though it added that the allocation of costs between business divisions might partially obscure the full picture. Sun’s hardware sales reached $1.2bn, above forecasts.Larry Ellison, chief executive, said Oracle planned to more than double the size of the Sun salesforce. “We are focused on growing the Sun business, and growing it rapidly,” he said.The rebound at Sun was based in large part on Oracle’s decision to stop selling unprofitable products from its portfolio, with the salesforce now rewarded on the profitability generated by sales as well as the revenue, said Safra Catz, co-president.As a result, Oracle had boosted the gross margin on Sun’s sales to 46 per cent, above the level Sun had been able to achieve on its own. Oracle’s core database software business also rebounded strongly, with an 18 per cent jump in new software licence revenues from a year before, to $2.3bn. New licence revenue from applications software rose only 6 per cent to $855m, reflecting its more volatile performance after a strong 21 per cent bounce in the previous three months.Overall, Oracle reported earnings of 46 cents a share, up from 38 cents a year before, as revenues increased 39 per cent to $9.5bn thanks to the Sun deal. On the pro-forma basis Wall Street judges the company, earnings reached 60 cents a share, compared with the 54 cents analysts had expected.
543;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-06-10T21:35:31Z;Heron set for return to building houses;Homes to be built on sites controlled by land subsidiary;Heron International, the European property company led by billionaire developer Gerald Ronson, is set to return to housebuilding 16 years after it abandoned the market.The company, which is behind the Heron Tower development in the City, plans to build homes on sites controlled by its land subsidiary.The original Heron Homes became one of the biggest housebuilders in the south of England but was sold for £31m in 1994 as part of a series of disposals to try to bring down debt at the parent company, which had been hard hit by the property slump.The company made earlier attempts to return to housebuilding with approaches for Alfred McAlpine’s housing arm in 2000 – rejected as “materially undervalued” – and for Crest Nicholson about five years later, from which it walked away.It built a stake in Crest and made a £56m profit by selling it to Sir Tom Hunter.The inspiration to go it alone back into housebuilding came after the Heron Land subsidiary, led by Stephen Bailey, suggested that the company would be able to capitalise on market conditions.Mr Ronson’s plans come a year after Heron– whose backers include Larry Ellison, the Oracle chief, Michael Milken, the former junk bond king and Steve Wynn, the casino mogul – resumed dividend pay-outs.The company, whose land subsidiary controls 8,000 plots in southern England, is drawing up plans to start building homes next year, which are likely to be priced at between £120,000 and £400,000.Possible sites for the Heron Homes renaissance include Emersons Green in Bristol, where the company has a share in a 300-acre scheme with Quintain and Gallagher Estates.“We are quite excited about this,” Mr Ronson told Property Week. “To give customers value for money, you need to have acquired the land at the right price – and we have put together an excellent land bank at the right price.”Mr Ronson acknowledged that the industry and regulatory landscape had changed substantially.He stressed: “There is strong demand for homes in the south of England and, with planning consents getting harder to achieve, if you can build the right product in the right location, you will do well.”

545;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-06-09T19:42:31Z;Allscripts deal leaves Misys to focus on banking business;;By any calculation, the sale of Misys’s majority stake in Allscripts is a fabulous return for two years’ work.Misys bought the 54.5 per cent stake in the US healthcare software business in 2008 for $330m plus the value of its own ailing healthcare software operations – estimated to be worth about $100m – which were folded into the combined entity.Today it expects to sell most of this stake for $1.3bn in cash, as Allscripts merges with Eclipsys to create one of the largest US healthcare software operations. At the very least, the UK software company has doubled its money, and shareholders could be in line to receive about $1.2bn in cash through a share buy-back this autumn – about 72 per cent of Misys’s market value.It is the kind of hedge fund-style return that ValueAct Capital, Misys’s biggest shareholder with 29 per cent, had in mind in 2006 when Mike Lawrie, one of its former partners, took over as chief executive and began to turn round a sleepy and struggling British technology company.Before Mr Lawrie can ride off in glory, however, he must settle what will happen to the other half of Misys’s operations, its stagnant financial software business.This year, he appointed Al-Noor Ramji, the former chief information officer of BT, to an executive role at the banking division and on Wednesday brought in a new chief financial officer for the company.Mr Lawrie would not rule out acquisitions as a way of helping the banking business grow faster.“It is all guns blazing,” Mr Lawrie said. “The last stage of this turnround is to create a leader in the financial services software sector.”The Allscripts healthcare business is being boosted by huge US stimulus spending on upgrading electronic patient records, but the Misys banking arm has had no such fairy godmother to bolster business.Founded in 1979, Misys provides core software for some 1,200 financial institutions around the world. It is a stable and established business, banks being slow to change vital computer systems. However, the software has become badly outdated and Misys is losing new business to peers such as Temenos, Oracle and Infosys. The latest financial report from Misys, for the quarter to the end of February, showed a 12 per cent fall in banking revenues.In March Misys launched a software platform, BankFusion, which it hopes will return the business to growth. Mr Lawrie has said he wants to have 250 banks using BankFusion within five years, bringing in £250m in incremental revenue.If this works, the banking business should see a rise in its market value. Analysts value it at about 10 times projected earnings for 2010, compared with about 17 times for its competitors.The Misys banking division could become a takeover target for competitors looking to buy the impressive Misys customer list. Temenos, for example, has looked at buying the banking operations in the past, and Oracle could be looking to increase its banking software capabilities, following the purchase of a large stake in i-Flex, the Indian banking software company, five years ago.
546;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Sun sackings over? Not yet;;Five months after its acquisition by Oracle, the axe continues to fall on employees at Sun Microsystems.This is what CEO Larry Ellison had to say in January:The truth is we’re actually hiring 2,000 people over the next few months to beef up these businesses, and that’s about twice as many people as we’ll be laying off.Late on Friday, though, Oracle said it would add massively to the $325m of restructuring costs it had projected from the Sun integration. There will be an additional $675-825m of charges, with around 80 per cent of that apparently earmarked for employee severance costs.The latest job losses will fall in Europe and Asia, as part of a new restructuring plan adopted in early May. The affected employees started to hear about it a week ago.Oracle isn’t saying how many jobs will go as a result of the latest round of cuts. But the move certainly leaves a big question over Mr Ellison’s assurances about the prospects for Sun employees. It also raises doubts about how much Sun has benefited from the recovery in the server market this year, ahead of Oracle’s next quarterly earnings announcement on June 24th.

548;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-05-13T21:48:14Z;SAP adopts American operating system;Chairman defends return to dual chief executive structure;Hasso Plattner may be taking a back seat advisory role these days as SAP’s supervisory board chairman. But the co-founder of Germany’s software giant has nonetheless been pulling the strings to revive the company’s fortunes as it suffers increasingly at the hands of Oracle, his US competitor run by arch-rival Larry Ellison.It was clearly Mr Plattner who decided in February that it was time for Léo Apotheker, SAP’s chief executive, to go as a first step in rebuilding internal morale and revive the confidence of the company’s increasingly disenchanted customers and investors. After all, SAP had seen both its sales and profits steadily fall, while Oracle, as a result of a $42bn acquisition spree during the past five years, seemed to be going from strength to strength. To replace Mr Apotheker, who had avoided embarking on an Oracle-style big acquisition strategy in preference for what turned to be an unpopular cost-cutting one, Mr Plattner decided to go back to the company’s roots by re-establishing a dual chief executive structure. Mr Apotheker was thus replaced by two new co-chief executives – an American, Bill McDermott, and a Dane, Jim Hagemann Snabe.Mr Plattner justified the decision to revert to a dual chief executive structure on the grounds that this approach had not only marked SAP’s best years, but other information technology champions. Oracle had its Ray Lane and Larry Ellison, Microsoft its Bill Gates and Steve Ballner and, of course, at SAP itself, Mr Plattner shared power with Dietmar Hopp and later with Henning Kagermann.He suggested at the time that the German company had to act quickly. As he put it: “We are at the advent of the largest and most significant changes in the industry.” So for all the recent declarations claiming the two new co-heads of SAP were now firmly in charge, the duo must nonetheless have been feeling the pressure from Mr Plattner.Their reaction has been swift. They have not hesitated to pay a bumper $5.8bn to secure the Californian-based Sybase software group that specialises in systems that make it easier for users to access business software via smart phones and other mobile devices. And part of the current revolution in the IT market is the growing use of the mobile internet and smart phone in business.The speed with which the new SAP duo executed the Sybase deal also seems to have been designed to give customers, investors and employees a clear signal that the German company was now changing – and changing fast, with the new top management intent in injecting a bit more American culture in the way SAP conducts its business.So far, so good. But the question is whether one quick, smart deal – albeit expensive – will be enough to restore confidence in the German group and provide SAP with the necessary competitive tools to match the likes of Oracle, IBM, Cisco and Hewlett-Packard.The obvious question is whether SAP will now need to grow in scale even further to yank itself back to the top of the software business pedestal by making more acquisitions or partnerships with other companies that are falling behind the IT industry’s new leaders.But one thing is certain. Mr Plattner is bound to keep the heat on his two new chief executives. A keen sailor himself, he did not like losing to Mr Ellison in big yachting competitions. And he clearly does not want to see his old Oracle rival sailing ahead in the international software stakes.Sarkozy’s soft euroAngela Merkel, the German chancellor, continues to insist that Europe needs a strong euro. Her French counterpart, President Nicolas Sarkozy, clearly thinks differently.Talking this week to some party faithful, Mr Sarkozy suggested that a US dollar now trading at around €1.27 instead of €1.5 six months ago was no bad thing. Indeed, he is understood to have told a group of his UMP parliamentarians that he would even be quite happy to see the euro reach parity with the US currency.After all, this was where the euro originally traded against the dollar when it was launched.A weaker euro is helping European exporters – in Paris, shares of Airbus parent EADS have gained more than 6 per cent this week – and also making life more difficult for US competitors.Mr Sarkozy even suggested that a weakening euro could also allow France a little more inflation. It sounds like he is hankering back to the good old days when many European countries indulged in the competitive devaluation of their currencies to keep exports booming, while also keeping domestic wages rising and making the government debt seem more manageable.european.view@ft.com
549;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-05-13T21:28:59Z;SAP signals start of ‘stack wars’;;Ever since SAP reported a 28 per cent fall in annual software sales and dismissed chief executive Leo Apotheker earlier this year, it has been clear that the German software company was in need of a transformational change.However, investors and industry observers were on Thursday debating whether the $5.8bn acquisition of US peer Sybase was the right deal to achieve this.The transaction – which comes just three months after Jim Hagemann Snabe and Bill McDermott took over as co-chief executives of SAP – is undoubtedly expensive. It represents a 44 per cent premium, or $65 a share for a stock that has not been above $50 since the mid-1990s.It is the second-largest deal SAP has done since buying Business Objects for $6.1bn in 2007.That deal was criticised as overpriced, and this time it has paid an even higher multiple of expected sales.In contrast, Oracle, SAP’s far more acquisitive rival, paid just a 30 per cent premium when it bought Phase Forward, a healthcare software company, last month.Shares in SAP fell 1.1 per cent to €35.67 ($44.76).Some analysts see Sybase as a “dusty” and “broken” company, a distant fourth in the database market behind Oracle, IBM and Microsoft.“SAP has made no secret of wanting to do a meaningful deal, but not many would have guessed it would be Sybase. They need to strengthen their middleware offering, but instead they have bought a database vendor that competes in a market dominated by Oracle,” said Paul Guely, managing partner at Arma Partners, the technology advisory company.SAP is thought to have considered a number of targets, including Tibco, the Nasdaq-listed company that provides “middleware,” or technology that connects applications. Some analysts say this might have been a better deal.SAP argues, however, that the Sybase acquisition gives it access to cutting edge technologies, particularly for mobile phones.Sybase is a market leader in software for putting business applications onto mobile devices. Its software operates 1.5bn messages daily, according to John Chen, chief executive.“The immediate benefit is the mobile capability. They will be able to take SAP applications and make them accessible on handsets. Not many software companies have that capability and it will give SAP an incredible boost,” said Yvonne Genovese, analyst at Gartner.“This deal will extend our applications and analytics to millions of mobile users,” said Mr McDermott, pointing to the fact that there are seven to eight times as many mobile devices as broadband connections globally. Mobile access could be particularly important in emerging markets such as China, where Sybase has a strong position.The deal will also help SAP to push forward its “in memory” technology, where data is stored on the memory chip instead of the hard drive, a system that allows much faster computing.SAP says in-memory systems can cut the time it takes to analyse a database from hours to seconds. It is considered the next big leap in computer technology.Developing in-memory computing has been a pet project for Hasso Plattner, SAP’s chairman and co-founder, but the company is coming under pressure to turn the technology into marketable products.Putting SAP’s in-memory technology in Sybase’s databases would help sell the concept, said Ms Genovese. Sybase is focused on clients from the financial and trading world, where SAP believes the in-memory technology’s strength will play out best because of the size of data and the speed needed by the industry.Going into the database business will increase the competition between Oracle and SAP, however. Up to now, SAP has partnered with Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, using their databases as part of its enterprise systems.However, the temptation will now be to offer the Sybase solutions instead, as part of a complete, in-house “stack” of software.“The stack wars will start to happen, with Oracle, SAP, Microsoft and IBM all competing in this area,” Ms Genovese said.

The four-week average is improving, down 9,000 to 450,500 for the lowest level since late March. But those claiming jobless benefits rose unexpectedly, by 12,000 to 4.62m.At the close the S&P 500 was down 1.2 per cent at 1,157.42, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 10,782.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent lower at 2,394.36.Stephen Carl, principal and head equity trader at The Williams Capital Group, a boutique investment bank, said: “It’s a breather of a day compared to what we’ve had recently. The Cisco earnings are bringing some of the technology stocks down.”Cisco, a maker of networking equipment, lost 4.5 per cent to $25.53 in spite of the company issuing better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimates of at least $10.7bn. The average analyst estimate was $10.6bn.Brian White, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, advised a longer term outlook. “We would look beyond the quarter and near-term stock market reaction but rather focus on the fact that Cisco is in the midst of a major transformation that pushes the company into new markets, new product lines and lesser penetrated geographies, allowing for the potential to expand . . . and deliver attractive growth.”Mr White has a “buy” rating on the stock.Sybase rose 14.4 per cent to $64.22 after Germany’s SAP, the world’s largest enterprise software maker, said it was to acquire it for $5.8bn.The price, $65 per share, represents a 44 per cent premium to Sybase’s three-month average stock price.The move extends the rivalry between SAP and Oracle, which is the leading database company, but is number two to SAP in business management software.

551;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-05-13T16:58:13Z;SAP / Sybase;New chiefs spend entire cash pile, and more, in one go;SAP has finally raided its piggy bank. After three years without making any big acquisitions, the German software giant’s new co-chief executives have spent its entire €3bn cash pile, and some, in one go. But does paying $5.8bn for US database company Sybase make sense?If the deal was really about databases, probably not. While the acquisition will let SAP offer its corporate customers a database on which to run its applications (arch-rival Oracle already provides a one-stop-shop), Sybase is in truth a minnow. It has a 3 per cent share of the database market compared with Oracle’s 40 per cent or so, IBM’s 25 per cent and Microsoft’s 20. Most of SAP’s customers will probably stick with the big boys.What Sybase does offer is software that enables companies to run SAP’s real-time business analytics applications on mobiles – making them accessible on factory floors, in meetings and so on. This could give SAP an edge as it battles to defend software market share. The deal will also bring a different perspective to the board in the shape of John Chen, Sybase’s well-regarded chief executive. Those are rather woolly advantages, though, in return for an offer equal to about 25 times Sybase’s expected 2010 earnings. There are no obvious cost savings to be made.On a broader level, the deal sends a signal that things are changing at SAP, long seen as too cautious and slow to adapt. Since their promotion to the helm in February, Bill McDermott and Jim Snabe have promised innovation and a sense of urgency. Their approach to dealmaking would suggest they meant it. Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison, who openly mocked SAP in his latest results press release, should start dialling down his smug-o-meter.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
552;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-05-12T23:28:10Z;SAP to buy Sybase in $5.8bn deal;;SAP, the world’s largest enterprise software maker, has agreed to buy US rival Sybase in a deal worth $5.8bn, its biggest acquisition in almost three years.The German software group will pay $65 per share in cash for Sybase, SAP said in a statement on Wednesday evening.That represents a 44 per cent premium to the three-month average stock price of the fourth-largest provider of database software.The move extends the rivalry between SAP and US rival Oracle, where Oracle has been the leading database company but is number two to SAP in business management software.Bill McDermott, SAP’s co-chief executive, said the company would benefit hugely from Sybase’s database and mobile application technology.“We see a great potential in combining the leader in enterprise software with the leader in mobility,” Mr McDermott said.The deal marks a fast foray into dealmaking by Mr McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executives.SAP’s last big acquisition was the takeover of rival Business Objects for €4.8bn ($6.1bn) in late 2007.Sybase’s share price shot up more than 35 per cent on Wednesday, giving the US-based company a market value of just below $5bn. The group specialises in business intelligence and trading software for financial institutions, as well as solutions for mobile devices, matching SAP’s requirement that any takeover should move the company forward in terms of new technology.“This is a growth story,” Mr Snabe said.Mobile, “on device” software is one of three key areas for growth in SAP’s strategy. But it is also one where the group, which is by far the biggest seller of traditional enterprise software, is lagging behind competitors such as Sybase.Sybase would not have been a target for its acquisitive Bay Area neighbour Oracle, according to Yvonne Genovese, business applications analyst with the Gartner research group.“From a database perspective, Oracle thinks it’s got it all sewn up, so they have no need to go buy another database vendor,” she said.The software maker aims to expand its enterprise software market leadership while at the same time moving into the new areas of mobile software and on demand software, which is being used remotely rather than being installed and licensed.Mr Snabe said Sybase would be run as a fully owned subsidiary, with John Chen, its chief executive and chairman, staying at the helm of the company as well as joining SAP’s management board.SAP is financing the deal with a €2.75bn loan facility provided by its advisers on the deal, Deutsche Bank and Barclays Capital. Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Sybase.
553;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;IBM sets out bold buying strategy;;"IBM will spend $20bn on acquisitions over the next five years, chief executive Sam Palmisano said on Wednesday.“In five years we will spend more in acquisition than we did in the previous 10,” Mr Palmisano told analysts gathered for the company’s investor day.IBM has already stepped up the pace of acquisitions in recent months.During the first quarter it spent $1bn in cash, buying mostly smaller companies and putting it on track for the $4bn a year it would need to spend to hit Mr Palmisano’s target.Acquiring new companies would provide IBM with additional paths to growth, good news for a company whose core businesses of consulting and software are largely matured.Software, analytics and software as a service (SAAS) are expected to be a focus of IBM’s buying spree.The company talked about its evolving “cloud” strategy at its annual software conference in Las Vegas last week. Its customers are showing more interest in having their applications and services run remotely for them over the web – so-called cloud
computing.Last week, it bought privately held Cast Iron Systems to help integrate different cloud applications and service providers.A buying spree would also relieve IBM of the more than $14bn in cash and marketable securities it had amassed in recent years.Other large tech companies, including Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle, have also hoarded cash through the downturn.Mr Palmisano said the aggressive buying strategy would be made possible by what he expected to be “at least $20” earnings per share by 2015, which would generate $100bn in free cash flow during the same period.The chief executive’s forecasts were part of a “five-year roadmap” IBM presented to investors that assumed 5 per cent compound revenue growth over the five-year period.The timeline continues IBM’s habit of making detailed forecasts. In May 2007 it introduced a three-year plan to achieve $10 per share by the end of 2010. It hit that target one year early, at the end of 2009. The group now expects EPS of $11.20 for the full fiscal year.Mr Palmisano has overseen more than 100 purchases during his time as chief executive. The largest of those was the $3.5bn purchase of PwC Consulting in 2002, a deal that bolstered IBM’s services division but has been marred by choppy integration and a more competitive outsourcing market.The second-largest purchase under Mr Palmisano was also for a services company, the $1.3bn purchase of Internet Security Systems in 2006.It spent $1.5bn in the 2009 calendar year, with $1.2bn of that spent on SPSS, the business analytics group.IBM will be 100 years old next year. From its origins as a vendor of meat slicers and scales, it has become the world’s largest consulting group and third-largest software company."

555;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-05-06T17:08:35Z;Larry Ellison revamps America’s Cup;;Larry Ellison, billionaire founder of software group Oracle and winner of this year’s America’s Cup, on Thursday launched a makeover of the world’s oldest sporting trophy to model the elite yachting series more along the lines of Formula One motor racing.Russell Coutts, the world’s most successful professional skipper who has won the cup four times, laid out Mr Ellison’s plans at a Rome press conference held jointly with Vincenzo Onorato, an Italian racer and ferry line owner.Mr Onorato spoke as the Challenger of Record representing teams planning to contest the right to race against the American billionaire for the 162-year-old trophy.The establishment of a single class of boat and an independent international jury will hopefully avoid the three years of complex and tedious court battles that marred the last series bitterly contested by the previous defender, Ernesto Bertarelli, a Swiss biotechnology tycoon, and Mr Ellison’s BMW Oracle team over two races off Valencia in Spain.Details have yet to be worked out with the challengers – possibly six to eight teams – but will include annual regattas as well as qualifying races in various venues with the emphasis on winning greater television audiences, more marketing and making the series commercially viable. Lengths of races will even be tailored to fit “optimum television time”, Mr Coutts said.Organisers suggested this would see a return to the Americas Cup fold of Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods maker that had been a long-time partner in the events but had been marginalised by Mr Bertarelli’s narrower and controversial vision for this year’s prize, which ended up in a one-to-one race against Mr Ellison. Other challengers were left out of the picture.“Diktat has been replaced by discussion, confrontation by consultation,” Mr Coutts said, stressing Mr Ellison’s collegial approach to cooperating with potential challengers even at the expense of the losing some of his privileges as the cup’s defender. He did, however, underline Mr Ellison’s controversial intention to race against the challengers at the annual regattas, a development seen by rivals as giving him an unfair advantage.“Formula One is one model,” Mr Coutts told the Financial Times. “It will be a dramatically different product.” He said the cup should not be seen as an “arms race” and stressed the need for cost-cutting. Mr Ellison is reported to have spent some $100m (£66.78m, €78.69m) winning the cup this year.Mr Ellison prefers the final series of the 34th America Cup races to be held in San Francisco, home of his Golden Gate Yacht Club, but venues and timing have yet to be agreed. A protocol of rules could be announced in August, rules on the class of boat – whether mono- or multi-hull – by September and a deadline for challengers to register by next January. The final series would be held in 2013 or 2014.Mr Ellison was also said to be open to holding a series of regattas pitting his boat against other American teams vying for the right to defend the trophy.

557;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-04-29T03:35:53Z;Sharp rise in profits for SAP;;SAP on Wednesday reported a sharp rise in its first-quarter profit thanks in part to a strong rebound in corporate spending.The German software group said its profit after tax jumped by 97 per cent to €387m ($509m), as last year’s cost cuts paid off and on the back of increasing sales across most major regions and products.“The outlook for our business is very compelling … There is a strong growth momentum in all our key markets,” Bill McDermott, co-chief executive, said.SAP, which sells software to manage client relations and supply chains to more than 92,000 customers, said its total revenues increased by 5 per cent to €2.51bn.The strong first-quarter results followed similarly positive earnings reports from its main rivals such as IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.The recovery of the tech sector was underscored further on Wednesday when German chipmaker Infineon raised its full-year outlook on the back of a better than expected second quarter.Peter Bauer, Infineon’s chief executive, said the group aimed for a sales growth in the “high 30s”. Infineon had previously expected sales to rise by more than 20 per cent in the current fiscal year, which ends in September.Fellow German company SAP stopped short of increasing the full-year guidance, in spite of sales growth in the first quarter that exceeded the forecast.SAP’s core revenues – sales of software and related services such as online subscriptions – climbed by 12 per cent in the first three months, much more than the full-year forecast of a rise between 4 and 8 per cent from last year’s €8.2bn.Jim Hagemann Snabe, co-chief executive, cited remaining challenges for the overall economy such as the Greek debt crisis as a reason for the cautious approach.But he also said the company had a very encouraging pipeline for its products, as customers across the globe were placing renewed emphasis on growth strategies.“While tight cost control remains important for our customers we also see clear signs that growth is back on the agenda,” he said.Thomas Otter, analyst at Gartner, the research firm, said: “This should be a positive year for SAP both from a financial standpoint and from the customer perspective, off a dismal 2009 that left both investors and customers confused and uncertain.”The German software maker has gone through turbulent times in the past twelve months.SAP’s revenues, software licence fees and profits have been falling and the attempt to increase maintenance fees caused an outcry particularly among domestic customers.In February, chief executive Léo Apotheker was replaced by Mr McDermott and Mr Snabe, following an employee survey that showed an erosion of trust in the top management.Further senior managers left the company in the meantime, burdening SAP with a €27m bill for severance pays in the first quarter.Despite the management changes, Mr Snabe said SAP had won more than 70 new customers from competitors in the first three months.
558;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Big names prove worth in crisis;;"For companies whose financial value depends heavily on the health of their brands, the severity and abruptness of the recession was a challenge.The abruptness with which many consumers stopped spending, and large companies reduced capital investment and wound down capital investment, caused a shock to the system. Many companies experienced not only the financial crisis, but also a crisis of confidence.Marketers and advertising agencies preach the gospel that the companies that emerge best out of recessions are those that maintain their marketing budget and protect brands when the going gets tough. In practice, few companies were certain enough of the future to comply.Yet some of the Doomsday scenarios about the value of brands in a new, less leveraged world, have not come to pass. Emerging from the recession, luxury goods companies and many other consumer brand companies are enjoying a rebound.The underlying value of any brand – the premium commanded by products and services with strong reputations and identities – has not been eliminated by the crisis. Even those companies that did not invest heavily in their portfolio in the worst times are regaining some confidence.Indeed, this year’s BrandZ brands survey suggests that, even if the value of brands is below its 2007 peak, it has rebounded more sharply than the S&P 500. Millward Brown Optimor, the WPP subsidiary that compiles the ranking, calculates that a portfolio of the top 100 brands – updated each year as a new list is compiled – is 18.5 per cent up from its level four years ago, compared with an 11.5 per cent fall in the S&P 500.The premium for the top 100 brands was squeezed as many countries went into recession but it opened up again coming out. In other words, the outlook for brands has not been fundamentally altered as a result of the recession; instead, it looks familiar.“Brands outperform in good times and when there is a recession they do go down, but they come out the other side with a sustainable advantage,” says Joanna Seddon, chief executive of MBO.The nature of brands continues to evolve. Technology rather than marketing is now the defining characteristic of seven of the top 10 brands, with Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Marlboro making up the other three.Google remains the world’s most valuable brand, but edging up close behind it are two other technology companies, IBM and Apple. Both of these outrank Microsoft, whose brand value was stable during the year.Meanwhile, China Mobile, General Electric and Vodafone occupy the lowest three places in the top 10, which comprises the same brands as last year’s ranking. Although GE’s brand value fell by 25 per cent from $59.8bn in the list published a year ago, due mainly to its difficulties with GE Capital, the technology and infrastructure-related parts of its business retain their strength.The resurgence in Apple under Steve Jobs, through the iPod, the iPhone and now the iPad, continues unabated and, on present trends, it could be pressing Google for first place within a year or two. That is a tribute to a company that inspires devotion among customers.It may also be a reflection of the value of inspirational leadership, and the way in which consumers identify some of the world’s most valuable brands, such as Oracle and Starbucks, with founders who embodies their qualities. Larry Ellison of Oracle and Howard Schultz of Starbucks are not only the founders but keepers of the flame.This broad shift towards technology is a reflection of the importance of the internet and communications in the fortunes of many companies, including Telcel, the mobile phone group controlled by Carlos Slim Helu. Telcel is the first Mexican company to enter the top 100 (in 69th place).The social media boom led by companies such as Facebook and Twitter – as well the rise in smartphones led by Apple – has had a broader impact on the top 100. It has boosted mobile operators such as Verizon and AT&T, despite the complaints of iPhone users about AT&T’s 3G coverage.Although mobile phone companies are struggling to upgrade their data networks, the trend towards the mobile internet is giving them valuable revenue opportunities. “Everyone is twittering and sending pictures on iPhones, and data is what makes money,” says Ms Seddon.Yet technology can also disturb traditional brand values and make it easier for young competitors to break into markets. The best example of that at the moment is the media industry, where technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple dominate distribution.That is causing problems for media conglomerates with old-established brands in film, television and print. They are facing similar problems to the consumer goods companies that confront powerful discounting distributors, particularly Walmart.Apart from the influence of technology, the biggest secular shift in brand value is the continuing rise of emerging market brands. Some 13 of the top 100 brands now come from emerging markets, with seven of these from China. In the 2006 ranking there was just one emerging-market brand – China Mobile.For the moment, most of these brands tend to be based on finance or resources, with banks such as ICICI of India and China Construction Bank, and energy companies such as PetroChina and Petrobras combining both financial value and a large domestic market.One reason for the two latter groups’ debut in the latest BrandZ Top 100 is that MBO has used new research to reflect the upstream brand value of oil companies for the first time. Previously, only the downstream distribution arms of energy groups such as BP and ExxonMobil were fully reflected in the brand rankings.This has had a significant effect, with BP being allocated a brand value of $17bn and entering the top 100 at 34 while ExxonMobil comes in just behind it in 39th place, with brand value of $15.5bn. It is an illustration of how brands matter not just to customers but in a business-to-business context.As ever, the year included examples of famous brands having difficulties – the most notable being Toyota, the Japanese car company. Problems with the brakes on some models led to product recalls in the US and damage to its reputation for quality.Toyota’s brand value fell from $29.9bn in the 2009 ranking to $21.7bn in the latest one, and the effect of the product recalls may not yet have fully worked its way through. Toyota joined Home Depot, another well-established brand that lost its way, falling from a brand value of $18.3bn in 2007 to $9bn this year.Many analysts expected problems for luxury clothing and goods makers, which faced a wave of discounting by retailers at the end of 2008, and fears about whether consumers would continue to be extremely high prices for a luxury image.In practice, however, well-established luxury goods brands such as Louis Vuitton have kept their value, even if they have not seen the kind of growth they might have hoped for. The value of the Louis Vuitton brand, at $19.8bn, is 2 per cent up on the previous year.So, despite the shock that many experienced following the financial crisis, brands are playing their traditional role of giving companies some cushion against market pressures. They have proved their capacity to retain loyalty among consumers even through downturns.Many brands will experience crises, or simply stagnate, in the coming year and have to claw their way back but the aftermath of the crisis has proven once again an old lesson. Brands may suffer, but they are hard to destroy altogether."
559;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Across the sectors: brand value rankings for 17 business categories;;Reflecting last year’s less volatile business environment when compared with 2008, the rises and falls in the aggregate brand values of the 17 categories covered by the 2010 BrandZ ranking are less marked.Whereas the biggest risers in the 2009 ranking were mobile operators, up 28 per cent, and soft drinks, up 24 per cent, the steepest rise this time is just 12 per cent for financial institutions, reversing the 11 per cent decline a year earlier.At the other end of the table, cars and insurance are still battling for the wooden spoon, but at least this time both sectors have stemmed the decline. After a whopping 48 per cent decline in brand value in last year’s ranking, insurance has fallen just 7 per cent this time, while cars are down 15 per cent, compared with 22 per cent a year ago.Financial Institutions12%Beer10%Technology6%Fast Food1%Retail-1%Soft Drinks-1%Mobile Networks-1%Bottled Water-2%Gaming Consoles-3%Spirits-3%Luxury-3%Apparel-4%Personal Care-4%Coffee-6%Insurance-7%Cars-15%Here are briefing notes on all the categories, with comments from Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, Nick Cooper, senior vice-president of MBO in the UK and Europe, and Cristiana Pearson, an MBO director. (NB: to produce the top 10s and in some cases top 20s, many brands are included that are too small for the Top 100. So, while all constituents of the financial services Top 20 are in the Top 100, none of the bottled water Top 10 are anywhere near big enough to get in. The Coffee and Games Consoles categories have only eight and six constituents respectively).ApparelPearson: “Not much movement but Nike has taken back its number one position from H&M”. Seddon: “People are no longer totally shopping at H&M, they’re not feeling quite as poor.” Pearson: “Next is a recovery brand, it was down 40 per cent last year so has recovered its value. It has tried to adopt the Zara/H&M model of quick turnround of trends and moving its products fast through the stores. It has also adopted a strategy of moving from the cities to larger spaces in retail parks, which has been quite successful.”BeerPearson: “As last year, light beer brands are growing faster. Corona, the Mexican brand is also doing well, helped by its “Corona tu espacio” concept of having a moment alone with your Corona. Skol is benefiting from the merger of Anheuser-Busch and InBev, and from its strong position in Brazil where it is very involved in cultural events, music festivals, things that young people really bond with.”Bottled waterPearson: “The only brand really going up is Evian, with its Roller Babies campaign which was very successful.” Nick: “Evian’s Live Young campaign suggests and communicates a benefit and that there is actually a point to drinking water, which I think has perhaps helped the brand.”CarsPearson: “Toyota is no longer top, as a corporation it has been affected by the recalls, so that has impacted on the financials [which form an element of the brand value formula]. Walshe: “Millward Brown did some research in the US in January, which said, not surprisingly, that people’s perception of Toyota as a reliable brand had slipped, and also it wasn’t to be trusted as much as their domestic brands. But when you split that out between users or owners, and non-owners, with the owners there was only a very slight slip, so there was an inherent loyalty there, which is to do with what the brand has done in the past. Toyota is trying quite hard now [to rebuild its reputation] with advertising, inviting owners to contact them, saying that all the cars have been checked, and guaranteeing it all. Now, I think it’s a brand that might have a greater chance of being believed simply because of its strength in the past.” Seddon: “All the brands are down except for Ford, VW and Audi in the top 10. Ford, apart from having the best social media campaign ever, has stepped into the hole left by GM. Ford dealt with the whole [crisis in the US car industry] beautifully from a brand and reputation point-of-view.”CoffeePearson: “The same story as last year, Nespresso is the big winner. It continues to do incredibly well for the same reasons as before – it’s affordable luxury. It continues to introduce new flavours and new machines.” Seddon: “Otherwise, everything’s down apart from Starbucks, and of course this brand now includes coffee sold at supermarkets.” Pearson: “Because of the recession Starbucks has introduced different packages which are more like value packs, so you pay less for bigger packs and this has worked quite well, especially in the US.”Fast foodSeddon: “Look how dominant McDonald’s is. It hasn’t particularly grown [brand value is actually down 1 per cent] but it’s a fabulous brand.” Pearson: “Last year was the fast food year, [the sector rose 16 per cent in the 2009 ranking, but only 1 per cent this time] and a lot of that was driven by McDonald’s.” Seddon: “Burger King is down quite sharply, it claims that the reason it is are not doing so well is because of the weather and swine flu.” Pearson: “Compared with McDonald’s Burger King is very much more exposed to the US, even though it is opening a lot of stores outside the US.” Seddon: “Subway is worth a mention – it has a really healthy reputation but it’s the $5 Footlong which has really benefited it. The Footlong was supposed to be temporary when Subway launched it and it has been incredibly successful and kind of turbocharged Subway’s performance.”Financial InstitutionsSee separate article.Games ConsolesPearson: “This is all about a technology switch as new generations of consoles come in. Nintendo’s Wii is still growing, as is PlayStation 3, but next year we’ll probably not see PlayStation 2 at all. Also the at-home consoles are doing better than the portable ones like Nintendo DS because the hardcore and serious gamers don’t really use handhelds.”InsuranceSeddon: “This category is all over the place [brand value changes range from a 19 per cent rise at State Farm to a 47 per cent fall at ING]. Pearson: “State farm has a top score of 5 in brand contribution so it is very trusted.” Seddon: “ING won’t be in business next year [last October ING unveiled a radical break-up forced on it by the European Commission that will see the Dutch financial services group sell off its insurance and investment management business following the state bail-out in 2008]. Walshe: Zurich Insurance have done a big branding campaign in Europe, which has been successful.LuxuryPearson: “This category is a bit of a mixed bag again. Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Gucci were the three brands that rose [apart from Tiffany] and these really are the traditional, staple luxury brands.” Seddon: “It was generally a bit of a dismal year for luxury but those three brands stuck to their knitting, they all said ‘We are the classic luxury brands, we’re not compromising. They are real, classic luxury brands. The other brands are not so classic. People have been drinking less champagne – all those investment bankers, there’s fewer of them.”Mobile operatorsSeddon: “Here we’ve got the modern, legal form of addiction in mature markets. All the top 10 mobile operators are in the top 100, and a lot of this is because of apps – it’s all that data flowing through, which increased the arpu (average revenue per user). Verizon Wireless has done a very good job, part of this is about the fact that AT&T had the iPhone and, big though their network was, the iPhone apps were too popular, leading to reception problems, and Verizon took that on, head on, and went with Google’s Android [mobile operating system]. The positioning is very different, it’s more techy and less fluffy and social, but Verizon have done very well. For AT&T the iPhone was too popular for its own good. Elsewhere, very few companies have two of their brands in the Top 100, but Spain’s Telefónica owns both Movistar and O2. Movistar has been doing very well – that is really about growth in Latin America. O2 has been very successful in monetising the brand through apps and use of the phone, so for example it has got a platform called O2 Money, which is enormously successful. It has also got one of the best music downloads. And it has successfully grown the brand outside the UK in Ireland, Germany and the Czech Republic. O2 has also gone into fixed line with ADSL [asymmetric digital subscriber line] quite recently. Finally, China Mobile’s brand value went down. It has been enormously successful, but now it has new competition in China, as China Telecom has been licensed to compete with it.”Oil and gas brandsSee separate article.Personal careColgate is the only brand to have achieved a rise of 10 per cent or more in this category, and across the Top 15 there are more fallers than risers. Dove, the Unilever brand which is outside the Top 100, also did well, while Avon and Nivea are the biggest fallers.RetailersSeddon: “Amazon is the top performer in this category. It continues to take business away from Ebay [the biggest faller in this category by a long chalk] and in fact is every retailer’s biggest competitor now. Amazon’s biggest competitor is Walmart, that’s who it is targeting. If you look at Amazon’s sales, it is general merchandise – the stuff that Walmart sells, that is rising fastest. So Amazon has really branched out from being just a book and media merchandiser to being Walmart on the internet. And don’t forget the Kindle [e-book] which has been enormously successful – I’ve seen people reading Kindles on public transport everywhere from the Moscow metro to New York.” Pearson: “The other important thing is that, a year ago, we were talking about people buying online to save money in the recession, but in fact I think there’s a long-term shift on the way people are shopping. Amazon is also constantly innovating, so last year it was Amazon Prime, in which you pay once a year and get free delivery. Now it is allowing individuals to sell their products online without charging a fee, and that is a direct challenge to Ebay.” Walshe: Best Buy [just outside the Top 10] is also doing well, it has benefited from the closure of some of its rivals.Soft drinksPearson: “There is still the theme that diet and light brands are doing better than staple products – we see that in Diet Pepsi. Although Diet Coke is down, there has been a big rise in Coke Zero’s brand value.” Seddon: “Coke Zero has been the most successful launch that Coca-Cola has had in 22 years – it’s ‘bloke Coke’.” Pepsi’s fall is for financial reasons although the brand contribution is relatively stable, while Gatorade’s brand contribution increased significantly, offsetting the slightly negative financial results. This brand is outside the Top 100.SpiritsPearson: “This is terribly unexciting, not much has happened at all. It has been a tough year in general for spirits brands, it is a difficult category to innovate in because it’s all about flavours and bottles and packaging.”TechnologyThis is one of the biggest categories, with huge variations in performance across the top 20. The three biggest risers, Samsung, Baidu and Hewlett-Packard, are covered in the Risers and Fallers article. Then come Apple and IBM with a 32 and 30 per cent rise respectively. Walshe: “All the brands in the Top 100 are either extremely trusted or highly recommended by their users, and a lot of them are both. Both companies’ brand values have risen by about $20bn, so they are the top actual value growers in the rankings. IBM is driven hugely by trust whereas for Apple it is recommendation.”Seddon: “IBM has done has done a very, very good job of buying up software companies. Whenever it sees there’s a need in the marketplace it finds a software company that’s doing it and then pumps it through its brand marketing machine with fabulous branding, fabulous marketing and that’s what you get. So, it’s very much a branded story, it was “e-business” now it’s “a smarter planet”. It’s a company that was turned around by Lou Gerstner, very much on the idea of brand. It’s also a global brand with global executions, it shows you the power that you can get from leveraging one brand globally across the world.” Seddon: “BlackBerry has been one of our enormous growers and over the past five years its brand value has more than doubled, but that has slowed off. It’s a great device and it’s become a great brand, but does it have as strong an emotional connection with the users as, say, Apple’s iPhone? Maybe not. It’s marketed more as a device than as an enabler of your life. And the growth of the iPhone has probably stopped BlackBerry growing as fast as it could, because consumers want the exciting apps [that the iPhone offers]. Seddon: “Another interesting one is Oracle. Oracle has bought Sun but its brand value doesn’t include Sun because it has not rebranded Sun, so they are separate. Oracle is famously aggressive, is ruthlessly controlled from the top, global and it’s in both business productivity, software as well as in databases. Oracle is also interesting because it comes back to one of our themes this year, the brand that is driven by the chief executive. SAP is Oracle’s biggest competitor, and since SAP’s founder retired it has been losing market share to Oracle.”Three of the four worst-performing brands in this year’s Top 100, Nokia, Intel and Siemens, are in this category and are covered in the Risers and Fallers article. Another poor performer this year was Dell, down 24 places at 66th after a 23 per cent fall in brand value. Seddon: “Dell was the biggest, number one in PC market share, but HP has come back from the dead and taken over that position. Also, Dell has traditionally only sold direct and there is a fundamental love that people have for wanting to twiddle with technology before they buy. [If you sell direct and focus on low prices], it’s not a sustainable positioning because the Chinese brands, the Acers of this world, will come out and underprice you. So, I think there’s a brand building story under way, hopefully.”Finally, scraping in at No. 20 in the Technology Top 10, but not yet in the Top 100, is Facebook, with brand value of $5.5bn. Walshe: “A few years ago Facebook would have been in the Top 100 with a value at that level.” Pearson: “The structure has changed because Facebook’s users were young people, originally, but there was a shift last year and older people and businesses are on it now. That is what happened with Twitter, too.”

561;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-04-22T00:56:45Z;Autonomy relishes recovery prospects;;"Autonomy, the UK’s largest software company by market value, said it had seen a strong start to the year as companies resumed discretionary spending on IT projects.“I see a definite recovery, although I suspect it is fragile,” said Mike Lynch, chief executive.Sales in the first quarter rose 50 per cent to $194.2m (£126m), as the Cambridge-based company signed more deals above $1m – 19 compared with just 10 in the same quarter of last year. Autonomy’s $775m acquisition a year ago of Interwoven, the legal software specialist, also lifted sales.The IT group is hoping the second quarter will be boosted by banks buying search technology following news that the SEC is suing Goldman Sachs for fraud.Autonomy’s software allows companies to search through unstructured information such as e-mails, voice calls and word processing documents, and is already used by many banks to ensure that they comply with regulations.In the past few weeks, however, there has been a sharp rise in demand for a “quick-fix” search product, a box that can instantly be plugged into a bank’s computer system to check through files.Autonomy bought $10m of hardware for the box product in the first quarter, about three times normal levels. Pre-tax profits rose from $50m to $68.8m, while earnings per share rose from 15 cents to 21 cents.A further sign of confidence is that Autonomy is looking to poach sales staff from its rival Oracle to sell its new product for searching structured databases.Mr Lynch said discussions were continuing on a large acquisition in the second half of the year. Auto­nomy has a war chest of $910.9m, after it raised £500m in a convertible bond issue in February. Analysts believe the company could buy a business worth up to $2bn, possibly in the business intelligence or web content management area.Shares in Autonomy, which have risen over 40 per cent in the past year, were up 1p at £17.82.● FT CommentAutonomy is a “marmite” stock, which polarises investor opinion. On Wednesday, it was in trouble with the bulls for promising “jam tomorrow” – a disappointing second-quarter revenue guidance of $217m-$222m compared with a consensus of about $225m – but a promise of a stronger second half. Quibbling over the numbers is irrelevant, however, given that Autonomy is poised for a possibly game-changing acquisition. The bulls will applaud a deal for increasing size and reach; the bears will decry it for muddying the waters on underlying growth. At about 21 times earnings estimates for 2010, the shares are higher than the European Software Group at 18.5 times, but acquisitions historically cause them to rise and could do again."
562;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;The cutting edge of enterprise stays sharp;;"Out of darkness comes hope. The list of winners of the annual Queen’s Awards for Enterprise demonstrates that, as we emerge from the toughest recession for at least 40 years, the UK has an impressive range of businesses that continue to devise cutting-edge products and services and sell them all over the world.The 2010 list, published today to mark the Queen’s birthday, contains 143 business awards, mixing FTSE companies with subsidiaries of foreign-owned groups and private businesses. The core of it, though, remains the dozens of often unsung smaller companies for which the awards provide important recognition.The innovation and drive of all the winners – and many more – will determine whether the UK really can achieve a much-desired, export-led economic recovery.The UK’s acknowledged strengths, including medical and pharmaceutical technology, aerospace and defence, oil and gas, engineering design, consultancy and project management are well represented.Other winning businesses range from shortbread to folding bicycles, maternity wear, translation, online book retailing and television drama. The FA Premier League is recognised for creating a football phenomenon that up to 2.7bn people around the world can watch on television.As in recent years, the company awards are given for achievement in three categories: international trade, where there are 95 winners out of 565 applicants; innovation, with 38 awards from 414 applications; and sustainable development, with 10 from 190 applications. There are also awards to 11 individuals, including a lifetime achievement award for Doug Scott, chief executive of Tedco, a not-for-profit enterprise agency in Tyneside.Autonomy, the FTSE 100 company founded in 1996 that has built a global enterprise software business out of pattern-recognition algorithms based on work by Thomas Bayes, an 18th century mathematician, wins in the trade category for the first time. Software providers such as Oracle, Hewlett-Packard and Adobe embed its technology within their own.Also among FTSE 100 winners are two subsidiaries of Cobham, the defence and aerospace group: Chelton, which makes antennas, and Domo, which wins an innovation award for wireless digital audio and video link technology that improves safety for bomb disposal teams and others.Pearson, the educational and media group that owns the Financial Times, receives an international trade award. It is the largest winner in terms of employment, with nearly 7,000 UK-based staff.Trade winners from the FTSE 250 include Pace, the digital television technology developer, and Schrader Electronics, a Tomkins subsidiary that makes tyre pressure monitoring systems, based in Antrim, Northern Ireland. Malvern Instruments, a subsidiary of Spectris, wins an innovation award for instruments that measure particles in fluids.Other large or well-known export winners include: Baillie Gifford Overseas, the international arm of the Edinburgh-based investment manager; BupaInternational, the healthcare company;Scott Wilson Group, the infrastructure design and engineering consultancy; and Walkers Shortbread, the family-run Scottish company. Brompton Bicycle wins both trade and innovation awards.At the small end, Innis & Gunn, a five-year-old Scottish brewer of oak-aged speciality beers, has just three employees, as does Vectric, a Worcestershire-based company that develops software for machines in craft industries such as woodcarving, signmaking and engraving. Both are recognised in the trade category.One of the oldest trade winners is Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon, a maker of hydro electric turbines and engine cooling pumps based in Kendal, Cumbria, which started trading in 1853. Winn & Coales International, a specialist in corrosion prevention and sealing technology, was established in 1883.Foreign-owned groups are well represented, including the radar and advanced targeting unit of Selex Galileo, part of Italy’s Finmeccanica defence group, which wins a trade award. So do Baring Asset Management, owned by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance of the US; ContiTech Beattie, a maker of hoses and couplings for the oil and gas industry owned by Germany’s Continental; Sandvik Osprey, a manufacturer of fine metal powders that is part of Sweden’s Sandvik; and Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks, part of the French communications group.Manufacturing is represented by a broad range of companies, raising the hopes of those who would like to see a rebalancing of the economy, with less financial services and more industry, especially now that manufacturing is starting to recover from a ferocious downturn.But the list also includes winners from the fields of culture, services and the new economy. Applied Language Solutions, a Greater Manchester-based translation and interpreting company, was founded seven years ago in a back bedroom by Gavin Wheeldon, chief executive, now 33. Now it has a turnover approaching £7.5m, 120 employees and customers in 91 countries. It wins a trade award.Other export awards go to Powercorp International, an independent producer of television dramas including The Devil’s Whore and The Day of the Triffids, along with The Book Depository, which aims to make more titles available through the book supply chain than any other online bookseller in the world, and First Magazine, a publishing and events company that aims to enhance communication between leaders in industry, finance and government.Future Health Technologies, which pioneered the collection and storage of stem cells from umbilical cords, wins a trade award and hopes the market will now expand in the UK, which is behind other countries.Among winners in the innovation category is Concateno, a drug and alcohol test provider, which has developed a mobile detector for roadside drug testing. Ultravision is recognised for its soft contact lenses for people with irregularly shaped corneas, while Salamander has developed software to make military campaigns better co-ordinated – “saving British lives and British money”, it says.Yorkshire’s Joseph Rhodes is recognised for being world leader in super plastic forming presses, joining titanium and aluminium alloys into strong, light shapes for aerospace, and Makevale for its lightweight polymers with uses from dentures to submarine cockpits.Sometimes new technology can assist traditional purposes. Garford Farm Machinery, from Lincolnshire, has developed the Robocrop InRow Weeder, which uses an advanced vision guidance system to weed up to 15 rows of lettuces or brassicas simultaneously.This year’s 143 business awards is below last year’s record 194, the largest in 44 years of the scheme, but higher than the previous two years. The 1,169 applications received this year was above last year’s 1,078 and well ahead of the 683 in 2007."

565;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:29:44+0000;Sticks and stones;The saving grace of hostile bids is the name-calling;While it is true that a majority of takeovers add no value for shareholders – at least those of the buyer – they have a saving grace. They add to the gaiety of nations.Corporate life is conducted publicly in a suffocating atmosphere of politeness. Only in the heat of a bid can bosses let their hair down and fire off some childish insults.As with other areas of human activity, cultural differences loom large. Take a recent riposte to a hostile, and rejected, bid by US miner Peabody for an Australian rival, Macarthur. In an almost lyrical passage, a rival suitor, Noble, likened the target’s rejection to that of a “hungry hiker who stumbles upon a roadkill roo that had been in the sun too long, and not surprisingly [says] no thanks”.You rarely hear this sort of thing when foreigners come bidding in the UK. The best Cadbury’s chairman, Roger Carr, could come up with during the recent bid from Kraft was that the bidder was a “low-growth conglomerate”. Ooh – handbags at dawn!The US and Ireland both have a fondness for Anglo-Saxon plain-speaking. When Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus in 2008, its boss Michael O’Leary was likened to Osama bin Laden. In turn he compared the Irish carrier to Shamrock Rovers, a struggling football team. PeopleSoft boss Craig Conway likened Oracle’s Larry Ellison to Genghis Khan when the US software giant made a bid. Not a good career move. Oracle won and Mr Conway was fired. Even in Europe, the gloves occasionally come off – if not always with happy results. In 2006, when Germany’s MAN bid for Swedish truckmaker Scania, the latter’s boss Leif Ostling compared himself to Winston Churchill defending Britain from the Nazis. He later apologised.Globalisation opens the door to new variants of the bid insult. Perhaps in the future, a Chinese chief executive will refer to an antagonist as a “criminal of a 1,000 generations” or “tango dancer”, insults once thrown at Hong Kong governor Chris Patten. Bring it on.
566;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-04-09T04:15:34Z;Misys benefits from US healthcare reform;;The passage of the US healthcare reform bill last month, combined with the Obama administration’s $19bn (£12.5bn) stimulus package, is boosting revenue at Misys, which is gearing up to sell software for electronic patient records to US doctors’ surgeries.“We’ve seen a big uptick in the last quarter,” Mike Lawrie, chief executive, said on Thursday. “The passage of the bill has lifted the uncertainty in the market. The US healthcare business is the best industry to be in right now.”Misys owns 57 per cent of Allscripts, the US healthcare software company, and is expected to be a big beneficiary of the stimulus package, part of which is earmarked for helping doctors to modernise their patient record systems. Stimulus payments are due to start being made in 2011, and this is encouraging physicians to start adopting new software now, Mr Lawrie said.In January, for example, Catholic Health Initiatives, a US nationwide healthcare provider, selected the company’s electronic health record for the 1,000 doctors it employs, contributing an estimated $5m to revenue.The growth of the healthcare business is helping to offset declines in Misys’s banking division, which has been struggling to upgrade its software and win clients.Revenue at the Allscripts healthcare business was up 16 per cent in the third quarter to the end of February, helping lift overall turnover at the company 7 per cent on a constant currencies basis to £192m.Revenue in the banking business slipped 12 per cent in the quarter as the company continued to lose ground to aggressive competitors such as Oracle, Temenos and Infosys. However, Mr Lawrie is hopeful the company will win customers with BankFusion, its new banking software platform.Mr Lawrie aims to have 250 banks using BankFusion within five years, adding £250m to banking revenue. However, the technology has had a slow start. Nine banks have signed up to buy BankFusion, of which just two are live.“This is something that will start slowly but quickly ramp up,” Mr Lawrie said.In spite of the disparity in performance between the healthcare and banking businesses, Mr Lawrie declined to comment on speculation the two divisions could be separated. Many analysts have suggested this would be a way to unlock more value for shareholders.The shares rose 1.4p to 243.5p.
567;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-04-07T19:30:23Z;Global computer server sales see rare boom;;The global computer-server industry is witnessing a once-in-decade sweet spot of sales growth, boosted by a rare alignment of economic recovery, big technological advances and soaring data-handling needs.Servers, the heart of computer networks, are seldom regarded as the racy end of the information technology sector. But after a difficult 2009, server manufacturers are suddenly seeing strong growth with customers reinvesting in ageing IT infrastructures as recessionary conditions recede.JPMorgan analysts recently more than doubled their estimates for server revenue growth in 2010 from 6.2 per cent to 14.3 per cent – “a unique phenomenon in IT hardware”.IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Oracle, as well as processor makers Intel and AMD, have all rushed to bring out a range of server products.Part of the turnround is being driven by pent-up demand after a 2009 in which worldwide server revenue declined 18.9 per cent to $43.2bn, according to research firm IDC. Businesses had deferred purchases of servers during the economic down times to save costs, extending the replacement cycle for products that tend to have a working lifespan of about five years.But analysts also point to financial incentives to upgrade, saying the newest generation of servers can pay for themselves in a few months amid reduced costs of power and cooling. This is in spite of higher price tags for many of the new products.One example is the development of processors for servers, which have advanced in recent years from a single core or “brain” doing the work to multiple cores being squeezed on to chips. High-end eight-core processors introduced by Intel last week can be deployed in a single server that replaces 20 older single-core servers and achieves the same performance. Intel claims this reduces energy costs by more than 90 per cent.AMD, Intel’s smaller rival, also introduced eight- and 12-core processors last week.In addition, server upgrades are being driven by more data-intensive applications and an explosion in cloud computing where services and data are stored and served from remote data centres.“This next wave is the biggest one of all, and highly dis­ruptive,” says Howard Elias, head of cloud services at EMC, the data storage equipment company. “We’re talking about a change in the way IT infrastructure is operated, produced and consumed.”Matt Eastwood of IDC’s enterprise server group said there could be a shake-out in the industry. “Optimal conditions for market inflection occur only once a decade and IDC believes that market shares could shift dramatically as the winners and losers of this new market cycle are determined,” he said.Additional reporting by David Gelles
568;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-04-07T19:30:23Z;Servers soaring as recession thaws;;At Intel’s launch of its newest processors in San Francisco last week, Jean Gonnord of France’s atomic energy commission gave a thank-you speech to the chipmaker.The programme director for numerical simulation at the Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique (CEA) told the audience he appreciated the on-time delivery of his order for 18,000 of the chipmaker’s new Xeon 7500 8-core chips.Priced at more than $2,500 (€1,877, £1,642) each, perhaps Intel should have been thanking him.The order is destined for just one supercomputer – among the world’s five fastest – which will run checks on France’s nuclear arsenal. The order might be exceptional in size, but it is typical of the major upgrades taking place in servers and high-performance computing (HPC) this year.The “refresh cycle” is good news for chipmakers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and for server vendors, who are led in terms of sales by IBM, followed by Hewlett Packard, Dell and Oracle.A once-in-a-decade market inflection took place in the fourth quarter of 2009 as business shook off the effects of the recession, according to IDC, the research firm.Although full-year server revenues for 2009 were down nearly 20 per cent on 2008, the rot stopped late in the year as companies re-evaluated their needs for server upgrades.“There have been a lot of deferrals of orders that should have gone through in 2009, so to that extent there is pent-up demand,” says Jean Bozman, IDC server analyst.“Also, the bigger, older servers …some have been held onto for a very long time and technology has gotten so much better.”About 40 per cent of the installed base of higher-end servers are still running single-core processors and, according to Gartner, the research firm, more than 1m server upgrades were delayed by the downturn.Switching to energy-efficient multi-core servers can dramatically cut the amount of power, space and cooling needed for them in data centres, meaning they can pay for themselves in less than a year.“You can get your money back in five months and in seven months you’re making money,” says Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel’s data centre group. “It’s a cash machine for IT [departments].”Some of this surplus is going into new projects, which in turn require new equipment, according to Steve Schuckenbrock, Dell’s head of large business deals. “We’re going to see this run for a long time,” he said.Intel’s smaller rival AMD launched its own line-up of high-end server processors – the Opteron 6000 series – the day before Intel and claims it offers similar performance but better value in different segments of the server market.“Just because people are having to go through a refresh because they’ve got to end-of-life on their servers or they’re no longer supported on their warranty, that doesn’t mean they’re going to rush out and buy the most expensive servers,” says John Fruehe, head of server marketing at AMD.Both chipmakers and server manufacturers have timed their new offerings to perfection, says Jim Ganthier, vice-president of marketing for Hewlett Packard’s industry standard servers division.“We’re seeing a perfect convergence of new products coming along at just the right time and we are able to deliver radical [returns on investment] to our customers.”He says the work of 20 old servers can now be done on just one new HP ProLiant server and buyers can see a return on investment in about two months.As well as more powerful hardware, consolidation of servers is being further enhanced by virtualisation software. This allows servers to be split into many virtual machines and pooled with others to allow greater task-sharing.Other factors driving server sales include the growth of cloud computing, where web services and applications are delivered from data centres and the need for business information to be served in real-time.JPMorgan analysts expect server revenues to grow in 2010 at a higher rate than other segments such as PCs, printers and storage.The new processors will drive more than profits as they help scientists better predict natural disasters, explore the universe and tackle major diseases.“We’re going to transform scientific discovery at a rate and pace never before seen on earth,” says Mr Skaugen.Additional reporting by Joseph Menn

570;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-04-06T23:51:26Z;Has IBM just gone back on a landmark open source pledge?;;IBM’s promise five years ago to release 500 of its patents to the open source world was a milestone in Big Blue’s support for community-developed software.So the news that it now plans to assert its legal rights in the case of at least two of those patents could mark an unfortunate watershed. And, to borrow an accusation often directed at arch-rival Microsoft, it is certain to sow FUD in open source circles.The apparent inconsistency has been unearthed by European open source advocate Florian Mueller, who recently led the quixotic and ultimately unsuccessful effort to persuade Brussels to prevent Oracle from assuming control of MySQL when it bought Sun.Mr Mueller’s blog has the details of a threatening IBM letter to TurboHercules, a company whose business is based on the open source Hercules project. Hercules is a mainframe emulator, a layer of software that sits on top of IBM’s mainframe hardware and makes it possible for users to run non-IBM software. So it’s no surprise IBM is not a fan.In the letter, the computing giant lists no fewer than 173 patents that IBM either already owns or has applied for, and which it says TurboHercules may have infringed.Two of those are among the 500 it released to the open source world.This makes it look very much as though, when it comes to open source products that threaten to tread on IBM’s own toes, the company’s high-minded 2005 pledge isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.In a statement on Tuesday, IBM says it has “serious doubts” about whether TurboHercules qualifies under the terms of the pledge, adding:TurboHercules is a member of organisations founded and funded by IBM competitors such as Microsoft to attack the mainframe. We have doubts about TurboHercules’ motivations.The pledge, though, was irrevocable, with only one exception:IBM reserves the right to terminate this patent pledge and commitment only with regard to any party who files a lawsuit asserting patents or other intellectual property rights against Open Source Software.Even under a very generous reading of the case, IBM is stretching the definition considerably to defend its turf. There’s a clear message there for any other open source company rash enough to try to take on Big Blue with its own weapons.
571;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-03-31T21:52:27Z;Atos creates smart energy business;Move to help offset decline in big IT upgrade projects;Atos Origin on Wednesdsay announced it would create a new subsidiary company to provide IT services to the growing market for smart energy meters.The business, called Atos WorldGrid, will have 1,000 engineers and initial revenues of €150m ($203m), growing to €300m by 2014. France’s second-largest IT services company said it would consider acquisitions to help grow the WorldGrid business faster. However, it gave no indication of when the offshoot, to be set up by June, was likely to reach profitability.Atos is the latest IT service company to seek new business opportunities in the energy market and the installation of smart meters, as traditional IT service work declines.A number of European countries are seeking to reduce their energy usage by installing technology in people’s homes that analyses and monitors how much gas, electricity and water they are using from moment to moment. This will help utility companies plan for demand across the network. If customers install their own solar or wind power generators, the electricity grid needs to be upgraded so it can calculate how much power these devices are adding.The European market for smart grid products and services is expected to be worth $11bn by 2015, according to analysts at Frost and Sullivan, the research group.Italy has already installed about 32m smart electricity meters in the country, and Sweden has rolled out more than 870,000 meters to date. Denmark, Finland, Ireland, France and Spain are also planning nationwide roll-outs within the next few years.The new electricity grids require complex software and computer systems to run. IT services companies are hoping that providing some of these systems could help offset the decline of their traditional business of overseeing big computer upgrades at companies. During the recession private companies were reluctant to undertake large technology projects, and the market is still difficult. Atos Origin saw revenues fall from €5.6bn in 2008 to €5.1bn last year.Last month, Capgemini, Atos’ main French rival, also established a service division focused on smart energy technology. Logica, the UK IT services business, has also highlighted smart metering as a focus area. SAP and Oracle, the database companies, have been battling to win utility company customers over the past year.Atos Origin is hoping to leverage its experience in providing control systems to France’s 58 nuclear reactors into a more widescale, global energy business.Creation of the new subsidiary is part of a restructuring of the Atos business undertaken by Thierry Breton, the former French finance minister, who took over as chief executive in 2008.
572;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-03-31T16:55:25Z;Intec Telecom shares dive on profit warning;;Analysts said Intec Telecom Systems could be vulnerable to a takeover bid after the telecommunications billing software group issued a profit warning that wiped almost 40 per cent off the value of its shares.The group blamed aggressive price competition in emerging markets, particularly from Subex, an Indian-based competitor, for missing first-half revenue forecasts by 10-15 per cent.“Should the current trend continue, it is possible that the full-year revenues could be similarly impacted,” Intec said.Some analysts on Wednesday questioned the guidance given six weeks ago by the management team of Andrew Taylor, chief executive, and Robin Taylor, finance director.“We had the impression that there was less than £5m of revenue at risk in the first half, so we are a little surprised at the scale of this,” said David Toms, an analyst at Numis Securities. “We suspect it will take some time to rebuild investor confidence.”The duo had spent 18 months patching up investor faith in Intec after it was beset by profit warnings four years ago, taking shares to a nine-year high as it won contracts around the world from customers such as AT&T, Cable and Wireless, France Telecom and Verizon.Wednesday’s warning pushed the shares down 35p, or 37 per cent, to 59½p.RBS, the group’s broker, said the shortfall implied that revenue for the six months to March 30 fell from £80.3m a year ago to £69m, while underlying full-year profit would be about £16.1m compared with £29.3m last year.Ian Spence, an analyst at IS Research, pointed out that emerging markets had been a major part of Intec’s growth strategy as European and North American sectors matured.“Is it as much of an opportunity as we thought? That’s the big question now for them,” Mr Spence said.Intec spent five months in 2008 rebuffing an approach from an unidentified third-party.General Atlantic, the group’s largest shareholder, was understood to be holding out for more than 65p a share when Intec was valued at 50p a share.Mr Spence said that Intec had been linked with a bid from US business software groups Oracle and Convergys Corporation.“Intec is always on people’s screens and this will flag it up again,” he said.Intec said that there had been further deferrals on several contracts from customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions.It said it planned to further cut costs and hire sales staff.
573;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-03-31T04:43:55Z;Intel and AMD serve up multi-core contest;;Servers, whether the tall wardrobe type or those pizza-box slices of hardware that slide into racks in data centre ovens, seem suddenly almost sexy.We have had lavish beauty-contest launches from AMD and Intel on Monday and Tuesday of new high-performance server chips at San Francisco’s De Young Museum and the old Federal Reserve building respectively.Sashaying down the microcircuitry catwalk, Intel’s Xeon 7500s and AMD’s Opteron 6000s won admiring testimonials from data-crunching executives for their lean energy needs and powerful performance, giving them the ability to pay for themselves in savings on electricity and licensing costs in a matter of months.HP, Dell, Cray, SGI and Acer – a new AMD vendor – are among those introducing new systems based on the 6000s, which are either eight or 12-core processors.HP, Dell, Cray, SGI, IBM, Oracle and many other vendors have announced systems based on the 7500s, which have up to eight cores.AMD says it is delivering more cores – or processing brains – and more memory for less money. Intel says data centres can replace 20 single-core servers with a single 7500 system. The 7500s follow the launch of 5600 chips for the “volume server” market two weeks ago.“Intel typically has done really well in multiprocessor [systems], in government and done fairly well in high-performance computing. AMD typically does really well in the price/performance area,” says Jim Ganthier, head of marketing for HP’s Industry Standard Servers, which feature both processors.Intel has more than 80 per cent market share in servers, but the pie seems about to get bigger this year with a once-in-a-decade “inflection point”, according to the research firm IDC, where customers are re-evaluating their needs and upgrading their infrastructures.An increase in data to be managed, the growth of cloud computing, the need for real-time business information and the compelling benefits of virtualisation technology – where one server can be split into many virtual machines – are among the factors prompting the refreshing of equipment.The most alluring argument for an upgrade is the cost savings, with HP claiming outlays on new equipment can be recovered in less than a quarter.“When our CIOs [chief information officers] go and have conversations with their CFOs [chief financial officers], they can promise them a two-month ROI [Return On Investment] . These are radical savings that we’re delivering to our customers,” says Mr Ganthier.
574;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-03-26T05:00:18Z;FTC turns to old rule in antitrust quest;;The Federal Trade Commission, the competition and consumer protection watchdog, is on a mission to push the boundaries of US antitrust laws. To accomplish that goal, it has resurrected the use of a legal authority that has been rarely touched since the late 1970s – one that gives the agency the unique power to pursue companies for “unfair methods of competition”.Some antitrust lawyers say the FTC is flexing its muscle on competition policy far beyond established legal precedent, especially in its groundbreaking case against Intel, which it accuses of illegally stifling competition in the US chip market. They fear the FTC is circumventing Supreme Court precedent and risks reining in practices that help, not hurt, competition.In the antitrust community, it is almost universally recognised that the force behind this transformation comes from an unlikely source: Thomas Rosch, a Republican FTC commissioner. Mr Rosch defended companies against antitrust litigation for 40 years as a stalwart believer of the Chicago school of economics. Today, he tells the FT, he has had a change of heart about the role of regulation and is out to make the FTC a force to be reckoned with.“My friends and colleagues expected that I would continue to be a defence attorney when I came to the commission,” says Mr Rosch. “My view is that you shouldn’t take a position like this unless you open your mind and try to look at things in a different way.”But Mr Rosch has done more than open his mind since he was appointed to the FTC in 2006 by George W. Bush, shortly after he helped Oracle defeat the Bush administration’s only significant merger challenge – to its tie-up with PeopleSoft.In a paper entitled “The Redemption of a Republican”, which he published in 2009, he said that the orthodox Chicago School of Economics was “on life support, if not dead”. In the wake of the financial crisis, he took issue, too, with the notions that “markets are mostly perfect, that, if imperfect, they will correct themselves quickly, and that business people are rational and will eschew predatory conduct”.One antitrust attorney says the Republican is the “source of intellectual energy” at the FTC. He was instrumental in the FTC’s decision to challenge Whole Foods’ takeover of Wild Oats. In that case, the FTC won an appeals court ruling that set a legal precedent that many lawyers believe gives the FTC – unlike the Department of Justice’s antitrust division – unique power to seek preliminary injunctions against companies wanting to merge.“He thinks like a litigator and tries to put his client in the strongest position possible,” says James Rill, a veteran antitrust attorney. “He take positions that will strengthen the FTC to the fullest extent possible.”Jon Leibowitz, the FTC’s Democratic chairman, says Mr Rosch is the “living embodiment of Teddy Roosevelt”.“The conservatives in the antitrust bar think we are pushing the envelope. In fact there is broad consensus at FTC to find practical solutions to real problems. And Tom is part of that consensus,” Mr Leibowitz says.Attorneys who deal with the FTC say they believe Mr Rosch’s influence reflects his close relationship with Mr Leibowitz. They speculate that Mr Leibowitz, who rose through the ranks on Capitol Hill trusts Mr Rosch for his longtime experience as a litigator. They say that while Mr Leibowitz has advocated tougher antitrust policies, it is his Republican colleague who has been instrumental in providing the legal rationale for the FTC to pursue an aggressive agenda.But the FTC’s strategy carries risks. The agency faced stinging legal setbacks in the 1980s after the courts rejected attempts to use what is referred in legal circles as “Section 5 authority” to prosecute unfair competition. The FTC’s case against Intel, its first big use of Section 5 authority since the 1970s, is expected to go to trial in September, marking an important test for the agency. Mr Rosch is not a stranger to risk, however. He says he reminds the FTC’s attorneys that they are up against the best corporate lawyers in the country.
575;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-03-25T23:57:14Z;Oracle boosted by new licence sales;;Oracle said on Thursday it had seen a rebound in a key measure of new software licence sales, reinforcing Wall Street’s hopes that a broader rebound in the technology sector had picked up steam in the early months of this year.At the same time, Larry Ellison, chief executive of the US software company, stepped up his war of words with German rival SAP, which recently replaced its own CEO. “We think SAP is vulnerable,” Mr Ellison said, adding that he believed Oracle now had a chance to overtake SAP in business applications software.SAP countered by casting doubt on a long-delayed upgrade of Oracle’s business application software, known as Project Fusion, which Oracle says is due finally to hit the market this year. “Fusion, if it ever comes to market, will force customers to do massive upgrades, which is as Oracle points out a completely different strategy than SAP’s,” the German company said.Oracle’s latest quarterly numbers were broadly in line with Wall Street’s official earnings expectations but failed to meet more optimistic, unofficial hopes. The optimism had driven the company’s stock price to a nine-year high earlier in the day, and the shares fell back slightly in after-market trading.Overall earnings fell from a year before as losses from Sun Microsystems, which Oracle acquired in January, dented its performance. Its net income dropped 10 per cent to $1.2bn, or 23 cents per share, while revenues rose 17 per cent to $6.4bn. Excluding the effects of currency swings, revenues rose 12 per cent.Underpinning the company’s latest numbers were new licence sales of $1.7bn, a rise of 5 per cent excluding the effects of currency swings and the Sun acquisition. That was the strongest growth it had seen in seven quarters. While most of Oracle’s revenues come from annual maintenance fees paid by existing users, licence sales are an indicator of new demand from customers that cut back on technology spending during the recession.Sales of new application software licences, a business in which SAP is the leader, increased by 21 per cent to $477m.Compared with the decline reported recently by SAP, the figures showed that Oracle was continuing to eat into the German company’s market share, Mr Ellison said.Oracle’s latest figures, for the third quarter of its fiscal year ending in February, included one month of Sun’s figures. At $596m, Oracle executives claimed that Sun’s hardware sales had performed better than expected.They reiterated earlier forecasts about a turnround in the struggling business’s performance.Excluding goodwill amortisation, stock-based compensation expenses and the Sun losses – the basis on which Wall Street assesses the company’s performance – Oracle reported earnings of 38 cents a share. That was broadly in line with consensus expectations, and was up from 35 cents a year before.

579;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-03-02T23:28:20Z;SAP vows return to double-digit sales growth;;Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s new co-chief executives, promised on Tuesday that there would be a new culture of “fun” and “trust” at the embattled German software company.In their first public appearance after last month’s surprise announcement of their appointments, Mr McDermott and Mr Snabe pledged to return the German software company to double-digit sales growth by 2012 and to restructure the company to make it more innovative and entrepreneurial.SAP’s core software sales fell 16 per cent during the downturn and Leo Apotheker, its former chief executive, left after one year in the job. The company, which competes with Oracle and Salesforce.com, has been criticised for falling behind on new IT trends such as cloud computing.Speaking at the CeBIT IT trade show in Hanover, Mr McDermott and Mr Snabe said a key strategy would be reorganising the company’s more than 12,000 engineers into small entrepreneurial teams of 10 or so people, with more contact with customers and more control over their own projects.Mr Snabe believes this will enable the company to innovate more quickly and efficiently.He said: “We want to transform SAP into a lean organisation, doing more with fewer people. We want to unleash the creativity of our engineers.”He estimated that the company could make a 30 per cent efficiency gain through the new structure, allowing SAP to keep research and its development consulting costs flat while accelerating the pace at which it brings out products.He promised that SAP’s much delayed new software-as-a-service offering, BusinessByDesign, would start being shipped to the mass market in July. This is part of SAP’s effort to address the small and medium enterprise market better.Mr McDermott said that SAP was also open to making more large acquisitions and “would not hesitate” if the right opportunity came up. SAP has not traditionally made big acquisitions, but bought Business Objects for €4.8bn in 2007.Some industry observers suggest, however, that SAP could itself become a take­over target following its recent weak performance. Microsoft, for example, is understood to have considered buying the company in the past.Mr McDermott reiterated SAP’s targets for 4 to 8 per cent core software sales growth in 2010, and a 30 to 31 per cent operating margin. In the medium term he said the margin would reach 35 per cent.The toughest challenge for Mr McDermott and Mr Snabe will be overseeing a cultural change at a demoralised company. As the first foreign chief executives of the German company, this job is particularly tricky.They say they would like to adopt a highly approachable management style, in contrast to the more hierarchichal structure that they said existed under Mr Apotheker.Mr Snabe is Danish and the former head of product development. Mr McDermott was previously the head of field operations.Both insist that Hasso Plattner, SAP’s co-founder who stepped back in to the company during the crisis, will give them plenty of leeway in the day-to-day running of the business.“I believe that Hasso is the most brilliant mind in technology and he will play a role as a technology advisor,” said Mr McDermott. “But Jim and I run the company, and that is how Hasso and the board want it.”“We used to present complex solutions, tackling the most complicated problems in 25 industries. Now we are trying to give more of a citizen’s point of view and talking about how SAP is relevant to what is happening in your kitchen.”

581;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-14T21:06:43Z;US trimaran wins back America’s Cup;;Larry Ellison’s high-tech boat USA 17, boasting a revolutionary vertical wing instead of a mainsail, outpaced Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi on Sunday to win the 33rd staging of the America’s Cup – the oldest active trophy in international sport.A bitter, three-year legal battle between the two billionaires – Mr Ellison founded the software group Oracle and Mr Bertarelli is a Swiss biotechnology tycoon – made the event off Valencia in Spain seem more like a private battle over money and technology than the colourful sailing competitions of previous years.Mr Ellison’s trimaran – a lightweight, three-hulled vessel – outperformed the twin-hulled catamaran Alinghi to win races in light but chilly Mediterranean breezes on Friday and Sunday to take the best-of-three series.“I couldn’t be more proud,” Mr Ellison said. “It’s an absolutely awesome feeling.”Both vessels are made of carbon composite and have sophisticated electronic navigation and racing aids, as well as fibre-optic stress monitoring systems embedded in the structure to measure strains on the hulls, masts and cross-beams.Their huge rigs (USA’s wing sail is as high as a 20-storey building and bigger than the wing of an Airbus A380 jet) “leverage” the available wind to produce high speeds. At times on Sunday, USA was travelling across the wind at more than 30 knots in just 8 knots of true wind.Subject to any legal challenges, the trophy first contested in 1851 between the yacht America and British rivals in a race around the Isle of Wight will now be returned to the US for the first time since 1995.Alinghi – technically, the Société Nautique de Génève, since the competition is between yacht clubs, not boats or individuals – had held the cup since beating Team New Zealand in 2003. Now it will go to the Golden Gate Yacht Club in San Francisco.In 2007 Valencia hosted a close-fought regatta for the Alinghi defence involving a dozen nearly identical yachts from different countries. The region benefited from billions of dollars of investment and spending, while luxury goods companies and other sponsors entertained their guests on super-yachts on balmy summer evenings.This time the feud between Mr Ellison and Mr Bertarelli left other competitors without any chance of participating. Although both teams said they regretted that, they also relished the chance to build ultra-fast boats with no regard for expense or for any agreed rules on what shape or weight they should be.The only limitation, set out in a 19th century America’s Cup document known as the Deed of Gift, was that the maximum length on the waterline should be 90ft.
582;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-12T23:26:34Z;Ellison’s USA wins first America’s Cup race;;Larry Ellison’s boat USA won a convincing victory on Friday over Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi in the first race of the 2010 America’s Cup off Valencia, Spain.One more win in the best-of-three series would allow Mr Ellison’s BMW Oracle team to secure the cup from Alinghi, the defender, at the end of a bitter, three-year legal battle that has pitted the two billionaires against each other and excluded teams from other countries such as the UK, China and New Zealand.The USA trimaran – a lightweight, three-hulled boat – boasted a revolutionary wing larger than the wing of an Airbus A380 superjumbo jet, instead of a conventional sail.As expected, the wing drove the trimaran fast and close to the wind in the initial upwind leg of 20 nautical miles after an awkward start that left Alinghi with a penalty and USA stalled on the start line.To the surprise of many sailing experts, however, the BMW Oracle boat also performed better than the two-hulled Alinghi catamaran in the downwind leg to the finish, although the lightness of the wind was expected to favour Alinghi, which is believed to weigh less.USA officially finished 15 minutes and 28 seconds ahead of Alinghi in the three-hour race. The actual time gap was smaller, but Alinghi was obliged by the judges to re-cross the finish line after mis-timing its last-minute penalty turn.Mr Ellison, founder of the US software group Oracle, and Mr Bertarelli, the Swiss biotechnology tycoon, each invested tens of millions of dollars in their high-tech boats. In southerly wind of around 7 knots, the boats reached speeds of up to 28 knots.The first race was repeatedly delayed by bad weather. Race two is now scheduled for Sunday.
583;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-11T23:31:15Z;Advanced snaps up COA Solutions for £100m;Deal creates group with revenues of £90m;Advanced Computer Software, the acquisitive healthcare software group, has made its largest acquisition to date by snapping up COA Solutions from Alchemy Partners for £100m.The private equity group offloaded COA Solutions after nearly eight years of ownership. It had bought COA in the aftermath of the dotcom crash – when it was known as Cedar – for just £3.8m.For ACS, it served as another step along the route envisaged by Vin Murria, chief executive, to consolidate software assets in the National Health Service and public sector markets.COA had long held that only 20 per cent of its business was exposed to the National Health Service but Ms Murria said around half COA’s revenues was complimentary to ACS’s markets, which also included social care and not-for-profit markets as well as the NHS.Shares in the group on Thursday closed up 3¼p at 39¼p, giving the group a market capitalisation of £140m.Ms Murria told the Financial Times she had no immediate plans for the other half of the business, which comprises accounting software and competes with Sage, Agresso and Oracle.The group will pay for the deal from its existing cash of £57m and a new bank facilities of £55m provided by HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland.ACS said the deal would create an group reporting revenues of about £90m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £21m, based on pro forma figures to February 28 2010.
584;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-09T20:00:35Z;Japan’s healthy eating, with a side of McDonald’s fries;;Selling beef patties and fried potatoes to a nation obsessed with the freshness of its food might seem a daunting task.But in the nearly 30 years since it first landed in Japan, McDonald’s has shown that even rice and miso soup eaters can develop a craving for “Texas Burgers”.The yellow arches, which first appeared in the 1970s, have grown to more than 3,700, and in 2008, McDonald’s became the first fast-food chain in Japan to exceed Y500bn ($5.5m) in sales.But, amid Japan’s severe economic climate, it is not just Y100 burgers that are pulling in the crowds.Last month, on the day McDonald’s introduced the “Texas Burger”, it reaped record one-day revenues of Y2.9bn, surpassing the previous record, when the Japanese discovered the joys of the “Quarter Pounder”.In a year when many fast-food restaurants have suffered a slowdown in sales, McDonald’s on Tuesday reported record full-year sales.Capitalising on its winning streak, McDonald’s is closing 433 existing stores that do not meet its standards for kitchen size and brand image.The plan is to open larger stores instead, which will be able to accommodate more customers and thereby raise revenues.Japanese health officials have been sounding the alarm about rising obesity, but if McDonald’s success is any indication, Japanese consumers are clearly not listening.Challenge for SAPAnyone who believes business is boring should think again. Some of history’s biggest dramas have been played out in boardrooms – from the dissolution of the company that built the Eiffel Tower in the 19th century to the Porsche-Piëch family saga that is only now reaching its climax.There have been numerous corporate causes célèbres, but few are likely to match the intensity of what promises to become a transatlantic contest for the world software and information technology market. In one corner is Larry Ellison, co-founder and chairman of Oracle, and one of the most competitive businessmen around. In the other is Hasso Plattner, chairman of SAP and one of the co-founders of the German software group.The two share a common passion – sailing. Mr Ellison has spent a fortune building a yacht to challenge the Swiss billionaire holder of the America’s Cup Ernesto Bertarelli in the Mediterranean this week. He has also spent vast sums in legal fees in his dispute with the former biotechnology mogul over the rules governing the sailing competition.Mr Plattner is not quite in the same sailing league, but he is also a competitive yachtsman and has raced against Mr Ellison. Their most notorious encounter was in the 1996 Kenwood Cup off Hawaii, when Mr Plattner’s yacht, Morning Glory, broke a mast and Mr Ellison’s Sayonara sailed past. When Mr Ellison’s support boat did not come to Mr Plattner’s aid, the SAP chairman pulled his trousers down in disgust at his American rivals.Trousers or no trousers, Mr Ellison has tended to gain the upper hand in sailing clashes against Mr Plattner. But what has been more troublesome for his rival is that since Mr Plattner gave up day-to-day control of SAP some years ago, the German group has been losing ground and market share to its US competitor. This may well explain why Mr Plattner has decided to assume a more active role again following the surprise resignation of Léo Apotheker, who had taken over as chief executive less than a year ago.In recent months, SAP seems to have lost the confidence of some of its customers. Internal morale appears undermined by Mr Apotheker’s cost-cutting strategy. And investors have become disenchanted.In the meantime, Mr Ellison has been credited by investors for pursuing a nimble and focused strategy including a clever acquisition spree culminating with his takeover of Sun Microsystems. The result is that SAP is valued at €40bn ($55bn) against Oracle’s market capitalisation of about $116bn. That makes Oracle number two behind Microsoft.Mr Plattner’s new mission is to restore some balance between the perception that SAP is losing the battle to Oracle and the reality that the group is a key operator in its field and likely to remain so.Mr Ellison seems to think his challenge is no longer to topple SAP from its pedestal – he probably thinks he has already succeeded – but to challenge Microsoft and IBM outright.But the SAP chairman may have a few tricks up his sleeve. Not least his link with IBM – there have been rumours of a possible merger between the two. Should German political sensibilities allow such a combination, Mr Plattner may well be tempted to pull down his trousers again as he sails, this time, past his rival.world.view@ft.com
585;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Some of history’s biggest dramas have been played out in corporate boardrooms – from the dissolution of the company that built the Eiffel Tower in the 19th century to the Porsche-Piëch family saga, which is only now reaching its climax.Take, for example, the “dirty tricks war” conducted by Lord King, the late and colourful chairman of British Airways, against the equally colourful Richard Branson and his upstart Virgin Atlantic airline. Or the so-called “handbag war” waged between Bernard Arnault and François Pinault, the French luxury goods tycoons, for control of Italy’s Gucci.There have been numerous other corporate causes célèbres – BNP-Paribas’s dogged and unsuccessful efforts to take over Société Générale; the Italian chemical industry war of the 1970s between Montedison and SIR; attempts by Novartis to absorb Roche, its Swiss pharmaceutical rival. And in most cases, these battles have involved fiercely competitive tycoons who have found it difficult not to turn their corporate conflicts into personal affairs.But few are likely to match the intensity of what promises to become a transatlantic contest for the world’s software and information technology market.

588;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Cindy Sweeting on global exposure to emerging markets;""" I wouldn’t call China a great market for bargain hunters at the moment""";"Emerging markets looked like offering investors good value during the shocks of the credit crisis, when risk profiles of the developed world were changing dramatically. But since the recovery on the world’s major stock indices, emerging markets are looking more expensive.As a value investor, the Templeton Global Equity group is finding opportunities in high quality companies, at a reasonable price, that may have been overlooked. There are also opportunities in international companies located in developed markets that are tapping into faster growing economies around the world at less of a premium and with a better risk profile.Cindy L. Sweeting is director of portfolio management for the Templeton Global Equity Group and has over 26 years of experience in the investment industry.Cindy’s answers to a selection of the best questions we received are appearing live below.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Currently it seems like US retail investors can only invest in emerging markets through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. Is there any progress being made to allow us to buy emerging market stocks and debts directly?
Harlan Seymour, San FranciscoCindy Sweeting: It depends on where you want to invest. Many of the larger companies in China, Russia, India and Brazil have American Depository Receipts or Global Depositary Receipts, so retail investors have some options in those markets if they have conviction on a specific company.Smaller companies are more likely to be traded on local exchanges where costs of trading for retail US investors may be prohibitively high.Furthermore, financial documents may not be translated into English, leading investors to make “hope and a prayer” investment mistakes. For liquidity and diversification, ETFs and mutual funds are probably still the best bets for retail investors, and mutual funds are best for investors looking for professional insight and management.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..When considering companies with exposure to emerging markets, risk control must be foremost in your thinking? What particular elements do you take into account?
Steven Sparks, SingaporeCS: As in all its equity investments, the Templeton Global Equity group looks for an adequate margin of safety, which means the stock trades at a generous discount to our estimation of the fair value of its business.Because fair value is difficult to accurately compute, a substantial margin of safety gives the investor room for error. In emerging markets carrying higher risks such as currency instability, lack of transparency of financial statements, or poor corporate governance we demand a greater margin of safety.While we might be satisfied buying a western European multinational for eighty cents on the dollar, we may demand fifty cents on the dollar to buy a Latin American telecom. So it’s all about buying value at an adequate enough discount to compensate for risk and uncertainty.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..How concerned are you with the speed with which emerging markets – particularly, the Indian and Chinese equity markets– have rallied in the past year? Do you think we are now in a deep-correction territory if not in bubble territory considering a possible sovereign-debt crisis and an overheated Chinese economy?
Nandan, LondonCS: The fact that both the People’s Bank of China and the Reserve Bank of India have begun peripheral tightening measures is a good indication that overheating is a serious concern.Both monetary and fiscal policy were massively stimulatory last year, especially in China. In India, the budget deficit has ballooned from 6 to 11% of GDP in two years, and the economy will require sustained high growth rates to bring its debt under control.The risk of malinvestment is a major concern, particularly in China, but bubbles can run for a long time before they burst – particularly when they are fuelled by lots of liquidity and a credible growth story.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What do you think is the best route into the Indian market - there is an Indian miner on the FTSE 100, are there any other similar options in Europe and the US providing exposure?
Rajesh, UKCS: At Templeton, we’ve held a couple of the big Indian banks in recent years, as well as outsourcers and industrial conglomerates.Some Indian companies, like ICICI Bank, issue American depository receipts and so can be bought easily by retail investors. The best Indian banks are well-diversified with good asset quality and prudent loan growth.They should ultimately benefit from the rising secular credit demand in India, and the very steep yield curve is another advantage at the moment. Valuations got too pricy for us, however.The current market correction is improving valuations and we may get future opportunities to buy Indian companies at more attractive discounts to their longer term values.They should ultimately benefit from the rising secular credit demand in India, and the very steep yield curve is another advantage at the moment. Valuations got too pricy for us, however. The current market correction is improving valuations and we may get future opportunities to buy Indian companies at more attractive discounts to their longer term values.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Political uncertainty in emerging markets worries me. How much protection does an investment made via a developed world company, active in emerging markets, really provide from potential disruption from political problems?
Andrew Cowell, DerbyCS: Significantly more protection than a direct investment in emerging markets, though political risks still remain as both BP and Telenor discovered last year in Russia. Political turmoil which may only cause a flesh wound in the operations of a foreign multinational, might well be a fatal blow to a domestic operation.On the other hand, a domestic emerging market stock will generally outperform a foreign multinational in a strong regional bull market. What’s really important is the price you pay.Recently, gaining emerging market exposure through investments in foreign multinationals has been notably cheaper than direct investment, so it increases the margin of safety for our investors and also reduces their risk profile.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..How good an investment option is land in emerging markets, and are there any funds which offer exposure to land prices? surely the process of economic development will lead to rising land prices, but how best can investors exploit that, if at all?
Gelu, LondonCS: Investing in land requires a deep understanding of factors unique to a specific market which is generally best found with local experts.Since we are stock-pickers, I am more qualified to speak about land investments from an equity market perspective.We have periodically invested in companies like Cheung Kong and Swire Pacific, which are two of the biggest property owners and developers in Hong Kong. Hong Kong property has been very strong, driven partly by the influx of mainland Chinese onto the island. These companies are highly diversified conglomerates, which is important from a capital preservation standpoint as property prices in emerging markets can be volatile.Local closed end funds and private equity may offer retail investors diversified exposure to emerging market property investments.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What do you look for at the macroeconomic level to assess the prospects of an individual emerging market nation? Do the indicators you use vary from country to country, or are there ones which are common to them all?
Christopher O’Neill, GlasgowCS: Along with its industry experts, the Templeton Global Equity group has country analysts who study the stability and growth prospects of various regions, and its primary objective is to find bargains in those markets.We want to know if a country might default on its debt, debase its currency, raise or lower interest rates or tax rates, depose a sitting government, go to war, nationalize industry sectors or anything along those lines.This due diligence is an important part of our risk management and analytical process and provides the framework for our individual company analysis.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Chinese equities remain volatile. Have you a strategy for exploiting the upside without too much exposure to the more dizzying elements of risk there?
Malcolm Hamilton, YorkshireCS: Regions experiencing very high rates of economic growth do not necessarily provide the best equity investments, as valuations often become excessive because of the optimism of investors.Also, the competitive environment is often fierce, ultimately lowering corporate profitability. We have more recently been focusing on some of the “utility-like” stocks that should benefit from China’s long-term growth potential, but are less sensitive to economic fluctuations and significant market volatility.China Telecom, China Mobile, and Shanghai Electric are some examples. In general, though, I wouldn’t call China a great market for bargain hunters at the moment. We can currently get exposure to China at better valuations through other markets and companies benefiting from China’s growth.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Would you include any high tech companies in your search for overlooked investments well-placed for emerging market growth - We read a lot about Indian outsourcing companies, but is it true to say many of them failed to live up to expectations?
Daniel Jones, LondonCS: At Templeton, we are finding considerable bargains in the technology sector, and believe that both local and multinational companies offer opportunities to tap into emerging market demand.Emerging-market domiciled companies like Flextronics, Compal, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor all benefit from the cost-savings of emerging market production, but are tapped directly into global demand growth.Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle on the other hand, run their businesses out of the US, but also benefit from growing operations abroad. Currently, the majority of revenues in the tech sector still come from the developed economies, but that is changing, and companies with a presence in emerging markets are poised to benefit.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What is the best data to look at or monitor that can show when a market may be overheating - are emerging markets investments made via mature market companies using any such indicators, and are they reliable? How long does it take them to react?
Alan Tucker, SurreyCS: It is difficult to know when a market is becoming unsustainably overheated, as speculative bubbles and manias exist on investment flows and confidence in an often credible underlying story which can be quite persistent - until those flows and confidence reverse in the face of fundamentals, which always eventually drive valuations.Credit growth, property prices and equity valuations are important indicators to monitor, but they are not always reliable from a timing perspective. Our experience has shown us time and again that consistently predicting market moves is a tough way to make money.That’s why at Templeton, we don’t try to time markets, but instead, let valuations and our fundamental analysis of companies tell us when and where to invest.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Do you think the Indian market needs another 10 to 15 per cent correction before it would be wise to enter it?
Asheesh, RiyadhCS: The Indian market is structurally attractive: Economic activity is picking back up, exports are growing and government stimulus is feeding through to consumer spending.However, inflation is a concern, as is the yawning budget deficit. Interest rates are likely to rise and the country’s infrastructure bottleneck will be a real hindrance to future growth if not alleviated.So India faces its own set of policy challenges, but there are strong organic growth drivers, and we haven’t seen the same degree of credit creation and asset inflation we are seeing in China. From a valuation perspective, we still are not finding runaway bargains. But, another 10 per cent or 15 per cent decline could indeed reveal some attractive opportunities.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Is the election in Brazil enough to turn down the investor’s mood even with the country’s economy showing signs of growth for the next years? Roberto Rodrigues,
Sao PauloCS: With President Lula da Silva ineligible to run for the first time since 1989, the election later this year certainly adds another element of risk to the market. So too do the high current valuations driven by optimistic investor sentiment about good economic growth potential, which has caused significant investment flows into the equity market. We would be discriminating about valuations given this backdrop.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What do you think about agriculture funds and construction equipment for asian markets?
Guy Pridham, CanadaCS: Agriculture in Asia should be a strong investible theme given it is still highly fragmented, and there’s a structural demand story from increased calorie intake and changing diets as incomes rise.Long-term self-sufficiency in food is a main goal for Beijing, which should result in more investment in agriculture and new technologies.Realistically however, investment opportunities are thin:India caps most of its food prices. Agricultural land ownership is strictly controlled in China. Potential investment opportunities could lie in water, fertilizer, agricultural equipment and the like, but current valuations reflect much of the growth potential and we are not finding any real bargains at the moment.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Equity returns in many asset classes and the perfoprmance of the world’s major indices in 2009 have proved yet again that speculation remains superior to a more technical approach. The decoupling of world markets, however, implies further compartmentalisation of risk profiles. What should be considered more or less as the key indicative sign of a well leveraged risk-return position in emerging markets during 2010?
Augustin Dufatanye, ReykjavikCS: As fundamental analysts and long-term value investors, we use valuation to manage risk.The bigger the discount to underlying business value, the more attractive the risk-return characteristics of a stock.This is particularly important in emerging markets, where exogenous risks can unexpectedly impact an investment. To compensate for the heightened risk profile of emerging markets, we demand larger valuation discounts in those regions.______________________________________________________________________"
589;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-07T21:08:28Z;SAP chief goes in management reshuffle;;Léo Apotheker, SAP’s chief executive, resigned on Sunday night in a management reshuffle at the world’s largest business software maker.The company said Mr Apotheker would be replaced with Bill McDermott, head of field organisation, and Jim Hagemann Snabe, head of product development, in a joint-CEO structure.The German group said: “The supervisory board has come to a mutual agreement with the spokesman of the management board, Léo Apotheker, not to extend his contract as an executive board member.“Léo Apotheker has laid down his post as member of the management board with immediate effect.”SAP did not provide a reason for the departure but a senior company executive said the supervisory board did not think Mr Apotheker would be the right person to repair morale at the company after an employee survey last September revealed a dramatic loss of confidence in SAP’s senior management.Mr Apotheker, whose contract was to expire at the end of 2010, has been running the company as sole chief executive since a joint structure was abandoned early last year.He had been criticised for delays in the introduction of new business software for small and medium-sized companies.An attempt by SAP to increase maintenance fees in the middle of the economic crisis also attracted criticism from some customers last year.Hasso Plattner, one of the founders of SAP and the elder statesman of the group, recently indicated concern over the direction of the company.Mr Plattner said on Sunday: “The new structure at the top of the company is meant to bring the product innovations closer together with customers’ requirements.“The new management will continue the strategic direction of the company and the focus on profitable growth and it will further push our leading position in the market in 2010.”Mr Apotheker’s departure came as a surprise given that only two weeks ago he had expressed great optimism for the group, which had a difficult 2009, a year that was dominated by job cuts and shrinking profits.Mr Apotheker said then “we see a step by step return of clients’ readiness to invest – although most of them are still acting cautiously”.He forecast the group’s core revenues – comprising sales of software and related services such as online subscriptions – to climb between 4 and 8 per cent in 2010 from last year’s €8.2bn.Mr Apotheker said SAP, whose main competitor is US software company Oracle, aimed to gain significant market share this year.
590;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-05T21:18:54Z;America’s Cup: Close to the wind;Two billionaires do high-tech battle on the seas;"Listen too closely to the lamentations from the camps of the two billionaires competing in Valencia on Monday for the America’s Cup and you might start to believe that the sport of super-yacht racing was dead in the water.Ernesto Bertarelli, Swiss biotechnology tycoon and current holder of a trophy that predates the modern Olympics, and challenger Larry Ellison, American founder of software group Oracle, have for weeks been loudly broadcasting mutual recriminations over their bitter and still unresolved three-year legal battle about how to run the week-long series of races that comprises the world’s most venerable yachting contest.The tussle in the courts has overshadowed the competition, freezing out entries from as far apart as South Africa, New Zealand and the UK, and leaving only the teams of the two billionaires to fight it out. Mr Bertarelli calls the battle “a very big step backwards”, declaring: “No one has been a winner.” According to Russell Coutts, chief executive of Mr Ellison’s BMW Oracle team, the victims include “the participants, the commercial sponsors, the fans that want to come and look at it, and the city that’s hosting the event”.Fortunately for all concerned, the 33rd America’s Cup is not just legally tortuous but also technologically inspiring. In this respect – as well as in terms of the money it attracts from luxury goods makers and other sponsors – it is comparable to Formula 1. Because no one could agree on a set of rules to control costs and ensure boats were evenly matched, the two teams competing are limited only by the most basic 19th-century rules for the race. The super-rich rivals have built two of the fastest and most technically advanced sailing machines the world has yet seen.The pair are both given to technological displays of wealth: Mr Ellison pilots his own aircraft and owns a fighter jet; Mr Bertarelli hired a Russian Mil Mi-26 helicopter, with the world’s biggest lifting capacity, to fly the Alinghi 5 catamaran from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean. Both find it hard to control their excitement about the contest. “Whoever tells you speed is not important is lying,” enthuses Mr Bertarelli at a public presentation in Valencia of Alinghi. “These boats are a lot more fun.” According to Mr Ellison: “This is the X version of the America’s Cup. This is extreme sailing and it’s very exciting to be a part of it.”The sailing world, adds an equally fired-up Mr Coutts, will “switch on” when the racing begins because the boats are “at least” 10 years ahead of the industry in terms of technology – including aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and electronic control and monitoring systems.Both teams are keeping vital details – cost, weight, maximum speed – sec­ret, though each campaign is thought to have cost more than $100m (£65m; €75m). Mr Ellison’s trimaran (with three hulls, one more than a catamaran), USA, is equipped with a vertical wing instead of conventional sails and reputed to travel at up to three times the underlying wind speed, exceeding 40 knots (about 75km/h).What is known about the boats, and what is visible at sea or at the dockside, is remarkable enough. The only size limit is that waterline length must not exceed 90ft. They are able to capture the power of a breeze and turn it into forward motion that subjects the crews of about six to 10 to constant oncoming strong winds – sometimes of gale force. The incessant roar makes it hard for them to communicate, even by radio. Television crews, photographers and race judges, meanwhile, could find it almost impossible to keep up except by helicopter as few powerboats can match the speed of the yachts when the wind is blowing.The most obvious innovation in this competition is USA’s wing and its nine hinged flaps, an assembly larger than the wing of an Airbus A380 super-jumbo passenger jet. Designers have experimented with wing sails be­fore but the difficulties of controlling them have discouraged sailors. “It’s very, very similar to model aircraft and there’s a reason for that – it’s a very efficient structure,” says Michael Drummond, the team’s design director. “The wing can produce more lift for the same amount of area.” James Spithill, skipper and helmsman, has taken flying lessons to help him grasp how the wing might behave.The hulls and masts of both vessels are made of light, strong carbon fibre composite. In terms of structure, it is Alinghi that has taken the overall form in a new direction with its giant bowsprit protruding from the front, Y-shaped spine and spider’s web of rigging just above the waterline. (New in modern times, at least: American yacht designer Nathanael Herreshoff patented a surprisingly similar catamaran design in 1877.)Grant Simmer, Alinghi’s design team co-ordinator, explains that the spinal structure takes the load from the sails and distributes it into the platform of the catamaran, and prevents the hulls from being twisted apart by the wind and waves. “That’s really the most challenging thing on this boat – what loads can we deal with structurally,” he says. “We struggle with that every day.”One way to deal with this problem is with electronic sensors. Embedded in the two boats are scores of tiny optical-fibre stress gauges that constantly measure the changing loads. On Alinghi, the real-time data are shown as a three-dimensional image on screen. An alarm sounds when any part of the boat comes within 10 per cent of a predetermined load limit, allowing the crew to ease off the sails or do whatever else is necessary. The system tells the crew that “in these certain conditions you’re pushing too hard and this part of the structure is in danger”, says Simon Daubney, Alinghi’s head sail-trimmer. “Any failure that we get, even with one little fitting …would be catastrophic. It would be like a house of cards.”Such sensors, already used in structures such as bridges, are likely to be more widely used in the marine industry following the contest. “The load monitoring would definitely be of use to any large yacht, for the safe management of the yacht,” says Mr Drummond of BMW Oracle. Once unheard of, he adds, these gauges are now sprinkled around the boat “like cornflakes”.The teams are making advances in other areas of electronics and software, both to measure the changes in wind, water and speed that are ex­ploited to enhance sailing performance and to run control systems. Measuring the wind, for example, is not simple when the mast is more than 60 metres high: the wind’s speed and direction can be dramatically different at the top from at sea level.Put all these lightweight and high-technology systems together, power the hydraulics and winches with simple and unromantic engines (a noisy ski-mobile engine in the case of Alinghi), and the result is two of the fastest sailing boats in history.But not the safest. Unlike offshore cruising boats, the yachts that will meet off the coast of Spain to compete for the best of three races – weather permitting – are fragile, highly tuned and overpowered machines designed for one purpose: winning the cup. Almost the only thing the teams could agree on was a concession to safety – changing the starting arrangements, as a head-to-head confrontation at the start line could have resulted in the huge structures closing on each other at up to 80 knots. “All the people on the boats have spent their lives thinking in slower motion than this,” says Ed Baird, Alinghi helmsman. A capsize, he adds, would make the boats “explode in a thousand pieces”.After all the years of legal wrangling, both Mr Bertarelli’s and Mr Ellison’s teams now say they are finally ready to compete on the water.“If these boats get to race in a reasonable breeze, it will be a spectacular race to see,” says BMW Oracle’s Mr Coutts. Alinghi’s Mr Baird agrees: “It’s going to be different than anything any of us have ever experienced in our lifetimes.”"
591;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-04T22:48:35Z;Billionaire battle of the seas;;Sir Keith Mills is one of life’s eternal optimists. This is, after all, the man who, back in 2003, took on the then herculean task of persuading the Olympic movement to support London’s bid to host the 2012 games.Ask Sir Keith, founder of the Airmiles business and the Nectar card loyalty scheme, about England’s chances of hosting the 2018 World Cup – another bidding project to enlist his services – and he talks enthusiastically about the bid’s “unbelievable line-up of football greats”, such as David Beckham.Of the stadium plans for Tottenham Hotspur, where he is director, he talks passionately about the Premier League club’s sense of responsibility to community.But when the subject turns to the protracted legal war over sailing’s America’s Cup that has the Alinghi and BMW Oracle teams at each other’s throats, even Sir Keith Mills is left shaking his head.The battle has pitted the team’s billionaire owners, Alinghi’s Ernesto Bertarelli of Switzerland, heir to the Serono pharmaceutical company, and BMW Oracle’s Larry Ellison, founder of software group Oracle, against each other in a struggle for domination over the competition’s archaic rules.The cup is sport’s oldest trophy. But one court ruling after another has kept it off the water for approaching three years.“It is bad for sport, it’s bad for the America’s Cup,” says Sir Keith. The America’s Cup is “one of the iconic, historic sporting events in the world”, he says, ranking it alongside the Olympics, the World Cup and Formula One, but for the time being sponsors want nothing to do with it.Sailing is Sir Keith’s greatest love, a sport he only really took to after taking part in a 1998 round-the-world yacht race. He is obsessed enough to have set up a British team, Team Origin, to challenge for the America’s Cup. It is a competition, he likes reminding people, that the British invented but have never won.But no other team can get to contest it until Alinghi and BMW Oracle sort out their differences. Which is why Sir Keith has spent the past several months as an unofficial negotiator between the warring parties.He cares intensely about the positive role sport can play in society. But the spectacle of legal teams slugging it out at vast expense does nothing but harm to the sport. It is, he agrees, like Jarndyce versus Jarndyce in Bleak House.“I know both of them quite well, they are passionate sailors and very astute businessmen,” Sir Keith says. But the conversations have to be bilateral – getting them round the table, Sir Keith adds, “is not possible”.So many lawsuits and counter-claims have been launched that Sir Keith estimates their legal bills run to £100m ($160m, €114m) each. The arguments have revolved around interpretation of the America’s Cup “deed of gift”, a rule book that was written in 1852, last revised in 1887 and registered in the New York Supreme Court.“I have spent some time trying to resolve their differences, and speak to them about a new governance structure,” Sir Keith says. “Both seem very keen to try to ensure that what comes out of this dispute is a better governed America’s Cup. It is not fit for purpose and needs to change.”Getting the America’s Cup structure right for the future would also unlock economic rewards for the countries that want to be involved, and especially for the venue that hosts the event.The commercial value of the America’s Cup is significant. In a study commissioned by Allianz, the insurance company, following the 2007 event in Valencia, researchers placed the America’s Cup third behind the summer Olympics and the Fifa World Cup in terms of economic impact.The Valencia series generated $8bn in direct and indirect impacts, Allianz estimated, taking into account technological investment made by syndicated teams.One study found the Valencia region benefited by an annual 1 per cent increase in gross domestic product in the three years leading up to the event, a period that created 74,000 jobs linked to the event.A resolution may yet be around the corner, if only because the two protagonists are finally going to be racing each other. A ruling from the New York Supreme Court in May ordered them to contest the America’s Cup by the end of February. It will be staged next week in a best-of-three series in Valencia.But the series will not stop the legal tit-for-tat, only give it pause for breath. The Supreme Court last week said it would hear a complaint from BMW Oracle about its rival’s sails after the conclusion of the series.On one thing the two billionaires did agree – the series will be fought between no-expense-spared, monster multi-hull vessels. Each are 90ft long and just as wide, the masts 110ft high.They are so big that Alinghi used a Russian military helicopter to transport its boat over the Swiss Alps. The depths of mistrust even prompted the team to use Nasa technology to prevent spying.Their boats race at frightening speeds, and take sailing to the outer limits of technology. But to Sir Keith, they represent the end of a story, not the beginning. “Both the Americans and the Swiss will tell you sailing used to be a sport of excess,” he says.“Every team had two boats and two crews. That is not economically or environmentally sustainable.” Future sponsors will be drawn to the America’s Cup only if teams demonstrate interest in the environment, he believesMeanwhile, Sir Keith is hopeful that once the series is run, the two billionaire businessmen will stand down their legal teams and work to bring peace to the America’s Cup.Others are not so sure. “The legal fight will go on,” says Ron Katz, head of the sports law division at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, the US litigators.“The document that controls the event can only be interpreted by the courts, and we have very wealthy people involved who can afford to go to court. There is no one like a commissioner of football or baseball to decide these things.”What motivates the two protagonists is not some ideological reading of the rule book, Mr Katz adds. “They are trying to get an edge in the race.”Sir Keith puts it slightly differently. “These are two entrenched positions, one driven by a desire for fair rules, the other not to have to accept through a court rules imposed by one team,” he says.Both teams betray weariness at the legal ding-dong. “It has gone totally out of control as far as the sport is concerned,” says Brad Butterworth, skipper of Alinghi, who is dismayed that the America’s Cup has been reduced to a straight race between two teams rather than a regatta of many.“In the end, the sport is diluted. It would have been nice to come to some arrangement a year and a half ago when we had 19 teams ready to compete.”On Mr Ellison’s side, BMW Oracle is concerned to protect him and the team from reputational damage, in the face of goading from Mr Bertarelli. “”If Larry is going to win the America’s Cup in court then I will be the first one to congratulate him,” Mr Bertarelli said last month.Tom Ehman, BMW Oracle’s head of external affairs, is sensitive to the suggestion. “We have never wanted to win this in court, but we want Alinghi to abide by the rules,” he says.Sir Keith believes the teams will eventually agree to an arbitration panel made up of trustees to resolve disputes and an independent event management company to take charge of the America’s Cup logistics and maximise commercial benefits.But that is for later. While the lawyers take a breather, the crews are making the final adjustments to their preparations for next week’s grudge match.Alinghi and BMW Oracle will race each other over a straight course, hardly a contest that appeals to sailing purists. There are not a few of them who wonder whether the winner will be the boat that avoids breaking up.For that reason, Sir Keith, will not be drawn to what he calls a freak show akin to machines trying to break speed records on salt flats. “It will be two contestants steaming down the course,” he says. “I can get excited by a Formula One race, but drag racing leaves me cold.”
592;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-04T10:05:25Z;Beijing dismisses Washington’s mounting anger;;China on Thursday dismissed US political pressure to revalue its currency, saying the yuan was already at a reasonable level and that China did not deliberately pursue a trade surplus with the United States.”At the moment, looking at international balance of payments and forex market supply and demand, the level of the yuan is close to reasonable and balanced,” Ma Zhaoxu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman told a regular news briefing, repeating China’s standard line on its currency.”Accusations and pressure do not help to solve the problem,” he was quoted by Reuters as saying.US political heat on China intensified on Wednesday after Barack Obama, president, raised the issue of a weak Chinese currency a day after the US Senate condemned cyberattacks on Google.Speaking to Senate Democrats, Mr Obama warned that the US should not back down from trade with China.“For us to close ourselves off from that market would be a mistake,” he said. But he added that currency rates needed to be addressed internationally “to make sure our goods are not artificially inflated in price and their goods are artificially deflated in price”.Tensions between Washington and Beijing have risen in the wake of a $6.4bn (€4.5bn, £4bn) US arms deal with Taiwan and ahead of an expected meeting this month between Mr Obama and the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader.US senators on Tuesday voted unanimously to condemn the cyberattacks on Google and other companies that caused the search engine group to threaten to quit China.“It is important that the US not stand idly as China infringes on the free flow of information,” said Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Democrat.A senior Democratic senator also asked 30 large technology groups to provide details of their human rights practices in China.Dick Durbin, the Illinois senator and assistant majority leader, sent a sharply worded request for information to US groups such as Facebook, Apple, IBM, Amazon and Oracle and to international companies including Nokia, Vodafone, SAP, RIM and Toshiba.He said Google set “a strong example in standing up to the Chinese government’s continued failure to respect the fundamental human rights of free expression and privacy. I look forward to learning more about whether other …companies are willing to follow Google’s lead”.Mr Durbin said he expected the responses to include information on the companies’ business in China and any efforts to ensure their products and services did not “facilitate human rights abuses by the Chinese government”.Next week the congressional executive commission on China, which was created in 2000 to coincide with the country’s accession to the World Trade Organisation, will hold a hearing focused on the cyberattacks, including the intellectual property protection issues that it raised.Dennis Blair, the US’s director of national intelligence, highlighted China’s “growing international confidence and activism” in testimony to Congress this week.But he added that Beijing’s policies were largely set by its commercial interests and that its “core priority remains ensuring domestic stability”.In his evidence, Mr Blair listed the global “cyberthreat” to the US ahead of all other threats Washington faced.He described the recent cyberattacks on Google as “a wake-up call to those who have not taken this problem seriously”.
593;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-03T22:33:36Z;Autonomy raises guidance for 2010 after uptick in sales;;Autonomy, the UK’s largest software company by market value, raised its guidance for 2010 and said it had seen signs of improving business confidence.Mike Lynch, chief executive, said that at the end of the fourth quarter the company had seen the first orders by customers for discretionary items, such as software for marketing. Autonomy said orders for these items had slowed during the downturn.“[They are] small amounts, but there is a different business culture out there now,” said Mr Lynch. The company described the climate as “winter with snowdrops”, slightly short of a full spring revival.It also published a 43 per cent rise in full-year pre-tax profits from $186m to $266m (£167m) from revenue that rose from $503m to $740m. Earnings per share increased 31 per cent to 80 cents.Cambridge-based Autonomy provides software that allows customers, which include Goldman Sachs and BAE Systems, to search and organise data such as e-mails, pictures, documents and phone messages.It has continued to develop during the downturn – while peers such as SAP and Oracle have struggled – because of new financial and legal rules that force companies to keep better track of their information.But full-year organic growth has fallen from 26 per cent before the downturn to about 16 per cent. Autonomy said growth could accelerate to 22 per cent, with the company on track to meet sales estimates of $885m-$905m for 2010.“If things carry on as they are, we would expect this estimate to move up again,” said Mr Lynch.The shares rose 24p to close at £15.93.In spite of its long history of strong growth, analysts usually find something to quibble with in Autonomy results – cash conversion or lengthening debtor days, for example. This time there is little to find fault with, although some investors felt Mr Lynch could have been bolder in his outlook, given the prospects for an industry upturn. Trading at 20 times earnings estimates for 2010, Autonomy shares are at the upper end of its UK software peer sector of between 15 and 20. Given Autonomy’s consistent outperformance during the past five years, however, this premium is justified.
594;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-02-03T08:48:13Z;Autonomy confident after 53% rise in sales;;Autonomy, the UK’s largest software company by market value, on Wednesday reported a 53 per cent rise in revenues in the fourth quarter and said it was confident about 2010 after seeing the first signs of improvement in business sentiment.“At the very end of Q4 2009 we began to see some indicators of an initial improvement on the macro environment, which gives us confidence in the outlook for 2010, and accordingly we are adjusting our business plan,” said Mike Lynch, chief executive of the Cambridge-based company.Regulation is pushing increasing numbers of customers to adopt Autonomy software, which allows companies to search and organise unstructured data such as e-mails, phone calls, documents and images. This has helped Autonomy grow throughout the recession, while software sector peers such as SAP and Oracle have seen revenues decline.Autonomy reported revenues of $223.1m (£139m) in the three months to the end of December. Pre-tax profits were up 51 per cent at $110m, and adjusted earnings per share were $0.33, up 35 per cent from the previous year. The results were in line with analysts’ estimates.For the full year, revenues rose 47 per cent to $740m, reflecting 16 per cent organic growth and gains from the acquisition of Interwoven, a US software rival, in early 2009.Pre-tax profits for 2009 were $323m, up 55 per cent from the previous year, and earnings per share were up 31 per cent at $0.80.Autonomy was at pains to show that a blip in margin levels in the third quarter, when the company invested in the launch of a new product, IDOL SPE, had been a one-off. Gross margins, which fell to 86 per cent in the third quarter, recovered to 89 per cent in the final three months.“During 2009 Autonomy did a lot of work to prepare for a possible upturn in 2010, including significant new IDOL product developments. After this exceptional expenditure we are now seeing our cost base return to its traditional model,” said Mr Lynch.Autonomy shares have been one of the most consistent market performers for the past five years, and have increased more than 40 per cent in value over the past year alone. The increasing price has, however, put the company under close scrutiny by investors , some of whom have questioned how long it can maintain its rate of growth.
595;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-01-29T20:25:02Z;Man in the News: Steve Jobs;;Seven years ago, the globally recognisable boss of a certain giant technology company spoke often of the touch-screen “tablet” computer whose development he championed. This pet project was going to change computing for millions of people.The man was Bill Gates, and the product was the Tablet PC – a device that, while still on sale, has fallen into the limbo reserved for failed electronic gadgets. This week, when Steve Jobs of Apple ended months of feverish speculation by unveiling his own company’s tablet machine– branded the iPad – the echoes were hard to ignore.Mr Gates has since left the business stage to pursue philanthropy. But for Mr Jobs, who last year took six months off work to fight a near-fatal cancer and undergo a liver transplant operation, it is back to business as usual: sprinkling his pixie dust over inanimate lumps of metal and glass to create objects of desire for the digital age.Tablets (bigger than a smartphone, smaller than a laptop, and without a keyboard) have been the graveyard of personal computing. If Mr Jobs, 54, can succeed, it will open a new phase in a comeback career. The launch was classic Jobs, points out Jean-Louis Gassée, a high-ranking Apple development executive in the 1980s who later founded a rival personal computing company called Be Inc. “The whole product reflects Steve’s attention to detail and the drive for a minimalist approach – just enough, as opposed to piling on feature after feature,” he said. “It’s from the Steve we know and admire.”Behind the simple lines of the iPad lie a technological mastery, aesthetic flair and marketing savvy that have long set the Apple chief executive apart. Mr Jobs’ perfectionism, bordering on the obsessive, is summed up in a telling anecdote by John Lasseter, the top creative brain behind Walt Disney’s animation business and a long-time friend.“He found this one really great black turtleneck which he loved – I think it was Issey Miyaki – so tried to buy another one and they didn’t have any more,” Mr Lasseter confided to the FT recently. “He called the company and asked if they would make another one, and they refused. So he said: ‘Fine, how many do you have to make before I can buy them?’ So they made them – I think he has a closet full of them.”For anyone who has worked for him, that perfectionism has a downside: a stinging lack of patience that can border on bullying. Approached to comment about his management style for this article, several former employees and associates declined. The fear of Mr Jobs is still powerful, one person said.One figure who is less cowed is Steve Wozniak, Apple’s co-founder. “Steve can be annoying to people, and he can be obnoxious,” he told the FT in a recent interview. “He would walk into meetings and just say, ‘Forget it. It’s all a bunch of junk. You’re not doing it,’ and walk out, and: ‘You’re all idiots.’”Mr Job’s harshest critics accuse him of a secretive manner. The accusations dogged him three years ago when Apple blamed two former senior employees for a scandal over the improper issuance of stock options– even though Apple belatedly revealed that Mr Jobs had known about it and received some of the options. Mr Jobs was later exonerated after a review by regulators.Of course, no one ever said geniuses had to be easy to work with – and “genius” is one word that long-time associates like Mr Lasseter use freely. Larry Ellison, the billionaire head of software company Oracle and a friend, summed up his talent: “He has the mind of an engineer and the heart of an artist.”That blend is key to his success. He once studied calligraphy and said it influenced the first Macintosh, calling it “the first computer with beautiful typography”. It is evident in his computer-animated hits at Pixar, a company he bankrolled before its sale to Disney in 2006, and in the success of the iPod, the first digital media device not to feel soldered together by ham-fisted engineers.Yet his career has also been defined by a rare clarity of purpose. Returning to Apple in 1997 – 12 years after losing a power struggle and being ejected – he had to put aside years of bitterness. According to Mr Lasseter: “His simple statement to me about it was: ‘The reason I went back to Apple is that I feel like the world would be a better place with Apple in it than not. And it’s hard to imagine the world without Apple now.’”In a remarkable speech at Stanford University in 2005, in which he laid bare some of the most sensitive parts of his life – his unwed mother had put him up for adoption, his sacking from Apple, the moment in 2004 when his doctors believed he was dying of cancer – he delivered an eloquent testimonial to what makes him tick. “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life,” he said. “Because almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.”Such public declarations have reinforced a feeling that the enfant terrible of the tech world has matured, or sees things in a new light. They add to the impression, stirred by his counter-cultural San Francisco roots, that he stands apart from the judgments of the crowd, with their ordinary measures of success. The trappings of eastern religion have followed him for much of his life, from the Hare Krishna temple he says he ate at each day while “dropping in” as an illicit student at Reed College, to the Buddhist monk who officiated at his wedding in 1991.This week, Mr Jobs seemed unusually relaxed. Looking less gaunt than for some time, and in his trademark turtleneck, he mixed easily with journalists in San Francisco after the launch – a rare event. Yet he has little to be shy about. Apple’s stock market value has soared to $180bn – above Google and two-thirds that of Microsoft. Mr Jobs’ last launch, the iPhone, accounts for more than a third of group revenues and sparked a doubling of Apple’s shares in a year.Initial reaction to the iPad has been muted. Like Mr Gates before him, Mr Jobs could fall flat on his face. But if his record is anything to go by, consumers could yet find it hard to live without their iPads.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan and Joseph Menn
596;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-01-22T18:39:01Z;Yacht rivals trade jibes;;This will be no ordinary yachting regatta. The contest for the 33rd America’s Cup, the most venerable trophy in international sport, is proving to be a clash of high technologies and billionaire egos to rival anything either the sailing world or the business world has yet witnessed.This week, the rivalry between Ernesto Bertarelli, the Swiss biotechnology tycoon and current cup holder, and Larry Ellison, the American who founded US software group Oracle and wants to wrest it from him, took a bitter and personal turn as the two sides prepared for the first race off Valencia in Spain on February 8.In an atmosphere thick with animosity and a flurry of legal challenges launched by Mr Ellison’s BMW Oracle team against the Swiss Alinghi team, Mr Bertarelli mocked his rival’s litigious approach and his willingness to spend large sums of money in an attempt to guarantee victory.He sarcastically said he would host a celebration party if Mr Ellison won the competition that dates back to 1851 in the courts rather than on the water and tell him: “Well done, Larry! You won the America’s Cup in court. Good on you!”Mr Bertarelli continued angrily: “It’s been a pistol to the head … It’s been threat after threat after threat.”Russell Coutts, chief executive of the BMW Oracle team, hit back on behalf of Mr Ellison, defending the legal challenges as essential to stop Alinghi setting the race rules to their own advantage. He condemned the personal attacks on his boss and immediately landed some personal blows of his own on Mr Bertarelli.“Larry Ellison is one of the most successful businessmen in the world. He’s a self-made man,” said Mr Coutts.“A guy like that doesn’t get where he is today by being flippant and wasting money …I think that’s one of the problems that Ernesto Bertarelli’s got, because Ernesto, let’s face it, he didn’t create his own wealth the same way as Larry did.”Even as the two sides exchanged gibes, their teams of structural engineers, electronics experts and sailors have been fine-tuning two of the most advanced vessels to use wind as their means of propulsion.The two campaigns are each thought to have spent more than $100m. Mr Ellison’s trimaran and the Alinghi catamaran are larger and faster (and probably more fragile) than any previous racing boats.They are so fast in fact they can sail at two to three times the background wind speed and so subject the crew to gale-force winds created by their own forward motion.Mr Ellison’s trimaran will not even be using a conventional sail, but rather a wing with hinged flaps not unlike the wing of a jumbo jet – but placed vertically rather than horizontally and, furthermore, much larger than the wing of a double-decker Airbus A380.Alinghi is different but equally extraordinary, a vast catamaran made of carbon fibre composites with a mast the height of a 17-storey building. Embedded in the structure are tiny optic fibres attached to 150 electronic stress gauges that tell the crew in real time when they are in danger of overloading any part of the structure.This two-boat contest with no-holds-barred – the only limit is a maximum length of 90ft on the waterline imposed in the 19th century Deed of Gift for the cup – is a far cry from the previous contest held in Valencia in 2007, when a dozen near-identical boats raced under an agreed set of rules.The downsizing of this year’s clash is also due to legal wrangling. The defender, Alinghi, could not reach agreement with the official challenger of record, BMW Oracle, as decreed by a court, so there was no consensus for the kind of multi-boat competition that was so commercially and sportingly successful in 2007.“Clearly I think these boats are a lot more fun. There’s no question about it,” said Mr Bertarelli. But he added: “If my heart is with this boat, my brain tells me we’ve got to have a lot of teams involved …[Because of legal disputes] the image of everyone has suffered. No one has been a winner.”
597;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-01-21T17:57:00Z;Brussels approves $7.4bn Oracle-Sun deal;;Europe’s leading antitrust watchdog on Thursday gave its unconditional approval to the planned $7.4bn purchase of Sun Microsystems by Oracle.It had delayed the deal for months over concerns about the possible impact on MySQL, Sun’s open-source database business.Neelie Kroes, European Union competition commissioner, said: “I am now satisfied that competition and innovation will be preserved on all the markets concerned.”European competition officials had expressed concerns that if Oracle took control of MySQL unconditionally, it could have an incentive to suppress or restructure a product that is given away for free and that could pose a disruptive threat to its own business.The European stance was always at odds with that of US counterparts and this at one stage last year threatened to create a transatlantic rift between the regulatory agencies.The transaction was approved last summer by antitrust officials in the US, where both companies are based. US officials raised no significant issues over the database business – and in November, when the competition officials in Europe persisted with their concerns, presenting Oracle with a formal statement of objections, the US Department of Justice issued a public statement to emphasis its different stance.It was a month later, and after a two-day private hearing with Oracle and other interested parties in Brussels, that European officials signalled a change in their position.They welcomed Oracle’s 10-point list of “public commitments”, though these had no legal force, and Ms Kroes said she was “optimistic” the case would have a satisfactory outcome. At that point, investors and market traders assumed that clearance was likely.In its statementon Thursday, the commission said that those pledges – and signs that Oracle had already begun implementing them – had been factors in its decision to clear the deal with no conditions.But officials said their in-depth investigation had shown that while MySQL and Oracle competed in certain parts of the database market, they were not close competitors in others, such as the high-end segment.“Many database users” considered another open-source database – PostgreSQL – was a “credible alternative” to MySQL, and that so-called “forks”, utilising the MySQL code base, might also develop. These could all act as a competitive constraint on Oracle.In Europe, vocal opposition to the deal and concerns about the impact on MySQL had been raised by third parties including Microsoft, SAP and MySQL’s founder, Monty Widenius. Microsoft is one of the other main operators in the database market. IBM, the third principal proprietary database vendor, did not raise issues.

599;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:32:07+0000;SAP sees a silver lining on sales;;SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, offered a glimmer of hope that companies may be regaining confidence and investing again when it said software sales last year were not as sluggish as expected.But customer resistance saw the German group back down from a proposed increase in maintenance fees, a move that would add to revenue pressures. SAP said it would present a forecast for 2010 at the end of the month.The company said that sales of software and related services such as online subscriptions decreased 5 per cent to €8.2bn ($11.9bn) in the last three months of 2009, outperforming a drop of 6-8 per cent forecast in October.SAP’s preliminary full-year result was a second piece of good news for the information technology industry – seen as a bellwether of the mood in corporate boardrooms – after US software maker Oraclereported an unexpected sales rise last month.Both companies were hard hit when corporate clients slashed software spending at the end of 2008 – and SAP was cautioning the market remained tough only three months ago.Léo Apotheker, SAP’s chief executive, responded by reining in costs, a strategy that seems to have borne fruit, as SAP said its operating margin at constant currencies was 27.2 per cent, 0.2 points above its target. But his other big initiative, raising annual maintenance fees from 18 per cent to 22 per cent of software-purchase costs, could only be implemented in part as clients – mainly in Germany – balked at the increase.SAP will offer customers the choice between a standard maintenance service at 18 per cent and a more inclusive one at 22 per cent, an approach Mr Apotheker deemed “the right thing to do in the current environment”.“The altered maintenance offering …curbs upside [on sales] as we expect most customers will return to standard support,” warned Thomas Becker, a Commerzbank analyst. He also warned the effects of cost cuts could diminish.SAP’s better-than-expected results made the stock price jump more than 4 per cent to levels not seen for more than year. However, the share price closed 1.7 per cent higher at €35.27 after investors took note of the maintenance fees issue.In the last three months of the year sales – calibrated using methods not in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles, which SAP says reveal more than GAAP figures – fell 5 per cent to €2.56bn.Revenues calibrated using GAAP rules decreased 4 per cent to €2.56bn, while core software sales without subscriptions, which have traditionally provided a measure of future services revenues, fell 16 per cent to €1.1bn.
600;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-01-14T18:58:48Z;US stocks struggle following retail data;;"US stocks struggled to push higher on Thursday after an unexpected drop in retail sales gave investors reason for caution.The benchmark index has closed higher in seven out of eight sessions so far this year, lingering around a 15-month high.But after dipping in and out of the red on Thursday, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,145.47 by midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 10,690.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was also 0.1 per cent higher at 2,310.58.The market had opened lower after the latest commerce department figures showed retail sales, excluding cars, had fallen 0.2 per cent in December. Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.3 per cent.“The data sets came in a little bit on the soft side but didn’t necessarily take us into panic territory,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global.He added that uncertainty about demand for the government’s rush of Treasury auctions this week was also making the market nervous. Investors have speculated that the surprising demand for notes in the past few days has been fuelled by one big mystery bidder, whose intentions are still unclear.The disappointing retail data weighed on the market and also overshadowed positive corporate results from the sector itself.Target resumed its share buy-back plan following an improvement to the discount chain’s cash flow.In November 2008, the group halted further purchases halfway through the $10bn plan because of concerns over liquidity.However, revenue growth from its retail and credit card operations left Target confident that it could complete the buy-backs within three years. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent to $49.75.Encouraging sales in the holiday period prompted Williams-Sonoma to give a higher forecast for the fourth quarter than analysts had expected. But shares in the upmarket home goods retailer still fell 3.3 per cent to $21.99.Walgreen, the retail pharmacy chain, announced that it was buying 25 Snyder’s drug stores but its shares were flat at $37.06.Tyson Foods helped to lift the market after analysts at Credit Suisse raised the world’s largest meat processor to “outperform” from “neutral”.“While we clearly missed the bottom on Tyson stock, it is still under-owned, unloved and in the early stages of a cyclical rebound in protein processing,” wrote analyst Robert Mos­kow. Tyson’s shares showed the largest gains on the S&P 500, rising 4.4 per cent to $13.90.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Cryolife, which distributes human tissue for transplants, bought a stake in Medafor and became the largest single shareholder of the group. The company said it hoped to acquire the remainder of Medafor’s common stock. Cryolife gained 1.1 per cent to $6.68.The technology sector also helped to lift the market higher from the opening bell. Oracle gained 2.1 per cent to $25.27 after Morgan Stanley increased its price target on the stock to $31 from $29, citing the benefits of its imminent acquisition of Sun Microsystems.An analyst at UBS said the software maker could halve the number of Sun employees when it finally closed the deal. The $7bn takeover has been under scrutiny for months as a result of concerns about competition.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, came under renewed scrutiny from the Department of Justice. The government requested more information on the company’s soyabean business following complaints that farmers had been forced to pay for
more expensive products. Monsanto’s shares lost 1.2 per cent to $82.91.Financial stocks were in focus as details emerged about the government’s $90bn levy on the sector. Bank of America was up 0.4 per cent to $16.69, while Morgan Stanley lost 2.2 per cent to $30.56.LaBranche surged some 44.2 per cent to $4.01 after Barclays announced that it had bought the company’s designated market-maker business for $25m in cash.The S&P 500 financial sector, which had helped to lead the market higher in early trading, was flat by midday."
601;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-01-13T22:21:57Z;Spending rebound set to spur IT revival;;After the razzmatazz of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, the tech earnings season begins in earnest on Thursday, with investors eager to see whether hot products translate into optimistic forecasts for 2010.Intel, a bellwether stock for the industry, is, as usual, the first large company to report when it announces fourth-quarter results and issues its forecast for the year ahead.Analysts expect the world’s biggest chipmaker to lead a tech charge this year, powered not just by consumer spending but a surge in enterprise investment on upgrading servers and desktop PCs.“The technology downturn of 2008 and 2009 is unofficially over,” said Andrew Bartels, analyst at Forrester Research, this week. “All the pieces are in place for a 2010 tech spending rebound.”Forrester predicts businesses and governments around the world will start investing in IT as a six- to seven-year cycle of growth and innovation that it calls Smart Computing begins.The research group defines this as the new IT foundations being established for unified communications services, cloud computing (where companies access applications and services over the internet), and server and storage virtualisation (where computing and data storage are spread dynamically and more efficiently across servers and data centres).Global IT spending, which fell 9 per cent last year, will rise 8 per cent this year to more than $1,600bn, it predicts. Software and computer hardware will be the biggest growth sectors and western Europe is expected to be the strongest region with an 11 per cent rise in spending.Such trends would benefit large chipmakers such as Intel, as well as the leading PC makers Dell and Hewlett-Packard, and software and service leaders IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, which all report over the coming weeks.Last year was a good year for Intel based on consumer purchases, especially in mobile devices where its Atom microprocessor dominated the booming netbook category.“Looking forward to 2010, I don’t see any reason that shouldn’t continue as computers spread worldwide, but there’s also a potential for corporate and enterprise customers to return to the market,” said Paul Otellini, chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times at CES.“When you add those two together, you can construct a scenario for 2010 that is very optimistic.”Drivers for enterprise spending also include the introduction of Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system last October and the launch this month of a new family of more efficient Intel microprocessors based on the next level of miniaturisation – circuit widths of 32 billionths of a metre.“Most corporations did not upgrade to [Microsoft’s] Vista so they are on Windows XP on relatively old machines. Therefore the installed base of notebooks is over four year olds and desktops more than five years old,” said Mr Otellini.“If you’re going to run Windows 7 for improved security and performance, a new computer is in order.”The Gartner research group reports sales of consumer PCs actually rose 16 per cent last year to 143m units and it predicts an 18 per cent rise to 168m in 2010. But selling prices are falling as the mix shifts towards cheaper netbooks.“Market growth is going to be bumpy because we need a recovery from average selling prices going down. We are going to see some of that in 2010 but it’s not going to be [even] all around the world,” said Andrew Johnson, Gartner analyst.Chipmakers are finding new markets beyond PCs and mobile phones. There was a plethora of eReaders on display at CES, tablet devices made a comeback and TV makers announced 3D and internet-connected models requiring new chipsets and processors.Technology companies are also looking to China to drive growth as government-inspired consumer spending there last year helped to turn the industry round. The Chinese New Year holiday next month is traditionally a period of high consumer spending and the dawn of the Year of the Tiger is expected to provide a strong signal on whether technology can bite back in 2010.
602;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-01-05T19:46:48Z;Autonomy must assure on quality of earnings;;"Autonomy shares have been among the most reliable performers in the FTSE 100 in the past five years.Driven by an enviable record of profits and sales growth and a steady stream of acquisitions, they have risen from 140p in the summer of 2004 to more than £15 late last year. They now trade on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 32, far in excess of many larger global technology companies.The search software group has also weathered the financial crisis better than many others in the sector as banks, law firms and regulators attempt to follow the unstructured trail of e-mails and phone calls to track who authorised what in the financial services industry.But in 2010 Autonomy faces challenges. As IT budgets come under pressure, organic growth has moderated and the company has found itself in dispute with a number of analysts over its figures.That has seen followers of the UK’s largest software stock split into two camps; a majority of bulls who saw weak third-quarter figures as a temporary blip as Autonomy looks to make significant in-roads into cloud computing – which allows software applications and data to reside on web servers rather than on users’ own computers; and a smaller but highly vocal camp of bears, who argue that frequent acquisitions obscure the underlying organic performance.Autonomy made two important decisions in 2009. First, it bought Interwoven a year ago for $775m, which took the company into the large but underdeveloped legal market. Second, it developed and launched the Structured Probability Engine (SPE), a product for searching databases more effectively, which Mike Lynch, chief executive, regards as its most important launch for a decade.“In 2010, the challenge for Autonomy will be to take its considerable strategic achievements in 2009 and translate them into renewed organic growth for 2010 and beyond,” said Ian Spence of IS Research.In particular, investors will be looking to gauge interest in SPE. It has few customers and is expected to make only a minimal contribution to 2010 figures. However, it has the potential to move in on markets dominated by Oracle and SAP. “In our view, the success of SPE is absolutely core to the long-term growth potential for Autonomy,” says Mr Spence.The group also has to contend with disagreements with some City analysts, who are concerned about its underlying performance.In particular, they worry that customers are taking longer to pay, as sales outstanding in the third quarter rose to 97 from 84 a year ago, and that there was an outflow of $19m (£12m) for debtors in the third quarter. Autonomy’s calculation of the conversion of its profits into cash – a sign of the quality of earnings – has also been debated. The group has estimated that it is about 100 per cent, but some analysts, such as Paul Morland at Astaire Securities and Kevin Ashton at Canaccord Adams, have put the figure at just over 70 per cent.The two ratios are important as analysts use them as a guide to help determine whether a company is booking revenues aggressively before collecting the cash.Autonomy has denied it has poor cash conversion.It argues that because it is growing rapidly, but collects cash a quarter in arrears, the amounts coming in will always look small compared with current trading.Autonomy has continued to grow fast. The third quarter was its 26th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Deloitte’s annual Fast 50, a ranking of the UK’s top 50 fastest growing companies over the past five years, usually comprises a variety of start-ups and fledging companies, yet under the professional services firm’s criteria, Autonomy ranked 59th.“[The cash conversion] is a bit weak, but it’s not disastrous,” said David Toms, an analyst at Numis Securities. He suggested that the problem lay more in the lack of a prompt explanation. “The problem was that they didn’t want to talk about it,” he said.According to data from UBS, Autonomy’s growth in net cash from operations has been ahead of that recorded by SAP, Oracle and Microsoft when they were going through their growth spurts in the late 1980s. Critics counter that Microsoft’s growth rates were organic, not clouded by acquisitions.“The only way for Autonomy to really put investor concerns over earnings quality to rest is to deliver a clear 12-month period unaffected by acquisitions,” says Mr Toms. “With only two such quarters in the past 16, we feel that this might be too much to hope for.”Bolstered by its cash pile of more than $200m (£125m) most analysts expect Autonomy will announce its first $1bn deal in 2010, with names such as Fair Isaac in the frame.Such a 12-month period may be some time in coming."
603;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2010-01-04T22:17:10Z;America’s Cup teams arrive;;Final preparations began on Monday for the America’s Cup, sailing’s oldest and most prestigious trophy, as the Swiss team defending the title arrived in Valencia.The event was to have been raced in Ras-al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates until an American Supreme Court judge’s ruling last month forced a switch of venue following two years of legal wrangling.Titleholders Alinghi will face off against San Diego-based BMW-Oracle Racing in the 33rd edition of the event, which begins on February 8 with the first race in the best-of-three match.At its first attempt, Alinghi won the 31st America’s Cup in New Zealand in 2003, and then succeeded in defending it in Valencia in 2007.Previous competitions have involved about 10 challengers but this time Alinghi is defending the title against BMW-Oracle alone following repeated New York Supreme Court challenges over the rules.Alinghi’s 90ft catamaran – along with its masts and 20 support containers – arrived in Spain on Monday after a 14-day voyage by ship from the UAE, where the team had been training.BMW-Oracle Racing’s trimaran, with its controversial rigid “wing sail”, has also arrived in Valencia following a three-week trip from the US through the Panama Canal.“We understand the American challenger has also arrived in Valencia and hopefully both boats will be moored in the Dársena [inner harbour] and will provide a great spectacle,” said Grant Simmer, Alinghi design team co-ordinator.Alinghi completed a two-month training period on December 16 in the Gulf and the team sailed on a container ship the 4,500 nautical miles through the Suez Canal to return to their base in Valencia, which was where the 32nd America’s Cup match was staged.Alinghi plans to start sailing in Valencia mid-month and will focus on training for the 36 days that remain until the cup begins.
604;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-28T19:47:52Z;The year in review;;"On which deals this year will reputations will be made or lost? A few chief executives, most notably Warren Buffett, are prepared to wait years to be proved right. His purchase of Burlington Northern Santa Fe for Berkshire Hathaway will be seen as a masterstroke if a sluggish decade leaves the utility-like returns of a train company as the best available.For others, it is already possible to spot dangerous groupthink without knowing exactly which merger will prove least productive. Several technology companies have spent billions in the past 12 months buying into areas beyond their technical expertise. Software designer Oracle is trying to buy server maker Sun Microsystems, while Xerox and Dell have both made big bets that adding IT services to their hardware businesses will produce a seamlessly integrated, faster-growing whole. Rising competition as companies search for growth means not all these deals can end well.Had miner Rio Tinto sold part of itself to China’s Aluminium Corp (Chinalco) in June, it would have been a clear frontrunner for worst transaction. By default, raising $15bn via a rights issue instead ranks as one of the best decisions of the year. In comparison Ferrovial, the Spanish construction group, was forced to sell Gatwick airport for a loss, another sign that it was foolish to spend £10bn buying airport group BAA back in 2006. US taxpayers might also point out that their stake in General Motors will never be worth the $67bn needed to break even, but that takeover always owed more to political than financial logic.However, the outstanding deal of the year (where performance can already be judged) has to be Santander’s sale of a 16 per cent stake in its Brazil unit, giving Santander Brazil a market capitalisation of $34bn.

605;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-22T17:26:07Z;Nikkei closes at three-month high;;Stocks in the region enjoyed their best day for nearly three weeks as Tokyo’s surge to a three-month high outweighed more setbacks in Shanghai, where Chinese shares hit a seven-week low.The FTSE Asia-Pacific index rose 1 per cent to 224.87, its first advance in four sessions and the strongest performance since December 3.The Nikkei 225 Average led bourses in the region, up 1.9 per cent to 10,378.03, with the broader Topix index gaining 1.3 per cent to 903.06. “The market is being driven higher by gains in high-tech stocks on the back of a weaker yen and overseas news,” said Hajime Nakajima, of Comso Securities.A significant influence was overnight gains in the US’s Nasdaq Composite, which boosted technology stocks across the region.Chip-related shares were also buoyed by a report in Tokyo that Toshiba and SanDisk of the US were ploughing Y150bn ($1.7bn) into their joint venture.Toshiba climbed 4.7 per cent to Y518 while Elpida was another chipmaker benefiting from reports of higher investment, gaining 4.6 per cent to Y1,387.Samsung Electronics, Asia’s biggest chipmaker, rose 1.3 per cent to Won781,000 in Seoul and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s largest maker of custom chips, rose 1.1 per cent to T$62.90 in Taipei.In deal news, SPC Electronics soared 26.7 per cent to Y114 after Mitsubishi Electric Corp – up 3.7 per cent to Y676 – said it was planning to make it a fully owned subsidiary.The yen sinking to its lowest level against the dollar since October continued to spur exporters, with Nissan Motor jumping 6.1 per cent Y769.Toyota Motor rose 2.2 per cent to Y3,800 on plans to squeeze supplier costs 30 per cent by 2013 while truckmaker Isuzu climbed 6.8 per cent to Y172 on talks with General Motors on developing a next-generation diesel engine.The region’s worst performer was Shanghai. The Composite index fell 2.3 per cent to 3,050.52, its lowest since October 30, with nervousness over Beijing’s response to asset bubbles once again weighing on sentiment.“The policy front is still the biggest risk to the property industry,” said Zheng Tuo, of Good Hope Equity Investment. “Given the importance of property to China’s economy, investors are wondering if economic growth may be impacted next year.”Poly Real Estate hit its lowest since September 1 after dropping 2.8 per cent to Rmb21.52 and sector heavyweight China Vanke slid 3.9 per cent Rmb10.30.The Shanghai index has fallen nearly 10 per cent since late November but some traders said a drop by the end of the year below the pyschologically important 3,000 level could represent a buying opportunity.Hong Kong stocks at last broke a five-day losing streak, with banks advancing after a recent sell-off.The Hang Seng index rose 0.7 per cent to 21,092.04 as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s central bank, made upbeat comments on profit expectations for lenders. HSBC recovered from Monday’s near eight-week low to rise 0.8 per cent to HK$87.15.Gains for banks and miners lifted Sydney, with the S&P/ASX 200 index rising 1.5 per cent to 4,704.2. Westpac Banking Corp was up 3.4 per cent to A$24.15 while BHP Billiton gained 1.7 per cent to A$41.65.The Kospi index in Seoul advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,655.54, with Doosan Heavy Industries soaring 12 per cent to Won70,000.
606;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-18T22:11:10Z;Wall Street stages late rally;;Encouraging results from the technology sector lifted stocks on Friday, helping Wall Street pare some of this week’s losses.Shares in Oracle, the world’s second-largest software maker, climbed 6.4 per cent to $24.34 after it posted a higher profit for the second quarter than had been expected.The company also said it expected the European Union to clear its $7bn acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January.Research In Motion, the BlackBerry maker, offered further signs that demand for technology is beginning to improve.The Canadian company’s shares jumped 10.3 per cent to $70 after it reported higher sales and gave a more optimistic forecast than analysts had been anticipating.RIM has been aggressively trying to diversify its customer base away from business professionals, taking on rivals such as Apple and Motorola.But Palm limited some of the sector’s gains. The group announced its 10th straight quarterly loss in the second quarter after struggling to keep up with its competitors in the smartphone market. Its shares plunged 13.2 per cent to $10.17.The stronger dollar had pushed stocks into the red before midday but a final flurry of optimism in the last 30 minutes of trading pushed the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent to 1,102.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,328.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.5 per cent higher at 2,211.69.Volumes also hit an all-time high at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, largely because the session marked the expiration of December options and futures: a convergence known as quadruple witching. The NYSE said many investors were also settling their positions before the holiday period. “A number of positive earnings reports last night, particularly out of the technology sector, appear to be giving sentiment a boost today,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.However, he said indices did not seem ready to break above resistance levels. “With news flow generally expected to drop off dramatically for the next two holiday-shortened weeks, it appears that indices may remain trapped in their current trading channels for some time.”Over the week, the S&P was down 0.4 per cent, the Dow had lost 1.4 per cent but the Nasdaq was 1 per cent higher.Some of the biggest losses came from the financial sector after Citigroup announced plans to pay back government bail-out funds through a stock offering. However, the group ended up selling $17bn of shares at such a low price that the US government was forced to delay the partial sale of its stake.Also weighing on Citi stock this week was Terra Firma, the private equity group, which sued the bank for billions in damages, accusing it of misrepresentation during its disastrous 2007 acquisition of EMI.And Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, filed an arbitration claim against Citi, seeking damages in excess of $4bn. Over the week, Citigroup shares fell 15.2 per cent to $3.35.Stocks suffered further after the Federal Reserve highlighted on Wednesday its intention to shut down some of its liquidity facilities as the economy improves. Some analysts said the market had already begun to price in next year’s expected rate hike.While the consumer staples sector weighed on the market in early trading on Friday, a series of upbeat announcements helped lift investor confidence.Nike, the world’s largest athletic shoe maker, forecast a return to revenue growth in the next quarter, lifting its shares 1.9 per cent to $64.42.CarMax, the country’s largest used car dealer, beat estimates for the third quarter. It rose 7 per cent to $23.35. However, the company said conditions still remained tough and it had no current plans to restart expansion.

A sudden lurch higher for the dollar as European markets were closing for the week left global stocks on the back foot, though US stocks gained later in the day as the dollar pared its gains.Gold and oil ended the week on a high note, as traders fretted about geopolitical spats.The FTSE World index dropped as much as 1.8 per cent as the greenback reversed earlier losses to burst through $1.44 to the euro and above 78.1 on a trade-weighted basis, its highest level since early September.But the dollar later pared its gains, rising only 0.1 per cent to 77.73 on a trade weighted basis. Against the euro, it was flat at $1.4342 by the time the markets closed in New York.The pullback came too late for European bourses, which were dragged into the red. Still wary of the “carry trade” strategy, equity investors had sold off as the dollar showed signs of renewed vigour earlier in the day.After being up most of the day, London’s FTSE 100 tumbled at the close to finish down 0.4 per cent to 5,197, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 0.5 per cent to 1,013. Financials did most of the damage and the FTSE Global Bank index fell 1 per cent.The S&P 500 dipped 0.2 per cent to 1,094 but after the dollar pared its gains the benchmark closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,102.47. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5 per cent to 2,211.69 following good results from RIM and Oracle.The ‘quadruple witching’ of options and futures expiry provided some added spice, with 500m shares traded on the NYSE in the first few minutes of the session.The dollar also received support from haven flows as traders had to cope with a couple of geopolitical-induced wobbles – namely, talk of an Iranian incursion into an Iraq oil field (initially denied, but later confirmed), and chatter about a coup in Pakistan (denied).These worries saw oil jump above $74 a barrel, though it was later up 0.9 per cent at $73.29.Gold, which has sported a close inverse correlation to the dollar, managed to maintain its earlier advance, even as the buck rallied – perhaps a sign the precious metal was again attracting haven flows. Gold rose 1.2 per cent to $1,112.Another potentially worrying development for market bulls was the continued decline in the Baltic Dry Index. The BDI, which is a measure of shipping costs for commodities and hence used by many as a gauge for the health of the global economy, fell 3.5 per cent to 3,258. This is the 10th day in a row it has dribbled lower, and the BDI has now lost 30 per cent since hitting its high for the year a month ago.In government bond markets, the benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points to 3.54 per cent following Thursday’s double-digit drop.The demand for government debt had come after the greenback had soared to three-and-a-half month highs as traders reassessed their expectations for US monetary policy in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s comments the previous day.This had battered riskier assets such as stocks and commodities, and bourses in Asia on Friday took their lead from New York’s subsequent 1.2 per cent declineThe FTSE Asia-Pacific index dipped 0.4 per cent – but Asian exchanges also had some difficulties of their own to contend with.Chinese stocks had another miserable session, losing 2.1 per cent to 3,114, and taking the week’s declines to 4 per cent. Real estate companies were under the cosh after Beijing revealed measures to clamp down on property speculation by making it more difficult to buy government land.Banking stocks across the region also suffered, after hopes earlier in the week that the sector would get as much as 10 years to bolster its capital were dashed. The grouping led Hong Kong’s Hang Seng to a three-week low, off 0.8 per cent at 21,176.Banks in Japan, which had taken particular glee at the ultimately incorrect take on the capital proposals, fell back accordingly, helping to drag the Nikkei 225 down 0.2 per cent to 10,142. The FTSE Global Bank index fell 0.3 per cent.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan reiterated it would keep interest rates at ultra-low levels in order to combat deflation. This took the legs from under the yen, which fell 0.5 per cent to Y90.38 against the dollar and lost 0.5 per cent to Y129.63 versus the euro.The yield on Japanese 10-year bonds fell 1 basis point to 1.24 per cent.In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.4 per cent to 4,650 as the previous day’s tumble in commodity prices caught up with resource stocks.

609;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Polar Capital outperforms technology indices;;Polar Capital Technology Trust’s view that the global technology sector was rapidly dividing into newer, emerging investments and older, fading stocks enabled the fund manager to outperform technology indices in the first half.Net assets, in sterling terms, rose 13.6 per cent to 246.21p, or £311.5m ($506m) in total, over the six months to October 31. This compared with a rise of 11.5 per cent in the Dow Jones World Technology Index.The strength of sterling masked the strong performance in Polar’s portfolio of global technology stocks in the middle part of the year as investors were drawn to the sector’s cheap valuations, strong balance sheets, and potential for growth.In local currency terms, the Dow Jones Technology index rose 24 per cent as smartphones emerged and the industry rapidly adjusted to the explosive growth of data.The fund, set up by former managers at Henderson, saw its own performance recognised in November when it won the FTSE TechMark award for statistically best performing technology fund in the year to September.Shares in Polar, which have risen 80 per cent in the last year, traded up 2½p at 236.3p on Wednesday. Analysts at brokers Killick & Co said the fund’s share price remained 14 per cent below its net asset value of December 14.But Ben Rogoff, the fund’s manager, said the quarter showed the industry was beginning to split between the old guard of technology companies, such as SAP, Oracle and Cisco, and newer companies whose business was based on cloud computing, such as Salesforce.com, and mobile internet.“The third-quarter earnings cycle saw a proper divergences between new cycle and old cycle stocks,” said Mr Rogoff.As a result Mr Rogoff increased his holding in Google and Apple, while his holding in Noka fell from 2.1 per cent to 0.8 per cent.However his holding in Microsoft rose from 4 per cent to 4.8 per cent in anticipation of a sales uplift from Windows 7.Investment income fell from £1.7m to £1.5m while it turned an interim pre-tax profit of £37.7m compared with a loss of £58m a year ago. Earnings per share were 29.46p from a loss of 43.34p a year ago.

The acquisition of the US natural gas producer includes about $10bn in XTO debt and is the eighth-largest energy deal since records began, according to Thomson Reuters. While XTO shares rose 15.4 per cent to $47.86, Exxon lost 4.3 per cent to $69.69.The S&P 500 closed at its highest level since October last year, climbing 0.7 per cent to 1,114.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,501.05 and the Nasdaq added 1 per cent to 2,212.10.However, Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said investors were still cautious and focusing on the upcoming FOMC meeting this week. “The Fed is not going to raise rates but in their communiqué they will probably be less dovish than they have been. They may need to raise interest rates sooner, rather than later.”Citigroup weighed on the market after announcing it would issue $17.5bn in common stock and $3.5bn in tangible equity units in a move to repay government bail-out funds.The deal will end the loss-sharing agreement between Citi and the US government, putting an end to the pay restrictions that had accompanied the funds.In a similar move, Bank of America sold $18.3bn of shares earlier this month to exit the troubled asset relief programme.Citigroup was down 6.3 per cent at $3.70. After early losses, the financial sector closed 0.6 per cent higher.Elsewhere, Visa rose 4.2 per cent to $84.77 after the stock was raised from “neutral” to “outperform” at Robert W. Baird & Co. Shares in the world’s largest electronic payments network were also buoyed by the company’s impending inclusion in the S&P 500 index.Visa, which has risen more than 60 per cent so far this year, will replace Ciena, the network communications company. Ciena shares fell 4.4 per cent to $10.99 on Monday.MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, will also be dropped from the index and its shares dropped 7.6 per cent at $3.39.In other deal news, shares of Sun Microsystems jumped 11 per cent to $9.28 after EU regulators said they were optimistic a “satisfactory outcome” over Oracle‘s takeover bid was possible. The $7bn takeover deal has been under scrutiny due to competition concerns.The European Commission has until January 27 to clear or block the bid. However, last month, Steve Mills, head of IBM’s software division and one of Oracle’s biggest rivals, told the Financial Times that the acquisition did not raise any significant antitrust issues and was likely to close soon. Oracle shares gained 2.3 per cent to $23.31.Luna Innovations, which makes technology for medical, telecoms, energy and defence companies, soared 61.9 per cent to $2.38 after the group submitted a reorganisation plan to emerge from bankruptcy. The company also settled all claims with Hansen Medical, the medical robotics group.Luna shares had plummeted earlier this year after the company was ordered to pay Hansen about $36m after allegedly misappropriating trade secrets belonging to its rival.Hansen shares also gained 8.6 per cent to $2.90 following the announcement.Terra Industries dropped 2 per cent to $34.58 after the fertiliser producer rejected a $3.9bn takeover bid from rival fertiliser maker CF Industries Holdings.CF boosted its bid earlier this month but Terra said the deal still undervalued the company. Shares in CF, which has itself been trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid by Agrium, fell 0.3 per cent to $89.75.Shares in Amazon.com fell 2.1 per cent to $131.38 after Barron’s said market expectations for the online retailer may be too high as the stock has more than doubled this year.
611;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-14T18:00:47Z;Oracle pledge pushes Sun deal forward;;Oracle on Monday appeared close to resolving the issues that have delayed its $7.4bn purchase of Sun Microsystems for months with Europe’s antitrust watchdog.The US technology group unveiled a 10-point list of “public commitments” it said should reassure the European Commission that MySQL, the open-source database business owned by Sun, would remain “a competitive force” after the change in ownership.European competition officials had been concerned that, if Oracle took control of the business unconditionally, it could have an incentive to suppress or restructure a product that is given away for free and poses a disruptive threat to its own business.Monday’s commitments did not amount to formal legal remedies offered to Brussels, and the US group is not expected to make any moves in that direction, according to people familiar with the situation.But the public pledges were nevertheless given a warm welcome by the Commission – which in turn pushed Sun’s shares almost 9.9 per cent higher to $9.20.“Today’s announcement by Oracle of a series of undertakings to customers, developers and users of MySQL is an important new element to be taken into account in the ongoing proceedings,” the Commission said.“In this context, competition commissioner Neelie Kroes recalls and confirms her statement of December 9 that she is optimistic that the case will have a satisfactory outcome, while ensuring that the transaction will not have an adverse impact on effective competition in the European database market.”Both Oracle and Brussels would be relieved to put the difficulties over MySQL behind them. Sun’s business has been declining, and the uncertainty surrounding the merger has cost it customers.Meanwhile, the Commission has been in the unenviable position of holding up a merger between two large US companies that had already been cleared by antitrust regulators in the US.The commitments themselves include increased spending on MySQL research and development, the creation of customer and storage engine vendor advisory boards, and a promise to maintain the MySQL reference manual.Oracle also made certain licence-related pledges – which will be incorporated into contractual arrangements with storage vendors who currently hold commercial licenses with Sun.Several competition specialists not directly involved in the case described them as “face-saving”, and questioned why such pledges could not have been offered or negotiated many months ago.But the commission said: “Oracle’s binding contractural undertakings to storage engine vendors regarding copyright non-assertion and the extension over a period of up to five years of the terms and conditions of existing commercial licences are significant new facts.”Officials in Brussels now have until January 27 to make a final decision on whether to allow the deal.
612;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-10T21:40:43Z;Oracle accuses Brussels over Sun evidence;;Oracle executives and their advisers on Thursday accused Europe’s top competition regulator of misrepresenting customer evidence as they tried to overturn objections to the US group’s proposed $7.4bn purchase of Sun Microsystems.Oral hearings, held in private, over the deal began in Brussels on Thursday morning and will continue on Friday.Officials at the European Commission are concerned about the impact the merger could have on the database market – in particular Oracle’s control of MySQL, an open source database company bought last year by Sun.Although this is a relatively small part of the overall deal, critics say Oracle would have an incentive to suppress or restructure a product that is given away for free and poses a disruptive threat to its own business. The other big players in the market are IBM and Microsoft.The Commission has based its concerns partly on the results of a market survey, and the responses generated from database users.But on Thursday Oracle was understood to have argued that customer comments were misrepresented and cherry-picked. According to its reply to the Commission, which has been seen by the Financial Times and which formed the basis for Thursday’s presentation, Oracle claims “many if not most” of the two dozen customers cited in the Commission’s statement of objections “do not support the Commission’s theory of harm”.The US group also argues that the views of some of the biggest-name customers have been “simply ignored” by Commission officials – including the likes of General Electric, Fujitsu, Siemens and Nasdaq.The weight of the evidence, Oracle maintains, is all the more important because Commission officials are pursuing a “novel theory dependent on hypothetical future conduct” – namely, Oracle’s desire to degrade MySQL. But, the company maintains, from a legal standpoint, the Commission needs to show not that Oracle has the incentive to harm MySQL but also that this is the “most likely outcome”.In reality, it claims the plan is to “substantially increase” the research and development budget for MySQL.Lined up against Oracle at the hearing are SAP, Microsoft, and Monty Widenius, founder of MySQL.Commission officials, meanwhile, have continued to signal that they are hopeful the concerns can be overcome by attaching appropriate conditions to the deal. The Commission has until January 27 to reach a final decision.
613;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-10T02:47:10Z;Oracle summons support for EU hearing;;A number of big corporate and government technology users are set to appear at a hearing in Brussels starting on Thursday to back Oracle’s claim that its planned acquisition of Sun Microsystems would not harm competition in the database software market.The move comes after Neelie Kroes, the European Union’s competition commissioner, said on Wednesday that she was “optimistic” that a “satisfactory outcome” to the dispute could be reached. Her comments raised hopes on Wall Street that the stand-off with regulators that has prevented Oracle from completing the Sun deal could be resolved.According to a person familiar with the schedule for the hearing, users that would lend their support to Oracle’s case include Ericsson, Vodafone, Sabre and BBVA, as well as the UK Atomic Weapons Agency and National Health Service.The line-up of prominent customers is an attempt to counter fears over the future of MySQL, an open source software company that was bought by Sun last year and which Brussels has argued is a significant rival to Oracle’s own core database software business.Critics say that acquiring MySQL would leave Oracle in a position to stifle the business. “The most common competitor [to MySQL] is Oracle and usually it is only Oracle,” Monty Widenius, the founder of the open source company and a leading critic of the deal, told reporters in Brussels. Mr Widenius left MySQL after selling out to Sun early last year for $1bn.Oracle claims that the two companies serve different parts of the database market and are not seen by customers as substitutes, a view that has been backed by many in the tech world.The tech clients appearing at the hearing have pointed to an effort by Oracle to draw attention to the scarcity of customers that have been prepared to speak out against the deal. The Commission’s formal statement of objections contains the names of only five technology corporate users that believe MySQL is a serious rival to Oracle, according to one person who has seen the document.Mr Widenius is set to appear at the Brussels hearing to back the Commission’s case, along with Oracle rivals SAP and Microsoft. However, the head of software at another big rival, IBM, has said that he does not believe the deal causes serious concerns.Oracle has also called two prominent figures from the open source world to support its arguments: Marten Mickos, a former chief executive officer of MySQL, and Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and founder of the Software Freedom Law Center.
614;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-09T21:37:39Z;Steelmaker strength lifts Wall Street;;Steelmakers and renewed dollar weakness helped drag Wall Street out of the red on Wednesday.The revision of Spain’s outlook to negative by Standard and Poor’s had sent stocks lower for most of the day, adding to lingering concerns from the previous session about the pace of the global economic recovery.On Tuesday, Wall Street suffered the steepest losses for more than a week after Fitch downgraded Greece’s sovereign debt and fears resurfaced over Dubai’s debt crisis. However, an unexpected rise in US wholesale inventories in October helped mitigate losses. A sharp decline in the dollar in late trading boosted materials stocks further, allowing Wall Street to break this week’s losing streak.“Some pre-market optimism was squelched by the Spain news,” said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated Investors. “In the back of everyone’s mind are the questions: who is the next Dubai? Are there additional downgrades to be made? Are other large western nations also going to be looked at with a more critical eye by the rating agencies?”He added: “Whether these landmines go off in the coming months or not depends on the rate at which the global economy stabilises and improves.”The S&P 500 finally closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,095.95, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 10,337.05 and the Nasdaq Composite also edged 0.5 per cent up to 2,183.73.Steelmakers helped to lift the market. AK Steelclimbed 6.2 per cent to $20.49 after announcing that it would increase the price of its carbon steel products due to rising demand and higher costs. The optimism spread to its rivals, boosting United States Steel 5.7 per cent to $46.74.Shares of 3M gained 3.4 per cent to $79.74 after the diversified manufacturer was upgraded by Citigroup from “hold” to “buy”. Citigroup also gave a boost to Sprint Nextel, the country’s third-largest wireless carrier, raising its stock to “buy”. Its shares climbed 5.6 per cent to $4.13.Elsewhere in the technology sector, shares in Sun Microsystems edged 0.7 per cent higher to $8.55 after Neelie Kroes, European competition commissioner, said she was optimistic about Oracle’s plans to buy the technology company.The comments from the commissioner came ahead of today’s hearing that could help regulators decide whether or not to block the deal. Oracle was up 0.2 per cent to $21.95.Meanwhile, the European Commission dropped its antitrust probe into Rambus, the memory chip manufacturer, after the company agreed to cut royalties. Rambus was charged in 2007 of abusing its leading position in the market by claiming unreasonable payments. The shares, which have still soared more than 30 per cent this year in spite of concerns over regulation, were up 3.2 per cent to $21.94 on Wednesday.However, the consumer discretionary sector weighed on the market from the opening bell. Movado Group, the watch-maker, suffered some of the biggest losses, plunging 12.9 per cent to $9.45.The group, which designs and manufacturers watches for brands such as Hugo Boss, made an unexpected loss in the third quarter.Movado said its sales had fallen as retailers went out of business or slashed stock levels in anticipation of lower consumer spending.Men’s Wearhouse, the men’s clothing chain, fell 7.2 per cent to $20.26 after forecasting a loss for the fourth quarter.Tuxedo rentals, which contribute about a fifth of the group’s revenue, have continued to rise. But sales of new suits have fallen and the group said it was also facing higher costs.CKE Restaurants, which owns the Carl’s Jr hamburger chain, fell 3 per cent to $8.39 after posting a lower profit for the third quarter than analysts had been expecting.On Tuesday, shares in McDonald’s suffered their biggest daily drop since July after the group posted its second successive month of sales declines at its US restaurants.Among pharmaceutical groups, Repligen slumped 16.3 per cent to $3.91 after reporting disappointing results from trials of its pancreas imaging agent.
615;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-09T15:45:00Z;Rambus settles chip charges with Brussels;;Rambus, the US technology company, has resolved its two-year high-profile dispute with Europe’s top antitrust regulator without paying a fine, after the watchdog on Wednesday accepted legally-binding commitments that will cut and cap the company’s royalties on key patents.The case, which followed complaints from the likes of Germany’s Infineon and South Korea’s Hynix, had centred on claims that the US company – whose technology improves the performance of computer memory chips – engaged in deceptive conduct when dealing with an industry standard-setting body.Two years ago, the European Commission formally alleged that Rambus hid its plans to patent part of the technology which was eventually put into an industry standard.That “patent ambush”, officials argued, had put the company in a position to charge “unreasonable royalties” later on when others adopted the standard.But last June, Rambus offered to settle the matter, by providing licences to customers of its technology with royalty rates capped at relatively low levels.As part of the suggested deal, which followed months of discussions between the regulator and company, Rambus would not make any admission of wrongdoing or pay any fine, and the commission would not issue any finding against the company.On Wednesday, after seeking the views of interested third parties, the commission said it was satisfied that the deal addressed its competition concerns. Rambus’ commitments will now become legally binding.Under these, the US company will charge zero royalties for SDR and DDR dynamic random-access memory (D-Ram) devices which were adopted when Rambus was a member of the standard-setting body, known as Jedec. It will also offer a maximum royalty rate of 1.5 per cent on five-year worldwide licences for later generations of Jedec D-Ram devices.The deal allows Rambus, which has always maintained that it did not violate any rules, to put the alleged patent ambush episode behind it. The European charges had followed similar claims by the US’s Federal Trade Commission. But in April 2008 a US appeals court overturned the FTC’s determination that Rambus acted improperly and the FTC subsequently dropped the case.Yesterday, EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said that there had only been marginal changes to the proposed deal announced in June. But she stressed that the case was significant because “it highlights the crucial importance of transparency in the process of setting technical standards”.She said competition officials intended to put out revised draft guidance on standard-setting early next year and invite comments, as part of a broader revision of some its antitrust guidelines.Separately, Ms Kroes said that she was hopeful that a solution could be found to the problems surrounding the proposed Oracle-Sun merger. The tie-up of the two US companies has been held up by EU competition officials who are worried about the potential implications for MySQL, an open-source database company acquired by Sun last year.Hearings are due to start before the EU regulator on Thursday. But Ms Kroes said: “I am still optimistic that we can find a solution”.

617;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Rival dismisses Oracle/Sun antitrust issues;;Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems did not raise any significant antitrust issues and was likely to close soon in spite of objections raised in Brussels, according to Steve Mills, head of IBM’s software division and one of Oracle’s biggest rivals.Mr Mills’ comments, in an interview with the Financial Times, came as Oracle prepared for a two-day hearing before European regulators starting on Thursday.Europe’s concerns have centred on Oracle’s acquisition of MySQL, an open-source database company acquired by Sun last year.Critics claim MySQL is an important rival to Oracle’s own core database business.But the IBM software chief said MySQL posed little direct challenge to database products from groups such as IBM and Oracle.“It’s certainly not the most sophisticated database in the marketplace,” Mr Mills said. “It’s not used for sophisticated query and analysis things.”MySQL has been most widely used in the high-volume but relatively simple task of running websites, rather than as a replacement for the more complex corporate databases.Mr Mills suggested that there were plenty of alternatives to the free software.“MySQL comes in at the bottom of the market. There is a lot of ‘freeware’ out there today.”He said Oracle should do more to outline how it would maintain the open-source aspect of MySQL’s software, and he expected reassurances in this area to resolve the European concerns and lead to the Sun deal closing early next year.Suggestions that the hiatus over the deal – which has approval in the US– could be resolved by appropriate conditions have been fuelled by comments from European Union officials.Since sending out a formal statement of objections last month, they have said that they remain hopeful remedies could be found to resolve their concerns.Nevertheless, barring an 11th-hour agreement on that front, the hearing will go ahead in Brussels on Thursday, with Oracle and Sun having five hours to make their case.Interested parties lined up against them are likely to include SAP, Microsoft and MySQL founder Monty Widenius.If there is no settlement, Brussels will have until January 27 to make a final decision on the deal.An opponent of the deal said IBM’s comments were an indication that competition concerns were well founded.“They would like MySQL to be confined and lose relevance because they, too, feel competitive pressure from it,” Florian Mueller, acting for Mr Widenius, said.
618;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-07T09:40:50Z;Buffett on sale;;Value is in the eye of the beholder, even when valuing value investors. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway can now be had for 1.18 times book value, which – depending on how one looks at it – is cheap or expensive.Closed-end funds typically trade at a discount to book of 5 to 15 per cent. Even well-run conglomerates sell at a discount to break-up value. Loews, with similar holdings to Berkshire, is at a 10 per cent discount.But Berkshire is, of course, no ordinary conglomerate, so a mere 18 per cent premium to book is among the cheapest entry-points in decades. Over the past 18 years investors have paid 1.7 times book on average. Anyone who balked at paying 1.3 times in 1991, as the US was exiting a recession, missed out on a tenfold return. Since 1964, Berkshire’s book value has grown more than 400,000 per cent versus 5,000 per cent for US stocks overall.While he touts growth in book value and not share price as the best measure of his prowess, Mr Buffett stresses that it is but a crude approximation of “intrinsic value”. Of Berkshire’s $155bn market value, some $95bn can be ascribed to publicly available debt and equity holdings that deserve no premium. The rest, mostly insurance and utility investments, are tougher to value, but have publicly traded counterparts. Then there are opaque derivatives bets. But hardest to value of all is how Mr Buffett allocates the prodigious cash flow from these holdings. No accounting convention can capture his sterling record.Berkshire’s cheapness may reflect fear of dilution from its pending acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Or it may mark realisation that the 79-year-old Oracle of Omaha and his 85-year-old partner Charlie Munger will not be around to allocate their capital for another 46 years. It is hard to put a price on their intrinsic value, but the market appears to be trying.
619;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-12-06T20:18:12Z;Silicon Valley turns its gaze to Wall Street;;Silicon Valley’s technology stock marketing machine is cranking back into high gear. The worst drought in public stock offerings in more than three decades has left a dearth of new listings for young technology companies.Now the Valley’s rising stars are talking of a return to Wall Street next year, with the coming-out of a “class of 2010” that will represent the strongest batch of tech companies to hit the stock market in years.It is hard not to see a big dose of wishful thinking behind the expectations.“It’s been an awful period,” says Matt Regan, a managing director at San Francisco investment bank WR Hambrecht. Initial public offerings have plunged since the start of 2008, with barely 50 operating companies going public since then. That compares with an annual batch of more than 400 in many years in the 1980s and 1990s.For the venture capitalists who supply the money that keeps the Valley’s innovation engine revving, the bad times have been going on longer than that. It is now more than a decade since the US start-up finance industry has returned more cash to its investors than it has taken in.Historically, IPOs have led to some of the biggest paydays. Without a big rebound in public investor interest, the model on which the venture capital industry is based could be under threat.The private equity firms that piled into tech in recent years are also busy primping their best IPO candidates as they seek to restore the flagging confidence of their own investors.“There’s a dance going on between the venture capitalists and private equity firms and their limited partners,” said Susan Mac Cormac, head of the practice that covers renewable energy and other “cleantech” companies at law firm Morrison & Foerster.“You’re going to hear about a lot of companies going public, but far fewer will actually go out.”Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida, estimates that IPOs in the US are likely to return to the 160 or so a year they averaged in 2004-2007, well below the levels of the 1980s and 1990s.Wall Street no longer has an appetite for the very small companies that used to be able to tap public capital, he says.Yet even if the actual number of IPOs next year fails to meet the overheated expectations of some in the Valley, the conditions look set for a marked recovery – barring a renewed market or economic setback.The rebound in the Nasdaq index, up 73 per cent from its low point in April, has revived the appetite for tech IPOs and tilted the balance in favour of equity rather than debt finance. “The equity markets have come back faster than the financing markets,” says one private equity investor.Two recent deals confirmed the change in mood and triggered the race by other tech firms to prepare their own public filings: the $650m raised in August by Avago, a chip firm that was the subject of a buy-out in 2005, and the $380m in September for A123Systems, a lossmaking maker of advanced batteries.If these early signs of demand solidify, there is certainly no shortage of supply ready to meet it. To hear Valley financiers talk, the batch of potential newcomers waiting in the wings will bear comparison with some of the most impressive IPO vintages of the past – even 1986, when Microsoft, Oracle and Adobe went public.The marketing hype revolves largely around two sectors: the internet, and “cleantech”.The boom in social media and online advertising since early this decade has so far led to relatively few significant public offerings – with the clear exception of Google’s 2004 debut, which remains the stand-out IPO of the era.Social networks Facebook and LinkedIn are now high up on many public investors’ wish-lists, though both have been working hard to damp anticipation.Having reached profitability and with no immediate need for capital, companies like these can afford to stand back and pick their moment rather than risk rushing to Wall Street before conditions are right.A number of ambitious renewable energy and other “green technology” companies are also lining up to go public, though these companies have demanding capital requirements and are less assured of a good reception. These companies often need to expand production quickly to gain scale, but may still be jumping through regulatory hoops before they can begin operating, says Ms Mac Cormac.“You’re going to have a lot of energy companies needing to go public before they’re producing energy,” she adds. As Silicon Valley turns back to Wall Street, that will represent the biggest test of all.
620;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-11-26T18:04:50Z;The final frontier of business advantage;;"Business intelligence, information intelligence, business analytics: whatever you call it, all the evidence is that ways of turning a company’s raw data into information that can be used to improve performance and achieve competitive advantage is the topic du jour in many business leaders’ minds.A survey carried out this year by the US-based consultancy Forrester Research revealed that of more than 1,000 IT decision makers canvassed in North America and Europe, more than two thirds were considering, piloting, implementing or expanding business intelligence (BI) systems.“Even in these tough economic times, virtually nobody in our surveys says they are retrenching or reducing their business intelligence initiatives,” says Boris Evelson, a principal analyst for Forrester with more than 30 years experience of BI implementation behind him.What is BI management? It is not about the technical nitty gritty of data warehousing or cleansing technology. While technologies are important – and most are good and effective, according to Mr Evelson – BI management is about ways of systematically making the most of customer information– what it is and what you can do with it.More prosaically, it is everything that has to be done to raw data before they can be manipulated to facilitate better decision making.It is also about understanding the business and its processes well enough to know what questions should be asked of the data to improve performance.The basic idea was pioneered more than a decade ago by the US computer manufacturer Teradata, which combined supercomputer performance with sophisticated software to scan and detect trends and patterns in huge volumes of data.But it was expensive and ahead of its time. Today, high-performance, low-cost computer systems and cheap memory mean that enterprises can and are collecting and storing data in unprecedented amounts.However, they are struggling to make sense of what they have.In Mr Evelson’s words: “We have to find the data, we have to extract it, we have to integrate it, we have to map apples to oranges, we have to clean it up, we have to aggregate it, we have to model it and we have to store it in something like a data warehouse.“We have to understand what kind of metrics we want to track – times, customers, regions and then, and only then, can we start reporting.”Everybody agrees there is nothing simple about these operations. “It is a very complex endeavour,” says Mr Evelson, “and that is why this market is very immature.”The business opportunity for BI software has not been lost on IT companies and there has already been significant consolidation in the market, with IBM acquiring, among others, Cognos; SAP buying Business Objects; and Oracle purchasing Hyperion to add BI strings to their respective bows.Microsoft offers BI software called SharePoint Server and there is considerable interest in open source BI software from younger companies such as Pentaho and Jaspersoft.IBM alone reckons to have spent $12bn and trained 4,000 consultants over the past few years to develop the tools and knowledge which will encourage intelligence management in its customers.Ambuj Goyal, who leads the company’s information management initiative, argues that it is a new approach that will “turn the world a little bit upside down”.“Business efficiency over the past 20 years was all about automating a process – enterprise resource planning [ERP] for example. It generated huge efficiencies for businesses but is no longer a [competitive] differentiator.“In the past two or three years we have started to look at information as a strategic capital asset for the organisation. This will generate 20, 30 or 40 per cent improvements in the way we run businesses as opposed to the 3 or 5 per cent improvements we achieved before.”But revolutions are rarely pain-free. According to the Forrester survey: “For many large enterprises, BI remains and will continue to be the ‘last frontier’ of competitive differentiation.“Unfortunately, as the demand for pervasive and comprehensive BI applications continues to increase, the complexity, cost and effort of large-enterprise BI implementations increases as well.“As a result, the great examples of successful implementations among Forrester’s clients are outnumbered by the volume of underperforming BI environments.”In fact, more than two thirds of users questioned said they found BI applications hard or very hard to learn, navigate and use.The business case for BI management is not helped by the difficulty of making a strong case for return on investment.It is, for example, hard to decide which tools and processes should be included in the assessment – Microsoft’s SharePoint is much more than a BI tool, for example, but separating out which strands are contributing to improved revenues and which are not is a challenge.As Mr Evelson notes: “The grey boundary lines around which process and tools to include, the multiple BI components that typically need to be customised and integrated, and the frequent unpredictability of BI system integration efforts all make BI business cases an effort not for the faint of heart.”How, then, should executives think about business intelligence management? Royce Bell, information management specialist with the consultancy Accenture takes a robustly pragmatic view: “Business is made up of processes. Some of them may interact with the outside world, but there is a definite chain of events.“All that business intelligence is supposed to inform, is any decision along that chain of events. The question an executive should be asking is: ‘At this point in the chain, what information do I need?’.“Going through each and every one of your processes to be able to ask that question is hard. People are disappointed because they haven’t been able to get wisdom simply by piling all the data in one place.“That [data warehousing and mining] sounds more exciting and more fun than going through your processes to determine what you need.”Mr Bell believes that many executives are suspicious of the quality of the information provided by BI software: they think the data are “rubbish”, and there is no doubt that transforming data into intelligence requires clean data.Roger Llewellyn is chief executive of the UK software group Kognitio, which has responsibility for analysing, among other things, telephone calls made by customers of British Telecom and store purchases that use the Nectar loyalty card of supermarket chain, J Sainsbury.He says that up to 80 per cent of the price of a new contract can be the cost of cleaning the data – converting, in one case, 15 data types to a single standard.The Sainsbury contract involves the analysis of the 20bn items purchased in the chain’s stores every nine months – enough, if typed on paper, to make an in-tray pile almost 17kms high.How can this huge volume of bits and bytes be turned into useful information?Mr Llewellyn gives the example of skin creams sold to counter stretch marks. Generally bought predominantly by women, if particular stores show high sales volumes, there are likely to be a lot of pregnancies in those areas – an alert for the store manager to stock up on maternity magazines, baby food and clothing.And if most of the clothing bought is blue, there will be a lot of baby boys in the region: “From buying a jar of stretch cream, I’ve almost got you for life,” Mr Llewellyn beams.James McGeever, chief financial officer of the US company NetSuite, which markets BI management software, underlines the importance of clean, unambiguous data in breaking down “silos” – data stored in different places and formats within an organisation: “I believe that if the same piece of data exists in two places then one will be wrong.”The NetSuite answer for its customers is to convert all the data to one consistent type and store it in one repository: “The physical process of loading the data is not as tough as it may sound. It’s actually deciding what data to store there and how to organise your workflows that is the difficult part.”NetSuite provides executives with tailored “dashboards”, a visual representation of the information important to their jobs.A well-designed dashboard providing the right amount of pertinent information is a crucial part of BI according to Peter Lumley and Stephen Black of PA Consulting.They point out that it is often forgotten that managers have limited time to absorb and act on information which, in any case, may be imperfect – if it was perfect, decision making would be no chore at all. A well-designed dashboard can help managers make the best possible decision from incomplete information.The information, of course, has to be trusted and that is where technology can play an important part – in the automatic roll-up of data to a central repository: “Every time you go through a stage with manual intervention you have the opportunity for time delay and misinterpretation,” Mr Lumley argues.And these mis-steps are precisely what business intelligence management hopes to avoid."

622;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-11-20T17:39:23Z;Oracle wins more time for Sun merger;;The European Commission has agreed to a request by Oracle to extend the deadline for approval of its proposed $7.4bn merger with Sun Microsystems.The Commission, which has been holding up the deal because of antitrust concerns over Oracle’s acquisition of a Sun-owned open source database company, said that the US software group had requested the extension in order to “have the opportunity to further develop its arguments in relation to the Commission’s concerns”.The extension will push back the latest date for a Commission decision from January 19 to January 27.The move triggered speculation on Friday of a possible softening in the stand-off which has developed between the company and the European regulator. But Oracle said that the delay in the timetable had been made to allow more time given next week’s Thanksgiving holiday in the US.In the absence of any discussions on concessions, the next likely step would be for Oracle to ask for an oral hearing in Brussels, although it is not obliged to do so. If a hearing does go ahead, this now seems likely to take place in mid-December.The Sun deal, which has already secured approval from antitrust authorities in the US, had been held up because of the Commission’s worries about Oracle’s gaining control of MySQL, an open source database company which Sun acquired last year.Critics say that Oracle would have an incentive to suppress or restructure a product which is currently given away and poses a disruptive threat to its own business.This month, Brussels sent a formal statement of objections to Oracle, and revealed that customer complaints had been one of the driving forces behind its concerns over the deal’s impact on the database market. That prompted a fierce response from the software group, which said it would “vigorously oppose” the Commission’s position.Oracle’s frustration appears to have been intensified by the fact that the MySQL business is only a small part of the Sun deal.Since then, senior commission officials have indicated that they hope the situation could be resolved through appropriate remedies. Last week, for example, EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: “Let’s be optimistic . . . let’s find out if they [Oracle] could take us to a point where we say: ‘Okay, we can take the result as a satisfying result for fair competition’.”
623;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-11-15T17:58:10Z;Oracle v Brussels;;The mere possibility that a $7.4bn technology merger in California might be blocked by regulators nearly half the world away over a fly-speck of a business shows how odd the dispute over Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems has become.At the centre of this dispute is an open-source software unit of Sun that has annual revenues of only $70m. According to European regulators, in an official complaint issued last week, Oracle’s assumption of the MySQL software could thwart competition for its own, far larger database business. The US Department of Justice, in a clear rebuke to Brussels, pointed out that it had found no problems with the transaction.Given the nature of open source software, the numbers don’t tell the full story about the significance of MySQL. Nevertheless, they still make the point eloquently that this is a side-issue that should never have been allowed to threaten a far bigger deal, let alone stir up regulatory differences across the Atlantic.Both sides have stumbled into this disagreement by accident. Having already won clearance in Washington, Oracle tried to rush its deal through in Brussels without showing due deference to regulators there, and has paid the price. But in asserting its right to form its own view, the European Commission is now in danger of over-reach. There is still time to overcome this stand-off and a compromise is still the most likely outcome, but it will require a greater willingness on both sides to give ground than has so far been the case.Thankfully, this is not a symptom of deeper transatlantic policy differences. Since the row that followed Europe’s blocking of General Electric’s proposed acquisition of Honeywell eight years ago, regulators in the US and Europe have aligned their work on merger approvals more closely. For businesses, this has lessened the risk that different standards will be applied to international mergers.In other areas, however, Washington’s decision to soft-pedal on anti-trust issues during the Bush years meant that regulators elsewhere were left to take up important battles. Most notable have been the actions in Europe and Asia against Microsoft and Intel.So it is a welcome sign that US regulators, under a new administration, are showing a greater interest in anti-trust enforcement again. Achieving consistency in enforcement between different jurisdictions is as important as achieving consistency in policy.
624;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-11-12T00:06:23Z;EU gets ready to stuff Oracle’s turkey;;Despite signs that the over-heated rhetoric is cooling down a bit, it’s too soon to predict a compromise in the transatlantic falling-out over Oracle’s plan to buy Sun.European competition commissioner Neelie Kroes was more measured in her comments to reporters on Wednesday, suggesting that some sort of agreement might be possible that would protect competition in the database market and allow the dispute to blow over. That certainly sounded less punchy than her own spokesman’s attack on Oracle earlier in the week as “facile and superficial”.The context, though – she was responding off the cuff to reporters – robs her gesture of too much meaning, and the Commission still maintains that it has a strong case.What’s more, we hear that Ms Kroes has a Thanksgiving treat in store for Oracle, having already provisionally reserved a room to hold a hearing on the case in Brussels on November 25th – the day before Turkey Day. Not that this should be seen as an act of provocation, of course: we’re told that it’s just that there there weren’t many options in the calendar. But picking such an early date does suggest the Commission is pushing ahead with the case and not pausing to build extra negotiating time into the schedule.
625;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-11-10T23:26:29Z;Oracle rejects Brussels antitrust claims;;Oracle on Monday mounted a strident attack on Europe’s competition authorities as it confirmed that it had received an official objection from Brussels to its proposed $7.4bn acquisition of Sun Microsystems.The US software company also said it would “vigorously oppose” the European Commission’s position, pointing to further lengthy delays even if a deal for the struggling Sun is finally cleared.By formulating an official statement of objections, which has been sent to Oracle and not made public, regulators in Brussels have drawn a line in the sand more than two months after first revealing they might have concerns. A formal objection is the first step towards possible action to block a deal, though few disputes get this far and most are resolved by the companies either modifying their plans or scrapping their proposals.Oracle said the Commission’s case “reveals a profound misunderstanding” of the software markets, and that a deal of this kind had not been blocked on either side of the Atlantic “in decades”.European regulators object to Oracle assuming control of MySQL, an open source database company bought last year by Sun. Though MySQL is far smaller than database market leaders Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, critics say that Oracle would have an incentive to suppress a product that is given away for free and poses a disruptive threat to its own core business.In a statement on Monday, however, Oracle claimed the case was founded on a misunderstanding. “It is well understood by those knowledgeable about open source software that because MySQL is open source, it cannot be controlled by anyone,” it said. “That is the whole point of open source.”The case has led to a rare difference of opinion between anti-trust regulators on either side of the Atlantic, with the US Department of Justice clearing the transaction in August.In an unusual move, the Department of Justice issued its own statement on Monday reiterating its view that the proposed deal does not give rise to anti-trust concerns. Molly Boast, deputy assistant attorney in the anti-trust division, said it had concluded that “consumer harm is unlikely because customers would continue to have choices from a variety of well established and widely accepted database products.”
626;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-11-10T20:46:33Z;Sun / Oracle;;Open roads, open fields, open source. There is a tendency to romanticise the joys of freedom, including the benefits accrued from placing underlying source code for widely used software in the public domain. But while there are good reasons for governments to support open source as a matter of public policy – states should use transparent systems and processes – it is hard to see how that extends to a reason to block the takeover of Sun Microsystems by Oracle.At issue is Oracle’s potential control of MySQL, an open source form of database software often used to run websites, whose developer Sun bought last year for $1bn. The European competition commissioner has filed objections ahead of a January deadline to approve the deal. Oracle will have no incentive to support the development of MySQL into a feasible, cheap competitor to its own corporate database systems. But it is not clear that MySQL can or would necessarily play that role as an independent entity.Were MySQL a straightforward commercial competitor using proprietary software, there would be no reason to object. A competitive market exists in databases between Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, and MySQL’s share is tiny. Considering revenues perhaps understates the popularity of MySQL, but there are alternative open source competitors. The US Department of Justice has already waved the deal through and sniffily suggested its European counterpart should hurry up.The Commission’s response may be in part a reaction to what it sees as Oracle’s uncooperative approach and a reluctance to take the company’s claims at face value. Friday’s results from Sun suggest Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, overstated the cost of delay when he claimed Sun was losing $100m a month. But temperament is not competition policy. The path to a deal should remain open.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Lex column is on Twitter
627;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-11-07T01:41:21Z;Sun Microsystems’ losses narrow;;Things at Sun Microsystems do not seem to be quite as bad as Larry Ellison has been suggesting.The Oracle boss said in late September that Sun was losing $100m a month as European regulators put its $7.4bn acquisition on hold. Then, a month later, Sun announced plans to sack 3,000 workers – a move that was widely seen as having been caused by the European delay.The latest quarterly figures from Sun, filed with the SEC on Friday, paint a slightly different picture.True, revenues are still falling hard, down 25 per cent in the quarter.But Sun’s net loss in the three months to the end of September narrowed to $120m. Also, its all-important gross profit margin in the systems division climbed by 6 percentage points, to 41 per cent. This shows that, while pricing pressures remain intense, Sun has been able to more than offset it with lower material and other costs.It may also be wrong to blame the job losses on Europe, at least directly. Sun itself said it was making the cuts “in light of” the regulatory delay. That might simply mean that, with a deal no longer imminent, its board realised it had to act now to deal with the consequences of this year’s collapse in Sun’s business, rather than leave it to Oracle to take the same action later as part of its post-acquisition integration.Certainly, the delay must be bad for Sun. But there is no evidence yet that it is suffering the sort of dramatic implosion about which Oracle’s supporters warn so darkly.
628;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-11-03T23:46:32Z;Oracle braced for EU objection on Sun deal;;Oracle is braced for a formal objection from Brussels to its planned $7.4bn acquisition of fellow US technology company Sun Microsystems, escalating the company’s legal wrangle with Europe’s competition authorities.The US software company has refused to offer any concessions to European regulators to meet their concerns about the deal, according to one person close to the process. That has left Brussels close to issuing an official statement of objections, the first step on the path to blocking it, this person added.The complaint could come within days, but there is still a chance that one side or the other will back down, according to observers in Brussels. Neither side commented on Tuesday.Some suggest that Oracle has little to lose by waiting to see Brussels’ precise concerns. It would then still have time to offer concessions or try to mount a legal fight, though this would inevitably be prolonged.The European Commission last blocked a US merger when it intervened in General Electric’s proposed purchase of Honeywell in 2001, causing a transatlantic row.Since then, regulators in Washington and Brussels have tried to co-ordinate their work more closely to avoid such disagreements.The Commission rarely blocks deals outright. Between 1994 and 2003, the European commission blocked 21 mergers out of the 2,157 notified – an average rate of 1 per cent a year. Between 2004 and 2008, only two of the 1,665 deals notified have been barred.The Sun acquisition has already been cleared by the US Department of Justice, in spite of the agency’s heightened attention under the Obama administration to antitrust issues, particularly in the technology industry.Brussels has blocked only two proposed mergers since 2004, both of them involving European companies.The EC first raised its concerns about the Sun acquisition two months ago, preventing Oracle from completing the deal. Since then Sun has said it will lay off 3,000 people, attributing the timing of that decision to the delay in Brussels.The commission had no comment on Tuesday. But two weeks ago, commission officials confirmed that, in spite of ”repeated requests”, Oracle had neither provided them with evidence that the deal would not cause competition problems, nor discussed possible remedies.With Sun’s sales under severe pressure due to the recession and the uncertainty about its future, people familiar with the state of its business have warned that longer delays could seriously jeopardise its survival.Brussels’ concerns centre on Oracle’s assumption of MySQL, an open source software company that Sun acquired in 2008. Opponents of the deal claim MySQL could become a serious competitor to Oracle’s own core business in the long term.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s outspoken chief executive officer, has challenged antitrust regulators in the past, having won a rare legal battle against the justice department’s attempt to block his purchase of PeopleSoft.He said recently that Sun was losing $100m a month as Oracle waited for approval of the deal.
629;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle/Sun: the plot thickens;;When it comes to deal-making, predicting what Larry Ellison will do next is never easy – which is just the way he wants it.So what to make of the fact that Mr Ellison’s pursuit of Sun Microsystems has now reached a point few expected, with the European Commission close to drawing a line in the sand with a formal objection to the deal?This doesn’t necessarily mean that Brussels will act to block it. But it does show that things have reached an impasse in Brussels, which at the very least means a longer delay – with further detrimental effects to Sun’s business.Assuming neither side balks before the EC issues its objection, Mr Ellison now appears to have a number of options.Compromise. With the formal issuance of a Statement of Objections, the Commission will have to lay out its case in some detail. That could make it easier for the Oracle camp to craft a compromise that meets the EC objections without having to give too much away. The trouble with this scenario, though, is that Mr Ellison has already had two months to suggest compromises but, from what we hear, has shown no sign of giving any ground at all, so why would he change course now?Stand firm. The Oracle boss has shown he is ready to take a stand, having fought – and won – against the US Department of Justice over PeopleSoft. That would be highly risky in this case, though. If the Commission sticks to its guns and Oracle is forced into a long battle, it could prove disastrous for Sun, which Mr Ellison said recently was bleeding $100m a month.Renegotiate. One explanation whispered around Wall Street is that Mr Ellison might be looking for a reason to cut the price he is paying for Sun, and that allowing a stand-off to develop with Brussels gives him an excuse to renegotiate. If he is forced into spinning off MySQL, which is the focus of the EC objections, he might demand a lower price. Again, though, that sounds a highly risky move.Walk. Oracle might use the cover of the EC delay as an excuse to abandon the deal altogether. But history suggests that when Mr Ellison wants something he sticks with it to the end, so dropping Sun at this point would be surprising.Logic suggests that compromise is still the right approach. But in the heat of the fight, logic can sometimes be the first casualty.
630;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
631;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-10-28T14:06:54Z;SAP cuts outlook on slow Japan sales;;SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, surprised investors by cutting its full-year sales outlook after missing expectations for the third quarter because of slow sales in Japan and emerging markets.“The market has still not returned to normal conditions and businesses are very cautious about spending,” said Léo Apotheker, chief executive.While he said he expected improvement in the fourth quarter, Mr Apotheker warned that “it is an unpredictable environment and we have to be a little more patient to see a recovery”.The German company’s guidance is in contrast to other technology sector companies such as Microsoft and Intel, which recently beat expectations, raising hopes that a recovery could be under way. SAP’s biggest rival, Oracle, however, also missed expectations last month.“SAP is showing that the recovery is happening a lot slower than everyone expected. Share prices across the sector have got overheated,” said Rajeev Bahl, analyst at Piper Jaffrey.Shares in SAP fell 6.8 per cent to €32.06 in early Frankfurt trading.SAP said it expected software and services revenues to drop between 6 and 8 per cent from its 2008 €8.62bn ($12.7bn) total. It had previously forecast a 4-6 per cent decline. However, SAP said it would meet its operating margin target of 25.5-27 per cent thanks to cost-cutting and lower tax rates. The company announced 3,000 redundancies this year.The lowered outlook came after the company reported revenues of €2.5bn for the three months to the end of September, missing market expectations of €2.6bn.SAP, which provides companies including Walmart and Coca-Cola with software to handle functions such as payroll, has suffered as customers have put off purchases during the downturn.Revenues were down 9 per cent from the same quarter last year. Software sales were 31 per cent lower at €525m.“Third-quarter software and software-related service revenues came in lower than we expected, mainly because of a particularly challenging environment in the emerging markets and Japan,” said Werner Brandt, chief financial officer.The company said there had been one-off difficulties in Japan because the recent change of government had resulted in some business uncertainty.Mr Apotheker, who took over as sole chief executive this summer after sharing the role with Henning Kagermann, stressed that “one quarter does not make a trend” and said conditions were improving, albeit slowly.Net profit at SAP was €435m for the third quarter, up from €389m a year earlier. Basic earnings per share were 0.37, at the lower end of estimates.
632;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-10-23T02:50:38Z;Sun deal dims as Brussels focuses on Oracle;;Oracle and Microsoft might be sworn enemies in the software world, but they appear to have at least one thing in common: an ability to antagonise regulators in Brussels.In Microsoft’s case, European antitrust enforcers felt that their valid concerns about the company’s use of its market dominance were being given short shrift, leading to years of bad relations between the two sides before a recent provisional agreement to settle their dispute. Oracle, for its part, is only just learning what can come of failing to pay due attention to regulators across the Atlantic – to its cost.The European Commission’s decision two months ago to delay Oracle’s $7.1bn purchase of Sun Microsystems caught the US software maker off guard. Having won US approval for the agreed deal, it expected a rubber stamp from Europe. Unexpectedly, though, Brussels raised a potential objection to the fact that Oracle would assume control of the popular open-source database software made by Sun’s MySQL, which has emerged as a potential long-term competitor to its own core database business.As time has gone on, relations have failed to improve. Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-president, was rebuffed at a meeting with Neelie Kroes, the competition commissioner, this week, highlighting the fact that the two sides are as far apart from an agreement as ever. On the same day, Sun announced plans to lay off 3,000 workers, attributing that to the delay in Brussels hurting its business.Commission officials appear to have become increasingly frustrated by a corporate attitude which they perceive as unhelpful and uncompromising. Mrs Kroes’s spokesman said this week that Oracle had failed to produce hard evidence that there were no competition problems raised by the MySQL issue, in spite of repeated requests. Equally, there had been no remedy proposals put forward.Many observers in Brussels, however, suspect that Oracle, headed by Larry Ellison, will have to agree to some form of remedy to avoid a longer fight. If so, the issue may be whether “behavioural” conditions – over investment levels or licensing, say – will be sufficient to satisfy Brussels, or whether a harder “structural” remedy, such as divestment by Sun of MySQL, might be required.An unusual alliance between Microsoft and some of the world’s most prominent open source software developers – normally a group strongly opposed to Microsoft – has been pushing hard for the latter idea.This week Richard Stallman, one of the founding fathers of open source, co-signed a letter urging Ms Kroes to block an Oracle acquisition of MySQL. Similar agitation has come from Monty Widenius, the founder of the freely distributed database software which has become one of the most successful open source projects.“MySQL needs a different home than Oracle, a home where there will be no conflicts of interest concerning how, or if, MySQL should be developed further,” Mr Widenius blogged this week.According to Florian Mueller, an EU lobbyist assisting Mr Widenius, the MySQL founder had phone conversations with the Department of Justice over the same issue, but the deal was cleared soon afterwards without conditions in the US. Things have taken a different course in Brussels, Mr Mueller suggests, because open-source issues have greater resonance in Europe – and elsewhere outside the US.In Brussels, lawyers watching the case are now divided over whether the commission will issue a formal statement of objections against Oracle, and say much is likely to depend on how the company handles the next few weeks.“I think it’s finely balanced,” says one person who is closely involved.Those opposing an unconditional clearance say questionnaires sent out by the commission – and the way issues have been aired – would seem to pave the way for a statement of objections should officials want to take this path. But they also admit there have been no firm signals this is what the commission intends.
633;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-10-20T23:11:34Z;Sun blames Brussels as 3,000 jobs are axed;;Sun Microsystems on Tuesday announced plans to slash 3,000 jobs over the next year, putting the move down to the delay in getting European Commission clearance for its agreed $7bn acquisition by Oracle.The latest in a string of job cuts from the struggling US maker of servers and other equipment for corporate data centres followed recent complaints from Oracle that the review in Brussels was hurting Sun’s business.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive officer, said last month that Sun was losing $100m a month as it awaited regulatory approval for the deal.That is twice the rate of losses Sun was suffering in the latest quarter for which it reported earnings.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sun failed to provide any update about its finances, but said its board had decided on the job cuts “in light of the delay in the closing of the acquisition of the company”. The cuts account for about 10 per cent of its workforce.However, it failed to say whether the regulatory delay – by causing uncertainty among its customers – was directly to blame for the job losses, or whether cuts were likely to have been made later anyway following an Oracle acquisition.There had already been signs that Sun’s customers had delayed purchases of new equipment as they waited for the completion of the deal and a clearer sense of whether the software company would continue to develop Sun’s existing range of products.Sun blamed a 31 per cent collapse in its revenues in the three months to the end of June partly on customer caution prompted by the acquisition, although its results were also badly dented by the slumping economy.A series of retrenchment actions have now seen Sun embark on 10 restructuring efforts, as it tried to deal first with declining competitiveness caused by changes in its markets, and more recently by the recession.It announced cuts of 5,000-6,000 jobs a year ago.Mr Ellison has also been expected to make deep cuts to pare Sun’s losses to hit his financial targets from the Oracle deal.In Silicon Valley, where both companies are based, Oracle’s agreement to buy Sun was seen as preferable to a possible purchase by East Coast-based IBM. However, one person close to the deal warned that the Oracle purchase would probably lead to far bigger job losses than would have occurred under IBM.
634;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-10-20T15:56:46Z;Software: Opportunity for program suppliers;;To some, the renewed focus on the importance of cash management that resulted from the credit crisis is nothing less than a refocus on sound business principles and a retrenchment of the relationship between bank and customer.“Good cash management is a feature of every single company. It’s certainly not going to go away,” says Tom Nelson, a management product manager at Wall Street Systems, a software group. “It puts the leverage back in the chief financial officer’s hands.”But while treasury departments may be celebrating a victory of sorts, the crisis has thrown up the question of whether they have the necessary software to take a strategic interest in the role of a large business.The industry’s inquest in the aftermath of the liquidity crisis and asset market turmoil a year ago revealed that many corporate treasurers had been unable to carry out some duties because of perceived inadequate investment in assessing risk, both internally and with their bank.Both bank and corporation have benefited from a symbiotic relationship. Treasury management developed rapidly in the 1990s as increasingly cheap credit and the rapid improvement in communications helped fuel globalisation of financial markets. However the Enron and Worldcom scandals led to the introduction of legislation such as Sarbanes-Oxley in the US and improved international accounting standards, which put ultimate responsibility on the corporate board.Spending on treasury management slowed as the focus moved to improving accounting standards, while other IT spending was devoted to more strategic issues such as sales, marketing and resource planning. “There was no need to manage cash tightly when it was so readily available,” says Guy Warren, general manager of banking at Misys, the banking software group.But the crisis, and the accompanying foreign exchange volatility, emphasised the importance of cash management. This has provided software makers with the chance to expand their market.Software has been one of the few areas of business to have largely escaped big cuts in corporate spending. But cash management software, in particular, has been free of budget constraints. Aite, the US research group, found treasury management software vendors had claimed up to 50 per cent growth in sales in 2008.Industry giants such as SunGard, Oracle, SAP and Thomson Reuters offer cash management software as part of a whole range of IT services but smaller companies, such as Chesapeake Systems Solutions, Kyriba, Wall Street Systems and IT2, which are focused more exclusively on cash management software, have also seen strong growth.This growth, however, is likely to slow. This year, Celent, the US-based research group, estimated bank spending on cash management technology in the wholesale banking market would grow 7.1 per cent in 2010, with spending climbing to $904m by the end of 2010 and exceeding $1bn in 2011.“People are starting to apply a deeper holistic approach to analysing the cash that companies spend and receive,” says Mr Grant. “It’s now ‘cashflow-at-risk’ more than value-at-risk, looking at where cash is residing.”Every area of the supply chain transaction process is being analysed, often as it happens. Furthermore, it is not just large companies that are realising its importance. “In the late 1990s it was companies with a market cap of $5bn that wanted it, now it’s sub-$1bn,” says Mr Grant. “The corporate treasurer has never been so powerful. Now they can make banks dance to their tune.”The continued improvement in computing power and the need to cut IT costs has led to the rise of “cloud computing”, in which smaller software providers host the application via data centres, away from the client.This development has had two main effects.First, cash management software can now be divided into its component parts – and sold separately at a lower price – rather than supplied as part of the suite of treasury management and other business products.Second, it has also changed the way software can be consumed. Rather than paying an expensive up-front fee for a licence and then annual maintenance costs, companies pay for what they use on a subscription basis, a cheaper option.Observers argue the threat to software company revenues posed by the subscription model has been overplayed, not least as corporations still want to retain their own vital data.However, as Celent points out, there are unintended consequences of this range of choice and the growing demands of a treasury acting more as a business adviser rather than merely as a back office function. “This forces treasurers to become IT experts,” it says.While software groups hope to supply cash management tools, banks have been quick to respond in this area. This is because cash management tools not only deepen relationships with clients but also provide higher-margin business.Perhaps the most difficult question is whether renewed focus on cash management will be permanent, with companies giving treasurers the necessary budget and leeway. “There’s always the danger people will forget the bad times when the good times come round again,” says Mr Nelson.……………………………………………………………………………………………One of the oldest companies in the business rises as a niche operatorWhen the administrator for APG Investments of the Netherlands, the third-largest pension fund in the world, was assessing which software group could manage its £217bn ($355) in assets, it found its answer not among the steel and glass structures of the world’s main financial centres but in a quiet street in west London.Between a school and the Edwardian houses is the home of IT2, one of the largest companies in the niche cash management software industry. Created in March 2008 to administer the collective pension scheme for the government and education sectors, it needed software that could assess and manage the cash deposits for a business with more than 4,000 external bank accounts, operates nine cash pools with 12 banks and is managed by more than 150 fund managers.APG has not been the only global corporation to beat a path to the UK group’s door. Cable & Wireless, Ladbrokes, SAB Miller and Rémy Cointreau are among others that signed up last year.Altogether, the group added a further 17 clients to take the total to more than 210. It reported a 32 per cent rise in revenues for the year to December, from £5.7m to £7.6m. Pre-tax profit rose from £1m to £2.3m and the number of employees rose from 41 to 64. The UK business saw turnover rise from £1.4m to £2.2m. The rest of Europe rose from £3.4m to £4m.Such growth makes the company the world’s sixth-largest cash management software provider, according to Aite, the US research group. It is one of the oldest software companies in the business, having been around since 1983 as Swallow Business systems, when treasury management was little understood. After being bought by Bank of America in 1991, it became part of Denmark’s SimCorp in 1999 before being bought for €11m ($16m) in 2007 by CapMan, the Finland-based alternative investment fund.But in a market dominated by US groups such as Sungard, Wall Street Systems, Thomson Reuters and Oracle, it stands out as focusing exclusively on treasury management software rather than an add-on product.Celent, the US research group, puts IT2 in the top quartile for both breadth of functionality and advancement of technology. The software is made available through an initial licence fee, followed by an annual maintenance fee.Kevin Grant, chief executive, says treasury departments are moving from a position where 60 per cent of their work was operational and 10 per cent strategic to a world where those numbers are reversed.IT2’s selling point is that the software offers real-time visibility of enterprise cash management risk on an internet-based application. Not only will it analyse cashflows in real-time but it will allow treasury departments to run various scenario analyses and check hedging positions and exposure to risky derivative products.Others have argued that IT2’s niche positioning can be a weakness. “Corporations seeking a one-stop shop for all financial or even treasury needs will not be able to have all their technology needs met by IT2. It requires treasuries to maintain multiple vendor relationships, and may go against both treasury – and the organisation’s – IT strategy,” says Judson Murchie of Aite.Yet IT2’s rapid expansion looks like disproving even the most optimistic assessments. CapMan has already cautioned its investors that profitability for the coming year will be lower than a year ago as IT2 makes extra investment in its product, IT2 Version 7.0. But Mr Grant says business is so strong it is expecting to make earnings margins of 15 per cent and revenue growth of 30 per cent.

636;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Microsoft-Yahoo tie-up garners ad chief support;;The heads of the four largest advertising agencies came out on Monday in support of the proposed search engine alliance between Microsoft and Yahoo.Their backing for the deal comes as regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are studying the partnership, which the two companies claim will create a stronger force in search advertising to counter market leader Google.Their support came in a letter to the Department of Justice from the American Association of Advertising Agencies from Nancy Hill, the association’s chief executive officer. The letter was co-signed by Maurice Levy of Publicis Groupe, Martin Sorrell of WPP, Michael Roth of Interpublic and John Wren of Omnicom.The brief submission did not go into detail about the dynamics of the search market or mention Google in any way, but argued that the alliance “enhances competition” and that it “should be allowed to take effect as soon as possible.”The lack of any mention of how the alliance might counter-balance Google’s dominance in the search market appeared to reflect the different positions that the individual agency heads have struck in the past.A year ago, when Google tried to forge an alliance of its own with Yahoo, Mr Sorrell spoke out strongly against the proposal, while Mr Levy backed the idea. The plan was eventually scrapped at the last minute after the DoJ signalled that it would sue to block it.“We believe that Yahoo! and Microsoft’s proposal to combine their technologies and search platforms is good for advertisers, marketing services agencies, website publishers and consumers,” Monday’s letter read.Google itself has remained on the sidelines, at least publicly, during the regulatory review of the alliance, having taken a strong position against the full acquisition of Yahoo that Microsoft tried to pull off last year.Microsoft and Yahoo have said that they hope to complete their partnership by early next year. They have yet to file a notification seeking approval from the European Commission, and their small combined share in Europe has raised questions about whether they need formal approval from regulators there. However, a failure to anticipate potential objections from Brussels recently tripped up another prominent technology deal, when European regulators refused to issue an expected rubber-stamp for Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems.

638;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-10-08T16:01:21Z;Microsoft close to EU deal on browser dispute;;Microsoft on Wednesday scored an important breakthrough in its long-running battle with European regulators, paving the way for an end to a highly charged dispute that has hung over the US software company for much of this decade in one of its most important markets.The EU’s antitrust watchdog said it believed it had won concessions from Microsoft that would bring more competition to the internet browser market, and voiced support for technical changes the company said would make its software work better with other companies’ products.To resolve the EU’s complaint about the way it bundles its Internet Explorer browser with Windows, Microsoft has agreed to present PC users with a “ballot screen” giving them the choice of alternative browsers. It said it had made 20 changes to an initial proposal made three months ago, reflecting comments from other browser makers and the Competition Commission.The commission, which had pushed for the changes to prevent Microsoft from gaining an unfair advantage because of its control of Windows, welcomed the initiative.“The commission’s preliminary view is that Microsoft’s commitments would indeed address our competition concerns,” said Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner. “Hopefully, we can take a decision before the end of the year”.Anti-trust regulators in Brussels challenged Microsoft’s business methods after the US settled its own legal case against the company in the first term of President George W Bush. Two years ago a European court upheld a sweeping regulatory ruling against the company that threatened to force big changes in its business practices.Some long-time Microsoft opponents conceded that the provisional settlement effectively signals an end to its battles in Europe, but maintain that Microsoft’s concessions would do too little to create a more competitive PC software market.Thomas Vinje, a Brussels lawyers who heads ECIS, a group that represents Microsoft rivals including IBM and Oracle, said his group would continue to press for more stringent requirements on Microsoft as the terms of the resolution with the EU are subjected to a formal month-long “market test”.Microsoft’s concessions should also calm the fractious relations between the company and the commission. “I’m absolutely of the opinion that this is a trustful deal that we’re making,” Ms Kroes said. “I trust Microsoft. I have contact with Steve Ballmer [Microsoft’s CEO]. There can’t be a misunderstanding.”

CIT shares were up 2.6 per cent to $1.20.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of Citigroup’s main investors, urged the US government to sell its stake in the bank as soon as this year in order to boost investor confidence, according to reports. Citi gained 2.6 per cent to $1.20.Bank of America rose 2.3 per cent to $16.71 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the bank had plans to select an emergency chief executive this week if legal issues force Ken Lewis to leave before the end of the year.American Express gained 2.2 per cent to $33.19 after Alfred Kelly, the credit card issuer’s president, said he would leave the company next year to seek an opportunity as a chief executive elsewhere.Renewed optimism in the sector helped lift the mood on Wall Street after discouraging economic data and falling commodity prices caused the S&P 500 to lose 1.4 per cent last week and 2.2 per cent during the previous week.By midday, the S&P 500 was up 1 per cent to 1,035.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 9,559.09 and the Nasdaq rose 0.8 per cent to 2,064.15.The Institute for Supply Management’s September reading of the services sector was also better than expected, helping stocks extend their early gains.Economists had been expecting a reading of 50, indicating growth after 11 months of contraction, but the ISM recorded a level of 50.9. Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage, said the market was now focused on the third-quarter earnings season, which begins this week.“We’re waiting for the big news in the form of earnings and revenue expectations for the quarters to come,” he said. “That’s going to be what drives the market.“Companies need to show positive expectations for higher revenue because cost-cutting measures can only take you so far,” Mr Colvin said.Industrial stocks rebounded on Monday after last week’s losses.General Dynamics rose 2 per cent to $64.36 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “equal-weight”, saying it expected a recovery in the company’s Gulfstream jet unit from 2011.Caterpillar announced plans to raise prices on most of its machinery by up to 2 per cent next year. Its shares gained 2.7 per cent to $50.15.The pharmaceutical sector was also in focus. Seattle Genetics fell 16.9 per cent to $10.94 after the biotechnology company halted trials of its experimental drug, which had been designed to treat patients with lymphoma.Amicus Therapeutics said it would not pursue final stage trials of a drug for Gaucher disease after a study showed the treatment was ineffective. JPMorgan then downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “overweight”, increasing pressure on the shares, which plunged 32.3 per cent to $5.78.Meanwhile, Depomed climbed 24.7 per cent to $5.50 after announcing late on Friday of positive results from trials of its neuropathic pain drug.While technology stocks lagged behind most sectors, Brocade Communications Systems, which provides networking solutions, climbed 16.9 per cent to $8.94 after reports that the company had put itself up for sale.Oracle advanced 0.4 per cent to $20.43 and Hewlett-Packard was up 1 per cent to $45.72 after speculation that they could be potential buyers.

643;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-24T19:24:00Z;Autonomy gains as Footsie drifts;;Autonomy proved the main talking point on Thursday as the London market drifted further from its one-year high.The search software maker’s shares rose as much as 5.6 per cent in early trading, which some traders linked to recent speculation that the group could be a bid target.Microsoft and Oracle have both been linked with Autonomy in recent days, but analysts were sceptical of the gossip.“We think the chances of a bid at current levels are exceedingly slim,” said Evolution Securities, a long-standing bear on the stock. “Software M&A is conducted on the criteria of cost synergies and recurring revenue. Autonomy satisfies neither.”A more plausible reason for the gain came via Merrill Lynch, whose “buy” advice triggered a short squeeze ahead of third-quarter results next month.Merrill, which raised its share price target to £19, said investors were overly focused on Autonomy’s compliance operations so were underestimating the upside potential from a recovery in cyclical sectors.Robert Webb, the search software maker’s newly appointed independent chairman, would be in a better position to address concerns over an accounting policy that many felt was too aggressive, the broker added.Autonomy shares closed up 3 per cent at 978p. More than three times the recent average daily volume changed hands.Falling oil prices and an unexpected decline in US home sales led the FTSE 100 to a second consecutive loss. The index fell 1.1 per cent, or 54.48 points, to 5,084.89.Wolseley, the Anglo-American builders’ merchant, was the day’s sharpest faller, dropping 4.5 per cent to £13.28.Property companies were still under pressure following Liberty International’s surprise equity placing. The speculation centred on who would be next.Hammerson and Land Securities both eased 3.9 per cent, to 401½p and 649p respectively. Liberty fell 2.8 per cent to 492½p.The wider market’s recent drift from highs has fed speculation that Aviva may bring forward plans to float its Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, within the year. Aviva, down 1 per cent to 408¾p, said last month it would explore a partial sale of the unit in 2010.A move by Waitrose into the convenience market took the impetus out of Marks and Spencer, its direct rival, which has climbed on pre-results optimism. M&S closed 2.9 per cent weaker at 373p.British Airways slipped 4.3 per cent to 220p after both Citigroup and UBS said the stock looked fairly valued after its recent rebound. Citi cut BA off its “buy” list while UBS started coverage with a “neutral” rating.Among the gainers, product testing specialist Intertek took on 2.1 per cent to £12.70 following an investor roadshow. Morgan Stanley upgraded Intertek in a sector review that forecast improved growth in 2010, and revived M&A activity, which would provide a floor to valuations.Cadbury was up 0.7 per cent to 795p on hopes of a formal offer from Kraft next week. A US press report suggested Kraft was struggling to put finance in place for the offer.Man Group edged 0.2 per cent higher to 304¼p amid reheated rumours about takeover interest from BlackRock. But the purchase of shares by a Man non-executive director on Wednesday suggested the hedge fund manager had nothing to disclose.Positive broker comment lifted pub operators and Punch Taverns climbed 1.6 per cent to 123¼p. Evolution moved from “sell” to “buy” on Punch based on the value of its property portfolio.Enterprise Inns rose 0.6 per cent to 133¼p on Merrill Lynch “buy” advice. The broker hosted a lunch with Enterprise management. “We came away feeling more confident on trading, regulation, debt and property values and believe a rights issue is unlikely,” it told clients.SThree, the recruitment group, slid 2.7 per cent to 261½p. Concerns about staffing demand led HSBC to downgrade to “neutral”.Helphire, provider of courtesy vehicles after accidents, was in focus on Thursday as nearly 6.4m shares changed hands – about 15 times the recent daily average.Predictably, the surge in trading volumes triggered speculation of a takeover approach for the company. However, dealers believed the heavy trading could have been down to the clearance of an overhang of 2.3m shares. Helphire closed up 15.7 per cent at 44¼p.Pursuit Dynamics fell 6.4 per cent to 124p after a block of 4.28m shares changed hands. Traders said the seller was John Heathcote, former chief executive, reducing his holding in the fluid processing company from 20 per cent to about 13.6 per cent.However, they added rumours that Mr Heathcote was looking to sell more of his stake were wide of the mark. The buyer of the 4.8m shares is thought to have been a US institutional investor.Songbird Estates B shares jumped 82 per cent to 2.35p after the majority owner of the Canary Wharf Group announced plans to raise more than £1bn, most of which will come from a £620m share placing. The rise surprised analysts and traders. Taking into account the dilution from the equity issue, Cazenove estimated a proforma net asset value for Songbird of just 1.27p.Coal and logistic group Hargreaves Services moved up 9.1 per cent to 758½p after Evolution Securities reiterated its “buy” recommendation after a company presentation which focused on a new biomass power plant venture. “Planning is approved for the first site, with Ofgem accreditation forthcoming in one month, when Hargreaves will issue more specific details,” Evolution said.Late in the session Hargreaves revealed that Gordon Banham, chief executive, had sold 1m shares at 650p each and Kevin Dougan, contracts director, had sold 370,252 shares at the same price.
644;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-22T19:24:58Z;Larry Ellison on the economy, the cloud, and sailing;;It is perhaps with good reason that Larry Ellison does not speak in public that often. Whenever he does, the famously bombastic Oracle chief executive seems certain to trash his rivals, make bold predictions about Oracle’s future, and wander off topic.Last night at a meeting of the Churchill Club, Mr Ellison said that Sun Microsystems was losing $100m a month as European regulators scrutinise Oracle’s proposed takeover of the struggling hardware maker.On the economy, Mr Ellison said it would be at least another five years before the US begins to recover. He said it would not be a V shaped recovery with a sharp rebound, or a W shaped recovery with a double dip, or a U shaped recovery with a pause before an uptick, but an L shaped recovery — “down and not coming back up.”In an onstage interview by former Sun No. 2 Ed Zander, Mr Ellison didn’t miss the opportunity to diss IBM, SAP and Microsoft, dismiss cloud computing as jargon, and weigh in on his bid for the America’s Cup.Mr Ellison has been Oracle’s chief since he founded the company 32 years ago with $2,000. It’s a remarkable run, and one is hard-pressed to name another chief executive who has been in place for as long. But Mr Ellison said he began with modest ambitions. “I wanted a nice car, I wanted a house,” he said. “We thought the idea was just to have a small software company.”Today Mr Ellison, the fourth-richest man in the world according to Forbes, is thinking very, very big. He said that with the Sun acquisition, Oracle is aiming to provide more integrated computing systems that offer customers storage hardware and database software in one package. “We believe in this model where we deliver complete computers systems,” he said. “It’s not good when the customer has to buy a bunch of technology components and then has to assemble them.”In a rare compliment to a rival, Mr Ellison cited Cisco as an exemplary company that has done as much by successfully combining hardware and software. “Cisco has a hardware/software combination that allows them to be instrumental in the internet,” he said.Critics had wondered if Oracle, a software company, would sell off Sun’s substantial hardware divisions. But Mr Ellison said he would keep all of Sun’s divisions. “We are keeping everything,” he said. “We’re keeping tape, we’re storage, we’re keeping x86 technology and Sparc technology.” Mr Ellison said that at $7.4bn, Oracle was getting Sun for a steep discount, citing the company’s deep pool of technology, talent and patents.Yet with uncertainty surrounding the Sun deal, rivals IBM and Hewlett-Packard have bragged that they are stealing customers. Mr Ellison challenged IBM and HP to provide details on their new customers, and he said once Oracle and Sun were integrated, the tide will turn.Mr Ellison was most impassioned when asked about the threat of cloud computing to Oracle’s core business. “The cloud is water vapor,” he said, dismissing the hype as semantics. “Is Intel dead? There will be no microprocessors in the cloud?“All it is is a computer attached to the network,” he said. “You still need databases, and memory and microprocessors. Cloud computing is not only the future of computing, but the present and the entire past of computing.”Mr Ellison said he saw Microsoft increasingly turning into a consumer-oriented business, despite the fact that the bulk of its revenue still come from licenses for Windows and Office. “I think they are obsessed with Apple, and they’re obsessed with Google, and to some degree with Sony and the PS3,” he said. “Culturally now, under the new administration at Microsoft, I see all their energies going into being successful in the consumer space.”As advice to budding entrepreneurs, Mr Ellison said to avoid the computer industry because the innovation rate is slowing. “I would probably go into biotech, not computing,” he said. “I think you want to go into a field where the innovation rate is very high. The computer industry is maturing. You go through a consolidation phase. And there are a relatively small number of computer companies that are competing. The innovation rates have slowed down.”Besides running Oracle, Mr Ellison also spearheads the BMW-Oracle sailing team, which will compete in the upcoming America’s Cup. This year BMW-Oracle will be trying to win the title from the Swiss Alinghi team, but the two sides are embroiled in a legal dispute.Alinghi says the BMW-Oracle boat doesn’t meet the required dimensions. But Mr Ellison said the Swiss, who also run the competition, are changing the rules because Alinghi was afraid to race against Sir Russell Coutts, the former skipper of Alinghi who Mr Ellison hired away. “Who’s ever head of a sporting event where the umpires and referees work for one team?” asked an exasperated Mr Ellison.Mr Coutts, considered by many to be the best sailor ever, previously won the America’s Cup for Team New Zealand and Alinghi. “They’re so uncomfortable racing against Russell Coutts, they’re twisting he rules,” said Mr Ellison. “We have the fastest boat, we have the best crew, and if it’s a fair race, we’ll win.”When Mr Zander asked if Mr Ellison would rather beat Alinghi in a race or SAP in a deal, Mr Ellison didn’t hesitate to respond. “Alinghi,” he said. “We beat SAP all the time.”Finally, Mr Ellison, who is 64, said he would stay at Oracle for at least another five years. “I would like us to be the successor to IBM,” he said. “If the information age was fully upon us and Oracle was storing and retrieving most of that information, I would be very happy.”
645;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-22T16:46:42Z;iShares Cup: Asian Extreme series to augment the calendar;;The iShares Cup, the Formula One-style international catamaran racing series, is to add a “winter series”.Race series organiser OC Events is developing the inaugural Asian Extreme Sailing Series for the Extreme 40 class, with regattas in the Middle East and Asia this winter, starting in November.The series is expected to visit Hong Kong, Singapore, The Maldives and culminate in Muscat, Oman, the climax of the month-long Muscat Festival.Mark Turner, chief executive of OC Group, parent company of OC Events, says: “The long-term intention is to develop an Extreme sailing series that has a high sporting integrity coupled with a unique B2B opportunity.“We are developing an Asian series that will stand alone from the current European iShares Cup and for this winter we plan to have four events and hopefully up to six boats, growing to a full-scale series.”With only the Amsterdam regatta this weekend from September 25-27, which is the penultimate round of the European series, and then the final regatta of the series of six, at Almeria, southern Spain, from October 10-12, a team from Oman Sail with three regatta wins is on course to lift the cup this year.The current series, adding another venue in its third year of competition, started on the canals of Venice in mid-May, moving to Hyères, on France’s Côte D’Azur, the UK’s Cowes week in August, then Kiel, Germany, which will be followed by the canals of Amsterdam leading to next month’s finale in Andalucia.Oman Sail team’s boat Masirah, skippered by Pete Cumming, goes into the next three-day regatta with a four-point lead over its nearest rivals, the joint second-placed GitanaExtreme-Groupe LCF Rothschild, from France with skipper Yann Guichard, and Renaissance with Loïck Peyron, the French multihull specialist also from Oman Sail.The other teams in the running are France’s Groupama 40 with Franck Cammas at the helm, BT led by Nick Maloney, BMW-Oracle Racing with America’s Cup star James Spithill, iShares skippered by Scotland’s Dame Shirley Robertson, France’s Luna led by Erik Maris, the Dutch team Holmatro with Mitch Booth and Ecover with Mike Golding.The Extreme 40 class has quickly established itself as a sporting spectacle, attracting 150,000 spectators last year, with its promise of thrills and spills in quick-bust races.In Kiel this year, gusty winds resulted in a series of capsizes – the light and powerful boats can pitch-pole forwards spectacularly when overpowered, spilling crews into the water – and collisions, with a broken mast and a crew member with a head injury.Conditions on the short and tight courses of the Kiel fjord were particularly demanding, with the wind gusting at up to 30 knots.The carbon-fibre boats, designed by Olympic champions Yves Loday and Mitch Booth, are built to fly a hull in medium winds of 8 knots and at each regatta go head-to-head with their nine rivals in as many as 18 races of up to 20 minutes duration, in a variety of inshore and offshore conditions.Mr Peyron has joined the line-up of stars taking part this year, which features world champions, America’s Cup aces, Olympians, and round-the-world campaigners.The French multihull stars competing this year include Franck Cammas and Mr Guichard, while Mr Peyron is holder of five oceanic multihull championship titles and won his third Artemis Transat transatlantic race last year. Other Olympic competitors include Carolijn Brouwer on Holmatro.Gilles Chiorri, director of the event, says: “The boats accelerate quickly and even in light to moderate winds they lift their hulls, as they are designed to do, and that makes the racing and the experience for their onboard guests very entertaining.“Once you get any kind of decent breeze, the racing becomes very intense and exhilarating – you can hear the crowd gasp as the fleet races at close quarters, missing each other or the harbour wall by inches.”iShares, which has sponsored the series for three years, says: “ Without wanting to be a me-too sailing sponsor, we looked for something that would provide differentiation and ownership within the sport.“During racing we offer our guests the opportunity to sail on board as part of the team by becoming the 5th member of the race crew.“This unrivalled experience provides the clients with the ride of their lives and contributes heavily to the extraordinary client feedback”.The series has established itself as a platform for media promotion and corporate hospitality.Among those to have taken advantage of this opportunity, at the Cowes regatta this summer, were yachtsman Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran, television presenter Ben Fogel, Formula One team Brawn’s chief executive Nicky Fry and round-the-world sailors Sam Davies and Dee Caffari.Later Mr Fry said: “The iShares Cup is just like Formula One. It combines high-technology, great teamwork and accessible entertainment for the fans.”The tender process to select race venues for the 2010-11 season is already under way, with more than 50 potential host ports expressing interest.

647;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-22T06:53:03Z;EU probe ‘costing Sun $100m a month’;;Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison said late on Monday night that Sun Microsystems was losing $100m a month while European regulators scrutinise Oracle’s acquisition plan for the hardware supplier.“The longer this takes, the more money Sun is going to lose, and that’s not good for anybody,” he said.Oracle made a $7.4bn bid for Sun in April, swooping in after talks between Sun and IBM broke down. US regulators approved the deal in August, but in September Brussels said it was scrutinising the deal.Antitrust regulators in Europe have taken a tougher line on competition issues, particularly in the technology industry. In this case they are examining whether Oracle’s control over MySQL, an open-source Sun product, would stymie competition in the database software industry.Although Oracle also makes database software, Mr Ellison believes European regulators are misguided in their inquiries. “MySQL and Oracle do not compete at all,” said Mr Ellison, adding that he would not sell MySQL.Nonetheless, the uncertainty around the deal has caused Sun customers to turn to rivals such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard since the deal was announced, further harming an already-weak Sun.Mr Ellison expressed frustration over the delay, but said he was confident the Sun deal would be approved.“The US took their time and deliberations and cleared it. They said it was overwhelmingly a pro-competitive deal,” he said. “The Europeans have to do their, job, but I think once they do their job, they’ll come to the same conclusion.”Mr Ellison made his comments during a rare and wide-ranging interview hosted by the Churchill Club, a prominent Silicon Valley forum. During the more than hour-long discussion, Mr Ellison also laid out his vision for a new generation of integrated computer systems. “We believe in this model where we deliver complete computers systems,” he said.Rather than competing over individual components, Mr Ellison said he wants Oracle to provide end-to-end systems for the world’s largest organisations.There has been speculation that Oracle, a software company, would sell off Sun’s substantial hardware divisions. But Mr Ellison said he would keep every part of the the company, including Sun’s data storage lines.“We think by combining our hardware with our software, we can deliver products that can be the backbone of most enterprises in America,” he said. “We are very interested in running airline reservation systems and banking systems, and that involves hardware and software.”

Analysts had been expecting initial jobless claims to rise.Homebuilders rallied after data showed new US residential building rose in August to a nine-month high. A separate study on Wednesday indicated confidence among US homebuilders rose for the third consecutive month in September.Beazer Homes, which operates in 17 states, rose 6.2 per cent to $5.13. Standard Pacific, which also provides mortgage financing, gained 1 per cent to $4.25.But after opening lower, Wall Street struggled to hold on to mid-morning gains. The S&P closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,065.49. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 9,783.92 and the Nasdaq slipped 0.3 per cent to 2,126.75.On Wednesday, US stocks had rallied to their highest levels since October after industrial production data raised hopes of economic recovery.“The economic news has been primarily good,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com. “We’ve had a heck of a rally and you have a lot of money managers on the side who, whether they like it or not, are forced to participate. But at the same time, when it’s been rallying this much you’re definitely going to get a pause after a few days.”Financial stocks initially led the market higher. Citigroup rose 5.2 per cent to $4.42 after Rochdale Securities said the group’s shares could return to the $5 level and that a share offering or sale of stock by the government was unlikely.Optimism about economic recovery also lifted Bank of America shares 2.1 per cent to $17.61 and JPMorgan 0.7 per cent to $44.96.Rising commodity prices continued to prop up material and industrial companies in early trading before they led the declines in the afternoon. Nucor, the second-largest US steel
producer, rose 3.6 per cent to $49.84 after Citigroup upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold” on expectations the group could return to profit in the fourth quarter.While energy stocks also clung on to the fluctuating oil price, Ivanhoe Energy powered ahead of the sector, gaining 11.1 per cent to $2.41. The oil and gas exploration company said analysts had found one of its oilfields in Ecuador contained as much as 12.1bn barrels.But Peabody Energy fell 1.9 per cent to $39.86 and Patriot Coal lost 5.6 per cent to $12.76 after both were downgraded by UBS analysts, who said stock prices already reflected a recovery in the industry.After three straight days of losses, Oracle, the software company, fell another 2.8 per cent to $21.52. The California-based company has been facing a delay in closing its purchase of Sun Microsystems, and the shares took another battering on Thursday after the company’s first-quarter sales missed analyst estimates.In an effort to return to profitability, American Airlines said it had raised $2.9bn in cash and loans to increase its number of flights from Chicago, New York, Dallas and Miami. Shares in AMR, its parent company, soared 19.7 per cent to $8.80.The consumer staples index led the market during early losses, but from midday it remained in the red. Smithfield Foods added to the sector’s woes, losing 3.3 per cent to $13.71. The pork processor said a public offering of 21.66m shares was priced at $13.85 per share, below the closing price on Wednesday.FedEx shares also slipped 2.2 per cent to $76.46 after reporting first-quarter profit that matched forecasts on Wall Street but lower-than-expected revenue. The delivery company, which is considered a bellwether for US business activity, also reaffirmed its forecast.In the pharmaceutical sector, Immunogen said late on Wednesday that it had extended its licence for technology to develop anti-cancer drugs to Amgen, the biotechnology company. Immunogen rose 3.5 per cent to $8.24, while Amgen gained 1.4 per cent to $60.52."
649;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-17T19:41:58Z;Oracle / Sun Microsystems;;Larry Ellison is no stranger to drawn-out deals – it took the Oracle chief 18 months and a court fight with US trust-busters to complete his hostile $10bn takeover of Peoplesoft. Still, the head of the world’s biggest business software company must be kicking himself for not seeking earlier European Union approval for Oracle’s acquisition of Sun Microsystems. Sun’s already faded star has dimmed steadily since Oracle pipped IBM with a $7.4bn all-cash offer for the stricken computer maker in April. The longer Oracle’s hold-up in Brussels drags on, though, the harder it will be for Mr Ellison to deliver the deal’s hoped-for benefits.As each day passes, rivals IBM and Hewlett-Packard poach more Sun customers. Fourth-quarter results showed that Sun’s sales fell 31 per cent year-on-year, worse than analysts had feared. As performance continues to slide, Oracle’s aim that Sun would contribute $1.5bn of operating profit in the first year of the deal – a target reiterated in Oracle’s quarterly conference call on Wednesday – looks increasingly tenuous. Oracle’s own sales are suffering, as companies scale back spending. As for Sun, Bernstein now expects it barely to break even next year – down from a forecast of about $900m in operating profit when analysts modelled the deal in April.Even so, Oracle is unlikely to walk away – although it could, and without suffering a break fee. After all, Mr Ellison does not want Sun’s software products, such as Java or Solaris, to fall into the hands of rivals. Furthermore, this week the two companies launched an Oracle-powered server designed to compete directly with hardware made by IBM and HP. Oracle’s best hope is that Brussels takes less than the maximum four months to pass the Sun deal. Until that happens, both companies will count the cost.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
650;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-16T23:06:33Z;LSE swoop shows strength of the subcontinent;;"When the world’s biggest exchanges go hunting for tech-savvy companies to help upgrade their trading systems, the last place they tend to look is Sri Lanka, a country known more for the civil war that has ravaged it for more than two decades.But that is where the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday made a $30m commitment, snapping up a little-known – but rapidly growing – company called MillenniumIT.The company was founded by Tony Weeresinghe, a former country manager for US software company Oracle, in 1996. It employs a staff of 450, most on a 6.5 hectare campus outside Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, complete with tennis court and gymnasium.MillenniumIT specialises in developing and selling the kind of ultra-fast trading systems that exchanges increasingly need to attract the “high-frequency” traders that are proving an ever-larger share of orders to exchanges.The LSE’s purchase is a sign that technology groups in the Indian subcontinent are flexing muscles globally, winning business from under the noses of better-known companies in Europe.In India, Mumbai-based Financial Technologies has muscled its way into the mainstream world of exchange technology by building systems for local exchanges in India and expanding into the Gulf and elsewhere in Asia.But it also marks a major milestone for MillenniumIT, which started with 12 employees under Mr Weeresinghe and has often struggled to convince prospective customers that it can compete with well-established rivals.MillenniumIT’s first contract was to provide the Colombo Stock Exchange with a new depository and clearing system, paid for with funds provided by the US government.Contracts followed for other developing market exchanges in Kenya and Tanzania. In 2001 Mr Weeresinghe was on holiday in Boston when he got wind of a tender that the Boston Stock Exchange had put out for the upgrade of the exchange’s trading system.He managed to get a meeting with the executive in charge of the tender. “The first question was ‘where is Sri Lanka?’,” the soft-spoken Mr Weeresinghe recalls, sitting in an empty office that the LSE has already provided for him.Even after Mr Weeresinghe had persuaded the Boston exchange to put his company on a shortlist of two for the job, the Americans still doubted the Sri Lankan company’s commitment, given how far away it was based.Mr Weeresinghe decided to move to Boston to demonstrate his commitment – and the company won the contract. He still lives there with his family but admits his company’s location has sometimes been an obstacle: “Probably being a Sri Lankan company cost us a few deals as well,” he says.There have been other obstacles. The company received some venture capital backing in 1999. But its small size – relative to rivals in more mature markets – would often lead prospective customers to question whether it would survive long enough to complete any contract it might win.“I have faced the situation many times where we have been the chosen partners for technology and the [customer’s] board has shut it down and said ‘we don’t want to put all our eggs in this basket when we don’t know the company’s future’,” Mr Weeresinghe says.Wednesday’s deal showed that, as far as the LSE is concerned, those days are over.It is also a vote of confidence in MillenniumIT’s technology, which has yet to be proven on a wide scale. Its only other big customer was the American Stock Exchange, now part of NYSE Euronext.The attraction for the LSE is technology that MillenniumIT has developed that should increase the number of electronic orders that come in to the LSE. Currently its TradElect system can handle 20,000 messages per second; the Sri Lankan company claims its technology can handle more than 1m.David Lester, LSE chief information officer, says: “If you think of the expense we have with external software providers and you compare that with Sri Lanka, it’s a huge cost saving. There is also the intellectual software we get.”"
651;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-16T21:01:45Z;Oracle stock slips as sales miss targets;;Oracle shares fell more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday as first-quarter revenue at the leading database software maker fell more than expected, by 5.1 per cent to $5.05bn.Company executives said improved operating margins had kept profit on track even though new licence revenue dropped 17 per cent, or 14 per cent before the effect of currency. As recently as June, Oracle said the new licence fall-off before the currency impact would be 10 per cent or less.Oracle met the consensus projections for non-GAAP profit of $1.5bn, or 30 cents a share, flat compared with a year earlier. Currency fluctuations lowered GAAP earnings to $1.12bn, or 22 cents, compared with $1.08bn, or 21 cents, a year earlier.The quarterly report comes after a spate of mixed results and generally positive comments from technology industry mainstays. Investors continue to scrutinise each announcement for signs that the sector will lead a broader economic rebound.

It’s a pay-as-you-go virtual desktop service that combines virtualisation technologies from vendors such as VMware, Citrix, Wyse and Desktone.IBM offers various hosting options, including three cloud-based delivery models, dedicated hosting or, for traditionalists, using the organisation’s own on-premises infrastructure.Managing infrastructureHewlett-Packard has announced HP Insight Control for VMware vCentre Server, which allows businesses to manage both physical and virtual infrastructure using VMware’s vCentre product.In similar vein, Dell and Lenovo have also struck deals with VMware. Dell will offer VMware View as an option on selected servers and PCs, while Lenovo will offer vSphere 4, VMware’s core virtualisation product, on its servers worldwide – previously their accord was limited to China.Citrix challenge to VMwareCitrix is out to steal VMware’s thunder with an open-source cloud infrastructure offering, the Xen Cloud Platform. Citrix hopes to undermine the lead enjoyed by VMware’s proprietary vSphere product by stressing how Xen Cloud will run virtual machines from any vendor.By contrast, VMware’s own cloud initiative, called vCloud requires organisations to standardise on VMware technology.Oracle’s fraud-busterOracle has a new release of its Mantas Fraud, which helps financial institutions tackle fraud in its multiple forms. As well as online fraud, this new release can detect identity theft, cheque and deposit fraud, insider fraud, debit card fraud and electronic payments fraud.The new release includes enhanced network discovery and visualisation capabilities for more effective identification of complex fraud schemes and rings.Salesforce.com for the smallest companiesSalesforce.com has launched a version of its popular hosted customer relationship management service for the smallest of small businesses. Called Contact Manager Edition, it caters for businesses with one or two people and provides basic CRM features including a contact manager, reporting, e-mail integration and integration with Google Apps. It costs $9 a month for each user.Fujitsu notebooksFujitsu has stolen a lead on its rivals with two convertible notebooks designed for the built-in touch capabilities of Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system, which hits the shops next month.The touch features let users enlarge or move windows using their finger while handwriting recognition can digitise text written on the screen with a pen. The two Lifebook models, T4310 and T4410, use Intel Core 2 Duo processors and have an integrated 3G wireless card.Intel’s Core family growsTalking of processors, Intel has announced new offspring in its Core family of PC processors. The biggest innovation is the reduced bill-of-materials count as the Core i7 and Core i5 processors are the first Intel processors to integrate graphics port and memory controller, so requiring just one additional chip. Previous Intel chipsets required two separate chips.Telephony link-upDigium, maker of the Asterisk open-source telephony platform, has teamed up with Skype to let businesses with an Asterisk-based PBX use Skype’s IP telephony network.The combination of Skype and Asterisk gives those companies that already use Skype the advanced call management capabilities of Asterisk, while Asterisk users can now make free or low-cost calls via the Skype network..
653;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-09T17:13:50Z;Software company finds lucrative niche;;Brazil is not known for its software industry, which makes the success of Totvs, a company that might appear less out of place on the IT-heavy Bombay Stock Exchange than on Brazil’s Bovespa, all the more surprising.Totvs produces enterprise resource planning (ERP) software for small and medium-sized companies, focusing on firms with up to $2bn in revenues. It has sustained fast growth with little volatility in its home market and is increasingly expanding overseas. In the past eight years alone, Totvs has grown revenues 10 times to some 1.05bn reais, says José Rogerio Luiz, CFO. That makes it the largest in the ERP space in emerging markets and the eighth most important such company in the world. In its home market, Totvs has seen off the challenge from giants such as SAP and Oracle, Mr Luiz asserts.The secret has been its niche: Totvs is the king of ERP for small and medium companies and develops a close relationship with all its clients, offering a product that Mr Luiz says is as essential as electricity or telephony.The company has several features that help distinguish it for cost-conscious consumers, thinks Carlos Sequeira, analyst at UBS Pactual. Totvs’ products tend to be cheaper and require less energy than solutions provided by competitors. It blends third party software with its own, relatively basic proprietary language. That keeps costs to a minimum by reducing development spend and yet avoiding the paying of licenses. And Totvs feels local wherever it goes by establishing exclusive franchises rather than using the industry standard of employing third party vendors.Careful not to expand too fast outside Brazil, the company has instead focused on developing a dominant share of the domestic market before looking overseas. It has grown domestically through a judicious blend of organic growth and acquisition. Recently, it received approval from the Brazilian anti-trust agency, CADE, to absorb its chief rival in the Brazilian market, Datasul. Totvs acquires rivals where the target helps to fill out its product offering and penetrate new client bases. Growth of the mining, oil and gas sectors, alongside hosting the World Cup in 2014 means the country remains attractive for further expansion, Mr Luiz says.At the same time, Totvs is already geographically diverse. It is present in 26 markets and has offices in three. Nevertheless, it emphasises caution in its expansion plans for foreign markets. “It’s like Napoleon and the invasion of Russia. You have to be strong in your home market before you attempt to conquer another,” Mr Luiz says. That is partly because of the time it takes to make a product fit the local market, a process that can take up to three years.In addition to Latin America, especially Mexico, the firm sees opportunities in Africa and India. Mr Luiz insists that despite the number of software companies in India, many are third-party providers and those focusing on servicing domestic companies do not focus on ERP software. “As soon as I got back from India two years ago, I realised that it is a huge and historic opportunity and one that we cannot pass up,” he says.
654;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Brussels v Oracle;;"So much, it might seem, for the thaw between US and European Union trust-busters. Christine Varney, President Barack Obama’s choice as the US justice department’s antitrust chief, has pledged to reassert the government’s role in policing anticompetitive behaviour after the laisser-faire Bush years. That should chime with the European Union’s more interventionist approach. Yet the European Commission last week extended its investigation of Oracle’s planned $7.4bn merger with Sun Microsystems into a second stage of up to four months – after Washington cleared it without conditions. Cue alarm bells all round. This is the first big all-US merger the EU has examined during the Obama presidency; if blocked, it would be the first US deal to suffer that fate since General Electric-Honeywell in 2001.But hold on. Brussels has not blocked the deal, nor even concluded yet that there is a competition issue. It does, however, want more time to examine whether there might be, in one area: that the deal could thwart the growth of MySQL, a popular, open-source, corporate database programme owned by Sun that competes with Oracle’s proprietary software. Oracle says since MySQL is open-source, by definition there are no obstacles to competitors developing commercial products based on it; rivals have complained to Brussels that there are. The Commission, unlike the US regulator, is legally obliged to probe any potential competition problem, otherwise it can be challenged in the European Court.Oracle is angry about the delay; competitors are utilising the uncertainty to poach clients from Sun. Yet while there may be blame on both sides, Oracle was late in officially notifying the deal to Brussels – on July 30, three months after it was announced. It may have miscalculated that if it could get US approval, the EU would rubberstamp it. Oracle’s best approach now is full co-operation with Brussels to resolve what both say is a minor issue. Then a deal that both also agree is, overall, pro-competitive can proceed.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"
655;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-03T21:49:19Z;Brussels’ Sun delay leaves Oracle in a quandry;;"How could an open source software project that we hear generates a modest 17m euros a year in Europe have held up a $7.4bn tech industry mega-merger ?Unlikely as it sounds, Brussels has put the Oracle/Sun deal on hold while it takes a longer look at the fate of tiny MySQL, which Gartner reckons has a database market share of around half a percentage point.Clearly, somewhere along the line Oracle has played its cards very badly.For whatever reason, it filed its official notification of the merger in Europe just as Brussels was closing down for the summer. Armed with clearance from the Department of Justice, it seems to have felt confident enough to press ahead to get the deal cleared and finalised before Labour Day. If so, that strategy has backfired.The question now: how substantive could Europe’s concerns over the database software market be?It’s true that MySQL’s current revenues understate its wider impact, given its business model (free download, pay for service). Also, they don’t help in understanding its potential to become a more important disruptive force in future.That might suggest that Oracle would have a strong incentive to kill it in its crib. But if so, why has Microsoft been agitating to prevent Oracle from getting its hands on MySQL? After all, you’d think Redmond would be only too happy to see Oracle put down a potential competitor.This exposes the wider issues at stake in the Sun deal. Microsoft’s interest is in doing all it can to delay or block Oracle from extending its influence over infrastructure software through the control of Java. If the fate of MySQL is the aspect of the deal that resonates most in Brussels, so be it (Java was the reason the DoJ gave for dragging its feet in giving its own approval of the deal, but as we reported last month, this wasn’t an issue that European rival SAP seemed too exercised about).In reality, it would be hard for Oracle to kill MySQL. It doesn’t control the IP, since the software is available under the GPL. Anyone else could clone it and continue their own version – as, indeed, founder Monty Widenius put it when the deal was announced:I don’t think that anyone can own an open source project; the projects are defined by the de-facto project leaders and the developers that are working on the project. If the company loses the trust of these people, they can go away and fork the project and turn it the way they want to.True, Oracle would own the MySQL name. Also, the momentum behind the project would be weakened if the core group of developers were to disband and, as Widenius put it, “spread like the wind”.But with some big Web companies, including Facebook, built on top of the software, it’s hard to believe that MySQL would just fade away.That said, Oracle now faces an invidious choice. It can press its case in the face of Europe’s publicly voiced doubts, but that might only serve to extend the second-phase review into early next year. Even if it eventually prevailed, it would have lost months, Sun’s business would only have been further weakened by the uncertainty.Or it can try to resolve things faster by proposing some sort of remedy to deal with Brussels’ concerns. There’s no assurance even then, though, that it would get a speedy resolution.Second-stage investigations from Brussels often end without the Commission filing a statement of objections. But this is certainly not the position Oracle wanted to be in right now."
656;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-09-03T18:42:54Z;Oracle’s Sun deal snagged in Brussels;;Oracle’s $7.4bn acquisition of Sun Microsystems hit an unexpected and potentially damaging obstacle in Brussels on Thursday as European antitrust officials opted to break with Washington in order to scrutinise the deal more closely.The more stringent stance in Brussels breaks with recent efforts by competition authorities on either side of the Atlantic to align their investigations, and is particularly notable since the deal has already been given the green light by a new US administration that has taken a tougher line on competition issues, particularly in the tech industry.The longer European review, which could extend into early next year, will greatly add to the uncertainty surrounding the struggling Sun and further undermine confidence among its customers, analysts warned.“It’s going to be very damaging to Sun and its whole market,” said Andy Butler, an analyst at Gartner, a tech research firm. “It’s slowly hemorraging their business viability. The only winners today are companies like Microsoft, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.”The controversy surrounding the regulatory delay was heightened on Thursday by the nature of the potential European concerns, which touch on an area of the technology world that only accounts for a very small fraction of Sun’s business.Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said that Brussels wanted to look more closely at the impact on the database software business of Oracle, one of the leaders in that market, acquiring control of MySQL, an open source database product that was acquired by Sun last year.While it has found a market among large-scale web services companies such as Facebook, MySQL has made little headway in the mainstream corporate database market dominated by Oracle, IBM and Microsoft. According to one person familiar with its business, MySQL generated revenues of only €17m ($24m) in Europe last year, and its roughtly $70m of annual sales make it only the fourteenth-largest database software maker.Despite that, Brussels’ interest echoes claims from some Oracle rivals that the software maker would have little incentive to continue developing a product that could one day prove disruptive to its core business.“Companies are looking for cost-effective IT solutions and systems based on open-source software are increasingly emerging as viable alternatives to proprietary solutions,” said Ms Kroes. “The Commission has to ensure that such alternatives would continue to be available.”Since it is an open-source product, Sun has little control over MySQL, owning only the trademark and employing some of the developers who lead a wider group of volunteer programmers. If Oracle were to stop development, it would have no power to prevent others from taking the MySQL code and continuing the project, Mr Butler and other analysts said.
657;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;SAP’s Plattner: Oracle control of Java is not a problem;;The US may have cleared Oracle’s acquisition of Sun, but there’s still a view among some people who have been close to this transaction that it won’t be the easy sell in Europe that Wall Street seems to assume.According to this view, Oracle won’t get the same free pass to acquire Java that it got from the Department of Justice, but will be forced to accept some sort of undertaking to ensure that licensing of Java does not become overly restrictive. Given the central part Java has played in building a counter-weight to Microsoft in the software industry, it isn’t hard to see why European regulators might be interested. There have been rumblings that SAP has been lobbying hard with Brussels on this issue.If so, then someone forgot to tell Hasso Plattner. The chairman of SAP’s supervisory board, and a co-founder of the company, Plattner was in Silicon Valley late this week, and I got the chance to ask him how he feels about Java passing to Oracle.His response: “Oracle will not screw it up, they will tread carefully.”Oracle knows how to accommodate rivals when its own interests are at stake, he reasoned: after all, the fortunes of its database business depend heavily on customers’ ability to run SAP’s applications on top of Oracle software.But won’t Oracle raise the price of Java licences?According to Plattner, raising prices would be a sure way to destroy the business. Customers would quickly turn to something cheaper. As we reported at the time of the Oracle/ Sun deal, there is nothing to prevent rivals from forking Java, though they wouldn’t be able to use the name and trademark.I certainly wouldn’t bet against Brussels holding Oracle’s feet to the fire over the Sun deal. But the lack of concern expressed even by an arch-rival like Plattner suggests that Oracle should eventually prevail without being forced to yield too much on Java.
658;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-08-21T01:46:32Z;Oracle gets US clearance for Sun acquisition;;Oracle on Thursday won clearance from the US Department of Justice for its $7.4bn acquisition of Sun Microsystems, after an earlier delay in the approval process threatened to knock the deal off-course.The US software company had originally hoped to close the deal quickly, but hit a stumbling block when the DoJ failed to give its approval at the end of an initial investigation. In an unusual move at the time, a lawyer representing Oracle said that the hold-up related to “one narrow issue” that was “never going to get in the way of the deal.”Oracle attributed the delay to scrutiny of the licensing arrangements surrounding Java, the programming language and software development tools that are controlled by Sun and which Oracle has singled out as the main reason for its acquisition.Some of Oracle’s biggest rivals, such as IBM, rely heavily on the Java technology, putting them at a potential disadvantage once Oracle takes control. However, Oracle has said that any steps it took to gain an advantage from its control of Java would be self-defeating, since this would only serve to fragment the broad support for Java in the technology world and undermine its value.The deal is still waiting for approval from the European Commission, which has set a deadline of September 3 for completion of its own review. Oracle is poised to close the acquisition as soon as it gets clearance from Brussels, but would fail to meet its self-imposed deadline of completing the deal in the summer if Europe decides to launch a more in-depth, second-stage review.
659;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-08-19T20:00:24Z;It takes all kinds to make it to the top;;"BOOK REVIEW1000 CEOs
Proven strategies for success from the
world’s smartest executives
by Andrew Davidson and othersDorling Kindersley, £25An ambitious young person about to start work in a large company might reasonably speculate about what sort of qualities the employer might be looking for when it promotes people to senior positions.Is there a particular style of management you should try to adopt, or avoid? If you are aiming high, you might want to study the profile of the current chief executive: what jobs did he or she do on the way to the top, what decisions were crucial?If you are thinking along these lines, you could do worse than browse for a few hours in this unusual book. It contains profiles of 1,000 chief executives, mostly current or past bosses of private-sector companies but also includes a few non-business organisations such as the Tate Gallery, Amnesty International and the BBC. The principal author is Andrew Davidson, an experienced interviewer.Because the 1,000 individuals are covered in 500 pages, the profiles are necessarily short. They cover, in staccato fashion, a few key themes: leadership style, key strength, best decision, lessons in business and a brief biography.What is pleasing about the anthology is the extraordinary variety of personalities, backgrounds and decisions that seem to be compatible with managerial success. No doubt it helps to be visionary, creative and entrepreneurial like Steve Jobs at Apple (pictured above), but should one also try to be perfectionist (Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook), or combative (Larry Ellison of Oracle), or inspirational and courageous (James McNerney of Boeing)? Is it better to be affable, self-deprecating and relaxed (Jeff Immelt of General Electric), or a hard-hitting, ruthless workaholic (Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase)?Similarly, when Davidson and his co-authors report on key decisions, there is a large menu to choose from. For Howard Stringer, the Welshman who runs Sony, the best decision was to persuade Lou Gerstner, the man who had turned round IBM, to be his exclusive personal coach.For Lee Iacocca of Chrysler it was having the strength to swallow the company’s pride and ask for government support to avoid bankruptcy. For Stuart Rose of Marks and Spencer, it was to recruit celebrities such as Twiggy to front the retailer’s advertising campaigns.A more personal piece of advice comes from James Ziemer of Harley-Davidson. His best decision was, when he was a teenager, to commute to a second high school for advanced maths lessons, which his own school did not provide, thus acquiring the skills he needed to launch his career.As for business lessons, these run from the obvious (if it’s not broke don’t fix it, make up your mind and get on with the job, hit the opposition hard and then hit them again) to rather more useful observations. For Katharine Graham, who ran the Washington Post for many years, the lesson was to manage people like a woman, not like a man; women are said to be better at giving praise and at understanding people.There are also some interesting contrasts: for example, between Miuccia Prada of Prada, who deliberately seeks the spotlight (“sometimes it pays to be the public face of the company”), and Amancio Ortega Gaona, chairman of Inditex, the Spanish company that built the Zara retail chain. Mr Ortega has never given an interview and is rarely photographed. His message to the self-publicising executive: are you helping the company, or trying to make yourself famous?The book is too heavy to take on an aeroplane but very suitable for a coffee table, and its style is reader-friendly. The CEOs are divided (somewhat arbitrarily) into categories – motivators, innovators, visionaries and so on – and the profiles are interspersed with short features on themes such as planning for succession and turning the company green.The format of 1000 CEOs is typical of the publisher, Dorling Kindersley, a subsidiary of Pearson, which owns the Financial Times.Could some clever analyst convert this material into a dataset, put it into a computer and extract some general conclusions? Almost certainly not. The clearest lesson from the book is that there is no general lesson. It takes all sorts of personalities, and all sorts of career paths, to get to the top. For someone starting out, that must be a source of encouragement."
660;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;IT outsourcers face cloud computing challenge;;Cloud computing is threatening the business model of the Indian IT outsourcing industry as the global recession pushes business to cut costs, according to the chief executive of Infosys.But Kris Gopalakrishnan, one of the leading figures in the Indian IT industry, also said he saw opportunities to expand Infosys’s customer base as cloud computing would allow it to tap into mid-sized companies.Cloud computing allows software applications and data to reside on web servers rather than on users’ own computers. Mr Gopalakrishnan said: “The slowdown has forced companies to look at cloud computing seriously …it is a change that is happening and if we are not adapting to that change we may get caught out.”Moving its outsourcing applications to cloud computing would require a large investment by Infosys and other Indian companies. Mr Gopalakrishnan said Infosys, India’s second-biggest IT services exporter, was “testing the waters” with cloud computing as previous much-heralded technological changes had failed to happen as quickly as predicted: “The question is how much the market will move to the new form of computing.”But he added that Infosys – and by extension other Indian IT outsourcing companies – needed to find a role for themselves if that change took place or risk being squeezed out by western competitors such as IBM, HP and Oracle. That role would be as an integrator, he added.But the shift to cloud computing could also open growth opportunities for Infosys. Currently, Infosys focuses only on the world’s 1,000 leading companies, which have annual revenues of approximately $5bn or more. But cloud computing would allow it to tap the mid-market and “this could bring it down to $1bn-plus revenues”, said Mr Gopalakrishnan.IT outsourcing has been one of India’s most successful industries. But it has been caught out by the economic crisis as well as increased competition from the likes of IBM.Mr Gopalakrishnan said he was worried about protectionism in the US. Infosys receives 62 per cent of its business from the US and 35 per cent from financial services. The rise in protectionism underlined the wisdom of Infosys’s move to double the amount of work it does in emerging markets in the next three to five years, he said.“We need to change. We want to bring down these dependencies and create a more balanced distribution of revenues,” he added.
661;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Venture to face regulatory scrutiny;;Microsoft’s landmark search alliance with Yahoo would face much stiffer scrutiny from regulators than generally expected, antitrust experts warned on Thursday.The most intense interest will come from Washington. Brussels, which has taken the lead in reining in Microsoft since the US resolved its most recent antitrust action in 2001, is set to take a back seat.The companies painted their alliance as the only realistic chance to create a viable alternative to Google in the increasingly important search advertising market. Already the biggest part of the online advertising business, this is set to continue to expand in significance, growing by 15 per cent a year to reach $30bn in 2014, to says Forrester Research.According to Microsoft and Yahoo estimates, Google has 77 per cent of search advertising in the US and more than 90 per cent in Europe – larger than its market share in search, given its greater skill at turning searches into cash.“This is really about going from one to two when it comes to having long-term sustainable competition in the search marketplace,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft general counsel.“Neither Microsoft nor Yahoo alone could look at a future over the next decade with the kind of ability for sustained profitable competition that this now gives us the opportunity to create.”That is a claim that is likely to be taken with a large pinch of salt at the Department of Justice.As Microsoft has shown over a number of years, it has been prepared to pour large amounts of money into its own efforts to catch up with Google.Steve Ballmer, chief executive, has repeatedly insisted that Microsoft will invest whatever is needed over the long term to catch up with Google.Mr Smith’s claim that Microsoft needs a merger with Yahoo to become a viable competitor “is a plea that will fall on deaf ears” in Washington, said David Balto, a former DoJ official.“Microsoft is not some also-ran that needs help from the antitrust division to stay competitive in the market,” he said.Antitrust experts pointed to a case involving a proposed merger of baby-food companies as evidence that US regulators sometimes oppose a combination between number two and three players in a market, even when the market leader is dominant.In that case, the Federal Trade Commission blocked Heinz from buying Beech-Nut, even though the two would still have had far less clout than Gerber, which accounted for two-thirds of the market.That case remains controversial, and other similar cases have gone the other way – most notably Oracle’s successful resistance of a DoJ attempt to block its acquisition of PeopleSoft to become a stronger competitor to SAP in business software applications. Yet it suggests that Microsoft will face some tough questions in Washington.European regulators were also likely to use the case as an the opportunity to take a closer look at search advertising for the first time, said Stephen Kinsella, a partner at business law firm Sidley Austin.He added that Brussels was highly unlikely to raise any concerns, particularly given Microsoft and Yahoo’s very small market shares in Europe. “This is one of the few areas where the US takes a stricter line,” than Europe, he said.In cases were the US has objected to the formation of duopolies, its concern has generally been about the risk of collusion between the remaining players in the market, said Mr Smith.“I don’t know of anyone who thinks there is any possibility that Microsoft and Google would collude about anything.”
662;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-07-28T20:18:47Z;IBM acquisition steps up software race;;IBM looked set to trigger another round of consolidation among the world’s largest makers of business software on Tuesday as it announced an all-cash $1.2bn acquisition of SPSS, a company whose technology is used to analyse and forecast customer and market trends.The deal also brings an intensification of the mergers and acquisitions wave that has started to sweep across the technology sector, as cash-rich companies take advantage of the downturn to make strategic acquisitions that round out their product ranges.It comes a day after Agilent, the maker of electronics test equipment that was spun off from Hewlett-Packard, agreed to pay $1.5bn in cash to diversify into the life sciences industry through the acquisition of Varian Semiconductor.EMC last week completed a $2.2bn cash purchase of Data Domain to extend its reach into an important new area of data back-up.Dealmaking between tech companies was frozen earlier in year as share prices crashed and demand from customers dried up, but it has revived as valuations have recovered somewhat and volatility has receded.The acquisition of SPSS gives IBM a stronger foothold in the new high ground of business software, known as predictive analytics.The technology, which analyses past patterns of behaviour to try to forecast future trends, is used in things such as online marketing campaigns, where prices and other factors can be adjusted in real time to improve effectiveness.“Every client is asking for an information-led strategy” that relies on technologies such as predictive analytics to “optimise everything” in their operations, said Ambuj Goyal, general manager of IBM’s information management division.IBM’s biggest software rivals were now likely to scramble to reinforce their own technology in this area to counter IBM, said Boris Evelson, an analyst at Forrester Research.SAP, which has relied on a close partnership with SPSS, faces the most immediate threat. “We will definitely see a similar move from SAP fairly soon,” Mr Evelson said.A similar round of acquisitions was triggered in the larger business intelligence software market after Oracle bought Hyperion early in 2007 for $3.3bn. IBM and SAP countered with deals of their own later that year for a total of $11.7bn.IBM said it would pay $50 a share in cash for SPSS, a 42 per cent premium to the closing price the day before.
663;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-07-28T13:44:34Z;Office technology;;"Do more with less. It’s the mantra of the office manager in the downturn – and one that, in theory, should reassure makers of hardware and software designed to improve the way companies work. Investors certainly seem to believe so – technology stocks have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index since markets began to rally in March. Alas, Canon’s 28 per cent drop in second-quarter sales revealed on Tuesday – it makes most of its money from office copiers and printers – suggests the outlook for business technology remains bleak.This is also true for big IT projects, where benefits tend to accrue over three or five years. They continue to be postponed in favour of smaller deals that make the most of existing kit. While sales at Canon and Xerox have shown signs of bottoming out, few expect demand to improve much before next year. Even then, recovery may be modest. IT professionals surveyed recently by Gartner, the market research group, expect average software budgets to increase just 1.5 per cent next year, after sharp falls this year. Hardware budgets are expected to show a similar pattern.The technology sector’s struggles are ironic given its role in providing companies with a window to business performance. This downturn is the first in which business software from the likes of Oracle and SAP – expected to report a 10 per cent drop in sales on Wednesday – have given companies a real-time view of deteriorating business conditions. Companies’ ability to see what is coming at them – and to adjust headcount accordingly – may be one reason US non-farm business productivity rose 1.9 per cent in the first quarter, unlike in previous recessions. In the 1981 downturn, productivity fell 5 per cent as job cuts failed to keep pace with falling demand. Still, it is not all bad news. When conditions improve, real-time monitoring means technology sales should also bounce back faster.Canon eked out a Y15.6bn net profit in the quarter from April to June but said that recovery in the world economy is likely to be slow.“Taking into account such future concerns as climbing unemployment rates in developed countries, considerable time will likely be needed before the global economy realises a turnaround but conditions are likely to gradually ease off toward the end of the year,” the company said.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

Its mainframes have supported virtual machines for decades, but virtualisation is less common on its mid-range servers based on Intel or Power processors, even though many data centres use all three platforms. IBM Systems Director VMControl aims to make it easier to manage all types of its hardware within a virtualised world.SuccessFactors to track employee successSuccessFactors, which specialises in on-demand human resources software, has released SuccessFactors Express, an automated performance management solution for companies with fewer than 50 employees. This web-based offering is aimed at fast-growing small businesses that need a system to track employee performance and progress against planned goals.Apple authentication from RSASecurity specialist RSA has unveiled an authentication product that provides Apple iPhone users with secure access to enterprise applications and resources. The RSA SecurID Software Token for iPhone, downloadable free of charge from Apple’s App Store, generates a one-time password that changes every 60 seconds and is designed to be used with RSA’s Authentication Manager software.Oracle insurance goes multi-lingualOracle has unveiled Oracle Insurance Policy Administration 9.0, the latest release of its rules-based policy administration system for insurance companies. The biggest novelty is support for multiple languages and currencies within a single instance of the system. This allows global insurers to roll out one policy administration system in multiple countries, while regionally-focussed insurers can conduct business in any combination of languages and currencies.Security with less expense from IBMSecurity does not usually come cheap but IBM has made it less expensive. The Comprehensive Data Protection Solution (CDPS) Express offering combines dedicated back-up hardware, software and services and is aimed at mid-sized enterprises worried about critical data such as customer information. For a limited period, IBM is selling the CDPS Express offering for $9,000, almost 40% less than the regular price.Early adopters for Windows 7Microsoft’s long-awaited Windows 7 hits the shops on October 22, but IT managers who want to take advantage of the summer slowdown can get a head start on the upgrade process. Businesses with a volume licence that signed up for the Microsoft Software Assurance programme can download Windows 7 on August 7. Volume licencees without SA must wait until September 1 and pay separately for the new operating system.Comverse and Infor team up on CRMComverse, the US specialist in telecoms billing software, wants to help telcos get closer to their customers.

Infor MyDay is free to users running the most recent releases of ERP Visual.Reward for pulling the plugHewlett-Packard hopes to attract Sun Microsystems customers unsure about the benefits of Sun’s acquisition by Oracle, which has just won shareholder approval. HP’s Sun Complete Care programme claims savings of up to 80 per cent on hardware costs and 60 per cent on server maintenance for businesses which pull the plug on their Sun hardware and use HP’s Integrity server line instead.Software as a serviceUS software house CA has unveiled a new software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering, CA Clarity Grants Manager On Demand. It is aimed at US states and municipalities that want to research and compare grants, particularly new sources of funding available under the US Reinvestment and Recovery Act. There is a growing trend for vendors to offer specialist applications that may only get used occasionally in a more cost-effective fashion as SaaS.Something for the thin clientAutonomy, the UK enterprise search specialist, has enhanced its Qfiniti contact centre offering with expanded support for the leading telephony platforms including Avaya, Genesys and Cisco. As well as better integration with these platforms, Qfiniti has improved quality monitoring and performance management, as well as support for thin-client computing devices.Security and sophisticationSonicWall, the security technology company, has fleshed out its TZ line of security appliances with two new offerings, the TZ 200 and TZ100, both of which have wireless variants. The TZ 100 is the new entry point to SonicWall’s line of appliances, which incorporates a new enterprise-class anti-spam service alongside familiar anti-virus and anti-spyware features. The TZ 200 adds more sophisticated per-user mailbox quarantine capabilities.Virtual performance monitorVirtualised data centres will soon be indistinguishable from the real thing. At least that is virtualisation specialist VMWare hopes. To get closer to that goal it has unveiled vCenter AppSpeed and vCenter Chargeback. The former helps monitor how well applications are performing on virtualised infrastructure while vCenter Chargeback lets IT departments allocate the costs of using their virtual data centre to the appropriate cost centres – which presumably pay with virtual money.
667;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-07-16T21:14:27Z;DMGT to switch off Teletext news service;;The internet claimed another legacy media victim on Thursday with the announcement that Teletext news and information services are to close in January 2010.Daily Mail & General Trust, Teletext’s owner, is switching off most of the service two years sooner than planned as audiences and advertising revenues flock to the web.In spite of the lure of the internet, Teletext, which offers a basic text-based news and information service through the television, still claims 11m loyal users.It began broadcasting in 1993 – as a successor to the Oracle service launched in 1974 – but next year all of its analogue services and most of its digital offerings will be turned off.Only its travel services, on TV and online, will remain. Three travel sites – including a price-comparison site, holiday booking and villa rental service – already account for about 40 per cent of revenue.Its audience peaked at 20m in 1999, with profits of more than £28m. But Teletext lost £3m in the six months to March 29, according to DMGT. Revenue was £41m in the previous financial year.“The continued fragmentation of television audiences, and the boom in online use for news, information and commercial services, have contributed to a significant reduction in Teletext’s viewing figures over recent years,” said Mike Stewart, Teletext’s group managing director.“The volume of commercial activity generated by this part of the business has fallen sharply, with revenue declining by 50 per cent since 2003. As a result Teletext’s television services have been lossmaking for the last three years.”Mr Stewart said it cost £10m to broadcast Teletext over the digital TV network. “Had there been no capacity costs, the profile [of profitability] would have looked very different.”He added that closure should reduce losses and allow management to focus on the profitable side of the business. About 70 jobs are said to be at risk.Mr Stewart said Teletext fans liked the service because it was familiar, reliable and easy to use.“We were very factual at a time when all reporting wasn’t just facts,” he said. “Do I think there’s [still] room for a service that meets that need?

Schlumberger gained 1.7 per cent to $51.83 and Chevron picked up 0.9 per cent to $63.It was supported by firmer consumer stocks, which rose after advance figures showed retail sales higher in June than May.Home Depot climbed 2.5 per cent to $23.68 while rival Lowe’s advanced 1.6 per cent to $19.57.But the effect of the data was tempered by the fact that much of the rise had come from increased spending on petrol.“People have got the money in their pocket, but they are still not spending it, which is not a surprise given how much the oil price rise in June will have affected petrol prices,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.5 per cent higher at 905.84, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 8,359.49 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.4 per cent to 1,799.73.Financial shares were mixed, even after Goldman Sachs reported much higher profits than expected.The bank had led a broad market rally on Monday after analyst Meredith Whitney, who turned bearish on financial stocks last year before many of her peers, recommended buying the shares.Ms Whitney said that Goldman’s profits would come in at $4.65 per share, much higher than the consensus view of $3.48, boosted by strong revenues from underwriting new issuance of stock and debt.Even her prediction proved overly-pessimistic though, as earnings were $4.93, excluding the amount Goldman had to pay back to get out of the government’s bail-out programme.The company managed to hold on to Monday’s gains, although did not build on them significantly, gaining 0.2 per cent to $149.66.“Most firms cannot play in Goldman’s league, so investors will focus more on earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo to give them a sign on how financials are doing,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim.Other banks were mixed. Citigroup rose 5.1 per cent to $2.92 but Bank of America dropped 0.6 per cent to $12.91 and Wells Fargo gave up 1.6 per cent to $24.40.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in commercial lender CIT Group spiked following two sessions of heavy falls after the ailing company said that it was in “active” discussions with regulators about a possible government rescue before it has to pay back $1bn of debt next month.The renewed hope that the company may avoid bankruptcy sent the shares up 19.3 per cent to $1.61.Johnson & Johnson was the second large corporate group to report its second-quarter earnings and the world’s largest healthcare company managed to beat both revenue and profits forecasts.Its shares picked up 0.9 per cent to $58.23.CSX, the railway operator, also announced its profits on the busiest day yet for announcements this earnings season.The company’s shares jumped 7 per cent to $34.80 after it revealed better profits than Wall Street had expected. The performance came largely from cost-cutting, with revenues coming in roughly as analysts had predicted.Dell weighed on the technology sector after the company warned that its second-quarter profit margins would be weaker as customers bought cheap notebook computers rather than more expensive items on which Dell makes more of a profit. The shares lost 8.1 per cent to $11.97 and the news put some pressure on its rivals.IBM fell 0.4 per cent to $103.25 while Hewlett-Packard gave up 0.4 per cent to $37.14.Sun Microsystems added to the pessimism in the sector after it forecast a steeper quarterly loss than expected on weak revenues as the company lost business to its competitors.The shares managed to rise 0.1 per cent to $9.17, but those in Oracle, which is in the process of buying the company for $5.6bn, lost 0.4 per cent to $20.63.

671;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-07-08T15:34:44Z;Does IT work?: Leaner use of logistics keeps supplies moving;;"The past few years have brought strong increases in revenue for the transport and logistics sector; it has enjoyed double-digit growth for most of this decade, according to PwC, the professional services firm.The current break in growth, as the economic downturn hits, may well prove temporary, but in the meantime, logistics and distribution managers – and the third-party logistics companies that carry an increasing percentage of the world’s goods – face pressures to contain costs and drive efficiencies throughout the supply chain.At the same time companies, especially those in retail, want to reduce their stock holdings. But they also want to avoid shortages and disappointed customers.“There are increasing demands on the supply chain at the moment, both internally and externally,” explains Danny Bagge, associate director for the retail supply chain at IBM Global Business Services.“Externally, there is huge pressure from retail to move material through the supply chain more quickly and with fewer people. But retail logistics people are saying they can’t reduce costs any more, they have taken out everything they can.”The improvements of the past few years in supply chain management, warehouse systems and – especially in retail – systems to predict and manage demand mean that there is little fat left to cut in most global companies’ logistics operations.When it comes to the third-party logistics, or 3PL, companies there is even less room for manoeuvre. Customers are demanding lower prices for shipping, as well as quicker turnround times and fewer incorrect orders. As a result, the logistics companies are looking to “added-value” services, such as packing or labelling, for additional sources of revenue.“A couple of years ago the supply chain discussion was ‘let’s buy lots, put it in a warehouse and then sell it’,” says Mr Bagge. “You can’t do that now, cash is king. It’s now about buying smaller quantities, seeing what is selling, and then buying to order.”This is largely possible because of the investments in IT that retailers and distribution companies made during the good times. But the “lean” approach to logistics has brought with it a new set of risks.A study carried out by AMR Research, the analyst firm, found that a year ago, the main challenges facing companies were rising transportation and fuel costs, and the availability of shipping slots, especially for consumer goods. “Capacity on eastbound ocean lanes was as hard to come by as Super Bowl tickets”, says AMR’s Kevin O’Marah.Now, though, supply chain risk is a foremost concern among logistics managers. Companies are increasingly worried that their suppliers might fail, or even if they do not, that they will be unable to ship their products. Non-economic factors, from piracy to the threat of swine flu, are also forcing companies to look again at their logistics planning.This has forced companies to pay more attention to supply chain network modelling, according to Mr O’Marah. It is one area of logistics technology spending that has held up well during the downturn, possibly because the costs are modest.“Supply chain network modelling is relatively inexpensive,” he says. It is not capital intensive like ERP (enterprise resource planning), or a new distribution centre or a ship.“The total spend on supply chain network modelling might be less than $1m, to put in the technology, build out the model and tune it.”Such investments, he suggests, should prove their worth relatively quickly, by helping companies identify where their supply routes might be vulnerable, and enabling them to plan alternatives. A project could pay for itself the first time a retailer or fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company faces a serious supply chain disruption.Other, longer-term investments in logistics technologies are being put on hold, however. Spending on tools such as radio frequency identification (RFID), or for larger items, GPS-based tagging, has dropped back.It is not just the economy that has affected spending on such systems. RFID, in particular, attracted a lot of attention at the beginning of the decade, with large retail groups such as Marks and Spencer and Wal-Mart using the technology to track goods in their warehouses and stores.However, the cost of the chips, their reliability and the difficulties companies faced dealing with the vast amounts of data created by RFID have forced them to review their plans.According to Mark Walton, the global head of operational consulting at PwC, companies have also become more sophisticated in the way they use the technology.“There are still issues around how far companies should go in tracking individual items, and how far into the supply chain you should go [with RFID],” he says. “If you are talking about large capital assets, such as aircraft engines, which need to be tracked, then there is still a lot of investment going on. Where it has eased up is in the FMCG end of the market.”In the short to medium term, companies are more likely to focus on measures that will conserve cash, such as asking suppliers to share more of the supply chain risk – for example by holding stock on their premises until the customer needs it – or through outsourcing a larger proportion of their logistics operations.Companies can manage these measures, at least partially, through technology. Mr Walton points out that the improved support for warehousing and logistics in general purpose ERP software, especially from Oracle and SAP, has allowed businesses to be more sophisticated in logistics without the need to invest in the type of bespoke or “best-of-breed” systems that were essential a few years ago.“These packages might not be as good as bespoke but the interfaces between them are much better than they were,” Mr Walton says. That, in turn, allows logistics specialists to reduce the cash tied up in stock – but without the risk of disappointing customers."
672;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-07-01T11:12:32Z;Slimline and lightweight – but back to the days of docking;;Lenovo’s latest laptop has been on a diet. The ThinkPad T400s is just 0.83 inches thick and weighs in at less than 4lb, 20 per cent less than its predecessor. The laptop, priced from $1,599, has a 14.1-inch LED screen, solid state drive storage and a monocoque carbon-reinforced fibre frame. The drawback of the slim design is its limited connectivity ports, so for the T400s Lenovo offers three docking station options – didn’t they go out with the 1990s?CA offers licence-swapComputer Associates hopes to profit from the uncertainty created by Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Sun Microsystems. CA is offering users of Sun’s identity management software a trade-in programme that lets them swap their Sun licences for equivalent licences of CA’s identity and access management products. The only cost is the annual maintenance fee payable to CA plus the work involved in migrating to CA’s rival products.Help for SMEs from SuccessFactorsSuccessFactors, a specialist in on-demand human capital management software, has unveiled SuccessGold, a support offering for medium-sized enterprises. The main novelty is that a support manager gets assigned to the company and support is tailored to cope with the company’s HCM calendar. As fast-growing SuccessFactors has discovered, HCM software lends itself well to the on-demand model because usage is both variable and predictable.Salesforce cloud for freeSalesforce.com, pioneer of hosted customer relationship management, has announced a free version of its Force.com cloud computing platform. The new edition is aimed at businesses taking their first steps in cloud computing and lets them build a cloud-based application for a maximum of 100 users.

VDC is aimed at large enterprises and public sector organisations and will be offered in countries in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.Oracle support for XBRLOracle has added better support for extensible business reporting language (XBRL) to Hyperion Financial Management, its high-end financial reporting software. The SEC requires the largest public companies to file reports using XBRL starting from the financial period ending June 2009. The requirement will be progressively extended to all public companies by 2011.Microsoft energy-saving appMicrosoft has launched Hohm, a web-based application to help US consumers save energy. The program is still in beta testing form and its advice hardly seems ground-breaking – fit thermostats and seal draughty windows are some of the energy-saving tips. More interestingly, Hohm is based on Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform and Microsoft plans to partner with utilities so that consumers can upload actual data from their electricity meters.Cisco’s protection against ‘user-initiated losses’Cisco has added a data-loss protection feature to its Iron Port S-Series of security appliances. The feature prevents ”user-initiated” data loss when employees access webmail, hosted blogs and other popular social networking sites – whose use accounts for up to half of all corporate data loss incidents, Cisco says.
673;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-29T20:45:40Z;Wall Street rally boosted by upgrades;;US equities rallied on Monday as upgrades in the consumer sector and improving energy stocks helped lift stocks after an early droop.Homebuilders were especially strong after Credit Suisse upgraded shares in KB Home, citing a rebound in orders, KB’s shares climbed 5.1 per cent to $14.11 and its rivals also saw some upside. Lennar gained 5.8 per cent to $9.71 and Pulte Homes rose 2.4 per cent to $8.97.Meanwhile retailers also did well, with JC Penney standing out after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company’s shares, saying it is the most likely department store to outperform margin expectations with its second-quarter results.Shares in the retailer rose 1.8 per cent to $28.89.Consumer stocks were joined by the energy sector in providing support as the price of oil rose back above $71 per barrel. Chevron gained 1.4 per cent to $66.88 and ExxonMobil rose 2.2 per cent to $70.58.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Teppco rose 5 per cent to $30.12 after Enterprise Partners said it would buy the pipeline company for $3.3bn, equivalent to $31.36 per share.The S&P finished 0.9 per cent up at 927.23, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 8,529.38 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,844.06.Volumes were low, however, and the markets were more sensitive to the relatively few trades.“Volumes are light ahead of the extended weekend, and many investors are watching out for the unemployment numbers out later this week” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.The reversal came after early weakness from healthcare stocks, led by Biogen Idec, which ended lower after it said a 10th patient had developed a potentially deadly brain disease after taking its multiple sclerosis drug. The shares lost 5.5 per cent to $47.23.There were some positive signs for banks, which reports suggest have made strong profits this quarter on the back of booming equity and debt issuance.Morgan Stanley rose 1.7 per cent to $29.10 and Goldman Sachs picked up 1.8 per cent to $149.36, with just one more session until the end of the quarter.Sentiment was also boosted by words from Christina Romer, chairman of the president’s council of economic advisers.She told the Financial Times the US economy would feel a substantial boost from the Obama administration’s emergency spending package over the next few months.These rises came in spite of negative economic data from two regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Chicago Fed said US economic activity remained at very low levels in May, while the Dallas Fed said manufacturing activity in that area has fallen more than expected during June.“Many of the data points recently have been mixed,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “But after the S&P hit 890, investors started to put in some of the cash they’ve been sitting on.”Alcoa, the aluminium maker, underperformed other materials stocks after analysts at FBR said the aluminium market was over-supplied, and downgraded the company’s shares. The stock lost 3 per cent to $10.44.Technology stocks made gains, with Microsoft picking up 2.2 per cent to $23.86 on news that the company is looking for a buyer for Razorfish, its digital agency, which one analyst valued at up to $700m.Investors also seemed reassured about the status of Oracle‘s deal to buy Sun Microsystems, even though the US Justice Department has asked Sun for more details about its flagship Java software before approving the takeover.A lawyer for Oracle said last week he does not expect the deal to be delayed, and shares in Sun rose 1.9 per cent to $9.18 on Monday, while Oracle gained 1.2 per cent to $21.50.Meanwhile the annual rebalancing of the Russell indices created some turbulence, with companies that moved up from the small- to mid-sized 2000 index to the large-cap 1000 index faring particularly well.Netflix, the online dvd rental company, gained 2.1 per cent to $41.20 while Interactive Brokers rose 1.6 per cent to $15.49.
674;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-24T20:52:07Z;Wall St pares gains after Fed decision;;US stocks lost most of their early gains on Wednesday afternoon after investors reacted negatively to uncertainty at the Federal Reserve.Equities traded higher throughout the morning, but received a double blow in the afternoon.Representative Darrell Issa, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee accused Fed chairman Ben Bernanke of a “cover up” regarding disclosures over Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch last year.The Fed then released the results of its latest Open Market Committee, and a perceived lack of boldness in its inflation outlook led some investors to question whether Mr Bernanke’s position might be making the Fed cautious.“The statement really didn’t say anything,” said John Lekas, portfolio manager at Leader Capital. It was “less hawkish on inflation than it normally would have been” due to Bernanke’s position being called into question.The questions over the deal also made the position of Ken Lewis, Bank of America’s chief executive, vulnerable, and the bank’s shares dropped 2.5 per cent in the afternoon. It managed to hold on to some of the morning’s impressive gains though, closing 1 per cent up at $12.35.There remained some support for stocks from Oracle’s profits and positive economic data.The software maker earlier reported sales and profits that topped Wall Street estimates and its shares gained 7 per cent to $21.26.Other technology companies also felt the benefit and Microsoft rose 0.6 per cent to $23.47.On a busy day for economic data, the markets were reassured by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which upgraded its forecasts for US growth for 2009 and 2010.Stocks were given added impetus by figures showing that durable goods orders unexpectedly rose in May.Lower demand for cars had been expected to drag the number down and the figures helped Fordclimb 1.8 per cent to $5.63.Meanwhile, materials producers and industrial companies performed well.Metals stocks continued Tuesday’s recovery following a sharp sell-off on Monday, boosted by the durable goods numbers and higher commodity prices.Alcoa, which produces aluminium, rose 2.1 per cent to $10.21 while Free-port McMoRan, the copper miner, which was upgraded by Friedman Billings Ramsey, picked up 3.4 per cent to $48.80.The materials sector was initially given an extra boost by results from Monsanto, the agricultural group, which beat estimates with its quarterly earnings.But the shares fell 4 per cent to $76.16 after the group said gross profit from its Roundup herbicide could fall 50 per cent on increased competition.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent to 900.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 1.6 per cent higher at 1,792.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent, however, to 8,299.86. The morning’s gains had come despite figures showing the number of new home sales unexpectedly fell in May.“The fact that the market completely shrugged off the new home sales data had me stunned,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.Financial stocks were higher after figures showed mortgage applications rose last week as interest rates dropped.They then continued to climb in spite of suffering a brief dip on the new home sales data.Wells Fargo ended 1.1 higher at $23.17. Citigroupalso advanced, helped by the news that it intends to increase employees’ base salaries in 2009 as part of an effort to retain top talent. Its shares climbed 1 per cent to $3.04.Meanwhile, Darden Restaurants, which owns US mid-market chains, including Olive Garden, also beat earnings estimates but the shares fell as it warned 2010 would be worse than hoped. The stock lost 3.2 per cent to $31.94.There was more bad news from supermarket operator SuperValu, which warned lower customer spending would mean substantially lower quarterly profits than expected. The shares fell 12 per cent to $13.81.

676;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
677;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-23T23:33:06Z;Oracle sees software demand picking up;;Oracle executives signalled on Tuesday that demand for the company’s software had picked up noticeably in recent weeks, suggesting the severe chill that fell over the technology industry during the financial crisis has started to thaw.The comments, which amount to some of the most optimistic yet from a big technology supplier, came as Oracle reported a 5 per cent dip in revenues and a 7 per cent fall in net income in its latest quarter. However, the company’s business still proved more robust than Wall Street had expected in the face of the downturn, and its shares gained 3 per cent in after-market trading.Commenting on new sales leads that could turn into future business, Charles Phillips, co-president, said: “The pipelines did improve over the last 90 days.” He contrasted that with the mood among customers early this year, when many responded to the downturn like “deer in the headlights” and shied away from spending money, even if they had the budgets.Like other Oracle executives, however, Mr Phillips said it was too soon to say technology demand was on the rebound. “That may be an indication of people getting back to work, but it’s difficult to call,” he said.Predicting that new business opportunities would continue to grow at a more rapid rate in the current quarter, Safra Catz, co-president, added: “I still see the pipelines growing rather significantly.”In spite of that, guidance for the present quarter was only in line with Wall Street’s expectations, with a revenue decline forecast of up to 5 per cent from a year before, and pro-forma earnings per share of 29-31 cents, compared with 29 cents the year before.Ms Catz stressed that with the pipeline of potential deals growing, the forecast was based on extremely conservative assumptions about the closing rate Oracle would see before the end August.For the three months to the end of May, the final quarter of Oracle’s fiscal year, the company said it had benefited from market share gains over arch-rival SAP, particularly in Europe, where its sales had been surprisingly robust.Sales of its database software slipped by 1 per cent to $1.9bn, while revenues from applications software, which is often volatile, fell 19 per cent to $805m.Revenues declined by 5 per cent to $6.9bn, while net income fell 7 per cent to $1.9bn. Earnings per share slipped to 38 cents, from 39 cents the year before, although on a pro-forma basis they reached 46 cents, 2 cents ahead of estimates.

679;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-17T15:18:37Z;What IT means to me: Ex-wrestler leads fight against cybercrime;;"In his Delaware college days, Dave DeWalt was a champion wrestler. Today, as chief executive of security software group McAfee, he faces infinitely more dangerous opponents – the shadowy criminals who roam the lawless badlands of cyberspace.It is a role he clearly relishes: “This company has such a noble cause,” he says. “I love the technology, I love the business and I love the noble cause of security. We are helping to put criminals away and behind bars.“You would be amazed to see the things we can do. We stop major terrorist attacks on the banking infrastructure; we help solve criminal cases and we help prevent fraud.”Warming to his theme, he adds that McAfee has been working with the Texas state attorney-general to identify and put away paedophiles: “We have been working with the law enforcement community and the legal community to help shape laws to deal with cybercrime as well as with law enforcement. This company has a very humanitarian aspect to it.”By McAfee’s own estimates, more new malware – viruses, trojans, worms and the like – was identified in 2008 than in the previous five years combined, a phenomenon that Mr DeWalt attributes to the international financial crisis and widespread economic distress.The mood, he suggests, is reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s when the cold war was at its height. This time, however, the war will be in cyberspace: “There are over 20 countries which we believe are cyber-armed,” he says. “That means they have the technology for cyber warfare, such as large scale denial of service attacks or widespread virus dissemination. Over the next five to 10 years we have to protect the internet against such attacks and put in place a global architecture to combat cybercrime.”In countries such as China, Russia and much of eastern Europe where legal infrastructures are inadequate, he says, dangerous websites proliferate. So can the good guys overcome the powers of darkness?“Absolutely,” he claims. “But we have to unite internationally to solve these problems. I am troubled by the lack of ratification of existing cyber crime conventions. We are still at the first generation stage, whereas the criminals have moved on to version 2.0 or 3.0. We need to do a better job.”He believes world leaders have failed to realise how interlocked their economies have become and how important the internet is to their stability. It is a theme he addresses frequently at technology conferences.In McAfee, the 44-year-old Mr DeWalt seems to have found his natural home, a company that matches his technical, social and moral predilections. An early interest in technology was encouraged by his parents, who, although not technically qualified themselves, were convinced that the future was computers: “They did everything they could to teach me about technology because that was what they believed in.”He remembers getting one of the first Atari personal computers when he was about 14: “I took it all apart and I put it back together again. I learned how to program it and that was exciting. It gave me an interest in programming and computer science. So I ended up taking computer science in high school and a computer science and electrical engineering degree at the University of Delaware.”Delaware, however, is on the eastern seaboard of the US; California’s Silicon Valley, the hotbed of the technology industry, is on the west. So, following the great American tradition, Mr DeWalt hit the road: “I jumped in my car one day and decided to drive across the country.“I just went there and never came back. It was a sad day for my parents but it was one of the best moves I ever made. I grew up in Silicon Valley. I worked for small companies and large companies and was introduced to a company called Oracle when it was quite small. Oracle was a great experience for me. I learned a lot about the technology and had the chance to be a part of the growth of the Silicon Valley market place.”Oracle taught him about structured data, knowledge he put to good use when, together with a college friend, he started Quest Software, a database company now quoted on Nasdaq: “From Oracle, we learned how to manage and tune the database,” he says.He then became president and chief executive of Documentum, a leader in the management of unstructured data. Documentum was acquired by EMC Corporation, a major provider of data storage systems, in 2003 for $1.9bn. Mr DeWalt stayed with the acquirer and became responsible for customer operations and sales. EMC then bought RSA, a pioneer in security software and Mr DeWalt became fascinated by another kind of challenge and another kind of technology: “I got to know the security industry and I jumped at the chance to join McAfee and help to build a large, dedicated security company.”He joined McAfee in April 2007 since when, he reckons, the business has grown rapidly through a combination of market share and international expansion. Between 2007 and 2008 sales grew 20 per cent and revenues reached $1.3bn last year. The US magazine, Institutional Investor, last month named Mr DeWalt one of the top five chief executives of publicly traded software companies.Mr DeWalt remains fascinated by the technology and takes pride in understanding the varied products that make up McAfee’s portfolio. He no longer writes computer code, however: “My biggest value to a company is to be in between the sales operation and the technology and to understand the customer’s needs.”Innovation is important if companies such as McAfee are to stay on terms with the criminals and he describes the “Patent Wall” in the company’s heaquarters in Santa Clara, California, celebrating McAfee’s 500 patents granted and 500 pending. He believes it is important that engineers take pride in their inventiveness and backs up his view with a system of rewards and bonuses.He is an enthusiastic user of his own products – and with good reason. Recently, while out of the country, he received an e-mail, ostensibly from his bank, with a request to click on a link to authenticate his account. It was a clever piece of deception including some details from his account to give the impression it was a genuine message.Mr DeWalt reasoned, however, that his bank would telephone him over such a matter rather than sending an e-mail and refused to click the link. The culprit, however, has not been caught, such was the sophistication of the attack.At home, he and his family operate a multiplicity of computers, leading him to complain wryly: “I’m head of technical support at my house. Every night I seem to have to go home and solve some problem,” he smiles. Fortunately, after more than 20 years in the industry, he is still in love with the technology."

682;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-05T20:35:59Z;Microsoft accused over web browser figures;;Microsoft has “substantially understated” its share of the browser market in its effort to combat charges by Europe’s antitrust watchdog that it illegally ties its Explorer browser to its Windows operating system, opponents of the US software company are alleging.ECIS, a technology industry group led by IBM, Nokia and Oracle, said on Friday it had filed a formal response to Microsoft’s defence arguments with the European Commission.European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes is considering the software company’s defence submission, after accusing it this year of illegally bundling Explorer with Windows and harming competition.In its filing, ECIS takes issue with Microsoft’s claim that its share of the browser market in the European economic area has been falling sharply, and is now under 55 per cent, compared with 85 per cent four years ago.Microsoft contends that competing browsers – notably Mozilla Firefox – have picked up significant shares, especially in markets such as Germany and Poland, implying that competition is rife.But ECIS, which has complained about Microsoft’s behaviour to the Commission in the past, maintains that the way in which these figures are calculated skews the results towards more active and sophisticated users, and so increases the likelihood that alternative browsers will have been downloaded.It also contends that, even if Microsoft’s figures are correct, the software group is still abusing a dominant position. This, it claims, needs to be addressed by “a ballot screen remedy requiring Microsoft to present Windows users with a straightforward, unbiased opportunity to choose for themselves among available browsers”.Thomas Vinje, partner at law firm Clifford Chance and spokesman for ECIS, said: “Even if one accepts Microsoft’s preferred usage shares, the majority of the market remains foreclosed to competitors – and a majority of consumers remain denied a genuine choice of browser.”ECIS also said it had dismissed as “purely speculative” Microsoft’s claim that the Commission would be acting illegally if it made the software group carry rival web browsers.Microsoft has argued that the Commission itself would be in danger of negatively affecting competition in another, related market – that for search – and entrenching the position of US rival, Google.Ms Kroes is likely to reach a final decision on whether Microsoft’s behaviour breaches antitrust law in the autumn.
683;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-03T23:16:35Z;Rivals in bidding war for Data Domain;;The fate of the lucrative technology company Data Domain has set off a bidding war between two data storage rivals as they vie to control the emerging market for “deduplication” products.Data Domain on Wednesday agreed to be acquired by NetApp for $1.9bn, or $30 a share in cash and stock. The offer from NetApp matched an all-cash bid from EMC made on Monday. NetApp and Data Domain originally agreed to a deal at $25 a share on May 20.EMC is well positioned to take the bidding higher if it chooses, and analysts expect the larger company to win in the end. The world’s largest maker of storage systems and software, EMC had $6.3bn net cash at the end of March. NetApp had just $1.7bn net cash at the end of January.“At this point it’s really just about NetApp trying to make it more painful for EMC,” said Rajesh Ghai, an analyst with ThinkEquity.“At the end of the day, given that EMC has so much cash, it will prevail over NetApp.”Yet late on Wednesday, Data Domain accepted NetApp’s offer, signalling that it may prefer to be acquired by the more nimble NetApp than EMC. “We are pleased with the revised terms of NetApp’s acquisition,” Frank Slootman, Data Domain chief executive, said.Joe Tucci, EMC chief executive, said: “EMC’s all-cash tender offer remains superior to NetApp’s proposed part-stock merger transaction.” But he refrained from increasing his company’s offer.Such bidding wars are relatively uncommon in the technology industry. After Oracle agreed to buy Sun Microsystems in April, IBM, which had been in talks with Sun, did not produce a counter-offer.EMC and NetApp are both interested in Data Domain’s fast-growing revenues and skilled team. Data Domain makes products that identify duplicate copies of documents and eliminates the redundant ones, reducing its customers’ storage costs. The need for deduplication products is growing as enterprise customers produce ever-larger reams of digital data.Major Data Domain customers include the US Army and TiVo, which use the products to reduce storage costs. Data Domain’s revenue more than doubled last year to $274m, and Data Domain reported $79m in revenue during the first quarter of 2009.While both EMC and NetApp want the fast-growing Data Domain to provide a spark to their core business, the acquisition is also a productive way to use their idle capital. “Interest rates are so low, they’re not making much money on cash balance,” said Mr Ghai. “They might as well put the money to work.”
684;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-03T16:38:45Z;Heron resumes dividends with £17m;;"Heron International, the property company run by Gerald Ronson, is to pay a dividend of £17.2m to its investors this year.Heron’s backers include Larry Ellison, the Oracle chief, Michael Milken, the former junk-bond king and Steve Wynn, the casino mogul.The last dividend Heron paid at the beginning of 2007 was £80m, although this reflected a one-off boost from the sale of a stake in Crest Nicholson.Accounts for 2008, which are to be filed with Companies House next month, show that Heron is surviving the property slump in far better shape than the previous recession, when it almost went bust due to its debt.Heron’s net asset value was reported at £384m at the end of 2008, a moderate decline from £409.6m in 2007. Heron sold many of its investments in the UK before the slump, while its European assets have not been as badly hit.The fall in the value of its property assets has also been offset by a £34m
currency boost from its European holdings.Gross assets stood at £697m, with cash at £137m at the year end, which Mr Ronson said would be used alongside debt to buy selectively back into the market when it staged its recovery over the next few years.Mr Ronson said there was not yet value in the market. “We have bought a few properties but nothing major. Unless the deal is really right, why do it? Keep the money in the bank and if you miss the odd opportunity so what?“Our accounts show we aren’t grossly overgeared, all our developments are well financed, all our investment properties are funded. Compared to most of our competitors in the public sector, our performance and balance sheet speaks for itself.”Heron intends to start building houses again and Mr Ronson admits he has cast his eye over some of the listed housebuilders. They carried too much debt, he said, and banks wanted too much equity. “Residential will be the first thing to come back [but] we’ve got enough land,” he added.Even so, he remains cautious. “We are in for a difficult period of time. There will be more unemployment than people expect,” he said.“In the last recession, it was stay alive till 1995, then go to heaven in 1997. And we are looking at three-to-five years again from now for recovery. But if you’ve got cash and good relationships with your banks, then you will survive and do well. If you have neither then you are in trouble.”"
685;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-02T23:14:33Z;Acer to launch Google Android notebook;;Acer, the world’s third biggest PC maker, on Tuesday said it would start producing the world’s first mainstream notebook computer using Google’s Android operating system before the end of September.The move opens a new front in Google’s battle with Microsoft by offering an alternative to the Windows operating system on small, low-priced PCs rather than just the smartphones for which Android was originally designed.It came as Microsoft revealed that Windows 7, the latest version of its operating system and one designed to work better on less powerful machines, would go on sale on October 22.Meanwhile, Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, indicated that it would also launch its own software platform for PCs and handheld devices once it completes its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, though he gave no further details.Signs that Microsoft’s stranglehold on PC operating systems is about to face fresh challenges reflect a sea change in the computing business as smartphones and “netbooks”, or small notebooks, gain in popularity and the lines between different categories of computing device blur.Microsoft charges about $20 per netbook computer for Windows, analysts say, while Google does not charge for its Android system, which is based on the open source Linux software.Microsoft’s price for the most basic version of its software is expected to rise with Windows 7, though details have not been announced.Acer’s new low-end Aspire One will run both the XP and Android operating systems and allows users to switch between the two.It would still be cheaper than the current model, the company said, but declined to comment further on its pricing strategy.Skytone, a Chinese maker, recently announced a pure Android netbook that has yet to ship.Dell, the second biggest computer maker, plans to introduce an Android product, according to a software developer that last month accidentally issued a press release announcing work on the product.Industry leader Hewlett-Packard was conducting tests but was reluctant to forge ahead for fear of reducing revenue, analysts said.“Android is beginning to show some wings,” analyst Roger Kay, of Endpoint Technologies Associates, said.
686;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-06-02T19:21:39Z;Is this, finally, the thin client from Oracle?;;At the official passing of the Java torch today, Larry Ellison couldn’t resist dangling the suggestion that Oracle is getting ready to launch some sort of new client software platform to rival Google’s Android and – an unspoken challenge – Microsoft.The Oracle boss was on stage with Scott McNealy at the annual JavaOne event in San Francisco, in what looked like a symbolic ceding of Sun’s leadership of Java after nearly two decades.Not surprisingly, Ellison was quick to reassure the developers on hand that he was ready to invest in and expand Java. And, on the same day that Acer confirmed it would launch the first PC running Google’s Android operating system, he also hinted at something similar from Oracle:We’re going to see lots of Java devices, some coming from our friends at Google but I don’t see why they won’t come from us at Sun/ Oracle.In case the message was missed, he added this for good measure:There will be computers, devices based on JavaFX, not only from Google but also from [Oracle].It is more than 15 years since Ellison began talking up the thin client as the next computing platform. Now that Oracle has its own Linux distribution, and assuming it gets its hands on Sun software like Java and OpenOffice, it will soon be in a position to make good on that long promise.Of course, it could be that Ellison is just dropping hints to keep his rivals guessing. But with Android poised to make deeper inroads in the PC and handset markets, it feels like the market for client software platforms is finally opening up. Given his history, that certainly sounds like something Ellison wouldn’t want to miss.
687;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;SAP stays buoyant through maintenance growth;;Léo Apotheker, chief executive of SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, last week said he saw “no significant improvement” in the bleak outlook for 2009. However, the German group – and the likes of US rival Oracle – are riding the downturn better than many old-economy counterparts.Like them, SAP has seen sales of its products slump as its clients have tightened their belts. But business software makers have a second, often larger sales stream that most old-style manufacturers do not: revenues from updating and maintaining old programmes – and these continue to grow in spite of the recession.While SAP saw software licence sales decline 33 per cent to €418m ($590m) in the first quarter of the year, its maintenance revenues climbed 18 per cent to €1.3bn, making for stable overall revenues. It is a trend that SAP says it may be able to sustain all year.Chris Pang, an analyst at Gartner Research, even believes maintenance revenues could still make the €23.5m market for enterprise resource planning applications grow ever so slightly this year. “Maintenance is the life vest,” he said.It seems recession has cast a light on the business software sector’s big secret, one Mr Apotheker seemed unwilling to mention at SAP’s annual meeting last week.Take Luxottica, the Italian eyewear group. It started to install a new, company-wide software system in 2008 with a view to having its 62,000 staff, 6,250 shops and 10 manufacturing sites move from multiple systems to a single IT platform by 2012.Although the company itself will not comment on cost, industry experts believe the project will cost €200m, of which only about 10 per cent will flow to the software’s manufacturer – in this case, SAP.Some €180m, by contrast, is earmarked to flow to technicians and consultants, most of them from third-party companies. With SAP contracted to stress test each new phase of the system before it goes live, the German company can expect its share of maintenance revenues to make up for struggling new license sales.But Carlo Privitera, Luxottica’s chief information officer, said it was the kind of investment many companies were shunning under current conditions – even if new software promises to make business processes more efficient and thus save money.“It’s a huge capital expenditure that does not promise major operating savings within the short-term of a year or two,” he said.Luxottica, which makes Ray-Ban sunglasses and owns the Lens Crafters chain, believes it will reap the full cost benefits of the move only after 2012 when it turns off the last of its old systems.Mr Privitera insists the company would have committed to the project even in a deep recession because Luxottica was primarily looking to improve the way it worked – and faced its customer. “The idea was to improve the customer experience – to serve the customer in Australia, say, from inventory in Europe.”Cutting costs was a secondary, but not an unwelcome, result – although, for the moment, the company is paying 150 in-house specialists and another 150 outsiders to do nothing but set up the system.Not all companies can claim to be so visionary.At Gartner, Mr Pang said many corporate IT heads were simply “hunkering down” as they saw little chance of persuading colleagues of raising present costs in the interests of future benefits.Gartner, as a result, forecasts ERP market growth slowing to 2-3 per cent this year.This is down considerably from double-digit annual increases in the two years before the global crisis but still better than the 15 per cent sales decline predicted for steelmakers this year.Perhaps comparisons such as this have led investors to ignore Mr Apotheker’s caution. Last week, they bid SAP stock back up to €30, meaning that the company has regained half the value it lost when the recession bit in September.

The NetScaler appliances are designed to boost the performance of web applications by offloading them from conventional web servers.G-mail clicks with translationGoogle has added automatic translation to its popular Gmail webmail service. The service can translate between 41 languages with just one click – although it first has to be enabled under ”settings”. While it is hardly perfect, Google argues machine translation lets users quickly get the gist of an otherwise incomprehensible message and improves internal communication in multinationals.A bigger slice of the PII from EMCBusinesses that handle personally identifiable information (PII) have found an ally in RSA. The security division of EMC has announced three new information security products for mid-sized companies that handle PII – the US government’s term for data such as biometrics or social security numbers that uniquely identify an individual. The products cover two-factor authentication, security information and event management and data loss prevention.Oracle moves into smart gridsOracle has jumped aboard the smart grid bandwagon. Using IT to manage power grids better is hardly new but it is has received a fresh political impetus from the Obama administration and vendors such as IBM, Cisco and, now, Oracle see big bucks in this market. Oracle Utilities Network Management, the flagship program in the Oracle smart-grid offering, gives early warning of power outages and links into advanced metering infrastructure.IBM bets on solid stateIBM is making a big bet on solid-state drives (SSD) and will offer the new storage technology across all Power6 processor-based systems. IBM pioneered magnetic disk storage in the 1950s but it has bowed to progress and is now promoted SSD technology, which as it has no moving parts, is 100 times faster, occupies less space and consumes less energy. IBM already offers SSD on its x86-based System x servers.Dell goes to schoolThe Latitude 2100 netbook is Dell’s attempt to crack the education market. It has a ”student rugged” design, a 10-inch screen and is based on Intel’s Atom chip.

690;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-05-14T18:50:48Z;Rivalries that keep F1 and the America’s Cup alive;;Two of the world’s most extravagant sporting spectacles seem to be plagued by a bout of bad sportsmanship. Both Formula One motor racing and the America’s Cup – sailing’s oldest and most prestigious competition often deemed yachting’s answer to Formula One – are caught up in complicated and unseemly disputes over the rules of the game.In the America’s Cup, it all boils down to the animosity of two multi-billionaires. Switzerland’s Ernesto Bertarelli, who sold his biotech empire a couple of years ago, owns the America’s Cup champion Alinghi and has complained that rival BMW-Oracle, owned by computer software mogul Larry Ellison, has spied on his new yacht.But this is only a diversion in the real dispute over the new rules that will apply to the next America’s Cup challenge, taking place next year. Unless this row is resolved, it risks scuppering the competition, which traditionally draws millions of fans from around the world.What is happening over on the Formula One tracks is just as worrying for the motor racing confraternity. A poker game is being played out that is due to reach its climax in London on Friday and which could determine the future of Formula One racing.Just like the America’s Cup, Formula One has increasingly become both a sporting and financial exaggeration. So it is understandable that in these times of economic crisis, Max Mosley, the president of the sport’s governing body FIA, wants to introduce some restraint in the budgets of competing teams.This followed Honda’s decision to pull out of Formula One for economic reasons. The Formula One organisers feared this risked provoking a domino effect with other teams quitting the competition and discouraging smaller new teams from competing. So Mr Mosley has decided to cap the budgets of competing teams to adapt the sport to the new mood of frugality.The FIA now wants teams to limit their annual spending to £40m ($60.7m) as part of its longer-term efforts to reduce costs. The problem is that his proposal will create a two-tier system whereby teams signing up to the budget cap will have much greater technical freedom, while those who do not – mainly the big spending teams such as Ferrari, McLaren, Renault and Toyota – will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.For the big spenders this is unacceptable. Ferrari, for example, argues that the whole point of participating in the championship apart from the sporting element is to develop new technologies that ultimately find their way into its road cars – not just Ferraris and Maseratis but also in other brands of the Fiat group, Ferrari’s parent. The same applies to Renault and Toyota, which, like Ferrari, are threatening to quit the championship if the new rules are introduced.A few years ago, Ferrari and the other traditional industry big spenders fought and won a battle to secure a greater share of the Formula One money by threatening to organise their own alternative championship.But the outcome is yet again likely to be a compromise. It is difficult to imagine Formula One without Ferrari, the only team that has been consistently racing in the championship for the past 60 years. For, at the end of the day, it all boils down to a question of money. Ferrari and Formula One need each other for their image and commercial success. Just as the America’s Cup would not be quite the same without the rivalry between fanatical billionaire competitors from the Scottish tea baron Sir Thomas Lipton to the current bitter spat between Messrs Ellison and Bertarelli.Unwelcome guestWhen it comes to making waves, no one does it better than Bernard Tapie. The French businessman – who is also an actor, a former minister and once president of Marseille football club – has set the cat among the pigeons at Club Med by suggesting he may take a stake in the holiday group. Mr Tapie last year won a long compensation battle against former state bank Credit Lyonnais (now absorbed by Crédit Agricole) over the sale of the Adidas sportswear group he once controlled. Claiming, ultimately successfully, the bank had made a big gain at his expense, the businessman is now back in business and is wasting no time to make his presence felt.Club Med and its chief executive, Henri Giscard d’Estaing, son of the former French president, are not amused.Mr Giscard d’Estaing seems to have secured the backing of institutional shareholders to help keep Mr Tapie at bay. These include Morocco’s Caisse de Depot, Air France, Credit Agricole and France’s own Caisse des Depots. This prompted Mr Tapie to ask whether there were not greater emergencies for the Caisse des Depots than offering its support to the Club Med. He may have a point.european.view@ft.com
691;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;The incredible shrinking system;;The clamour of small and medium sized companies for the improved productivity and efficiency that was once the preserve of big organisations with deep pockets and plenty of hired help is changing the market for enterprise resource planning (ERP) software.But over-ambitious targets and poor project management, the bane of software development everywhere, still dog companies in their search for business improvement, creating horror stories, which, some experts say, unfairly damage the credibility of the systems that should be their salvation.Tim Welburn, an IT expert with PA Consulting, points out that for many companies, ERP installation has been traumatic. “They have derived little benefit, have often taken multiple attempts at delivery and spent millions of pounds to implement fairly ordinary solutions that do little more than what was already in place,” he says.“This view of the large, costly and painful ERP implementation puts fear into mid-market organisations.”But things are changing, he says. “Smaller ERP providers are expanding and starting to challenge the established vendors. Conversely, the larger ERP vendors now provide functionality in manageable modules with service-oriented and hosted solutions.“These two approaches are meeting in the middle, where falling ERP costs, increased competition from suppliers, modern agile architectures and a more mature delivery capability are resulting in fewer project failures.”Even the acronym, a relic of the 1960s and 1970s, when the principal customers were large manufacturers, is under fire. “I think it is time to change the name,” says Alastair Sorbie, chief executive of the software group IFS. “I would prefer ‘project-centric solutions’.”“Enterprise systems”, however, perhaps best describes today’s comprehensive, multi-modular products. SAP of Germany, established in 1972, is one of the few European software companies that, with 82,000 customers worldwide, can claim to be a global leader.It pioneered the concept of ERP, a suite of programs to manage and co-ordinate most aspects of a company’s activities, developing costly, industrial-strength software that required substantial tailoring to individual companies. In the US, Oracle, through its purchase of Peoplesoft and JD Edwards, has a leadership position among big companies with substantial resources to invest.Today, traditional ERP markets in western Europe and the US are becoming saturated: the centre of gravity is moving both eastwards and down towards the mid-market.Mr Sorbie, head of a company that prides itself on speedy responses to new markets, says his customers are more likely to come from the defence, homeland security and energy sectors than traditional manufacturing: “We do not see growth in the US and western Europe for manufacturing ERP systems. That demand has shifted to eastern Europe and Asia-Pacific.”So for companies such as SAP and Oracle, the trick has been to rewrite their sophisticated systems to suit smaller companies while fighting the challenge from suppliers, including Microsoft, IFS, Infor, Epicor and Sage, who see the mid-market as their natural hunting ground.Inside-ERP, a guide to mid-market solutions published by Tippit, notes that vendors are cutting complexity. It says: “Vendors have made ERP solutions easier to use and simpler to implement as well as reducing the amount of customisation needed to fit the business, namely by adding features that support certain aspects of businesses that are common to mid-size organisations in a given industry. For instance, an ERP system tailored to the fashion industry should use matrices specific to apparel, such as sizes, colors and styles.”Alan Bowling, chairman of the SAP user group in the UK, says the company is driving down the total cost of ownership by innovative use of technology: “It can provide a more integrated approach. The cost of a technology upgrade can be painful.”He says that companies are beginning to realise that the cost is critically affected by the level of customisation: “It is important not to do lots of customisation. Instead, you should concentrate on those things that really make a difference to your business. That is something that in the early days people did not understand. They really understand that now.”Mr Bowling adds that, contrary to industry lore, SAP systems have never been particularly difficult to customise. “People’s change management processes were not particularly clever,” he says.Modern ERP comprises a set of core modules, typically business intelligence, customer relationship management, financial management, human capital management, manufacturing operations and supply chain management. It is software, according to Mr Sorbie, that takes all the complex information associated with a project and presents it in such a way that somebody at the top can see quickly where the business is, rather than relying on myriad spreadsheets.Inside-ERP suggests that lean manufacturing, business process management, enterprise asset management and supplier relationship management are further possibilities, pointing out that “the decreasing costs of hardware, infrastructure technology and ERP software put a modern version of these once-epic business management packages within reach of any mid-size company”.And the advantages are real. According to a survey carried out by Accenture, the consultancy, 76 per cent of companies canvassed in North America and the UK said ERP systems contributed to their organisation’s competitive advantage and strategic value.Karl Havers, head of European technology for the consultancy Ernst & Young says the improved efficiencies enjoyed by a company with a well established and well executed ERP system are almost palpable, even though most companies use only just over half the functionality of their systems.“ERP systems allow a group to work effectively, running inventory, supply chain and distribution globally and having effective management information,” he says. “Yet, there is more. To take advantage of cost savings from shared service centres, whether that is for finance procurement processes, credit and collection or claims processing, it is almost imperative to have an ERP system.”But he warns: “The sad thing is that implementing a complex ERP system seems really hard for many organisations.” Echoing Mr Bowling, he also believes the software is rarely to blame. He says: “The problems come when organisations start to customise the software, but actually the problems are likely to start and end with poor programme management, little attention to the cultural changes required and insufficient enthusiasm to adapt business processes to work with the software.”Cost, furthermore, remains a controversial issue. Sachin Shah, a partner in Bain & Company’s global IT practice, says the pricing needs of vendors and buyers are diametrically opposed. Today’s licences, he says, are based on a mixture of processor-based, user-based and revenue-based pricing, which puts many companies at a disadvantage.User-based pricing, for example, means that some companies must buy a full licence for each employee merely to use a small number of features. “Pricing structures have to change,” he says. “ERP vendors must allow businesses to pay for what is used in terms of features and without constraining them based on the number of users or their level of revenue.”It seems clear that if ERP is successfully to be deployed by businesses small as well as large, more than a simple name change will be required.If only we could start again from scratch
692;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-05-13T15:17:34Z;Corporate blogs: New way to engage with stakeholders;;"Once dismissed as mere online diaries, weblogs – or blogs for short – have become corporate tools. Today they go beyond sharing product information and have the potential to communicate with a wide range of stakeholders, including prospective employees, investors, suppliers – even consumers or non-profit organisations.Most corporate blogs have been launched in the past two years, as companies experiment with how best to use them.Blogging practices and characteristics vary widely, with styles ranging from formal to informal. Companies also use a range of people to blog publicly, from employees to departments to chief executives – or they employ professional freelance bloggers (for example, American Express and its Open Forum blog).Blogs are also published in a variety of languages; when they are translated this poses challenges, such as making sure the blogger’s personal writing style is not lost in the process.There are, however, themes common to successful blogging, as revealed by an FT blog index developed by ComMetrics, a body that analyses corporate blogs.Its key findings are:
• Blogs can be hard to spot. Sometimes they may be relocated to new domains or a clear link from the main site is lacking. Successful ventures solve this by featuring a prominent link to their blogs from the home page.
• They do not have to be chatty, but blogs do provide a chattier alternative to formal content. Writing style depends on the author, the target-audience and company culture, as well as the original language of the content.
• Some blogs skilfully use multimedia technologies such as YouTube to enhance the user experience through video clips and interactive features. Others use such technology sparingly or not at all, while still securing a large footprint.
• Successful blogs encourage communication by allowing comment and use a writing style that invites comments and make a serious attempt to give thoughtful responses as well as sharing or (respectfully) opposing different views.
• A flash in the pan is always bad. Developing a following takes time and keeping readers requires continuous effort. ComMetrics’ trend analyses (for example, over 18 months) show that successful blogs’ footprints tend to remain stable after an initial spurt. But keeping at it with regular posts indicates that a blog will show a slight upward trend over time.
• In some cases, the company’s most successful blog has its home at headquarters. However, there are quite a few examples of a company’s biggest corporate blog (in terms of internet footprint) being housed elsewhere. For example, Renault’s biggest blog covers its Formula One racing team. However, the corporate home page should feature a prominent link to the blog.
• Quality is key. The length of posts can be an issue with some readers (and writers) and using images can be helpful.
• Blogs can derive value from non revenue-generating activities. Highly effective blogs uncover the hidden value of holding a conversation with customers and/or suppliers. They are clearly targeted, but recognise that readers might come from different cultural backgrounds. Hence, respect and openness go hand in hand.More generally, people have come to expect online news and information to be free. The FT ComMetrics Blog Index examines how well large corporations are using free blogs as a means of communication and to achieve results.Online communication can also be used to serve a brand’s clientele while building reputation. Henkel demonstrates this with its Persil blog (www.persilblog.de).It has a clear focus: informing readers about what is happening with the product, including the brand’s history. The content is varied: sometimes blog posts provide information on getting clothes cleaner, sometimes they cover new developments.Procter & Gamble is less direct, supporting blogging activities that focus on social responsibility issues and safer drinking water. But again it illustrates how blogs can support corporate efforts to resonate with consumers.Some reputation-focused blogs are linked to a particular product, such as the Royal Bank of Canada, which focuses on issues of interest to school leavers going on to further education. Volvo has numerous blogs, one related to its sponsorship of sailing activities.In November, GE became one of the first companies to use a specific domain for a blog targeted at investors, shareholders and analysts (see www.gereports.com). The blog is the only source of information about cost-cutting efforts (for example at GE Capital). Similarly, Daimler has used its blog to inform employees and suppliers about its strategy to weather the current economic storm.Other companies use their blogs to make students aware of career opportunities. One of the more successful examples is Oracle’s oraclerecruiter.blogspot.com.The impact of a takeover can also be explained in a blog. US bank Wells Fargo, for example, launched a corporate blog on its takeover of Wachovia. The blog addressed issues such as how the takeover and revamp of operations would pay off for the company, for employees and for shareholders.Companies included in the FT ComMetrics Blog Index have effectively leveraged their brand by using social media to reach a larger audience. There is a strong case for saying that, while Twitter or Facebook may be all the rage, when used well, blogs work better to raise brand awareness, as well as to initiate and maintain a long-term conversation to foster better relationships with a company’s stakeholder groups.Urs E Gattiker is co-founder and chief technology officer of CyTrap Labs, an independent consulting body which analyses corporate blogs in Europe. ComMetrics is a division of CyTrap Labs."
693;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-05-12T21:28:41Z;Larry Ellison’s Plan A: Buy only Sun’s software assets;;Speculation about a possible spin-off of Sun’s hardware business by Oracle may not be so wide of the mark after all. The reason: Oracle’s initial acquisition interest only extended to some of Sun’s software assets.Also, HP spent months doing due diligence over a possible bid of its own but backed out at the last minute without ever submitting an offer, so there’s a chance of it emerging as a buyer should Oracle opt to shed any parts of Sun in future.Those are some of the things to be gleaned from Sun’s detailed disclosure to the SEC today of the events leading up to its deal with Oracle (HP’s identity is not disclosed – it is mentioned in the filing only as “Party B”. But one person who had a ringside seat to the action has told us that HP was actively engaged for months, and that despite widespread speculation, Cisco never showed any serious interest.)The last-minute nature of Oracle’s bid for Sun in mid-April has received plenty of attention. The sheer speed with which it moved on the final weekend left IBM looking very flat-footed.But what’s clear now is that this was not Larry Ellison’s preferred route. Back in mid-March he proposed buying what Sun describes as “certain of our software assets,” along with taking a minority equity stake. That idea was rejected.When he finally bought the whole company, Mr Ellison gave two justifications. One was that he wanted to get his hands on Java, Solaris and some of Sun’s other software. The other was that owning the hardware division as well would leave Oracle better placed, as a vertically integrated company, to deal with the way many enterprise customers will want to buy their technology in future.Based on the new information today, the “vertical integration” argument sounds increasingly opportunistic. Of course, Mr Ellison has since said he is “definitely not going to exit the hardware business,” but such declarations of intent often have a habit of changing as circumstances, and strategic objectives, shift.As for HP: In the only explanation given for its lack of a firm offer, Sun says of the discussions late last year that “pursuing a transaction in the near term was not optimal for Party B at that time.” That isn’t surprising. Mark Hurd has a lot riding on successfully integrating the EDS acquisition. Attempting a second big consolidation play at the same time, in servers, would be a risk.All of this suggests that, at some point, a deal between HP and Oracle for some of Sun’s assets could make sense. But for now, both companies are likely to keep their heads down as they focus on the immediate integration work at hand.
694;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-05-12T11:22:42Z;Autonomy pushes its head into the cloud with bank offering;;Autonomy, the search specialist based in the UK, has launched a cloud-based compliance solution for banks and others that do business on the web.The offering takes “snapshots” of the dynamic content served up by websites and so helps firms comply with regulatory requirements.It stems from Autonomy’s recent acquisition of content management specialist Interwoven and uses Digital Safe, Autonomy’s cloud-based archive service, which is already used by several financial firms.• Sterling Commerce, specialist in e-commerce software, has jumped into business process integration with the Sterling Business Integration Suite.This focuses on the business-to-business market and Sterling says it can reduce the cost and complexity of linking IT systems. In one of those unlikely acquisitions made in the dotcom boom, the company was bought by SBC Communications and is now part of AT&T.• More on the business integration front, this time from Microsoft, which has released BizTalk Server 2009. It sports 25 adapters to connect to the enterprise software suites of rivals such as Oracle and SAP, and supports Microsoft’s Hyper-V virtualisation software. It also embraces the latest standards for data from radio frequency ID (RFID) tags.• SugarCRM, the pioneer of open-source customer relationship management, unveils Sugar Express, a cloud-based version of its software aimed at small businesses. As well as core CRM features, it has plug-ins for Microsoft Office and “cloud connectors” to link data from sites such as Hoover’s business information. Subscriptions start at $499 a year for up to five users.• EDS, the services arm of Hewlett-Packard, has struck a deal with Microsoft jointly to sell the software giant’s hosted communication offerings. The Microsoft Productivity Online Suite includes online versions of Exchange and SharePoint as well as Office Live Meeting and Office Communications Online. Unlike rivals such as Google, Microsoft is unwilling to put the full suite of productivity software online so as to protect its packaged software business.• Sun Microsystems is making some of its open-source software available via the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. The product families are the GlassFish application server and OpenSSO, Sun’s open-source offering for identity management. With many IT budgets frozen, Sun says EC2’s hosted infrastructure allows IT departments to kick-start projects that would otherwise experience hardware requisition delays.• IBM has teamed up with MarketShare Partners, a specialist in marketing analytics, to target the media industry.Based on the Cognos business intelligence software, which IBM acquired in 2007, the offering is designed to help media companies monitor key performance indicators and consumer behaviour across different channels, and so maximise advertising revenues.• It is not just media folk who need help understanding their business. IBM plans to open a network of analytics solution centres around the world, with the first five about to open in Beijing, Tokyo, London, Washington DC and New York. IBM says economic stimulus measures will drive demand in areas as diverse as financial risk management and electronic medical records.

696;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-05-11T22:30:59Z;Return to Clinton-era intervention;;The past eight years have seen Washington take a back seat on antitrust issues and allowed Brussels to cement its place as the global competition capital as European regulators took on US companies such as Microsoft and Intel for alleged abuses.Dropping Bush administration barriers to antitrust cases, Christine Varney, the new head of the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, on Monday signalled a return to the more interventionist approach of President Bill Clinton’s administration. But that does not mean a blow to business. Sean Heather, a lawyer at the US Chamber of Commerce, the largest US business group, said he was against “inappropriate” antitrust action but saw no reason to believe Ms Varney would pursue a “radical” agenda.Even in the technology sector – whose companies are expected to bear more scrutiny than most – there are two sides to the debate.IBM, which has fended off antitrust inquiries since the 1960s, sought to benefit from the European Commission’s more active role to attack Microsoft. But some companies in Silicon Valley have a lot to lose. Ms Varney, an expert on internet law and antitrust attorneys for large technology companies, said they expected more scrutiny from her, especially of Google and Microsoft.“In the past, the antitrust division was a leader in its enforcement efforts in technology industries, and I believe we will take this mantle again,” Ms Varney said on Monday.Oracle’s pending purchase of Sun Microsystems is probably safe, lawyers in Silicon Valley said, but any combination of Microsoft and Yahoo’s search-based advertising will have to be structured more conservatively. “It’s going to make everyone in technology more careful before doing deals,” says a Valley expert with ongoing regulatory issues.Because Ms Varney’s remarks focused on behaviour by a single company, the most direct implications appear not to be for mergers but for actions by an already dominant company. Google adding functionality that mimics social networking, where it sees rivals emerging, should be expected to draw closer examination, said Gary Reback, a pre-eminent antitrust lawyer in the Valley. Ms Varney was “sending a shot across their bow saying ‘we’re going to look at those things’,” Mr Reback said. Oracle and Cisco Systems could likewise get into hot water without buying any other company.The Obama administration “understands one of main things that came out of Netscape, which was they were too slow in reacting”, said Mr Reback. Netscape, a pioneering web browser, complained it was being forced out of the market by Microsoft. But by the time the Department of Justice took action the company had already lost most of its market share.It is not only technology that will face calls for tougher action. Agriculture and media were both raised on the presidential campaign trail by Democrats as worthy of more scrutiny.But it is the financial sector where the change of administration could have the most profound effect. Ms Varney raised the question of whether antitrust enforcement could have stopped companies growing too large to present a risk to the entire financial system.She deliberately did not answer her own question, but moves from her department leading to a break-up of banks would be a radical departure. Lawyers said Ms Varney’s change of approach would see more alignment between the US and Europe.
697;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-05-06T04:30:32Z;Does tech pay enough tax?;;The answer, based on our back-of-the-envelope calculations: Probably, yes.But that doesn’t mean that some of the juicy tax benefits the sector has enjoyed aren’t about to come in for some close scrutiny. A case in point: the near-$500m tax benefit Apple got last year for keeping cash parked offshore rather than returning it to the US.The question in the headline above arises because the White House, trawling for ways to plug corporate tax loopholes and fill a yawning fiscal deficit, has just come up with ways to trim back on the tax privileges of US companies that operate internationally.The tech industry’s lobbyists in Washington have gone into overdrive. This is not aimed solely at tech, but the high share of revenues these companies get from overseas (70 per cent in HP’s case) makes them a prime target. The simultaneous effort to throw tech a bone by making the R&D tax credit permanent is a clear attempt to soften the blow.One lobbyist we spoke to made the point that tech, for all its globe-trotting, still pays a hefty chunk of taxes in the US: as a young industry, without the history of lobbying that brings with it an accumulation of tax breaks, it has relatively few shelters for its profits.Is this true? We compared the effective tax rates in recent years of a handful of the biggest tech companies (Microsoft, HP, IBM, Apple and Oracle) to other well-known US multinationals (GE, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola.) The broad picture: the techs tend to face all-in tax rates of 26-30 per cent, compared to the low-20 per cent range for the non-tech companies (and much less for GE, whose non-finance operations have faced tax rates of 11-16 per cent over the last three years.)Critics, of course, will complain that any effective rate that falls much below the 35 per cent US corporate rate points to an unjustifiable leakage of tax revenue from the US. But if US companies can organise their non-US operations in a way that allows them to realise higher profits in low tax countries (like Ireland – corporate tax rate 12.5 per cent) then so much the better for them: it has no impact on the tax take in the US.Fairness, however, often takes a back seat to political expediency. And in that regard, the cash that US tech companies have been piling up offshore makes a highly visible target. HP, Microsoft and Oracle between them have more than $30bn of overseas investments that they say they plan to invest indefinitely abroad – the test that keeps it out of the US tax net. Apple’s net income would have been 10 per cent lower last year had it not been for this benefit.The good news is that despite the fears that had been brewing in tech circles for a while, the Obama administration has not mounted a direct attack on this privilege. But it has started to chip away at the edges, and until the detailed proposals are out it will be hard to assess the full impact.
698;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-05-01T02:17:44Z;Fujitsu reforms chipmaking with TSMC deal;;Fujitsu is to outsource production of its most advanced semiconductors to TSMC of Taiwan as the restructuring of Japan’s chip industry gathers pace.The two companies said on Thursday that TSMC would make Fujitsu’s chips with features as small as 40 nanometres and that they would collaborate on future chips of 28 nanometres and less.The strategy amounts to a gradual exit from chip production for Fujitsu, which makes a range of processor chips, because it will not replace facilities in Japan as they become obsolete.The deal follows last week’s announcement of a merger between Renesas Technologies and NEC Electronics, Japan’s second and third largest chipmakers, and illustrates how the country’s chip companies can no longer compete with the scale and efficiency of Taiwan’s foundries.Kuniaki Nozoe, Fujitsu’s president, described the deal as only one step in reforming the chip operations and said further restructuring was possible. Fujitsu is already closing three of its nine semiconductor production lines in Japan.Speaking as Fujitsu unveiled its annual results, Mr Nozoe said the $7.4bn purchase of Sun Microsystems by Oracle was an opportunity to “build ideal partnerships”.Sun and Fujitsu jointly produce chips and servers based on scalable processor architecture (Sparc) – a rival to the Intel x86 design that is standard for PCs.“We have had proposals from SAP, Cisco and Oracle to discuss future technologies and I want to continue those negotiations,” said Mr Nozoe. Industry analysts have speculated that Cisco and Fujitsu are candidates to buy Sun’s hardware business if Oracle decides not to keep it.Restructuring costs in the semiconductor business, which more than offset healthy results from the services arm that Fujitsu is focusing on, contributed to an unexpectedly large net loss of Y112bn ($1bn) in the year to March 2009.Fujitsu forecast another net loss of Y65bn in the first half of its new financial year, but a sharp recovery in the second half leading to a full-year profit.
699;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-29T17:14:11Z;SAP sales drop by a third;;SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, said sales fell by a third in the first quarter of 2009, highlighting companies’ reluctance to invest in information technology during a recession.The slump was bigger than the 12 per cent drop in sales of such programs reported by rival Oracle in March. It led investors to sell SAP stock, although the shares rallied to close only 2 per cent lower at €29.50.The German company said software sales dropped by a third to €418m ($557m). However, it managed to make up for this by raising revenues from maintaining SAP software installed on customers’ computers.As a result, software and related services revenues were unchanged at €1.74m, outperforming Oracle, which saw joint revenues sink 2 per cent in its third quarter, which ran until the end of February.For the full year, SAP said it continued to work on the “assumption” that software and related services revenues would be flat or fall by 1 per cent, allowing it to meet an operating-margin target of between 24.5 per cent and 25.5 per cent.“While visibility for software revenues remains limited, we continue to take steps to protect our margin in this tough operating environment,” Léo Apotheker, SAP’s co-chief executive, said.Mr Apotheker added that he was not worried by ­Oracle’s better performance in selling software at the start of 2009. SAP’s position as market leader was “not substantially changed” by what would prove to be a normal quarterly blip, he said.Mr Apotheker signalled he did not want to follow Oracle into the hardware business after the US group agreed to buy server maker Sun. However, SAP’s strategy of organic growth would still be flanked by add-on purchases.Mr Apotheker takes sole responsibility for SAP next month when his current co-chief executive Henning Kagermann retires.SAP saw double-digit sales growth for much of 2008 – and an annual operating margin of 28.2 per cent – and it said as late as last summer that the crisis could be a boon as clients looked to cut costs with new software.Yet, in autumn, the company warned that the fall-out from the global recession meant it could not give a sales forecast for 2009. Cost cuts – including a pay freeze and jobs cuts – followed.SAP is cutting jobs for the first time in its 37-year history, aiming to reduce its workforce by 3,000 – 6 per cent of staff – to 48,500 by late 2009. Some 2,200 of these posts were cut last quarter.This led to a one-off restructuring charge of €160m in the first three months of 2009, helping to drag operating income down 8 per cent to €332m.Net income hit €204m, down 16 per cent from the first quarter of 2008.

701;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-28T23:31:08Z;Concern for Sun as sales fall 20% this year;;Sun Microsystems’ sales slumped by 20 per cent in the opening months of this year as the embattled computer systems company saw growth largely evaporate even for its most promising new products.The news came a week after Sun agreed a $7.4bn acquisition by Oracle and pointed to a further deterioration in the company’s market position amid the steep cyclical downturn.It is likely to give customers even more reason to pull back from further purchases while they wait to see whether Oracle will continue to support all of its products, according to analysts.“They aren’t firing on any cylinders at all,” said George Weiss, an analyst at Gartner, adding that Sun’s customer base was now vulnerable to being picked off by stronger rivals like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Dell.“They’re going to have to convince the marketplace that Sun products are still viable,” he said.Meanwhile, IBM responded to the collapse of its own takeover offer for Sun this month with an announcement that it would return more cash to its shareholders instead in the form of a higher dividend and increased stock buy-back plan.News of the 10 per cent dividend increase, to 55 cents a share, and extra $3bn devoted to buy-backs lifted IBM’s shares by 2 per cent on what was generally a weak day for tech stocks.The announcement continues a well-trodden path by Big Blue of paying out a large part of its cash holdings rather than amassing a big war chest for acquisitions.Breaking with normal practice, Sun on Tuesday called off its regular conference call with Wall Street to discuss its earnings, adding further to the uncertainty surrounding the future of its core hardware business as the Oracle acquisition looms.Oracle has pinned its motivation for the acquisition squarely on Sun’s software, raising doubts about its long-term backing for Sun’s servers based on its Sparc processors, as well as other products.On Tuesday, Sun reported that hardware sales had dropped by 26 per cent in the three months to the end of March, to $1.1bn, with the biggest dent suffered by its mature Sparc enterprise server business.However, the company’s smaller, more promising hardware businesses also suffered reversals, with sales of its X64 servers down 22 per cent and sales of its promising “Niagara” line of servers rising 3 per cent.Overall, Sun’s revenues fell to $2.6bn, below Wall Street expectations. Its net loss grew to $201m, or 27 cents a share, from 4 cents a share a year before.
702;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-28T13:47:37Z;VMware heads into private clouds;;Virtualisation specialist VMware has jumped aboard the cloud computing bandwagon with vSphere 4. Dubbed the first operating system for building ”private clouds”, vSphere 4 expands VMware’s traditional focus on server virtualisation to allow organisations to virtualise their entire data centre.VMware is having to move upmarket to counter the growing commoditisation of the low-end server virtualisation market, led by Microsoft, which also has the high-end covered with its own cloud OS, Azure.More MySQL from SunSun Microsystems has unveiled a mission-critical version of the popular MySQL open source database, MySQL Cluster 7.0. It provides fault-tolerant features normally only found on pricey high-end databases such as that offered by, for example, Oracle, which has just agreed to buy Sun. Open source fans are understandably anxious to hear what plans Oracle has for MySQL and the other no-cost/low-cost products in Sun’s open source portfolio.SAP for the warehouseSAP has teamed up with Teradata, the data warehouse specialist, to offer SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse on the Teradata database. NetWeaver BW runs on several databases, including those of Microsoft and arch-rival Oracle, but Teradata is a popular choice for very large data warehouses. Teradata, spun out of NCR, is one of the last remaining enterprise computing vendors to retain its independence – but for how long?HP security trioHewlett-Packard has unveiled a trio of new application security solutions – an area of IT security that often gets overlooked. The HP Assessment Management Platform 8.0 provides a platform for securely testing web applications. HP WebInspect 8.0 helps analyse complex web applications for security flaws.Finally, HP has a new software-as-a-service offering to allow businesses to contract security testing and expertise from HP on a pay-as-you-go basis.Checkpoint security gatewaysCheckpoint Software Technologies has introduced a new line of high-end security appliances. The Israeli firm claims machines in the Power-1 11000 series are the first security gateways to use Intel’s Xeon processor 5500 chipset. The family consists of three models with performance ranging from 15 gigabits a second to 25 Gbps, and the two junior members can be field upgraded as performance requirements grow.HP network switchesMeanwhile, HP is going in the other direction, eliminating the need for dedicated security appliances by offering a security module for its ProCurve network switches. The HP ProCurve Threat Management Services Module is available for the HP ProCurve 8212 and 5400 switches. HP also released ProCurve Network Manager Plus 3.0 to help businesses map and configure wired and wireless networks.New features for LatitudeDell has added new features to its Latitude line of business laptops to boost physical and data security. As well as a dedicated security control panel, which makes it easier to find the various security settings, selected Latitude models now come with Dell ControlVault, a hardware-based solution for protecting passwords with two-factor authentication. Encrypted solid-state drives will soon be offered as an option.The cost of losing a laptopMore on the lost laptop theme, this time from Intel which has calculated the business costs associated with losing a laptop – an astonishing $49,000 on average. While the replacement cost of a laptop is small, it is dwarfed by the hidden costs of the data breach – lost productivity, forensics, lost intellectual property and legal, consulting and regulatory expenses. Intel says data encryption can significantly reduce these costs.
703;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-27T08:12:37Z;Mergers and acquisitions;;"For a moment, it was like old times. Last week began with a “merger Monday”: 10 deals, totalling $27bn, including Oracle’s purchase of Sun Microsystems, GlaxoSmithKline’s takeover of Stiefel Laboratories, and PepsiCo’s bid for its two biggest bottlers. Subsequent days seemed promising, too, with rumours of a bid by Diageo for two-thirds of Moët Hennessy and Fiat signalling interest not just in Chrysler but in General Motors’ European operations.Sadly, a few rosy headlines can mislead. Thomson Reuters’ tracking figures suggest that last week was, in fact, nothing special in terms of global mergers and acquisitions values and volumes. Though the week beginning March 29 was one of the strongest since September, activity subsequently dropped below the average for the first quarter of 2009. And M&A values in January-March were already down a third, year on year, to the lowest since 2004.Buyers who are unconvinced stability has returned to equity markets fear making an acquisition that subsequently appears way overvalued. Most see the recent equity rebound as a classic bear market rally. And, while getting debt financing for deals is a touch easier than it was a few months ago, it remains tough for all except solid investment-grade names with a compelling rationale. Sellers, meanwhile, wistfully compare multiples today with a year ago, reluctant to part with assets unless they absolutely have to.M&A is set to remain subdued except in two areas. One is sectors where valuations and cash flows look reasonably solid – notably pharmaceuticals, plus consumer goods and, possibly, resources. The other is in distressed assets, including financial services. In the hardest hit sectors, such as cars, potentially transformational deals may emerge for little outlay, partially financed by the state – as Fiat hopes to do. But, as certain banks have discovered, just because assets are cheap and come with government “encouragement”, that does not make them less risky.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

704;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-23T22:02:31Z;I paid $7.4bn and all I got was this cup;;Wouldn’t you love to be a fly on the wall next time Oracle gets round to negotiating Java licences with IBM and Nokia?Sun’s aim of countering Microsoft by getting the programming language and development tools widely adopted was a knock-out success, but its business model (make the profits on hardware) failed utterly. Oracle has been pretty clear that it won’t make that mistake.But will Java licensees be willing to pay up to justify Larry Ellison’s claim that this is “the single most important software asset we have ever acquired”?One person familiar with Oracle’s thinking goes even further, arguing that net of Sun’s cash, the $5.6bn it will cost to buy the company is more than justified simply for Oracle to get its hands on Java.If so, then a back of the envelope calculation suggests Java would have to be capable of producing around $1.5bn a year in revenues (assuming you apply the same profit margins and earnings multiple as Oracle’s existing business.) That is a heck of a lot more than the $220m it made in Sun’s last fiscal year.This is where IBM and Nokia come into the picture. Along with Oracle, IBM is the biggest pillar of Java in the enterprise technology world, while Nokia’s 40 per cent market share makes it a key player in the place where Java has been most successful: on mobile handsets.Squeezing more out of IBM will not be easy. It has a ten-year licence granted by Sun that extends to 2016, with a change-in-control provision that protects the current terms in the event that Sun is taken over. We also hear that is has a “most-favoured customer” clause that guarantees it terms that are at least as good anyone else.When the time for renegotiation finally comes around, will Oracle be in a position to force up the price? To some degree, certainly, but IBM has a nuclear option: thanks to the open source licence on the programming language it could politely decline Oracle’s terms and go its own way. As Yefim Natis at Gartner puts it: “If IBM decides to support a forked Java, that will change everything.”Of course, it wouldn’t be able to call it Java, that trademark belongs to Sun. And it would have to ditch the blue coffee cup. But it could use exactly the same beans under a different name – how about Kona?Dividing the Java community like that would weaken it in the long run and undermine the power of the ecosystem. But still, it is a reminder that Oracle will have to tread carefully. Similar considerations apply when it comes to Nokia.All of this suggests that, to recoup what is plans to spend, Oracle will have to spread the net wider and persuade a whole new class of customers to pay for Java. It is a tantalysing prospect: with hundreds of millions of handsets running billions of Java applications, what if Oracle could extract just a tiny amount from each of those uses? Would the mobile ecosystem accept such a tax, and how would Oracle collect it?Sun failed to find an answer to that question. Oracle clearly does not plan to make the same mistake.
705;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-23T20:42:21Z;Oracle faces culture shock in Sun’s open-source world;;Larry Ellison is a famously activist exponent of competitive strategy. An avowed student of Sun Tzu’s Art of War, the Oracle chief executive has long followed an approach that sets Oracle’s interests against those of its main rivals, with Microsoft, IBM and SAP cast as the enemy.With the acquisition of Sun Microsystems, however, he is about to walk on to new terrain where some of the methods that defined Oracle’s traditional approach to strategy no longer apply.Sun’s main software assets – and the jewels for which Mr Ellison said this week that he had agreed to pay $7.4bn for the company – are all closely tied to the open source world: the Java programming language and development tools, which are partly open source, as well as the Solaris operating system and MySQL database.That makes them unlike the roughly 200 software properties that Mr Ellison has acquired in the past. They are made freely available, and rely partly on the efforts of a wider group of developers to extend and support them. Their future success, in fact, relies on a technology community that stretches well beyond Oracle – and includes companies such as IBM, which also relies on Java as a core technology.“Obviously Oracle is going to have to be a lot less heavy handed,” says Kenneth Chin, an analyst at Gartner. “They’ve acquired a lot of open-source assets, and they need to keep the communities involved.”So far, Oracle has had little to say about how it will manage this balancing act. That has left the open source world trying to second guess what Mr Ellison will do next.The focus has shifted in particular to how he will seek to make money from software properties that Sun itself so glaringly failed to “monetise” in the past, and whether his real intention is even to subvert some of the assets he is acquiring to protect Oracle’s existing business model.The future of MySQL – an open source database bought by Sun last year, which has come to be seen as a long-term threat to Oracle’s own core database software business – has become the most immediate source of concern.Marten Mickos, the former chief executive of MySQL, admits that Oracle’s acquisition of an upstart rival has sent a chill through the open-source community, and he likens it to Goliath vanquishing David. However, he also claims that it will still be in Mr Ellison’s own interests to maintain the software: “I think MySQL is cannibalising Oracle anyway,” so Oracle might as well benefit from that process directly, he says.Most observers do not expect the hard-headed Mr Ellison to see it this way. Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust expert, says there is a chance that anti-trust authorities will force him to divest MySQL, but adds: “I think he wins any way you cut it. If he keeps it, he kills it: if he spins it off, who wants it without the top developers anymore?”There are some potential limits. Mitch Kapor, a leading figure in the open-source world, points out that MySQL has a life beyond Oracle’s control: the software has already been “forked”, meaning alternative open-source versions have been created that are outside Oracle’s control.However, stripped of the sponsorship of a big company willing to supply the core group of developers to push the project forward, MySQL could lose momentum as a significant rival to Oracle.Mr Ellison’s intentions for Java have also become the centre of considerable speculation. Created by Sun as a way to counter the growing influence of Microsoft, Java’s power comes from its adoption by a wide group of companies, including IBM. If Oracle upsets this ecosystem it would undermine the value of Java – something people close to the company have been at pains to stress.Yet maintaining Java’s openness, while at the same time directing its future development, will be a delicate balancing act, requiring the exercise of what Bill Whyman, an analyst at ISI, calls “soft power” – not Mr Ellison’s strength.“We always wanted Java’s evolution to be participatory, but fully open would compromise compatibility,” says Bill Joy, the Sun co-founder and former chief scientist. “I believe Oracle shares these values, so am not concerned.”More directly, Oracle has made clear that it plans to make money from Java in a way that Sun failed to do – another source of potential conflict with the rest of the technology world. Besides simply raising the licensing fee, Oracle could try to levy a small fee on every application that runs on Java, according to Gartner – a move that would have particular implications for the mobile world, given that Java is shipped on virtually all mobile phones.

707;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-22T02:11:42Z;More thoughts on Oracle and hardware;;There are two explanations making the rounds for Oracle’s unexpected entry into the hardware business. Neither on its own is wholly convincing, but each hints at what is probably really going on here.The first is the explanation that Oracle was putting about on Monday. This holds that vertical integration of all aspects of hardware and software is the next step being demanded by the customers of enterprise technology companies, who want one throat to choke when something goes wrong.But it hardly feels as though customer expectations have changed enough to force Oracle to buy a deeply troubled server company to take on entrenched rivals like IBM, HP and now Cisco. Not does this explanation take account of the fundamental nature of the enterprise technology industry, which relies on deep technology and business partnerships.The other explanation is that Oracle had to move quickly to outmaneuver the slow-footed IBM, so it was willing to take on the unappealing hardware business just to get its hands on Sun’s software assets. It then follows, according to this view, that Oracle will now turn around and unload the hardware side as soon as it can, perhaps in pieces.To judge from the people we’ve spoken to, neither of these explanations quite gets to the bottom of what is going on.One good pragmatic reason for assuming Sun’s struggling hardware business is that, for the arch cost-cutters at Oracle, this is where many of the biggest opportunities for expense savings lie. Oracle has promised $1.5bn in operating profits from the Sun deal in the first year. Slashing hardware costs is likely to be a quick way to get there – and if the economy turns, Sun’s highly cyclical hardware arm could even provide a pleasant surprise.One person familiar with Oracle’s thinking suggests that the company will act quickly to narrow the focus of Sun’s hardware on a smaller number of high-end system designs. And a person close to the Sun camp admits that Sun itself simply failed to act aggressively enough to cut costs – though this person adds that a big acquirer like a Oracle also has many more opportunities to save money than Sun could have done on its own, for instance by combining salesforces.Another pragmatic reason to take on the hardware business is that it offers Oracle a strategic hedge. In a world dominated by a handful of giant systems companies, life as a pure software company could become uncomfortable: what if big partner/rivals like IBM and HP become less enthusiastic about selling and supporting Oracle’s software?Being able to offer its own hardware gives Oracle a fall-back, according to one person close to the transaction. The very existence of an Oracle hardware division changes the equation and removes a potential weapon in the hands of its enemies.Of course, none of this changes Oracle’s main motivation for the Sun acquisition: getting its hands on Java, Solaris and MySQL. But it does help to explain why a software company with operating profit margins of 35 per cent is willing to take on a business that recently has had trouble making any money at all.
708;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-21T20:39:42Z;Financials rise as Geithner calms bank fears;;US stocks rebounded on Tuesday as Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, allayed fears over the health of the banking industry.Mr Geithner told a congressional panel that “the vast majority” of banks had more capital than needed, which encouraged buyers to enter the market after Monday’s bruising sell-off, during which the financial sector dropped 11 per cent.Citigroup picked up 10.2 per cent to $3.24, helped by comments from its chief executive Vikram Pandit that it would “repay every dollar” of bail-out money. Bank of America, which fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday following warnings in its results about deteriorating credit conditions, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.76.US Bancorp was another significant riser, jumping 20.9 per cent to $19.27 after making better profits than expected.State Street reported operating earnings marginally ahead of estimates as mark-to-market losses declined following a change in accounting standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Its shares gained 17.9 per cent to $36.15.Lincoln National, the health insurer, surged after Bank of America recommended investors buy its stock and Reuters reported it would sell its Delaware Investments asset management unit. Its shares rose 20.3 per cent to $10.56.This helped the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 2.1 per cent to 850.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index gained 1.6 per cent to 7,969.56 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.2 per cent to 1,643.85.The overall rise in the financial sector masked falls from some companies as they missed earnings estimates, however.Keycorp, the Ohio-based bank, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share as it reported its fourth straight quarterly loss. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $7.05.Bank of New York Mellon also cut its dividend, reducing it to 9 cents per share, after feeling the effects of falling global stock markets, which put potential customers off investing with the bank. Its stock lost 0.2 per cent to $27.98.“Much of Monday’s trade was technical, with short-sellers betting that the six week rally could not continue. A lot of the most bearish estimates were factored in to the share price already,“ said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The Nasdaq’s gains came as IBMand Texas Instruments announced better earnings than predicted.IBM climbed 1.9 per cent to $102.31 after surprisingly good earnings.This helped Microsoft which gained 1.9 per cent to $18.97. Oracle, which on Monday announced a deal to buy Sun Microsystems, a former IBM target, also rose, gaining 3.8 per cent to $19.53.Texas beat expectations and raised its forecast for full-year profits gave up its early gains, following other chip makers downwards, and fell 1.2 per cent to $17.11.Some of the biggest Dow components added to the morning’s flurry of corporate news. Caterpillar reported earnings ahead of predictions, helping its shares gain 3 per cent to $31.39 even though this equated to a loss once the cost of making redundancies had been factored in.AK Steel offered further strength to the industrial sector as lower costs helped it report a narrower loss than Wall Street had expected. Its shares jumped 13.8 per cent to $11.66.Du Pont also gained as it reported earnings in line with estimates. Even though the chemical maker cut its full-year outlook, predicting further weakening of demand, its shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $28.06.Merger partners in the drug industry Merck and Schering-Plough both fell after Merck missed estimates for its first-quarter earnings. Schering’s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but both companies declined as Merck cut its full-year outlook. Merck lost 6.7 per cent to $23.54 while Schering Plough gave up 4.1 per cent to $22.11.Coca-Cola lost initial gains after reporting earnings in line with estimates. Investors worried about disappointing sales numbers though, sending its shares down 2.8 per cent to $43.09.“Today’s moves are a confluence of bargain hunting, Geithner’s comments assuaging fears over banks and short-covering after yesterday’s falls,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.
709;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Software and services help IBM meet targets;;"IBM has continued to outperform its technology peers during the downturn, relying on fatter services and software margins in the first quarter to make up for a continuing slump in hardware sales, its results showed Monday.Although net income dipped 1 per cent to $2.3bn from a year earlier on an
11 per cent drop in revenue, IBM’s share repurchases from what is now a cash hoard of $12.3bn pushed earnings per share up to $1.70, from $1.64. The stock buyback reduced shares outstanding by 4 per cent.Mark Loughridge, chief financial officer, said that he was “if anything, more confident” than three months earlier that IBM would meet the target it set then of $9.20 per share full-year earnings.Mr Loughridge said that IBM would cut a further $1bn of expenses out of its system during the year, on top of the $2bn in savings from restructuring last year and in the first quarter.Total gross margin expanded to 43.4 per cent in the quarter, from 41.5 per cent a year earlier. That was largely due to an 84.2 per cent software margin, where revenue slipped less than in the computer business.IBM, headed by Sam Palmisano, predicted that revenue would go up in its services business in the second half of the year. Service contract signings increased 27 per cent in the most recent quarter after adjusting for currency fluctuations.Asked about IBM’s loss of its quarry, Sun Microsystems to its key rival, Oracle, in the acquisition announced Monday, Mr Loughridge said he had no regrets.“Oracle and Sun have been partnering for two decades, and what’s the result?” he said. “We’ve picked up 14 percentage points of [market] share [in high-end servers] since 2000, and we have 32 points now.”IBM had negotiated down to the fine details with Sun before talks collapsed, but sources close to IBM pointed to problems that came up during Big Blue’s extensive inquiry, including employee and customer contract terms.“We run a very disciplined process,” Mr Loughridge said. “When we run a disciplined process, we get good results.”IBM said that its latest results benefited from its continuing “transformation” to a services company. While in mature markets a lot of the services contracts it has been securing concern saving clients money, the developing world’s deals include corporate infrastructure build-outs.Those markets are supplying a growing percentage of IBM’s total revenue and profit. Revenue from growth markets reached 17 per cent in the first quarter.IBM and Oracle have long been rivals in the sale of database software, while IBM and Sun compete on servers and data storage.The combination with Sun will make Oracle more of a full-slate contender, just as Cisco is expanding its own mission with the introduction of servers, on top of its core networking gear."
710;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;M&A springs back to life;;"The market for mergers and acquisitions sprang back to life on Monday when 10 deals totalling more than $27bn were announced, with over half of their total value paid in cash.After months of deal inactivity, Oracle agreed to buy Sun Microsystems for $7.4bn; GlaxoSmithKline paid $3.6bn for Stiefel Laboratories; and PepsiCo offered $6bn in cash and stock to buy out investors in its two biggest bottlers. Bankers said the deals signalled improving business confidence and market conditions for transactions, but cautioned that there was still a long way to go before the market could reach the levels of activity seen in the recent debt boom.William Vereker, co-head of investment banking at Nomura, said: “Companies are taking advantage of an improvement in markets to execute on strategic transactions which have been in the pipeline. But confidence is still fragile and much will depend on how markets behave over the coming months before M&A volumes increase meaningfully.”Others said it was encouraging to see deals being struck across several industry sectors. That contrasts with the first quarter, which was dominated by the pharmaceuticals industry– one of the few that is relatively stable and has strong cash flows. Pharmaceutical companies have also been forced to consolidate as they come under threat from patent expiries and generic rivals.However, the value and volume of worldwide deals remain well below the levels seen during the recent M&A and debt boom. In the year to date, worldwide M&A is down a third from last year to $659.5bn. In the same period in 2007, global deals reached $1,424.3bn – the highest year-to-date total on record, according to Dealogic.Wilhelm Schulz, co-head of European M&A at Citigroup, said: “Historically, M&A activity levels have been closely correlated to the state of the equity markets. While the recent equity capital market strength has certainly built board confidence and thereby contributed to increased M&A activity levels, structural barriers such as availability of credit, volatility levels and macro­economic uncertainty remain.”Although companies are using cash to do deals, acquirers with strong credit ratings and cash flows, and which can demonstrate industrial rationale for a deal, are also managing to convince banks to lend.Other companies are turning to the public bond markets as an alternative to costly short-term bank debt by tapping the bond market for long-dated, non-amortising debt. Roche, for example, financed its hostile offer for the 51 per cent of Genentech it did not own with cash, commercial paper, bonds and bank loans.“This is further evidence of the trend of selective big-ticket M&A as strategic consolidators take advantage of the lower market valuations to strengthen their own business with synergistic deals,” Philip Noblet, a managing director in Bank of America/Merrill Lynch’s M&A group, said.The deals did not excite equity markets, which fell on fears of economic weakness and troubled loans at Bank of America."
711;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-20T21:36:19Z;Oracle/Sun Microsystems;;"Swooping in before dawn broke over Silicon Valley on Monday, software maker Oracle announced an agreed offer to buy Sun Microsystems. The transaction at $9.50 per share in cash – the price that rival IBM had been expected to pay before negotiations collapsed two weeks ago – launches Oracle into direct competition with IBM and Hewlett Packard.Does this make sense for the software maker, though? On consensus forecasts, the $5.6bn enterprise value Oracle is paying for Sun equates to eight times expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $673m. But that does not factor in considerable scope for cost-cutting. Sun has successively failed to wring out savings over 10 successive restructuring plans. Oracle – typically bullish, without detailing plans and hardly any numbers – believes Sun will add $1.5bn to operating profits in its first year, and $2bn thereafter.Slashing costs is not the main rationale for this deal, however. Unless Oracle has developed a sudden desire to manufacture servers, Sun’s struggling hardware business will probably be sold on. (Cisco could be a potential buyer.) Rather, the draw is Sun’s software assets. Its key products, Java and Solaris, do not make much money. But they are industry standards, and much of Oracle’s own database software relies on them. Even if the group is unable to extract higher licence revenues from such intellectual property, it removes the risk of a competitor such as IBM stealing a march on Oracle.Indeed, the deal fits into Oracle’s overall strategy of building a software empire by acquisition, providing it with the ability to offer an “industry in a box” solution to businesses. Whether it will integrate the pieces into a coherent whole remains to be seen – although, as Oracle’s share price has handsomely outperformed its peers since it began its spending spree, investors should give Oracle the benefit of the doubt.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

712;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-20T21:23:29Z;Oracle in $7.4bn swoop on Sun;;Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison unveiled a surprise $7.4bn offer for Sun Microsystems on Monday, turning Sun’s collection of widely-used but undervalued software properties into the next targets for his wholesale consolidation of the software industry.The agreed offer, which followed closely on the heels of a failed IBM bid for Sun, threw the spotlight squarely onto Sun’s Java, a programming language developed in the mid-1990s to counter Microsoft’s growing dominance of the software industry.While Sun’s failure to make money from Java has long been a frustration for its shareholders, Mr Ellison declared it “the single most important software asset we have ever acquired” – and at a price, after deducting Sun’s net cash, that is only around half the amount that he paid for PeopleSoft, Oracle’s most famous software acquisition.News that Sun was being bought mainly for its software assets also confirmed the long decline of the server and storage hardware business for which it is better known. A former star of the technology industry, Sun’s value soared above $100bn at the height of the tech boom as its servers became the workhorses of the early internet years. its shares collapsed, however, as a new generation of lower priced technology took hold, and Sun struggled in recent years to justify its continued high cost base and heavy research and development spending.Oracle executives, while saying that the combination of hardware and software represented a new step in the database company’s evolution, left little doubt that they would severely cut back Sun’s hardware business after an acquisition, and analysts speculated that parts of the business would eventually be sold off to other tech companies.Sun’s agreed deal with Oracle, at $9.50 a share in cash, comes two weeks after negotiations for an acquisition by IBM at the same price fell apart.The deal follows a last-minute intervention by Oracle after IBM was once again in discussions with Sun about a deal of its own, according to a person close to the software maker. Oracle first approached Sun late on Thursday about the possibility of a deal, and signed an accord late on Sunday, according to this person.The swiftness is in stark contrast to IBM, which hesitated and dropped its offer price after taking a closer look at Sun’s business in recent weeks. This uncovered issues that reduced the attractions of a deal, including a bonus plan that would hand Sun executives a $600m windfall in the event of an acquisition, according to one person close to IBM.The IBM offer also caused a rift in the Sun camp, as the company debated whether to sell itself to an old rival. Oracle, by contrast, is an old Silicon Valley ally. Along with Netscape and America Online, Sun and Oracle were part of the Gang of Four that stood up to Microsoft at the end of the 1990s, lobbying for the US Justice Department inquiry and long-running lawsuit against what they called the Beast from Redmond.The deal will accelerate Oracle’s transformation from a database software company into an all-round IT systems supplier. Mr Ellison said the company would now be able to sell “completely integrated systems, hardware and software, [which] should be popular and very profitable.”The deal caps a series of big software acquisitions by Oracle, the latest of which, for BEA Systems, made it a big competitor to IBM in the market for “middleware”, the software used to stitch together applications that run over multiple computer systems.Previously, Oracle’s purchases had focused on applications, an area of the software business IBM has chosen not to play in, with the purchases of companies like PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems.The Sun purchase will be worth more to Oracle financially than the PeopleSoft, Siebel and BEA acquisitions combined, said Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-president. It will add 15 cents to its earnings per share in the first year after the deal, and will lift pro forma operating profits by $1.5bn in the first year and $2bn the year after that, she added.Oracle gave no other details for how it expected to achieve these profit targets. Instead, its executives on Monday focused squarely on the long-term strategic advantage to Oracle of owning Sun’s leading software assets, principally Java and the Solaris operating system.Java has become a key part of the software foundation for a generation of IT systems created by companies like Oracle and IBM. Yet even though it is in use on hundreds of millions of PCs, mobile phones and other digital gadgets, Sun has failed to make much money from the software. Licensed cheaply and operated as an open standard, it has become a shared resource for many of the software companies that exist outside the Microsoft camp.Along with Solaris, Sun’s Unix computer operating system, Java is the overriding reason for Oracle’s decision to swoop in at 11th hour and make an offer of more than $7bn for the company, Mr Ellison and other Oracle executives said.The central position of Sun’s software points to how the value has shifted in its wide portfolio of technologies as its core hardware business has crumbled. Though known mainly as a maker of servers, Sun has struggled as its customers have turned to cheaper, standardised machines based on chips made by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.Oracle made little effort on Monday to disguise the fact that it sees Sun’s hardware business as merely an afterthought. Publicly, its executives said only that they would make sure hardware became a profitable division within Oracle.According to one person close to the company, that is likely to mean forcing through the sort of aggressive cost-cutting that Sun itself had resisted as an independent company, and narrowing the range of products to focus only on the sort of high-end, complex systems that demand the highest prices.Oracle has already taken one step into hardware, “bundling” its database software into a machine from Hewlett-Packard so that it can sell a complete system. Likewise, with Sun hardware it will be able to sell servers along with sector-specific software aimed at retailers or banks that amount to an “industry in a box,” said Charles Phillips, co-president.Yet this ability to combine hardware and software to build complete integrated IT systems, though loudly trumpeted by Oracle executives on Monday, is not the driving force behind the deal.Rather, Oracle has its eyes set firmly on the Sun software – and combining this with Oracle’s own software throws up a “wildly profitable” opportunity that should make the Sun acquisition much more valuable than any of other deals the acquisitive company has pulled off in recent years, according to the person close to Oracle.Part of the reason, this person says, is that Oracle believes it can make far more from Java than Sun ever did. That is because Sun decided a decade ago virtually to give the software away to make sure it got wide adoption. Many of the Java licenses – including one that Sun granted to Nokia – were for ten years and come up for renewal next year, implying that in future, Oracle will look to extract a higher price for the technology.That message will not be lost on IBM, which itself relies heavily on Java for its own highly profitable portfolio of “middleware”. An IBM spokesperson declined to comment on the strategic implications.However, the person close to Oracle denied that the company would greatly increase the licence fees for Java, or weaken its position as an industry standard by tying it more closely to Oracle’s own software. It was clearly in Oracle’s interest to encourage Java’s continued widespread adoption, so such moves would not make sense, this person said.Likewise, Oracle is likely to find it hard simply to extract a price for Solaris, the operating system which Sun was forced to turn into an open-source product to try to hold its own against Linux. Yet the fate of Solaris is central to Oracle’s future: the company sells more database software licenses running on Solaris than on any other operating system, Mr Ellison said.As a result, keeping Java and Solaris out of arch-rival IBM’s hands was likely to have figured high on Mr Ellison’s list of reasons when deciding to mount his own bid for Sun.
713;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-20T20:46:03Z;Wall Street falls despite strong earnings;;Banks gave US stocks their worst day since the recent rally began in spite of better than expected results from Bank of America.The bank made strong earnings but the shares plunged 24.3 per cent to $8.02 as the company warned about “extremely difficult challenges”, especially from deteriorating credit quality.Other banks also struggled after The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was considering converting loans made to big banks into common stock, thereby putting money into them without having to ask Congress.Investors were nervous about the idea, which some called “back-door nationalisation”, and Citigroup fell 19.5 per cent to $2.94 while Wells Fargo dropped 16.1 per cent to $17. Citigroup was also hampered by bearish analysis from Goldman Sachs, which said credit losses at the banking giant were growing at a “rapid rate”. Capital One, the credit card company, was one of the sector’s biggest fallers after Goldman Sachs cut the company from “buy” to “neutral”. Its shares lost 25 per cent to $13.38.A report in the FT that banks would be able to return bail-out money only if it was in the economic interest also hurt the sector.“Investors were disappointed that paying back Tarp (troubled asset relief programme) money looked further away, and then the news on deteriorating credit from BofA tipped them over the edge,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 4.3 per cent lower at 832.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6 per cent to 7,841.73 points and the Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3.9 per cent to 1,608.21 points.But on the busiest day yet of the earnings season, a piece of acquisition news was the biggest surprise.Oracle, the software company, said it had offered $9.50 a share to buy its rival Sun Microsystems, which had been involved in take­over talks with IBM.Sun’s shares jumped 36.8 per cent to $9.15, while Oracle lost 1.3 per cent to $18.82.Shares of IBM fell as investors moved to anticipate the company’s results, due out after the close.The stock, which has risen more than 20 per cent since the market hit a low in March, dropped 0.8 per cent to $100.43.The takeover offer failed to spark a rally, even as several companies reported better first-quarter results than expected.Drug company Eli Lilly reported earnings that were better than both the same period last year and estimates for this period, but its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $32.99 as investors worried about weaker sales of its brand-name drugs.Halliburton, the energy conglomerate, also beat expectations, although with falling revenues and profits, and its stock gained 0.1 per cent to $18.79 after falling during the morning’s trade.PepsiCo was another company to fall in spite of reporting better results than anticipated. The company announced it was to offer about $6bn to buy the shares it does not already own in its two largest bottlers. This outweighed rising earnings, and its shares lost 4.4 per cent to $49.86. Shares in Pepsi Bottling Group rose 21.9 per cent to $30.73.Hasbro, the toymaker, was one of the few companies whose results did not beat expectations on Monday morning, with low consumer spending during the Christmas season hurting sales. The shares gave up 2.7 per cent to $27.16 after rallying on Friday following better profit margins than expected from its rival Mattel.Steel makers suffered after Bloomberg quoted a company official at Arcelor Mittal, the world’s biggest steel company, as saying it may halve the size of a planned plant in India and indefinitely defer a second facility amid low demand for cars and homes. As metals prices declined during the day, US Steel lost 11.3 per cent to $26.58 and AK Steel dropped 14.2 per cent to $10.25.Lennar, the homebuilder, was one of the heaviest fallers on the S&P after the company said it planned to sell up to $275m in common stock for possible use as working capital and to repay debt. Its shares lost 18.6 per cent to $7.60.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, said: “The majority of the bad news is behind us, but we had a nice run up and a lot of people are now covering their positions.”
714;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-20T17:36:04Z;Java looked upon as the hottest prospect;;The Java programming language, developed by James Gosling, the Sun Microsystems engineer, in the 1990s as an industry standard to counter the growing influence of Microsoft, has since become a key part of the software foundation for a generation of IT systems.Sun, though, failed to make much of a business out of Java, even though it is used on hundreds of millions of PCs, mobile phones and other digital gadgets. Licensed cheaply and operated as an open standard, it has become a shared resource for many of the software companies that exist outside the Microsoft camp.Yet that history belies Java’s true significance, at least according to Oracle. Larry Ellison, the software company’s chief executive, on Monday declared Java “the single most important software asset we have ever acquired” – and at a price, after deducting Sun’s net cash, that is only around half the amount Mr Ellison paid for PeopleSoft, his most famous software acquisition.Along with Solaris, Sun’s Unix computer operating system, Java is the overriding reason for Oracle’s decision to swoop in at the 11th hour and make an offer of more than $7bn for the company, Mr Ellison and other Oracle executives said.The central position of Sun’s software points to how the value has shifted in its wide portfolio of technologies as its core hardware business has crumbled.

716;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-15T21:09:09Z;High-tech groups to testify against Microsoft;;A group of technology companies led by IBM, Nokia and Oracle, has joined the European Commission’s antitrust case against Microsoft and will testify against the company, which is accused of abusing its dominance in the internet browser market.Ecis, the technology industry group, on Wednesday said it had been accepted as a third party complainant in the case, joining Google and the Mozilla Foundation, the developers of the Firefox browser.The addition of these technology heavyweights to the case highlights the rising importance of controlling internet browser technology. More and more technology services are being accessed through the internet, including word processing programs, productivity software and leisure activities, such as games. Companies are keen to limit Microsoft’s current dominance.Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser has 65.5 per cent of global market share, according to StatCounter, compared with just over 27 per cent for Firefox, its closest competitor.The Commission suspects Microsoft of having broken European antitrust laws by tying the IE browser to its dominant Windows operating system, thereby undermining rival products.Some rivals would like to see Microsoft compelled to offer a choice of up to four browsers with the Windows operating system.“This is an important case to ensure that browsers can compete on merit and that consumers have a true choice in the software they use to access the world wide web. Smaller, more innovative browser developers need a level playing field,” said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer and Ecis spokesman.Microsoft declined to comment on the news.The European Commission sent Microsoft a complaint in January, with initial findings that the company was harming competition with its practices. Microsoft has until April 28 to respond.Ecis has also been active in campaigning against Microsoft over its proprietary programming languages such as XAML and Office Open XML on the internet.
717;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-14T11:20:47Z;Bull offers crisis consultancy;;French IT group Bull has launched a range of consultancy services under the umbrella name of Next. The aim is to help businesses revamp their IT systems to cope with the current difficult times and Bull claims it can reduce data centre and software costs by up 60 per cent.Cut through some tortured jargon – concrete road-map or bio data centre – and you discover Bull’s elixir consists of open source, virtualisation, business intelligence and outsourcing.SAP stresses BISAP also stresses the importance of business intelligence in a downturn, particularly for smaller businesses. Version 3.1 of BusinessObjects Edge BI, which is aimed at SMEs, now includes the Polestar interface, which allows employees to use more intuitive keyword searches. The latest version can also handle data in PeopleSoft, Oracle and Siebel applications, which are all owned by SAP’s rival Oracle.Microsoft and Monster help for job seekersAnother announcement inspired by today’s tough times. Microsoft has teamed up with Monster.com, a leading online recruitment site, to allow job seekers in the US to create better résumés using a range of Microsoft Office templates. These can be downloaded from the US version of the Office Online website, where job seekers can also access Monster’s job postings and career management tools and advice.Dell’s healthcare solutionDell has unveiled a mobile computing solution specifically for the healthcare sector. It lets users keep their session active if they have to move to a different device, and employs a single sign-on system with authentication handled by contactless smartcards. Dell’s healthcare solution is built on top of Symantec’s Workspace Corporate software and Dell products such as virtual remote desktop and on-demand desktop streaming.Oracle wizard for Google appsOracle has announced a ”gadget wizard” for Google Apps. It makes it easier for businesses running Oracle Siebel customer relationship management software to incorporate customer data into Google’s web-based programs. Oracle also supports Google’s newly-announced Secure Data Connector, which allows data from behind the company firewall to be securely exported to the cloud.Oracle’s HP connectionsAlso new from Oracle are three ”connectors” to make it easier to use its Enterprise Manager software with Hewlett-Packard’s help-desk and systems management products. The three connectors can take data from HP ServiceCenter, HP Service Manager and HP OpenView Manager, respectively.New VirtualBox from SunSun Microsystems has launched Sun VirtualBox 2.2, the latest release of its free, open source virtualisation software. VirtualBox 2.2 introduces support for the new Open Virtualisation Format (OVF) standard, as well as offering better performance.HP enhances storage and operations productsHP has upgraded its business service automation portfolio with enhancements to two products, HP Storage Essentials and HP Operations Orchestration. Storage Essentials helps customers manage the increased storage needs of virtualised IT environments, while the operations product reduces service downtime and now supports the three main virtualisation technologies from Microsoft, VMware and Citrix.Windows beyond the data centreWindows Embedded Server is Microsoft’s latest attempt to expand the Windows franchise beyond the desktop and outside the data centre. It is an embedded version of Microsoft’s core Windows Server platform and is aimed at industrial computing, consumer products and other applications where IT is expected to work unattended and in the background.
718;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-04-03T22:04:50Z;IBM looks to fine tune $6bn Sun deal;;IBM was aiming to put the finishing touches over the weekend to a deal to acquire Sun Microsystems for about $6bn.The combination would bring together two of the largest makers of powerful corporate computers, with IBM expected to pay about $9.50 a share, according to people briefed on the talks.But the price has fluctuated during the talks and was moving “minute to minute”, one of the people involved said Friday.Both sides expect to announce a conclusion within days, probably as early as Monday.The takeover would leave Hewlett-Packard as IBM’s main competitor in the big servers market, and would bolster IBM’s position against database group Oracle by adding the open-source MySQL program to its own high-end database software.It would strengthen IBM’s position relative to Microsoft’s database software.“Who can hurt IBM? HP, Microsoft and Oracle. This gives them something to use against each of them,” a former Sun executive said.Analysts said IBM wanted Sun’s rich customer list, which could boost IBM’s lucrative services business. It is expecting cost savings to arise from cutting out Sun’s back office functions.An antitrust challenge could force IBM to divest some of Sun’s assets. There may be complications in other lines of business, such as middleware that co-ordinates small programs on top of the operating system.IBM has its proprietary middleware, while Sun has been pushing an open-source alternative.The two companies have different cultures, but both have been contributors to the development of open-source tools. The Java programming language was invented at Sun.The deal would be the largest in IBM’s history and spell the end of the line for Sun, which has seen its stock fall more than 90 per cent from its days as the favoured provider of equipment for internet groups.Sun was founded by a team from Stanford University and was far ahead in predicting the centrality of networks. It followed its own path, designing its own chips and operating system. The result was a much-admired combination but its offerings proved too costly for many buyers as Microsoft improved its capabilities and offered systems at a much lower price.The rapid adoption of Linux might have provided the death blow. That free and open-source operating system ran on the same machines as Sun’s, and corporations turned to it for central functions after the dotcom bust made saving money a priority.Sun has embraced open-source but has found it a struggle to earn anywhere near the profit from servicing customers using that software that it did from selling premium hardware.Sun and IBM both declined to comment Friday.

Sun is rumoured to be possible target for IBM which has partnered with rival Amazon’s EC2 cloud initiative.IE8 – coming soon to a screen near youBrace your firewalls as Microsoft has finally released Internet Explorer 8, which will be automatically deployed to PCs via Windows Update in coming weeks. Speed is the big selling point of IE8 and Microsoft claims it cuts page loading times by up to 50 per cent over rivals. Other features include right-click access to services such as Live Search and web slices, which keeps track of updates made to frequently visited pages.EMC’s bigger solid-state drivesStorage Giant EMC has brought out two larger-capacity versions of its new line of Enterprise Flash solid-state drives. Aimed at high-performance enterprise applications, the 200GB and 400GB drives are still more expensive than traditional magnetic drives so EMC is stressing the better performance and, above all, big energy savings made possible by using solid-state disks.HP’s entry level NonStop computerHewlett-Packard has added an entry-level model, the Integrity NS2000, to its NonStop line of fault-tolerant computers. With the NS2000, HP wants to broaden the market for the NonStop beyond stock exchanges and big banks to small and mid-sized organisations that need highly reliable hardware but previously balked at the price. The NS2000 costs from $100,000, which is cheap compared to traditional NonStop systems.Defence against Flash attacksHP has released a free tool to help prevent viruses and attacks being mounted via the Flash multimedia browser plug-in. The growing popularity of Flash on corporate and consumer websites makes it a favourite target for malicious code writers. The HP SWFScan tool allows website developers to write more secure code without becoming security experts.Oracles updates Mantas platformOracle Financial Services Software has unveiled a new release of its Oracle Mantas software to tackle financial fraud. Dubbed a ”behaviour detection platform”, Mantas is designed to help financial institutions spot cross-channel fraud by monitoring suspicious activities across different channels and lines of business. Before being acquired by the US software giant, Oracle Financial Services Software was known as Indian software company I-flex Solutions.Windows takes the apps’ revenue sharing routeIf you cannot beat them, join them. Microsoft has followed Apple’s revenue-sharing business model in a bid to boost the popularity of Windows with mobile software companies. Apple’s online App Store offers more than 10,000 third-party applications for the iPhone and Microsoft hopes its Windows Marketplace for Mobile will achieve similar popularity with developers, who get to keep 70 per cent of the revenues that their Windows applications generate.Citrix makes virtualisation easierCitrix has enhanced its XenApp virtualisation product to make it easier to manage large virtualised environments. With the latest improvements to XenApp5, IT departments manage a single standardised XenApp server ”image” which can then be rapidly deployed to hundreds of virtualised servers across a big data centre. User profiles are also easier to manage, which is particularly important when users access the system from different devices.
720;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-03-19T20:54:57Z;Wall St retreats on stimulus scepticism;;"US stocks fell on Thursday as investors continued to react to the Federal Reserve’s bold plan to buy up assets in order the stimulate the economy.Financials fell steeply, outweighing rises in materials and energy stocks, as investors bet the plan would not be as beneficial for banks as hoped, but would trigger a rise in commodity prices and a fall in the dollar.Banking stocks had surged on Wednesday as investors bet their balance sheets would be cleared of distressed assets. But on Thursday, many were more sceptical of the move and the financial sector fell below where it had been before the Fed’s announcement.They had earlier risen as figures showed that first-time unemployment claims fell to 646,000 from 658,000 last week, against consensus estimates of 655,000.But the fallout from the Fed plan soon started to dominate investors’ thinking once more, and banks were further weighed down that a new 90 per cent tax rate on bonuses for high earning bankers at companies which had taken over $5bn from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp) could trigger an exodus of talent.JPMorgan closed 8 per cent down at $24.95, Morgan Stanley fell 13 per cent to $21.04 and Goldman Sachs dropped 5.7 per cent to $99.30.Credit card companies were also big fallers after Discover announced an operating loss of $0.36 per share for the first quarter. The company said it would cut its dividend from $0.06 per share to $0.02, and its shares lost 13.3 per cent to $6.28. American Express also fell, dropping 7.2 per cent to $13.07, while Capital One gave up 13.6 per cent to $12.30.Shares in Citigroup, which have more than tripled in the past two weeks, were particularly volatile, as the company announced it had begun plans to swap $5.3bn worth of preference shares into common stock. After an initial rise of more than
11 per cent, they slumped 15.6 per cent to $2.60.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.3 per cent down at 784.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent lower at 7,400.8 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 1,483.48.“The aggressive move by the Fed is stoking inflation expectations and there is a belief that a lot of money could flow into commodities or other inflation hedges,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MFGlobal. “This is suppressing the price of equities.”Others warned that the Fed’s actions could only be judged on a more long-term view however.“We need to let the Fed’s efforts begin to work,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group. “They will help clear the balance sheets of good banks, but that will take time.”The oil price rose sharply on Thursday to its highest level this year, which boosted the price of energy stocks. Chevron gained 0.8 per cent to $67.13.Materials also gained on hopes that a weaker dollar would boost demand for US goods from overseas buyers.Alcoa the largest US aluminium producer, lifted 16.8 per cent to $6.40, bolstered also when JPMorgan raised its estimates of the company’s earnings for 2009 and 2010.The steel sector was another strong performer. Nucor gained 7.2 per cent to $38.08, US Steel picked up 9.2 per cent to $20.94 and AK Steel rose 8.8 per cent to $7.55. AK Steel was also helped by news of a $5bn Treasury bail-out for car parts makers, which lifted the big carmakers. GM one of AK’s biggest customers, rose 8.7 per cent to $2.87.There was further good news for the technology sector, as Oracle announced better profits than expected and said it would pay its first quarterly dividend. Its shares rose 9.7 per cent to $17.37.General Electric fell however after it told investors it was likely to see a smaller profit in its financial arm than previously predicted as the economy had worsened faster than expected. Rapidly rising job losses had hit the consumer-credit business, executives said, and the company’s shares lost 1.8 per cent to $10.13.Earnings for FedEx, the delivery company, missed analysts’ estimates but its shares rose 4.8 per cent to $45.10 after executives said they did not expect a further significant deterioration in the economy this year."

722;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-03-18T23:32:33Z;Oracle announces dividend in wake of robust earnings;;Continued spending by companies to handle the explosion of data on which their businesses depend helped Oracle, the database software company, avoid the worst effects of the downturn and post stronger than expected earnings for its latest quarter, according to figures released on Wednesday.In a show of confidence, Oracle also announced the first dividend in its 23 years as a public company, with a quarterly payment of five cents.“Though we cannot control the stock market, one thing we can do is give our stockholders a dividend,” said Safra Catz, co-president, adding that the payment was designed to show Oracle’s confidence in its operating model, competitive position and ability to hit its targets.The latest earnings, news of which led to a 7 per cent jump in Oracle’s shares in after-market trading, were hailed by Larry Ellison, chief executive, as a “remarkable achievement” at a difficult time.Had it not been for the sharp rebound in the dollar in recent months, which depressed the reported value of its earnings, Oracle would have exceeded profit targets that it set even before the downturn took hold, Mr Ellison added.Oracle’s results for the third quarter of its fiscal year were helped by the relative resilience of its core database and “middleware” business, which are an important part of the foundation on which corporate IT systems depend.“Infrastructure is an easier business in a tough environment” as customers still need to spend on new technology to handle rising volumes, said Charles Phillips, co-president.Oracle’s revenues climbed 2 per cent to $5.5bn, ahead of expectations, though growth would have hit 11 per cent had it not been for the currency swings.“But for currency, we sold more software licences” than a year before, Mr Ellison said.“That’s in the face of a worldwide recession. That is a remarkable achievement.”Net income slipped 1 per cent to $1.3bn, or 26 cents a share, but grew 14 per cent in constant currency terms.The stronger dollar would wipe an even greater 7 cents a share from reported earnings in the coming quarter, the company said.Oracle predicted that the weaker economy and currency effects would leave its revenues from new software licences in the next quarter between 17 and 27 per cent lower than a year before, with overall revenues down 10-14 per cent.On the pro forma basis on which Wall Street assesses the company, Oracle said its earnings per share had risen 16 per cent from a year before, to 35 cents a share, compared with the 32 cents analysts had expected.
723;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-03-16T19:56:14Z;Wall St snaps four-day winning streak;;US stocks fell sharply in late trade, giving up previous gains to finish slightly below Friday’s close as American Express announced more people had trouble paying credit card bills in February.The news prompted a slump in the company’s shares, which finished 3.3 per cent down at $12.66. It also dragged down the financial sector, which had enjoyed an early banking-led rally.Shares in Citigroup surged back above $2, gaining 30.9 per cent to $2.33 as confidence in the banking sector continued to rise after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, reassured the public that economic recovery would begin in 2009 if government action worked.He said the country’s leading banks were solvent, adding that he already saw some “green shoots” of recovery.The sector was also given a boost when Barclays of the UK added its name to the big banks that have said they started the year well.Last week Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan all said they were profitable for the first two months of 2009.Bank of America rose 7.3 per cent to $6.18 but JPMorgan fell after American Express’ announcement, losing 2.8 per cent to $23.09.Financial companies were also helped by messages from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which proposed changes to the mark-to-market accounting rule, which has been blamed for exacerbating worries over financial companies’ capital positions.The board proposed allowing companies to exercise more judgment in determining if a market for an asset is active and if a transaction is “distressed” when measuring the value of an asset.Insurers were buoyed by the news, with MetLife picking up 8.1 per cent to $19.17 and Prudential lifting 1.8 per cent to $19.10.Capital One provided some relief from American Express’ news after it announced reduced the numbers of auto loans it believes will never be repaid. Its shares gained 0.1 per cent to $12.57.But many investors still feel the recent rally by financial stocks is flimsy. Terry Morris, senior vice president at National Penn Investors Trust Company, said: “Citi’s rise is based on speculative buying that leads to short-covering. The company is not 40 per cent better than it was on Friday.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 753.89, having earlier been over 2 per cent higher, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 7,216.97.Weakness from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index, which lost 1.9 per cent to 1,404.02.Cisco announced on Monday it was to sell servers for data systems in partnership with smaller technology companies. Its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $15.45.Analysts said the deal might herald other large companies in the sector snapping up smaller rivals, but shares in many of those companies still fell as investors moved their money back into riskier sectors.Oracle, which was named specifically by Barron’s, the publication for investors, as a potential purchaser, was one of the biggest drags on the sector, losing 4.2 per cent to $14.90. Intel meanwhile fell 3.1 per cent to $14.25 and Dell dropped 5 per cent to $8.90.Investors had looked to the cash-rich technology sector as a defensive trade but as financials strengthened, it became the day’s biggest faller. Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “People are coming back to the financial sector and seeing some recovery in healthcare stocks.”Industrial stocks were led higher by General Electric, in spite of figures released on Monday morning showing that industrial production had fallen by more than expected.Investors took confidence from UBS, which removed its short-term “sell” recommendation on the company and the company’s shares rose 0.4 per cent to $9.66.Consol Energy rallied in spite of the falling price of oil, rising 5.5 per cent to $27.48 after Barron’s said the company had a strong balance sheet and low operating costs, making it a bargain.Shares in CV Therapeutics fell 5 per cent to $19.64 after Astellas, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, confirmed it would not enter into a bidding war with Gilead Sciences for the company. Gilead lost 2.7 per cent to $44.19.
724;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Sun’s Java programming language is already widely used on phones to run games, animations and the such. Sun wants to go further with JavaFX Mobile, which allow phone manufacturers to add ”immersive content” and ”expressive features” on top of the basic Java platform.
726;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-03-02T09:12:34Z;Buffett’s bad year;;"It is a sure sign of extremes in financial markets when the Oracle of Omaha is said to be losing his touch. The last time tongues wagged this way was a decade ago when he was supposedly missing the investment opportunity of a lifetime by eschewing what later turned out to be fool’s gold in the tech bubble. This time, though, Berkshire Hathaway is coming out of the worst year in its 43-year history at a time when investors’ faith in financial expertise has been shaken.A little perspective is warranted here. Buffett’s stumble came during the worst year for equities since the 1930s and Berkshire’s book value fell only 9.6 per cent. In other words, it fared 27.4 percentage points better than the S&P500 when dividends are included. An investment with Buffett has returned 84 times that of equities overall since 1965.As in the past, he admits to some investment errors in timing and judgment – confessing, for example, that one of the “dumb things” he did was to buy a large amount of ConocoPhillips stock shortly before oil and gas prices collapsed. But Buffett usually plays the odds masterfully and now says risk is grossly overpriced. His still-enormous cash pile insulates him from disaster and allows him to be shrewdly opportunistic, even if, on occasion, he did not quite pick the bottom of the market. He thus betrays no concern over the $14.5bn in plain and hybrid debt he bought from Wrigley, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. Investors are also jittery over $37bn in puts he wrote on various equity indices maturing in 15 to 20 years. His mark-to-market loss is already $10bn, or double the premium received. But, with no need to post collateral, stocks at 12-year lows and plenty of time remaining on those bets, his losses exist on only paper.As always, Buffett cares solely about value, not what the market thinks. Such pure objectivity is not only refreshing but also a contrarian buying signal for other brave, long-term investors. Consider what happened the last time he strayed so far from conventional wisdom.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

727;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-02-26T03:31:57Z;Government backs open-source software;;The government has pledged to accelerate use of open-source software as it seeks new ways to prevent overspending in public-sector IT projects.Open-source software is typically available for free, as it is made by a community of voluntary developers which anybody can join. That lowers development costs and mean no single organisation owns the “source code” underlying the products, as traditional software companies such as Microsoft, Oracle or SAP do.As a result, the up-front costs of open source software are lower and the wider availability of experts to support the technology once it is installed increases choice and control for IT departments. However, the costs of that support over the lifetime of the product are not always cheaper than traditional “proprietary” software.The 10-point action plan, published on Tuesday, follows a Conservative party report last month in which George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, said that the government could save £600m ($855m) a year by using a more “open procurement process”.Tom Watson MP, minister for digital engagement, said that open source “has been one of the most significant cultural developments in IT and beyond over the last two decades”.“It has shown that individuals, working together over the internet, can create products that rival and sometimes beat those of giant corporations,” he said.“We need to increase the pace” of open-source adoption, Mr Watson added, to “ensure that open source products are fully and fairly considered throughout government IT”.That involves a change in government procurement policy, which will also favour open source if there is no cost advantage due to its “additional inherent flexibility”, and strive to avoid tying into long contracts with software vendors which are expensive to change.The government will also employ open-source-style licensing for bespoke software to make it easier for technology to be reused between departments.In spite of a similar policy being outlined in 2004, the UK government has lagged in taking advantage of open source compared to corporate IT departments and governments in France, Holland and Belgium, industry experts say. Gartner, the analyst group, predicts that more than 90 per cent of companies will use open-source software in some form by 2012.“Open source is a good quality modern technology that most developed economics understand now,” said Simon Crossley, a partner at Eversheds, the law firm. “I’m not surprised by this but it is a bit overdue.”He added that government backing may mean open-source adoption filters down into schools, and so help teach children to customise their software and see how it works.Providers of open-source software and services welcomed the move.Simon Phipps, chief open source officer at Sun Microsystems, said: “There is a wave of interest in open source from global governments right now. This is a strong policy, not handwaving or a token gesture.”But he said he expected incumbent software vendors to cut prices to protect their position.Phil Andrews, regional director of Red Hat, which provides software such as the Linux operating system, called the government’s new policy a “major breakthrough”.He estimated that 40 to 50 per cent of government software purchases today could involve open source products, which could cut its overall IT spending by a quarter over a three-year lifecycle.But Marcus Robinson, technology partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that extra work required on open-source software, for example to make it meet security standards, could undermine the potential cost savings.He added that procurement habits would be hard to change: “There is some comfort at having a major name behind a big system.”Mr Robinson said that more open source would not solve the problems in large public-sector projects. “The fundamentals of why these things go wrong are lack of skills around how systems are specified … project discipline and change control,” he said. “With the big monolithic developments that governments do, it’s difficult to imagine open source having much of an impact.”
728;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-02-03T11:47:04Z;Thomson Reuters launches messaging for grown ups;;Messaging for grown upsInstant messaging is not just for teenagers. Thomson Reuters, the financial information giant, has launched Reuters Messaging Interchange to interconnect its own Reuters Messaging service, used predominantly by financial instructions, with enterprise IM offerings from Cisco, IBM and Microsoft. The aim is to make it easier to connect IM users to counterparts and customers in other organisations even if they use rival systems.IBM’s green SnowIBM jumps aboard the green IT bandwagon with its Supply Chain Network Optimisation Workbench. The tool, dubbed Snow for short, helps reduce the total environmental impact of a product by analysing alternatives in areas such as materials, sourcing, production, warehousing and transportation. Snow was developed by IBM’s China research labs and an early customer is Chinese shipping firm Cosco, which used Snow to reduce the number of distribution centres and so cut CO2 emissions.SugarCRM gets supportiveSugarCRM has improved its online customer relationship management service by integrating support for two online contact information databases, Zoominfo and Crunchbase – the latter lists mostly tech start-ups. Using web services, SugarCRM connects to either database and fetches details of a new contact or sales prospect. The new release also offers better support for mobile devices.Transaction processing for the modern ageOracle has unveiled a new release of Tuxedo, the popular transaction processing program. To create Tuxedo 10g R3, Oracle has combined its own middleware with technologies inherited from last year’s acquisition of BEA Systems, the original owner of Tuxedo. Transaction processing has traditionally been the preserve of mainframes but Oracle is now promoting Tuxedo as a more modern, open alternative for heavy-duty transaction-based applications.Servers on standbyFujitsu Siemens claims its FlexFrame for Oracle RE offering is a more cost-effective option for large Oracle users than traditional server clustering. With FlexFrame, a spare server is always on standby ready to take over should an operational server go offline unexpectedly. The Linux-based system uses Fujitsu Siemens blade servers and rack servers and comes pre-configured to customer requirements. Prices start at €80,000 without Oracle licenses and storage.Low-hassle hardwareDell and Cisco have teamed up in a bid to reduce the hassles of provisioning data centres with hardware from different vendors. The agreement focuses on Cisco’s new Nexus 5020 data centre switches, which Dell will add to its server and storage hardware. These combined solutions can then be used consolidate the separate networks traditionally used to link users, storage and servers into a single high-speed 10 gigabit Ethernet “fabric”.Web-based print services from HPNeed a professional printing job and need it fast? Hewlett Packard’s web-based MarketSplash service aims to help small businesses produce business cards, stationery and even website logos. A range of templates make designing easy even for those who do not know the difference between a pica and a pixel. In the US, the finished print job can be picked at your nearest Staples store.E-verifying needs commitmentMore compliance headaches for IT managers. The US government’s new E-Verify online employment verification system will likely become mandatory for federal contractors this year. The Department of Homeland Security wants to encourage the use of web services to access the system but warns that developing new software will require ”a large commitment”. The deadline has already been pushed back to May and may slip further as E-Verify is being challenged as unconstitutional.
729;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-01-29T20:23:15Z;Europe’s high-tech sector suffering from midlife crisis;;"We knew it was coming to Europe, and that it was just a matter of time. Nonetheless, when the tidal wave of industrial job cuts finally hit the high-technology industry this week it was still something of a shock.No one has been surprised about the dire state of affairs in the automotive sector, where overcapacity has long been a problem in Europe. But, secretly perhaps many had hoped that Europe’s high-tech champions SAP, the German business management software group, and STMicroelectronics, the Franco-Italian chipmaker, might be able to hold out just a little longer.After all, SAP is Germany’s shining example of a home-grown Silicon Valley-style success, the third-biggest software group in the world after Microsoft and Oracle. It even went on a hiring spree last year and was voted the country’s best employer in 2006.As for STMicro, it may have struggled against the weak dollar last year, but the continent’s biggest chipmaker has been putting its house in order and still carried the hope that Europe could sustain a powerful player at the very frontier of high-tech industries.These illusions were dashed on Wednesday with news that each would slash jobs and reduce costs; SAP is set for the first cuts in its 30-odd year history in spite of a relatively good performance in 2008. STMicro was equally shocking in its gloomy forecast that its market would tumble by at least 25 per cent this year.Their announcement of a total 7,500 job cuts followed the descent into bankruptcy last week of Qimonda, the German memory chipmaker ranked fourth in the world.To say that these job-cut programmes are the consequences of the dramatic slowdown in investment and spending around the globe may not come as any great insight. But looking at the causes of the cuts a little more closely suggests there may be much more at stake. The real question is whether what were once growth markets, with room for everyone, are today mature industries where the rules are very different.Take SAP for example. No longer can it rely solely on market growth to keep the wheels turning. Now it has to think about boring things such as how to keep margins going in slow growth markets at a time when price competition is mounting and the costs of innovation are high.Software may not yet be as commoditised as semiconductors or memory chips, but it is clearly on its way. And while the likes of SAP and STMicro may still be European champions, the question must be: just how much longer can they hold on to their titles when new competitors are selling more cheaply and while they remain much smaller than their next biggest rivals.Scale will matter in mature markets and, after the job cuts, it may be that these Continental champions will have to think about finding new allies if they want to stay in the game.Thomson’s image problemSpeaking of high-tech markets, there can be no better example of how far the mighty can tumble than Thomson, the French media services group. Once a proud symbol of innovation in image technology, Thomson this week looked dangerously vulnerable unless creditors agree to the latest restructuring plan.With debt at a gross €2.9bn ($3.8bn), the group will be in breach of its banking covenants, says Frédéric Rose, chief executive. To tempt his bankers, Mr Rose plans to sell non-core businesses accounting for €1bn in sales. The question is whether he can find anyone to buy them, and whether what is left – providing image services to film studios and broadcasters – can make any money.To be fair to Mr Rose, he has his back against the wall. He has to convince bankers there is a new, sustainable life for Thomson if he wants to resolve the immediate crisis. But the reality is that any plan may now be too late. The group has no more financial flexibility, having drawn down the last of its credit lines in the past few months. Buyers will be scarce and Thomson’s ability to pay down debt looks pretty slim.The only real decision may be the one that the French government failed to take many years ago, when it began breaking up the old state-owned Thomson conglomerate to create a raft of other industrial groups from Thales to STMicro. Instead of leaving a consumer electronics company – one that has struggled to find a new life as a media services group – Paris might have been better to continue parcelling Thomson out.But it may not be too late. There remain some decent cash cows in the company today – the lucrative licensing and patents business, for example, generating a few hundred million a year.There are some who suggest this business would be better used to bolster the struggling Alcatel-Lucent. And France Telecom would have an interest in finding a safe home for Thomson’s set-top box business, as one of its main customers.european.view@ft.com"
730;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-01-28T16:18:04Z;Big boats’ battle of the Pacific;;"Big boat match racing returns this weekend when TeamOrigin, the British challenger for the beleaguered America’s Cup, is one of 10 teams competing in the southern hemisphere in the inaugural Louis Vuitton Pacific Series.The British team led by Sir Keith Mills will on Friday have its first opportunity to go head to head with a full fleet of America’s Cup challengers while arrangements for the running of the 33rd America’s Cup remain held up in the American Supreme Court. A series of legal wrangles, including an attempt by Larry Ellison’s BMW-Oracle to supplant the Swiss holder Alinghi’s choice as Challenger of Record, the Club Nautico Espanol de Vela, and a continuing row between Louis Vuitton and America’s Cup Management has stalled the event worldwide.The British boat’s crew will include Olympic gold medallist Ben Ainslie as skipper and helmsman and Iain Percy as tactician. Volvo Ocean Race star Mike Sanderson is team director.This will be the team’s second regatta in version 5 America’s Cup racing boats, having already competed in the CNEV regatta in Valencia, Spain, last November.Ben Ainslie, said: “Given the delays we have experienced in America’s Cup matters during 2007 and 2008, it will be very refreshing to get out on the water and race again. It’s good to see so many teams active and ready to compete, and such a great mix of existing and new teams together, which bodes well for the future of America’s Cup racing. For TeamOrigin, it will be a chance to get our sailors together and race against some top teams which I am very much looking forward to.”All 10 teams will use boats loaned for the regatta from Team New Zealand and BMW-Oracle Racing to keep costs down.TeamOrigin will battle it out off Auckland, New Zealand, in a series of round robin races over five days against four other America’s Cup challengers – Switzerland’s Alinghi, the America’s Cup’s defender, Greek Challenge, Team Shosholoza from South Africa and Italians Luna Rossa – in Pool B of the competition. Pool A sees Emirates Team New Zealand, the Louis Vuitton Cup holders, Pataugas K-Challenge from France, BMW-Oracle Racing from the US and China Team locked in competition.

732;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2009-01-08T20:12:34Z;High-profile clients consider alternatives;;Some of Satyam Computer Services clients are considering shifting back-office operations to other companies to avoid any service disruptions in the wake of the scandal that engulfed the company this week.Clients on Thursday generally praised the services offered by the Indian information technology and software outsourcer. But the confession by B. Ramalinga Raju, the group’s founder, that he had falsified accounts for “several years” shocked the hundreds of blue-chip companies, which include Unilever, Cisco and GE, that entrusted their data to Satyam.“Satyam clients will naturally be concerned, and many will be forced to review contracts and talk to other suppliers …about potentially taking over work from Satyam,” said John C McCarthy, principal analyst at Forrester Research.Nestlé, one of Satyam’s clients, told the Financial Times it had been guaranteed by Satyam that its service would continue as normal, but the group admitted that it was exploring other options to avoid any problems in the future.Fifa, the governing body of world football, including the 2010 World Cup in South Africa of which Satyam is the official IT provider, told the FT that it was monitoring the situation and would react to any developments.Qantas, the Australian airline, which has five years remaining on a seven-year contract with Satyam, said it was monitoring the situation and would do so daily until the situation was resolved.Several Satyam clients have started seeking advice from IT consultants to make sure their interests are protected during the outsourcer’s crisis.Egidio Zarrella, partner and IT adviser at KPMG, said that many of his clients had sought his advice as they were unclear on whether Satyam would survive or be put into administration. “Companies using Satyam for major [back-office] projects are starting to be very nervous, because it might not be easy to end a contract and move elsewhere . . . We are telling our clients not to panic, to protect themselves, look at their positions and hope that Satyam will survive.”Oracle, the US software company, was one of the few to offer open support to Satyam on Thursday.In a letter to Ram Mynampati, Satyam’s new chief executive, Husam Dajannew, Oracle’s vice-president, said: “You and the entire Satyam team can count on us to assist [you] in every way we can to help Satyam go through the difficult time and rebuild confidence.”However, most analysts argued such support would not be sufficient to keep Satyam alive if many foreign investors spurned the group.
733;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-12-31T18:56:14Z;Two executives depart in Dell restructuring;;Two of the top executives brought in last year by Michael Dell to try to breathe new life into the PC maker he founded are to leave as part of a broader global reorganisation, the company said on Wednesday.Mike Cannon, president of global operations and a former chief executive of Solectron, and Mark Jarvis, chief marketing officer and a former head of marketing at Oracle, were key members of the new management group that Mr Dell put in place after he returned as chief executive early last year.Their departures, and the latest reorganisation, are a sign that Mr Dell’s initial efforts to reverse his company’s slide had not worked, according to industry analysts.“They spent a lot of money bringing in this new talent and got precious little for it,” said Roger Kay, a veteran PC industry analyst. The latest changes will signal the official end of the “honeymoon period” that Mr Dell was granted after he took back the CEO title, he added.Dell itself characterised the departures as amicable, and said they were tied to a broader reorganisation which was designed to bring a stronger global focus to its business.As part of the moves, the company said it would scrap its regional organisation and instead split its business into global operations focused on different customer groups. In addition to the existing global consumer group, that will lead to the creation of new divisions for large enterprises, public sector customers and small and medium businesses. The company said the changes would bring “faster innovation and greater responsiveness”.Mr Dell’s first push to revive the company involved an attempt to broaden its reach with new products aimed at consumers and wider distribution through retailers, diluting its traditional focus on selling direct to corporate customers. He also tried to put a new emphasis on operational efficiency and productivity, areas in which Dell had traditionally led the industry but where it had lost its edge.Those changes have failed to reverse the company’s deeper problems, which stem from fundamental shifts in the PC market and a failure to extend the benefits of its once highly-focused business model as it has become much bigger and moved into new markets, said Mr Kay.The success of some of Mr Dell’s early moves since his return have been demonstrated by the return to profitability of all of the company’s businesses, and by the positive reactions to many of the new consumer products it has brought out, a company spokesman said.An expansion in the company’s profit margins in the latest quarter, in the face of tough market conditions, was taken on Wall Street as a sign that Mr Dell had been able to get a firm grip on the company’s operations.However, the company also suffered a 3 per cent fall in revenues, compared with expectations of growth of 7 per cent, as it lost further ground to market leader Hewlett-Packard. The 10 per cent growth in PC sales reported by HP in its most recent quarter came with only a small slip in profit margins.Mr Dell has said that Dell’s reliance for much of its revenue on direct sales to customers – rather than through retailers or others partners – had given the company an advantage in fast-changing market conditions. But traffic to Dell’s website during the first three weeks of December, the heart of the holiday shopping season, was down by 17 per cent compared with last year, according to data from comScore, which tracks online retailers. By contrast, arch-rival Hewlett-Packard saw its traffic increase by 28 per cent.Shares of Dell were up 1.5 per cent at $10.39 in afternoon trading on Wednesday. Dell’s share price is off by nearly 60 per cent on the year.
734;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Unfounded panics and unexpected disasters;;"In April 1961, the philosopher Bertrand Russell told a meeting of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament that if the great powers did not change their policies, “it is in the highest degree improbable that any of you here present will be alive 10 years hence”.At the same meeting, Russell quoted an article by C.P. Snow in which the writer and scientist was similarly gloomy about humankind seeing out the decade: “Within at the most 10 years, some of these bombs are going off. I am saying this as responsibly as I can. That is a certainty.”Nuclear bombs could still go off in the next 10 years, or indeed next year. Some of the countries that have them, or seem set on acquiring them, are scarier than those that had them then. But, 47 years after Russell’s doom-mongering, we are still here.Our computers are still working too. Nine years ago, we at the Financial Times were ordered to keep our mobile phones on throughout the new year festivities in case we needed to report on power stations shutting down, cashpoint machines refusing to dispense money or aircraft falling out of the sky.Do you remember Y2K, the millennium bomb? It was supposed to bring the world to a halt because computers could not cope with their internal calendars turning from “99” into “00”. What was that all about? Was Y2K a scam perpetrated by the information technology and consulting industries, who made a fortune out of it? A genuine danger that governments and companies averted through assiduous action? (I remember an airline office where even the radiator had a “Y2K compliant” sticker on it.) Or was it just mass corporate and official hysteria?I suspect it was mainly the last. Perhaps a generation from now, climate change will be seen in the same light, or perhaps not. Not everything we panic about is baseless.But it is striking how often the disaster that gets us is the one we were not expecting.There were people who worried that subprime lending, securitisation and financial complexity would end in disaster, but there were not many of them – and no one listened.When disaster strikes, it often turns out that someone had predicted it. Anyone keeping an eye on US flight schools could have forecast that something like the September 11 2001 attacks was about to happen. Someone actually did – a Federal Bureau of Investigation supervisor in Minneapolis who, told to stop fretting, said he was “trying to keep someone from taking a plane and crashing into the World Trade Center”.In hindsight, the path to disaster seems clear, and the lone voices vindicated – although rarely thanked. People do not like being reminded how wrong they were.That is when the worst happens. Often it does not and the lone voices are scorned and forgotten. Or, as with Y2K, the worst does not happen even though nearly everyone warned it would.A desire to predict the future is an ancient human trait, but we are not very good at it. The Oracle at Delphi was vague for a reason.Why are we not good at it? First, because the world is too complicated for us to account for every eventuality. Second, because, being social beings, we tend to mirror those around us. Dissidents have few friends.Third, because, being uncertain, we rely on those who we think know best. In ancient times, those were interpreters of portents. These days, it tends to be economists, academics and celebrities. If all these clever people believe something, who are we to gainsay them? Bernard Madoff knew what he was doing when he persuaded the famous to entrust him with their money.Fourth, we like stories. We adopt narratives that explain the world and cling to those stories even when the facts suggest they may be wrong. Only when confronted with collapse do we begin to doubt them.Some communists abandoned the cause when Khruschev denounced Stalin; others over the crushing of Hungary or Czechoslovakia. Even when it was obvious that their god had failed, some hung on until the grim end. But at least when the Berlin Wall came down, there was a better story – of freedom and capitalism – waiting on the other side.The capitalist story itself became tattered this year, but I expect we will stick to it in one amended form or another, because this time there is not a better one waiting.But the next chapter is going to be fascinating. US interest rates down to zero, or pretty close. Much of the banking system nationalised. A charismatic president in the White House.What happens next? I do not know. Nor do you. Desperate though we are to find out, we should be grown-up enough to admit there is no one to tell us. It makes life hard, but what would we be otherwise? Curiosity about what happens next is an essential part of the joy and anguish of being human.Send your comments to michael.skapinker@ft.com"
735;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-12-19T22:18:40Z;Wall St gets a lift from auto industry plan;;Apparently minimal movements for Wall Street stocks masked another wild week, capped on Friday with the long-awaited rescue of the US car industry.General Motors soared 22.7 per cent to $4.49 on Washington’s move to grant the industry a temporary lifeline under the Troubled Assets Relief Program. Gains for Ford, which had said it did not require cash immediately, were more modest. It finished up 3.9 per cent to $2.95.Yet initial euphoria over the move faded later in the session and the benchmark S&P 500 index closed just 0.3 per cent higher at 887.88 having drifted between positive and negative territory throughout the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.3 per cent lower at 8,579.11.The technology sector was among the better-performing on Friday, helped by well-received results from Oracle and Research in Motion, which leapt 7 per cent to $17.78 and 11.4 per cent to $42.83, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index closed 0.8 per cent higher at 1,564.32.For the last full trading week of the year, Friday’s move left the S&P up 0.9 per cent, its second consecutive weekly gain. The Dow ended the week 0.6 per cent lower, but the Nasdaq was 1.5 per cent firmer.The Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate cut and move to use unorthodox measures took the market at one point in the week to its highest closing level in more than a month.Bulls were also encouraged by upbeat readings of key technical gauges. During the week, the benchmark S&P 500 index surpassed its 50-day moving average for the first time since shortly after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.Furthermore, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 5.1 per cent to 44.93 over the five-day period, its lowest level since October.Energy stocks saw heavy selling pressure as the price of US crude oil sank 21.3 per cent. The sector shed 4.6 per cent over the week.Defensive stocks were snapped up amid further evidence of a deep recession. Healthcare and consumer staples were up 4.3 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively.Retailers also did well after Macy’s quashed fears over its ability to repay debt. It soared 24.9 per cent over the week to $10.62 on the back of plans to amend covenant terms on its credit facility, which sparked hopes that indebted peers may be able to do the same. However, heavy snow across the country pushed retailers 1.1 per cent lower overall on Friday amid fears the bad weather could hit demand in the last shopping weekend before Christmas. That pared the sector’s weekly gain to 2.6 per cent and held the wider market back on Friday.Financials were the strongest-performing sector, up 4.1 per cent overall and were among the main beneficiaries of the Fed’s move into uncharted waters.The sector was helped by results from Goldman Sachs, which soared 19.2 per cent over the week to $80.73 despite reporting its first quarterly loss for the first time since going public in 1999. The figures were no worse than the most bearish predictions.Rival Morgan Stanley stood 11.6 per cent higher at $15.45 even after the bank reported a fourth-quarter loss that was worse than feared. Traders were encouraged by the bank’s attempt to reduce its leveraged capital structure. Standard & Poor’s move to cut credit ratings on the two banks on Friday only slightly pared their weekly gains.Morgan and Goldman were among 12 institutions around the globe for which S&P cut its outlook or ratings. Among them, Citigroup lost 8.8 per cent for the week to $7.02 after S&P cut its rating. Earlier in the week, General Electric sparked a sell-off as S&P’s negative credit rating outlook led investors to question which other companies could be vulnerable. GE lost 3.6 per cent to $16.50 over the week.
736;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-12-19T01:40:37Z;Oracle continues to grow amid downturn;;Oracle withstood the worst effects of the economic downturn and the rising dollar in its latest quarter, reporting on Thursday a 6 per cent rise in revenues and 10 per cent advance in pro forma earnings per share for the period.The figures from the world’s second largest independent software company suggested that big, diversified technology concerns have continued to fare better than most in the face of weakening demand from corporate customers.The company also said it expects earnings per share of 31-33 cents, or 36 cents before the impact of the stronger dollar. Wall Street analysts have been projecting earnings of around 34 cents a share.As expected, Oracle’s sales of new software licenses suffered in the three months to the end of November as the economy slowed and the dollar jumped.The company had said in September that it expected to see growth of anywhere between 2-12 per cent in new software sales in the period, but in the event it reported a 3 per cent decline, to $1.63bn. Had it not been for the translation effects of the stronger dollar, license revenues would have grown by 5 per cent, the company said.The pressure on new sales was particularly evident in the applications software business, which Oracle has built largely through acquisitions in recent years to compete with German rival SAP. New applications sales fell 15 per cent from a year before, to $469m, though that was not as bad as some Wall Street forecasts. New database and middleware sales, on the other hand, climbed 4 per cent, to $1.16bn.Thanks to the steady, recurring maintenance revenues it receives from customers who have bought software in the past, Oracle was able to report overall revenue growth of 6 per cent for the quarter, to $5.6bn. Reported revenue growth would have reached 12 per cent had it not been for the strength of the dollar.Though tight control of costs, meanwhile, Oracle was able to cut its pro-forma operating expenses by 2 per cent in the quarter, lifting its operating profit margin by five percentage points, to 46 per cent.Net income on a pro-forma basis – the basis on which Wall Street judges the company, rose by 8 per cent to $1.61bn, or 34 cents a share, in line with analysts’ estimates. After taking into account all its costs, including stock option expenses and amortization of intangible assets, Oracle reported net income of $1.3bn, a 1 per cent fall from the year before.
737;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Europe faces paradox of cheap shares with need for cash;;Companies are facing a deep paradox over their share buy-back programmes.On the one hand, companies’ share prices are on average far cheaper than they have been for years, making buying their own stock an attractive way of propping up market value.But at the same time the dominant corporate mantra right now is: preserve cash at all costs, including stopping buy-backs.“Both are true. Cash is king but your shares are massively under value so you should buy now. Both are conflicting, so which prevails?” asks Feike Sijbesma, chief executive of DSM, the Dutch life sciences group.His answer – to slow down DSM’s programme – is the response that has been widely seen in the past six months in the US.But, surprisingly, the trend in the third quarter in Europe and the UK was for more buy-backs, not fewer.Citigroup analysts show that in Europe the return of capital – mostly buy-backs but also special dividends and redemption shares – increased in the three months until the end of September from €25.8bn ($32.3bn) in the second quarter to €29bn.That was below the level of the third quarter in 2007, but still one of the highest levels ever recorded.Adrian Cattley, European equities strategist at Citi, says European companies have more long-term buyback programmes, while UK groups have done them often around disposals.Both are expected to slow in the coming months. “If you are going to rein in your spending, the first thing to go is discretionary spending and that will mean buy-backs before dividends,” he says.Pierre-Jean Sivignon, chief financial officer of Philips, bears that out, saying the Dutch industrial conglomerate has slowed its own programme down in part because “cash is king”.Philips will complete its €5bn of buy-backs, but at a slower pace to allow it to take advantage of other opportunities, he says. “We are taking back the flexibility on completion. We could buy back, we could slow down, we could do something else like M&A possibilities.”Acquisition possibilities were also behind the decision by GlaxoSmithKline, the world’s second-largest drugmaker, to slow its buyback programme over the summer.Andrew Witty, chief executive, says he feels even better now about the decision after the financial crisis started to affect the real economy. “[The slowing of the programme] is to make sure that we have the financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities for investment in the business. That might for example include some bolt-on acquisitions,” he says.Not all companies are taking this tack, however. Some of the largest groups in Europe and the US are starting buy-back programmes or stepping up existing ones.Microsoft has announced a $40bn programme, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle $8bn each, and Nike and Abbott Laboratories $5bn each. In Europe, KPN, Telefónica and German builder Hochtief increased buy-back plans.Abbott said at the time that it was “a significant buying opportunity”.Ad Scheepbouwer, chief executive of KPN, the Dutch telecoms group whose shares are down 18 per cent this year, says: “Our financing is really well organised and if you look at the price of the shares …we should start as soon as we can.”Mr Cattley agrees, saying that Warren Buffett’s use of his own money to invest in General Electric and Goldman Sachs shows how long-term investors should act: “With the benefit of a very long-term horizon, companies should invest in equity, either their own or others.”Underlying all this is a feeling that the value of cash has increased, no matter what you spend it on.As Mr Sivignon at Philips says: “I think the value of €1 of cash is certainly more than it was six months ago.” That means cash-rich companies are in the luxurious position of deciding whether to buy back shares or snap up cheaper rivals.For those companies with a poor cash position, however, it is a time to cut investments and costs and look for disposals.As in the entire playing-out of the financial crisis, the fact that US companies are cutting buy-backs ahead of Europeans show how the effects from the credit crunch are being worked through faster in America. The market fell there first.As Mr Cattley says: “In the end it is to do with the animal spirits of managers. M&A peaks at the peak of the cycle and buy-backs are just another manifestation of that.”
738;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-11-11T22:45:37Z;Former Oracle executive moves to German rival SAP;;SAP has hired John Wookey, a former prominent executive from rival Oracle, in a senior role as it seeks to expand into internet-based applications for its core large corporate customers.The hire is unusual given the deep enmity that has developed between the German and US corporate software makers as changes in their strategies have put them on a collision course. The rivalry hit its nadir early last year when Oracle sued SAP for theft, claiming that a US unit of the German company had been stealing its software.As an executive vice-president at Oracle, Mr Wookey had held a key role in the US company’s efforts to integrate the string of application software companies it has acquired in recent years, including PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems.The effort, known as Project Fusion, was an ambitious attempt to put all of the applications on a single technological foundation.Those plans fell behind schedule, however, and Mr Wookey left Oracle in October last year, after reports that he had fallen out with Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive. Speaking at the time that he first took on the assignment, Mr Wookey had himself predicted that he was likely to pay with his job if he failed to meet Mr Ellison’s expectations.At SAP, where he will be an executive vice-president, Mr Wookey will be involved in developing product strategy for the online delivery of applications for large corporate customers. Though still small, that market is expected to become significant in the long term as more customers rely on applications and services delivered over the internet – something known as “cloud computing” – rather than on software running on their own computers.While the contracts of senior executives in Silicon Valley often include non-compete clauses to prevent them defecting to rivals, Mr Wookey was not bound by such an agreement, according to one person familiar with his situation.Such clauses also typically only last for a year after employment ends.
739;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-11-04T16:17:33Z;What’s new: Infor extends its menu;;Infor, the US enterprise software company, has launched new software-as-a-service offerings and a novel hybrid pricing model. Infor ERP SyteLine, its enterprise resource planning suite for discrete manufacturers, can now be hosted remotely by Infor for a monthly subscription of $149 a user.In addition, there is a hybrid “hosted licence” option for businesses that like the traditional licence model but do not have the resources to run SyteLine on-site. It costs $65 a month for each user. These pricing options are also offered on Infor Enterprise Asset Management and Infor Expense Management.Autonomy automationAutonomy, the search specialist, has unveiled Autonomy ControlPoint, a compliance solution for organisations running Microsoft Office SharePoint Server. It is designed to automate the cumbersome process of searching for documents stored in SharePoint and tagging them to comply with legal and regulatory standards. It can understand more than 1,000 file types.EDS expands CRM serviceAs contact centres proliferate, organisations may struggle to ensure a consistent customer experience across different business units, locations and product groups.EDS, the services giant now owned by HP, wants to relieve organisations of the hassles of dealing with multiple systems and providers, with an expanded CRM services offering that now includes multivendor management and home-based agents.Business Objects upgradeBusiness Objects, now owned by Germany’s SAP, has brought out a new release of its eponymous business intelligence software. A key selling point for BusinessObjects XI 3.1 is its better integration with data stored in the enterprise software applications of Oracle, SAP’s arch rival. Among other enhancements are native support for 64-bit architecture and new visualisation options such as scatter plots and box plots to help make sense of multidimensional data.Windows XP lives onMicrosoft has given the popular Windows XP operating system another six-month reprieve, until July 31 2009. Businesses that buy PCs factory-fitted with Vista Business or Ultimate can legally “downgrade” to XP before that date. Many businesses have been reluctant to use Vista, judging the improvements not worth the upheaval and compatibility issues. With Windows 7 looming, the latest reprieve means they can probably skip Vista altogether (see Mary Branscombe’s first impressions of Windows 7 at www.ft.com/digitalbusiness).
740;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Did IT work?: IT team challenged to stay in step with the business;;US medical equipment supplier PSS World Medical has an ambitious goal as a company: to grow at twice the rate of the market.The company already has an annual turnover of $2bn, more than 100 sites, 40 distribution centres and more than 1,000 sales representatives. PSS supplies two main sets of customers, office-based physicians and the elder care market. It is currently the largest supplier of medical materials to physicians in the US.But although global spending on healthcare is rising, in some areas costs are under pressure.According to Carl Duhnoski, PSS World Medical’s CIO, many customers are seeing their profits squeezed, as medical expenses rise and insurers and Medicare try to reduce the costs of claims.The challenge for the company is to maintain its top-line growth targets, while reducing the cost of medical supplies to its customers. This meant seeking efficiencies within PSS World Medical.“IT lets our sales reps spend more time with customers,” says Mr Duhnoski. “We were confident in our product line, but wanted to minimise the order taking and entry time, so reps could spend more time in front of doctors. The pressure was on IT to build an infrastructure that was robust, and allowed reps to spend less time on admin.”But the IT infrastructure had become more complex as the company had grown.PSS operates a large, distributed network across the US, connecting the sales offices and distribution centres to a hosted data centre, which runs an enterprise resource planning system from JD Edwards, based on Oracle databases, and a proprietary in-house salesforce automation tool. Oracle software is also used to supply business intelligence data.PSS World Medical had previously run its own data centre, but decided to move to a hosted option to deal with growth. The in-house facility was not as “solid” as a hosted option, says Mr Duhnoski. But centralising all applications put more stress on the network.According to Mr Duhnoski, application performance and network performance are linked – any glitch in either affects the ability of the business to generate revenues. As a result, the IT group wanted to bring in new tools to identity and fix problems before they affected the sales force or supply chain teams.“We are constantly being challenged by the business to stay in lockstep with them,” says Mr Duhnoski. “The tools we have now allow us to identify problems in such a vast network much more quickly.”The tool, NetQoS Performance Center, has shifted IT from problem solving to prevention. If engineers notice a degradation of a service, they can address it before it interrupts access to applications.The software has also broken down some of the silos in the IT department. Rather than network engineers and application support staff each looking at a problem from their own perspective, the NetQoS system provides a “single version of the truth”. “We have people working together in a way we never had before,” he admits.One incident illustrates how applications and networks can interact in ways that even seasoned IT professionals might not expect. “A group of financial analysts in the central purchasing group had complained about sporadic application performance for months,” Mr Duhnoski explains.“Using NetQoS products, we discovered a Microsoft Access database was filling up the pipe between the second and third floors of our offices. We could alleviate that pain immediately. If we had had NetQoS before, we would have been able to prevent this problem before it affected our users.”The work to introduce better network performance tools was funded as an infrastructure project by PSS World Medical’s IT department, rather than by the business lines.There are no formal metrics for measuring success, but Mr Duhnoski says benefits were quickly felt, both by the IT department and users.“It took two weeks to put in. You install it, put everything through it and it’s instant gratification,” he says. “Uptime has increased, through problems avoided, and resolution time has improved. I don’t know how I could live without it.”
741;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-11-04T16:17:32Z;Individuals: Choices limited for those with disability;;"The biggest challenge for most IT system buyers is picking the right one, at the right price.The choice is far more limited, however, if they or their employees have sight problems and rely on “screen reader” technology to scan the text of a web page or application interface and present it in audio format.Roger Wilson-Hinds, co-founder of Screenreader.net, a social enterprise that distributes the software that does this free of charge to blind and visually impaired people around the world, is blind himself. He relies on Thunder, the product his company distributes, in order to run his business.He says of his search for a customer relationship management system: “It was performed slowly, clumsily but with all good intentions – it’s how I do everything online.” With some CRM packages, he found fields on forms that were not labelled in a way that could be read out by Thunder; with others, pop-up screens such as the calendar could not be accessed.Eventually, Mr Wilson-Hinds got in touch with Salesforce.com, the software-as-a-service application provider, and discovered that its CRM software worked well with Thunder, which has been downloaded by more than 100,000 users worldwide to date.Unfortunately, the problems encountered by Mr Wilson-Hinds are not unusual, says Chris Rourke, managing director of User Vision, a company that helps organisations such as the BBC, the Student Loans Company, Tesco Finance and Scottish Widows to ensure their websites and applications are usable and accessible. “It’s all in the way code mark-up is handled, because screen readers depend on code being labelled in a way they can understand,” he explains.“Systems developed in-house, in particular, tend to present problems, because the code isn’t written with the need of all users in mind. If they’re based on widely available Microsoft or Oracle technologies, there’s a better chance that a screen-reader can scan them effectively, but there’s no guarantee because accessibility demands extra talent and ‘duty of care’ from a programmer,” he says.Common obstacles for screen readers include drop-down boxes, image boxes that don’t contain “alt text” describing what they contain and applications that open new browser windows.The problems are not confined to people with sight problems, says Mark Wilson, director of interactive design consultancy Wilson Fletcher. His company is working with the British Dyslexia Association (BDA) to put together best-practice examples of how organisations might design applications to cater to the needs of people with dyslexia.“Mind mapping” software from companies such as Mindjet can be a valuable work tool, says Peter Abrahams, a practice leader in usability and accessibility at Bloor Research, the analyst company.“People with dyslexia find mind-maps easier to understand and create than linear text, especially when they include colours and images. People with limited vision who can see the overall structure of the map, find the electronic mind-map easier to navigate than linear text, as they can pick up on the visual clues of colour, image and structure,” he explains."
742;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-10-28T19:32:30Z;Markets;;Where have all the buyers gone? As stock markets round the world are crushed by the big unwind, few investors seem willing to buy on the mother of all dips, not even the usual buyers of last resort.Insurance companies, as it turns out, were ahead of the game. The likes of Aviva and Aegon have been steadily reducing their equity exposure. They are presumably not filling their boots now. What of their customers, though? Aviva, reporting on Tuesday, had resilient sales in life and pensions and long-term savings. But it seems fair to wonder whether, in the short term, consumers will be more focused on keeping cash in hand as they worry more about jobs than equity exposure. As for retail investors, they have probably been shocked into paralysis by a second stock market wipe-out in 10 years. For the moment, it is also rational for them to hang on to cash. The returns may be minimal and falling, but as an asset class, it will not give them a heart-attack on a daily basis.Then there are asset managers. Hedge funds are cashed up, but unlikely to plunge in: redemptions and sinking performance could shrink the industry’s assets by 25 to 30 per cent in the second half of 2008, according to Morgan Stanley. Outflows from European equity mutual funds could exceed €100bn this year, according to Citigroup.Pension funds could feel tempted to rebalance portfolios since the stock market fall will have left them looking underweight in equities. But equally, their appetite for equity-type risk has also probably diminished. Sovereign wealth funds from Beijing to Kuwait have their own problems.That leaves governments – which are already doing their bit by buying into banks – and companies with strong balance sheets. Some, like the energy group BG, have launched takeovers. Others, such as Microsoft, Nike and Oracle, plan to buy back stock. But many more will prefer to hoard cash given how expensive debt raising has become.The cash is there, but it will remain sidelined until the shadow of systemic risk is gone. It feels like a long time passing.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here

But not for much longer. Hewlett-Packard’s ProLiant xw2x220c Blade Workstation takes the workstation out of the cubicle and hides it in the data centre. The aim is to deliver high performance at more affordable prices in fields such as financial services and computer-aided design.To access the blade workstation, HP has developed a thin client, the gt7725, with advanced graphics to support 24 or 30-inch monitors. The blade workstation costs $2,850 for each user blade, the gt7725 costs from $749.Risk firewallWith volatility in the capital markets hitting new peaks each day, Progress Software has unveiled a ”risk firewall” to protect traders from getting their fingers burnt. Just as a traditional firewall blocks suspect internet traffic, the risk firewall blocks trades that would exceed the firm’s market risk tolerance. The firewall is part of Progress’s Apama Capital Markets Framework, a set of ”building blocks” for financial firms that hope to gain an edge building their own trading applications.Dell’s Mini 12Dell has added a bigger brother to its Mini range of cheap and cheerful subnotebooks. Weighing in at 2.7lbs, the Inspiron Mini 12 features a 12-inch screen whereas its predecessor, the Mini 9, had a 9-inch screen. It comes with Windows Vista Basic, Windows XP or Ubuntu operating systems, 1GB of Ram, and a choice of 60GB or 80GB hard disk. The Mini 12 goes on sale first in Japan but should be available globally in time for Christmas.

The Nasdaq Composite index was 3 per cent lower at 1,505.90 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.4 per cent at 8,175.77.Energy stocks were the biggest laggard, under pressure from oil’s fall to a fresh low for the year, down 5.7 per cent overall. ExxonMobil and Chevron, which report results later in the week, lost 4.3 per cent to $66.09 and 3.4 per cent to $61.71, respectively.Among the industrials, Caterpillar lost 1.6 per cent to $32.78, after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “hold”.General Motors shed another 8.4 per cent to $5.45 after Moody’s downgraded its rating on the motor group.Meanwhile, reports emerged that the government was considering providing financial assistance in a possible merger between GM and Chrysler. Separate reports, however, suggested aid could be limited in a McCain administration.Technology came under pressure on reports that tech financing defaults rose sharply this year, down 2.5 per cent overall. IBM and Oracle fell 3 per cent to $79.66 and 2.7 per cent to $15.77, respectively.The market’s decline came as interest rate futures priced in total certainty that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, edged up 0.6 per cent, indicating continued signs of extreme distress.Elsewhere, Lowe’s fell 2 per cent to $16.85 after the diversified conglomerate’s third-quarter earnings slid into the red, hit by losses at its CNA insurance division, in which Lowe’s said it would inject $1.25bn.The market had clung on to positive territory for much of the day and rose as much as 1.9 per cent after figures showed an unexpected rise in sales of new single-family homes, which were lifted as prices hit a four-year low. Housebuilders were buoyed by the news but later retreated along with the wider market, down 3.3 per cent overall. Morgan Stanley said the housing market was helped briefly in September by the Treasury’s move to provide mortgage finance assistance.Elsewhere in property, CB Richard Ellis – hard hit in recent sessions – rose 4.7 per cent to $4.64 after William Blair upgraded its recommendation on the real estate services group to “outperform”.Among more institutions that accepted government cash under its banking recapitalisation programme, Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financia jumped 5 per cent to $8.47 and 11.3 per cent to $9.95, respectively, and were among the biggest winners in the S&P. The regional banking index was 1.6 per cent higher.Earlier in the session, sentiment was helped as further details emerged of the vast series of measures to help the banking sector. The Federal Reserve began buying the debt under its plan to shore up the commercial paper market.“We are starting to see the initial signs of a thaw [in credit markets], but it is going to take some time,” said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at The Hartford.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs lost 7.5 per cent to $92.88 after the Financial Times reported that its chief executive last month sought tie-up talks with Citigroup. Citi fell 3.4 per cent to $11.73.Telecoms was the only sector to find positive territory, up 1.6 per cent overall. It was helped by well received third-quarter results from Verizon Communications, which soared 10.1 per cent to $27.61.Analysts were divided as to how much attention investors were paying to company results amid unprecedented market volatility.Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients: “Emotions remain the primary driver of recent stock market performance, in our opinion. As a result, we believe fundamentals are being cast aside by investors.”
745;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Microsoft looks to cloud to open new windows;;After years of hesitation, Microsoft is finally ready to take a big leap into the world of internet-based computing.That, at least, has been the message for much of this year from senior executives, including chief executive Steve Ballmer.The wraps are set to be taken off at a conference that the company is throwing for software developers in Los Angeles that starts on Monday.Depending on what it has up its sleeve, Microsoft’s move could propel it into a new internet-based approach to computing that has become all the talk of the tech world.Known as “cloud computing”, this involves a greater centralisation of processing power and information storage in large networks of datacentres.Rather than relying on computing power from corporate servers or desktop PCs, applications and services created in this new “cloud” are delivered over the internet and often accessed through a simple web browser.If Microsoft fails to lay out a compelling plan for how it will adapt to this new world, however, it would add to a nagging concern among investors and customers that the company is falling behind in the biggest transition to hit information technology in years – and could further open the door to rivals.“The market is going to look for something big,” said Frank Gens, a technology analyst at IDC.“If they do it in dribs and drabs, if they come out with a half-hearted ‘cloud’ deployment, it will open the way for IBM, or for Amazon and Google.”The software company has already hinted at what it has up its sleeve.Mr Ballmer recently promised that next week will bring an “operating system that runs in the internet” – something he dubbed “Windows Cloud”.The clear message: having dominated the PC-era of computing, Microsoft believes it is now ready to move to a new arena.Microsoft’s attempt to reposition its core software reflects a broader change that is forcing all the big tech companies to rethink their approach.“Platform shifts like this come along every 15 or 20 years,” said Sean Poulley, vice-president of cloud services for IBM’s software division.Tech executives argue over how new this trend really is or how quickly it will take hold, but generally agree on its significance.In the consumer world, advertising-supported internet services like those offered by Google have already won a big following.Corporate IT departments, which account for the lion’s share of the tech business, have started to inch towards a similar approach.About 4 per cent of IT budgets are currently spent on the business applications, infrastructure software, servers and storage technologies that support cloud computing, according to IDC.But by 2012, with the share up to 9 per cent, spending on this new approach to technology will account for a quarter of the annual growth in technology spending, making it an important new market for the entire industry.Much of the attention around cloud computing so far has focused on services, such as Google’s online word-processing service or the corporate applications from Salesforce.com.Microsoft’s announcement next week, however, will shift the focus back to the guts of the technology behind this shift: the infrastructure of datacentres that supports it, and the software “operating system” that supports online services, in much the way that the current Windows PC operating system supports applications that run on a PC.The scramble to win a piece of this new market is in its early stages. “There will be a number of years when there will be a lot of competition and confusion,” said Nick Carr, author of The Big Switch, a recent book about the coming transition. “Over time, I think it will resolve to a small number of platforms.”Big IT suppliers like IBM on the one hand, and internet companies like Amazon have already dipped their toe in this water.As the technology industry’s pre-eminent “platform” company, Microsoft’s promised move has attracted considerable anticipation.The biggest question that has hung over Microsoft, and the one to which next week’s event may provide an answer: how far, and how fast, will the company push as it reorientates its business around the web?This is largely an economic decision.Microsoft’s current highly lucrative business relies on sales of PC and server software, mainly to business customers.If these customers turn away from that computing approach and instead buy services delivered from the “cloud”, often at low monthly subscription rates based on how much they use, it could undermine the company’s core business model, said Mr Gens.To compensate for that, Microsoft will have to run fast to create new markets for cloud-based services, for instance among small businesses and consumers, as well as in emerging markets, he added.
746;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-10-23T20:24:01Z;Amazon wins over sceptics about web services;;"Wall Street thought Jeff Bezos had his head in the clouds when he came up with the idea of Amazon’s becoming a utility that offered web services to other companies.In one sense, the financial analysts have been proved right. Amazon’s founder has made his company a trailblazer in the field now known as cloud computing.But when Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched in March 2006, it seemed to investors like a diversification too far for the online retailer. The hundreds of millions of dollars Amazon was spending to build up its infrastructure and hire engineers were hard to justify.Today, the move seems less contentious. Microsoft and Google are among the big companies following Amazon’s lead and it reported a 41 per cent year-on-year growth in third-quarter revenues this week to $107m from the non-retail services that include AWS.Adam Selipsky, vice-president for product management and developer relations at AWS, says the company had spent over a decade building a massively scalable infrastructure to support its own operation at Amazon.com. It felt it had the scale and expertise to offer this to those who did not want to focus on or did not have the means to build their own.“We’ve built a business around providing the heavy lifting for developers with our cloud computing platform,” he says.Storage was seen as a basic need and S3 – Simple Storage Service – was the initial service launched. More than 400,000 developers are now using S3, which stored 29bn objects – anything from an e-mail to a video file – at the end of
the third quarter, growing from 22bn the previous quarter.Amazon followed up in August 2006 by offering raw computing power for businesses to run processes. Both services are pay-as-you-go – companies are charged only for the capacity they use and no contracts are needed.Other services have followed, including billing and account management.Adoption of Amazon’s services began with smaller Web 2.0-type companies but larger corporations have joined the client list in the past year, including Oracle, Sun, the New York Times and Nasdaq."
747;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-10-21T20:59:11Z;Poor earnings reports unsettle Wall Street;;A glut of poor corporate earnings and warnings of reduced profitability next year overshadowed a further improvement in money markets and pushed US stocks lower.The S&P 500 closed down 3.1 per cent at 955.05 on what was nevertheless a relatively calm day following last week’s near-unprecedented volatility. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.1 per cent lower at 1,696.68, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5 per cent at 9,033.66.Downbeat figures from corporations in the industrial and technology as well as financial sectors demonstrated the toll that the credit crisis had already taken on profitability. Still, traders were more concerned by the generally downbeat mood among companies for the coming year.The technology sector was the biggest drag on the market, down 5.6 per cent overall. Texas Instruments fell 6.3 per cent to $16.85 after it disclosed worse-than-expected results after the bell on Monday.Sun Microsystems and Logitech sustained some of the heaviest losses, down 17.5 per cent to $4.77 and 15 per cent to $15.53, respectively, after updates indicated a downbeat outlook.Apple and Yahoolost 7.1 per cent to $91.49 and 6.1 per cent to $12.07 ahead of results due after the bell.Oracle was one of the few bright spots on plans for an $8bn share buyback but later fell back to stand 2.6 per cent lower at $17.69.A drop in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold profit, which lost 10.8 per cent at $32.74, also put downward pressure on materials, which stood 5.7 lower overall. AK Steel retreated 7.6 per cent to $13.96 after the group said prices would be down about 10 per cent towards the end of the year.DuPont lost 8 per cent to $33.28 after the chemicals company cut its full-year forecast.Lockheed Martin fell 9.7 per cent to $84.19 after the defence group reduced its guidance for next year on concerns of reduced military spending by the new administration.Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $38.87 after the manufacturer reiterated its 2008 forecast but predicted no rise in revenues next year.However, some in the market downplayed the significance of earnings and argued developments in credit markets would remain centre stage“Earnings are going to be some what meaningless [this quarter],” said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial, who added that some signs in the credit markets were relatively reassuring.The Federal Reserve yesterday launched a new facility to restore liquidity for money market mutual funds and rates for inter-bank lending eased further.The regional banking sector, which stood 0.7 per cent higher, overcame a slew of grim results and was lifted into positive territory by plans to join the government’s $250bn recapitalisation scheme.For example, Regions Financial gained 6.1 per cent to $11.29 even though its earnings from continuing operations fell 76 per cent in the third quarter missing analyst forecasts.On the downside, Western Union sank 17.8 per cent to $16.75 after the group warned undershot Wall Street expectations and warned it could no longer forecast long-term profits.American Express, after the closing bell on Monday, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings that nonetheless beat analyst forecasts. The shares rallied 8.4 per cent to $26.39 yesterday.Also bucking the downward trend, Pfizer was flat at $17.34 after the drug group’s results beat Wall Street’s expectations. 3M rose 4.4 per cent to $60.04, also on the back of well received figures.Energy stocks were also hit as crude fell on fears of a global recession. The sector overall stood 4.3 per cent lower.Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s cut the expected 2008 dividend payment for the S&P 500 from $28.85 to $28.05, the lowest growth rate since 2001.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s ”fear gauge”, rose 1.1 per cent. At 53.253, it continued to indicate heightened distress.The fresh market decline came as it emerged that investor confidence plummeted last month, according to State Street research.

Its Global Trade Services application is designed to help them comply with the myriad laws, tariffs and security measures that govern trade around the world.The biggest novelty is Automated Broker Interface certification, which lets importers file electronically with US customs authorities.Sun’s identity move
Sun Microsystems has unveiled an open source platform that takes identity management into the Web 2.0 age. The aim is to make it as easy for external users to access corporate IT systems using the single sign-on (SSO) concept as it is today for internal staff.Sun sells the commercial version of OpenSSO Enterprise but there is also a free version available via the OpenSSO project, which was set up by Sun three years ago to expand use of its Java-based SSO technologies.Dell’s tape alternative
Dell drives another nail in the coffin of tape back-up systems. Its PowerVault DL2000 is a rack-mounted device designed to automate the time-consuming chore of backing up data for small and medium-sized businesses and branch offices.Unlike the tape drives of yesteryear, the DL2000 uses disk drives and reduces back-up times by more than 50 per cent, Dell claims. It comes with either Symantec or CommVault back-up software and can handle a vast 144 terabytes of disk space.Lotus Notes on iPhone
Another week, another iPhone application. This time its IBM’s venerable Lotus Notes software that has embraced Apple’s trendy smartphone. Lotus iNotes Ultralite is a software download that lets iPhone users use Lotus Notes e-mail and view the calendar and contacts.It’s free for those who already have a Lotus Notes software licence and is also included with the latest release of Lotus Notes.Cognos brings visibility
Cognos, the business intelligence specialist now owned by IBM, has unveiled Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics for businesses running Oracle or JD Edwards enterprise software.This packaged BI application is designed to provide line-of-business managers with detailed information on their department’s financial performance. IBM has also updated the main Cognos 8 application to Version 4, whose highlights include a flash-based “dashboard”, and mobile and search capabilities.Lenovo ultraportable
The Thinkpad X200s is Lenovo’s latest entry in the crowded ultraportable notebook market. Featuring Intel’s new Centrino 2 with vPro technology, the X200s weighs 2.4lb, has a 12.1-inch widescreen and a solid-state drive is optionally available – an increasingly common feature of ultraportable PCs.There is also a tablet version, the X200, which weighs 3.5 lb. Prices start at $2,242 for the ThinkPad X200s notebook and $2,323 for the ThinkPad X200 tablet.NFC and Nokia
Near Field Communications is sometimes written off as a technology searching for a purpose. Could mobile payments be the “killer application” that stimulates widespread use of this short-range wireless technology?Nokia hopes so and it has teamed up with payments giant Visa in a bid to persuade banks to endorse NFC-equipped phones for contactless payments. Currently only a couple of Nokia models support NFC, the latest being the Nokia 6212 Classic."
749;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-10-07T08:50:42Z;What’s new: A cloudy future for the database cash- cow?;;"Does Oracle see a cloudy future for its cash-cow database business? With much fanfare, it has decided to let businesses use its database software and middleware in cloud computing environments, starting with Amazon’s EC2 infrastructure.The aim is to reassure users worried about the licence implications of using Oracle software in a cloud, where Oracle’s traditional policy of one licence for each CPU is difficult to apply.But there is no other sign of Oracle moving to more flexible, pay-as-you-go pricing, which many see as the main reason for using clouds. Oracle has often been criticised by users for restrictive licensing conditions.Oracle hardware
In another surprise announcement, Oracle has unveiled a hardware offering – possibly the first in the software giant’s 30-year history.The HP Oracle Database Machine is a high-performance system developed with Hewlett-Packard and designed for data warehouse applications.It comprises a grid of database and storage servers packaged in a rack and is claimed to deliver 10 times the performance of Oracle’s current data warehouse product.Desktop supercomputer
Seeing crisis as opportunity, Microsoft is pitching its new Windows HPC Server 2008 software at embattled Wall Street firms.High-performance computing has long been used by Wall Street for risk modelling. The severity of current market turbulence has caused more firms to look at using HPC for intraday and real-time risk analysis, Microsoft says.Cray, the supercomputing firm, has teamed up with the software giant to offer a desktop supercomputer, the Cray CX1, running HPC Server for $25,000.Beating the bugs
Bug-ridden software is expensive to fix once it goes into widespread use. Far better to catch the bugs at an early stage and IBM’s Rational AppScan Developer Edition aims to do just that.The program checks the source code of a web application for potential security weaknesses and can identify vulnerabilities once the code is compiled.It uses a patented string analysis technique to weed out “false positives” – apparent but not actual loopholes.Cisco collaboration
Collaboration software is not yet a two-horse race, argues Cisco. The networking giant unveiled a new suite of collaboration software to compete with IBM and Microsoft.As well as an update to Cisco Unified Communications software, this latest offering adds Cisco TelePresence Expert on Demand, which targets contact centres, and a new software-as-a-service platform, WebEx Connect.The latter supports web 2.0 features such as instant messaging and web meetings.Laptop power
Fed up with all those power supply “bricks” cluttering your office floor? Fujitsu Siemens claims to have produced one of the smallest desktop PCs with integrated power supply, doing away with the brick.The Esprimo C5730 uses the Ultra Small Form Factor standard and has a volume of 6.9 litres, 23 per cent less than its predecessors. It also uses half the energy of an equivalent two-year-old PC, says Fujitsu Siemens.Defensive blade
IBM has unveiled a blade server designed to reduce denial-of-service attacks and other security threats.The BladeCenter PN41 uses deep packet inspection technology from CloudShield to perform real-time analysis of network activity and divert malicious traffic before it clogs the server."
750;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-10-07T08:50:41Z;Mobility diary: It might just start with a virtual kiss;;Social networking sites such as MySpace, Facebook and Twitter are growing increasingly mobile and ABI Research is forecasting 140m users of mobile social networks by 2013.Inevitably, this mass-market juggernaut is also crowding into the mobile enterprise world.Enterprise-focused social networking sites, and companies that have built businesses on cloud computing models, where users can share documents and information in real time from any internet point, are working out their mobile strategies.This year, the enterprise social network LinkedIn launched a long-awaited mobile version of its site. And companies such as Salesforce.com and Google have continued to enhance access to their applications via mobile devices. In September, Google launched its own Android mobile phone, and Salesforce.com, which has been offering a mobile version of its CRM software since 2004, released an iPhone client to access the products.There are some complete newcomers joining the market, too. Within one week last month, a just-launched company called Yammer, and a group at an SAP developers’ event both offered unrelated enterprise-class versions of Twitter, the group instant messaging service.Yammer says that 50,000 users, from about 10,000 organisations, signed up for the service during the first two weeks it was in operation. Oracle also made a move, in September, into the enterprise-grade collaboration market, with a new platform called Beehive.Mobile technology has made it easier for business people to communicate, but anecdotal evidence suggests there is demand from business users for more flexible ways of staying in touch.Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm, Accel, reports that a friend of his who works in the Microsoft Live Server team says that the number one feature requested is a “Twitter-like” service built into the application.“I think there’s a lot of frustration among users because they go home and can communicate in different ways, but they don’t have that at work,” says David Sacks, Yammer chief executive.One area that might start to see activity, is that of enterprise applications running on consumer platforms, such as Facebook.Eitan Gelbaum, a vice president overseeing product marketing in advertising, commerce and entertainment at billing specialists, Amdocs, believes there could be an opportunity for developers to focus on applications for single tasks – in effect, widgets – that will run on an existing online framework, such as Facebook, or in the case of a mobile device, a carrier’s portal.“Developers can take the functions of typical Facebook applications, such as virtual kisses and pokes and develop them into enterprise applications,” says Mr Gelbaum. “I don’t think developers will create a full-blown CRM service like salesforce.com, but smaller lightweight applications like scheduling tools and appointment managers, or billing services, or even presence capabilities, could prove to be very popular.”Facebook currently has 15m mobile users, which is not many compared with the 100m plus that access it via PCs.Nevertheless, there are signs that a site such as Facebook could become a useful tool for business people on the move: the site already hosts dozens of third-party enterprise applications.Facebook usage also appears to be growing among “end users”: Jim Balsillie, co-chief executive of RIM, which makes the BlackBerry, recently noted that the Facebook application for BlackBerry devices has been downloaded more than 2.5m times, “the fastest take-up of any application we’ve ever had”.Developments such as these have their detractors. “The internet is still a bit like the Wild West,” says Adrian Burholt, chief executive of The Key Revolution, a cloud computing spin-off of Vodafone, which still has a controlling stake in the company. “If you use the internet to transport data, it needs to be managed, controlled and encrypted. But that is not what the likes of Facebook or others do today. A lot of applications on the web are just not trusted.”But the turmoil in the financial markets, may anyway curtail enterprise IT investment in areas such as mobile data services.Experimenting with services on bigger consumer platforms could be a good way for companies to dip their toes into the Web 2.0 water before investing in larger projects.
751;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;SAP: The cracks in IT demand start to appear;;It is only two and a half weeks since Oracle reported robust quarterly earnings – but of course, that was before the fear engendered by the financial collapse had had a chance to eat its way into the executive suites of its biggest customers. To judge from the news from SAP today, things have got a lot worse – and other tech companies will already be feeling the brunt of it as well.This is what Henning Kagerman, CEO, had to say about the latest quarter at SAP, which ended last Tuesday:The market developments of the past several weeks have been dramatic and worrying to many businesses. These concerns triggered a very sudden and unexpected drop in business activity at the end of the quarter.On what was already an extremely ugly day on Wall Street, Oracle’s shares are now down 10 per cent. Enterprise software companies in particular book a large proportion of their sales right at the end of the quarter, so the September credit market meltdown will hurt. After proving surprisingly resilient for much of this year to the weakening US and European economies, it looks like tech is about to take a hit.
752;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-10-02T08:15:09Z;GE’s fear of falling;;A hefty insurance premium can be a bitter pill to swallow, but it beats the alternative should disaster strike. Warren Buffett, who has greatly boosted his fortune over the decades by having a knack for which risks to underwrite and at what price, cut a deal with General Electric on Wednesday that would have seemed superfluous a week ago given the conglomerate’s supposed ready access to funds.The congratulatory language from both sides does not portray Mr Buffett’s investment as indemnifying GE, but that is the inescapable conclusion. The conglomerate was not in danger of imploding and said its nearly $90bn in commercial paper was manageable. The generous terms on offer suggests that it feared losing its coveted triple-A credit rating or spooking the market by drawing on its ample bank credit lines.Barring financial Armageddon, the $3bn preferred stock investment by the Oracle of Omaha should pay off handsomely. Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway receives a dividend of 10 per cent for at least three years at which time the stock can be called at a 10 per cent premium. He also has been given warrants exercisable at $22.25 at any time over five years for $3bn of GE common stock, over $3 less than Tuesday’s closing value. The option value of the warrants is equivalent to an extra $1.2bn.GE could have easily drawn on its bank facility, so it speaks to the turbulence in the financial markets that it would pay such a big premium for permanent capital. On top of this, it is raising $12bn in common equity and announced last week that it would suspend stock buybacks and freeze the dividend for the first time in 32 years. This should bolster GE’s balance sheet enough to retain the top credit rating, a key competitive edge. The steps also make it much less likely that Mr Buffett will lose money on his latest insurance venture.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
753;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Calm before the storm;;On a stretch of Amsterdam canal bordered by a housing estate, bemused residents walk their dogs and push buggies in the September sunshine as high-performance catamarans dart alongside working barges and tatty weekend motor boats. Children are feeding the ducks while some of the biggest names in sailing buzz by in their Extreme 40 catamarans.When fighting a strong breeze, these yachts are spectacular, displaying breathtaking acrobatics, stunning acceleration and crunching cartwheels. But light winds had reduced this finale of the iShares Extreme 40 Series, which involved sailing’s elite racing on lakes and seas before ending on Amsterdam’s canals last weekend, to park pond tactics. Despite the popping corks for team Alinghi, who emerged as the series winner, there was a feeling that for the Switzerland-based team the event was something of a sideshow, a necessary distraction ahead of a bigger prize – the 157-year-old America’s Cup, the oldest trophy in sport.While the big ocean races – the Vendée Globe and the Volvo Ocean Race – are ready for the off in a matter of weeks, the future of the America’s Cup, the showcase of world match racing, remains becalmed in the New York State court.Neither biotech tycoon Ernesto Bertarelli, Alinghi president and cup holder, nor Silicon Valley entrepreneur Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle and prospective challenger with his BMW Oracle team, have been prepared to give sufficient ground in their high-stakes legal dispute that is proving costly both on and off the water. Ellison’s side this week offered to drop its legal action if Alinghi agreed to a regular regatta and rules similar to those used for the 2007 cup but the Swiss have yet to respond.“Yes, it’s expensive,” says Bertarelli, who has commissioned a multi-hulled 90ft cup boat that may never sail in pursuit of the coveted trophy. BMW Oracle Racing has already launched the trimaran that Ellison wants to field in his challenge.A New York court is scheduled to hear Elllison’s appeal in the new year against the reinstatement on appeal of the Spanish Club Náutico Español de Vela as the rightful challenger of record for the 33rd America’s Cup.“This was my biggest fear when I first entered the contest. I’m a passionate sailor and I didn’t want the cup to fall into legal proceedings,” says Bertarelli. “There has been a tendency in the past to want to win the regatta on land rather than offshore.”The legal shenanigans that marred earlier America’s Cup challenges appeared to have been consigned to the past by the 2007 event. Single-hulled boats were the agreed design and teams raced for the right to be the challenger in a round-robin series called the Louis Vuitton Cup, staged off Valencia. Emirates Team New Zealand won this event and then raced holders Alinghi in the America’s Cup off the Spanish port, only for the Swiss team to triumph again. At last it seemed the event had a clear format that could become a cyclical fixture over three- or four-year intervals in the sailing calendar.But Ellison objected to what he believed was a manipulation of the rules that would give the defenders too great an advantage. The rules drawn up by the New York Yacht club were designed to give the challenger of record the right to choose the boat design while the defender could choose the venue.There is no doubt that Ellison has a point. The hastily formed Spanish CNEV club was created as a vehicle for a new protocol that would retain the round-robin series. It left Alinghi holding too many aces for Ellison’s liking.As court proceedings continued, on-the-water interest shifted to the iShares Cup for some of the most serious America’s Cup teams because it gave them an opportunity to hone their multi-hull skills. And in the case of the British-based contender and iShares Cup runner-up, Team Origin, the series provided an opportunity to keep the core team together and competing.If Bertarelli and Ellison are looking increasingly like squabbling sisters, the Cinderella of sailing’s longest running pantomime has to be Sir Keith Mills, the businessman who founded Team Origin.Sir Keith has been working hard behind the scenes to ensure that he and the other contenders will indeed go to the ball. “There are quiet discussions going on between the team principals in an attempt to resolve this impasse. I think we’re progressively optimistic that a resolution will be found in a month or two,” he says. The view is shared by Mike Sanderson, Team Origin director, who believes the warring parties will see sense and settle their differences out of court. “There’s too much to lose for those guys now. Do they really want to gamble on the ruling of that last court?”In reality, Alinghi are in the driving seat whatever the outcome. If they do not get to choose the competition boat, they have ensured they have a winning team in either multihull or single-hulled yachts. And picking the venue, a choice that would remain their prerogative, means they can focus on conditions that suit the team.Sir Keith believes a resolution of the dispute by December would allow challengers to begin competing next year, initially in the 2007 boats, for a final in 2011 after a restoration of the single-hull, round-robin format.But what of those two state-of-the-art, multimillion-dollar trimarans? “I’m sure some museum will be happy to take them off their hands,” says Sir Keith.
754;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-09-25T20:40:18Z;Wall Street rallies on bail-out hopes;;Mounting expectations that Congress would speedily pass the proposed $700bn financial sector bail-out bolstered US stocks on Thursday, outweighing a slew of downbeat news elsewhere.Markets brushed aside a profit warning from General Electric and a series of grim economic updates as Washington grew closer to finalising a deal.Financials, up 2.6 per cent, were among the biggest gainers on hopes that the plan would afford paralysed money markets much-needed relief.GE gained 4.4 per cent at $25.68 even after the world’s fourth-largest company cut its third-quarter and full-year earnings forecast and suspended a share buy-back.Market-wide gains also took in housebuilders in spite of data that showed detached family homes in August fell to their lowest level since January 1991. DR Horton and KB Home rallied 5.6 per cent to $13.92 and 4.1 per cent to $21.16, respectively.Other figures showed that the number of workers claiming unemployment benefits jumped last week, and a sharp fall in demand for durable goods. “Industry is in trouble,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients.Yet stocks extended early gains after Chris Dodd, chairman of the US Senate Banking Committee, said negotiators had reached “fundamental agreement” on the principles of the Wall Street bail-out.The S&P 500 closed up 2 per cent at 1,209.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8 per cent at 11,022.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.4 per cent at 2,186.57.Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment, said: “At the end of the day it was going to have to get done [but] was it going to be decorated like a fancy Christmas tree? That’s really where there was a lot of uncertainty, and how fast [it was passed] was also up in the air.”Still, reports that the government would receive an equity stake in companies involved in the bail-out put a lid on more spectacular gains.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 6.8 per cent, although at 32.80 it remained above the psychologically significant level of 30, a sign of distress.A report from Bespoke Investment Group said: “A prolonged Vix above 30 hasn’t happened too often since 1990, and it’s the first time it has happened since January 2003.”Escaping the upward momentum, Washington Mutual sank 25.2 per cent to $1.69 on reports that regulators are trying to quickly broker a deal for the embattled savings and loan institution.Capital One Financial fell another 5.1 per cent at $49.72. The credit card and banking group priced a public share offering at $49 a share.Discover Financial, another credit-card company, which spun off from Morgan Stanley, fell 2.6 per cent at $14.82. More customers were late with payments and its third-quarter net income fell 11 per cent.Meanwhile, in technology, Microsoft gained 3.5 per cent at $26.61 after an appeals court ruled in favour of the software group in its music patent battle against Alcatel-Lucent.The hardware and semiconductor sectors moved higher. The gains came in spite of Wachovia’s issuing a bearish outlook and downgrading its recommendation from “overweight” to “market weight”. The bank forecasts slower growth in personal computer sales.Dell, Intel and Hewlett-Packard gained 1.4 per cent at $16.93, lost 0.7 per cent to $18.57 and gained 2 per cent to $47.70, respectively.Oracle rose 2.6 per cent to $20.47 on reports the computer software group will enter the hardware market.In the consumer discretionary sector, Bed Bath & Beyond gained 4.8 per cent to $32.19 after net income matched analyst estimates. JC Penney inched up 0.1 per cent at $35.90 as Merrill Lynch downgraded its recommendation on the retailer.However, lodging stocks suffered after JPMorgan reduced its estimates on eight because of lower demand.Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Choice Hotels International and Orient-Express Hotels fell 2.3 per cent at $30.70, 3.3 per cent at $27.99 and 5 per cent at $29.75, respectively.
755;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-09-19T00:23:54Z;Strong dollar to bite into Oracle’s growth;;The rebound in the dollar is likely to take a big slice out of Oracle’s growth rate in the coming months, ending a period when currency effects greatly boosted its reported performance, the US software company forecast on Thursday.The warning, which also points to a wider currency impact that will dent the broader US technology sector, came as Oracle reported that its earnings had topped expectations in its latest quarter, thanks to its success in keeping a lid on operating costs.The company’s sales of new software licences also held up better than Wall Street had feared, adjusting for the currency effects.The news pushed Oracle’s shares 3.4 per cent higher to $18.75 on relief that its sales had not suffered in the face of weakening US and European economies and the financial market crisis.The dollar’s rise, if it holds, will wipe 3 percentage points from revenue growth in the current quarter, Oracle said.That contrasts with a 7 percentage point lift that it gained from currencies in the same period a year before.The sharp swing in currencies will push revenue growth down to 9-12 per cent in the quarter, Oracle said, though executives said that the depressing effect on the reported figures would not affect its market position.“It doesn’t impact our pricing or competitive position,” said Safra Catz, co-president, adding that the company did not adjust the list price of its software to reflect short-term currency moves.In one of the few dark clouds in its latest figures, Oracle’s applications software business registered a 12 per cent decline in new licence sales compared with a year before as sales in Europe dropped by 26 per cent in constant currencies.Ms Catz brushed off suggestions that the application business was struggling.She said that European application sales rose 78 per cent in the same period a year before and the decline this year reflected a difficult comparison with a very strong period in 2007.By contrast, Oracle’s core database and middleware business reported a 23 per cent licence fee jump, partly thanks to its acquisition of BEA Systems.For its latest quarter, for the three months to the end of August, Oracle’s revenues rose 18 per cent to $5.4bn.Operating profits jumped 25 per cent from a year before, while pro-forma earnings, excluding amortisation and option expenses, rose to 29 cents, two cents higher than Wall Street had expected.
756;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle earnings stress sector’s dollar woes;;When Oracle, the world’s second biggest software company, reports its latest earnings on Thursday, it will highlight an inconvenient truth for the US technology industry: the big lift the sector has had in recent years from the weakening US dollar is over, at least for now.In its fiscal year to the end of May, roughly a quarter of Oracle’s reported revenue growth came from foreign currency translation effects, as the falling dollar increased the value of its overseas sales. Given their strong position in large parts of the global technology market, many other US tech companies have seen similar lifts from their big overseas positions.Currency adjustments have contributed nearly half of the revenue growth at software makers Symantec and Autodesk in the first half of this year, according to an analysis by Citigroup.A bounce in the dollar since July, particularly against the euro, has put at least a temporary end to that benefit, just as tech companies are bracing for a downturn in demand due to the weakening economy.Adobe, another big software concern, said this week that, in its most recent quarter, foreign currency adjustments had actually depressed its reported revenue slightly compared with the preceding three months, the first time for several years currencies have not provided a tailwind.Since Wall Street generally looks at year-to-year growth rates rather than quarter-to-quarter, the full impact of the stronger dollar, if it holds, will not be felt until next year. However, the dollar bounce will also have an immediate impact in at least two ways.For fast-growing companies whose growth is judged on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the currency tailwind of recent quarters will turn into an immediate headwind. That is still the case with Google, at least when it comes to the “whisper number” that Wall Street uses each quarter to assess the company’s earnings, said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst at Collins Stewart.“It is significant for Google,” Mr Aggarwal added. “It is a trend reversal, after 10 quarters of positive impact.” Foreign currency earnings have helped to support Google’s growth rate as it has hit the inevitable slowdown that comes with reaching massive size.Revenue growth in the second quarter fell to 43 per cent from 63 per cent a year before, but would have slumped to 36 per cent had it not been for a weaker dollar.A second immediate effect will come as Wall Street analysts start to revise their earnings forecasts for next year to reflect the new exchange rates.

759;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-09-04T20:43:33Z;US stocks tumble on poor retail sales figures;;A battered financial sector led Wall Street into bear market territory on Thursday, as Bill Gross, manager of the bond fund Pimco, warned that a “financial tsunami” could ensue if the government failed to support markets.Credit-card groups were among the key casualties as fears grew of rising defaults. American Express fell 5.3 per cent to $38.75 after Lehman Brothers forecast net charge-offs – a measure of uncollectable debts – on its cards would reach to 8.5 per cent of loans by next year.Capital One Financial fell 5.1 per cent to $43.33 after the investment bank cut its price target from $57 to $46.The decline took in the biggest names in corporate America, such as Lehman Brothers, which dropped 10.5 per cent to $15.17 as investors worried about its ability to raise capital ahead of expected poor earnings and writedowns at the end of the month.Bank of America slipped 7.2 per cent to $30.60 as options traders placed bets it would lose almost a quarter of its value by late autumn.Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch dropped 7.5 per cent to $26.21 after reports suggested talks to sell bad loans to Korea Asset Management Corp faced a deadlock.The wider market slumped, falling for the fourth straight session after an unexpected jump in initial jobless claims and sluggish back-to-school retail sales revived concerns about the health of the economy.By the close in New York, each of the 10 industry groups were down more than 1 per cent. The S&P 500, down 3 per cent at 1,236.83, had its biggest one-day fall since early June.The Nasdaq Composite was down 3.2 per cent at 2,2259.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3 per cent lower at 11,188.23.“It’s definitely ugly, that’s for sure,” said Matt King, chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors.The market decline was wide-ranging and took in stocks seen as traditionally defensive. Wal-Mart was one of the only exceptions as down-trading consumers allowed the discounter to escape a retail decline.Same-store sales beat expectations, helping the shares hold steady at $59.78.The retail decline was led by TJX Companies, down 7.4 per cent at $34.07, Abercrombie & Fitch, which lost 6.8 per cent to $50.99, Limited Brands down 6.2 per cent to $20.70, and Nordstrom, down 4 per cent at $31.99.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said: “Back-to-school selling was sluggish [during] the first three weeks of August and picked up some toward the end of the month as consumers are shopping closer to need.”The downward momentum swamped news of improved productivity in the second quarter.Industrials and materials each fell more than 3 per cent. Terex, the maker of construction and mining equipment, was one of the biggest casualties, after cutting its sales and profits forecast for the year. The shares tumbled 19.7 per cent to $38.02.Caterpillar was another key laggard, down 5.6 per cent at $63.94.Steel stocks were shunned after Goldman Sachs issued a more bearish outlook on the sector in a wide-ranging sector note. It said: “A rising US dollar, ‘China fear’ and sharply falling scrap prices have shaken investor confidence in [the] sustainability of [the] steel cycle.”AK Steel shed 11.1 per cent to $40.84, Allegheny Technologies dipped 4.5 per cent to $44.18 and US Steel fell 5.1 per cent to $112.67.Technology stocks – which led Wall Street lower the previous day – endured another decline.Ciena dropped 24.9 per cent to $13.09 after the network equipment maker warned that fourth-quarter revenue would be lower than expected.Oracle fell 6 per cent to $19.93 after a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that its chief executive had failed to turn over evidence that may have proved relevant in a shareholder lawsuit against the company.Microsoft eased 2 per cent to $26.35 after saying it would cut the price of its Xbox 360 console, in the face of competition from Nintendo’s Wii and Sony’s PlayStation 3.Housebuilders were also among the casualties.Hovnanian Enterprises reported its eighth consecutive quarterly loss after nine years of gains, pushing the shares down 17.4 per cent to $6.40.
760;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-08-13T01:11:43Z;Apple wages 3G war for BlackBerry core;;When Apple launched its touch screen iPhone 3G at its flagship London store, there was the predictable queue of people, eager to own a device which is equal parts phone, MP3 player and wireless web browser. Among the Apple aficionados and tech geeks, three besuited men stood together, all thumbing their BlackBerrys. When asked why they were lining up for an iPhone before 8am, one held up his BlackBerry and said: “Because this is damn ugly.”His friend, a consultant, from PA Consulting, called his BlackBerry “clunky”, while another said the iPhone would make it easier for him to communicate with clients. All disliked the BlackBerry’s “Qwerty” keyboard and web browser.Apple has launched its new iPhone decisively into BlackBerry’s business market, by improving security, e-mail and allowing third-party software to run on its platform. But this is not a challenge Research in Motion (Rim), maker of BlackBerry, is going to take lightly. Its most consumer-friendly phone yet, the Bold, could launch next week, while a multimillion dollar marketing campaign, “Life on BlackBerry”, sees it make a more determined push beyond its corporate core.Both are chasing the scale required for making the competitive smartphone business pay, with the stakes raised after recent results disappointed investors. BlackBerry is dominant in the larger end of the corporate market, but is facing tough competition among smaller companies that use Microsoft’s mobile operating system, which can be cheaper. Apple has set a target of selling 10m iPhone 3G devices worldwide, which could be tough in a weakening consumer environment.Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura, said BlackBerry’s attempt to crack the consumer market has “not been particularly competitive”. Unassailable in its e-mail handling, other BlackBerry functions such as media playing have even lagged behind many Nokia or Sony Ericsson devices. “The Apple experience on their device is second to none,” said Mr Windsor. “Rim has a lot of work to do to catch up” in scaling up its manufacturing and distribution capability as well as design, he addedNokia’s senior vice-president of devices, Søren Petersen, has been scathing about BlackBerry’s consumer push. “Selling to women is about more than making it pink,” he told the FT in June, referring to a colourful edition of the BlackBerry Pearl, its device that’s most like a regular phone. But he also dismissed the iPhone’s security and business features as “not worthy of discussion”.New models could help BlackBerry’s consumer push. BlackBerry Bold has a high-resolution screen, improved camera and slicker design. Like the iPhone, it boasts both 3G and wi-fi connectivity, making it better for watching video and surfing the web.That could leave software as the battlefront between the two smartphone behemoths, an area where Andrew Brown, analyst at Strategy Analytics, thinks Nokia has failed to capitalise. “Apple is in a good position to slaughter the lot of them because they’ve kept it pretty simple and accessible.”BlackBerry users have thousands of downloadable applications to choose from – if they can find them. BlackBerry relies on third parties to distribute compatible software and its consumer offering extends little beyond a Facebook application. Developers are put off by its strict security requirements – critical for corporates.After only a few months, more than 1,700 iPhone applications – around a quarter of them free – can be downloaded direct to the handset or iTunes. Importantly for developers, Apple customers have shown themselves willing to pay for digital downloads. Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, has claimed Apple made $30m (£15m) from 60m downloads in the first month that the iPhone was available.Enterprise software companies, such as Salesforce.com and Oracle, are making some applications iPhone-ready. But reliability problems with Apple’s MobileMe service – an online e-mail, calendar and file-sharing service – hit its credibility, especially compared with BlackBerry’s service.A survey of nearly 600 office workers by Dave, a London-based creative business consultancy, found two- thirds trusted the BlackBerry over the iPhone, while more chose BlackBerry as a consumer tool than iPhone for business use.Nomura’s Mr Windsor concludes: “It would be easier for BlackBerry to go consumer than it will be for Apple to go corporate.”
761;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-07-29T16:32:19Z;SAP gains from belt-tightening US clients;;SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, said economic troubles were driving some US executives to speed up buying computer programmes that manage inventory or client relations as companies try to cut costs.As a result, the German group shook off a weak first quarter to report strong sales in April, May and June. It forecast that full-year profitability would hit the upper end of a range predicted this year.Good news from the boardroom came after bad news from a San Francisco courtroom, where rival Oracle late on Monday expanded theft allegations against SAP and its US subsidiary TomorrowNow, which services Oracle products.Henning Kagermann, SAP’s co-chief executive, declined to comment on charges that alleged wrongdoing went beyond TomorrowNow staff because SAP executives also had access to “inappropriate” material taken from Oracle servers.Mr Kagermann, who has claimed TomorrowNow was solely responsible for alleged misdeeds, said SAP would take “a thorough look” at material filed with a US federal court as part of a 16-month long suit.Investors appeared to take the new claims in their stride, preferring to cheer the German company’s latest figures. SAP stock was trading at €36.45 in mid-afternoon, up 7.4 per cent on the previous day’s close.Léo Apotheker, co-chief executive, said US clients had “moved past the hesitation” of the first quarter, when the credit crunch began to bite. “In some cases, the decisions have even been accelerated.”Tough economic conditions faced by customers could prove to be a “favourable environment” for SAP if it continued to convince companies that new software was “a strong value proposition,” said Mr Apotheker.Second-quarter sales of software and related services in the US hit €472m ($737m), 14 per cent more than the same period 2007. Sales between January and March had fallen 1 per cent, although the weak dollar also took its toll.Total sales of software and online services rose 21 per cent to €2.1bn – above the top end of analysts’ expectations – as sales in Europe and the Middle East rose 21 per cent to €1.1bn, and those in Asia 30 per cent to €288m.SAP reported a 9 per cent fall in net profit to €408m as US GAAP accounting rules forced writedowns after its first big takeover, that of French rival Business Objects late last year. Earnings per share fell 8 per cent to €0.34.The group said full-year sales-growth of software and services should hit the upper end of a 24-27 per cent range and the operating margin – ignoring one-off costs from the consolidation of Business Objects – should approach 29 per cent.
762;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-07-08T19:25:47Z;Beware VMware;;US software innovator under pressure from Microsoft dumps founder.The headline might sound tailor-made for Yahoo but Jerry Yang still has his job for now. Instead, fellow Silicon Valley resident Diane Greene has been pushed out of VMware, the software company she founded and took public with great fanfare in August. Back then, even as the rest of the world was starting to lose its nerve, VMware’s stock roared ahead, reaching a market capitalisation of $48bn. It is worth less than a third of that, its stock down 27 per cent at the news of Ms Greene’s ousting.Tellingly, despite that slump, the stock still trades on a multiple of 66 times 2008 earnings. VMware does have a compelling story, enjoying an estimated 80 per cent market share in virtualisation software – programs that allow servers to run more efficiently, enabling IT departments to reduce spending on hardware and even cut energy consumption. With only 5 per cent of servers “virtualised”, the global market is expected to continue growing rapidly.Unfortunately for VMware and its cheerleaders, fast-growing markets dominated by a single company tend to attract competitors. In June, Microsoft released a rival, cut-price product two months ahead of schedule. Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, once dismissed VMware’s competitive advantage, saying its core software was so simple his cat could write it.Mr Ellison is known for his blunt remarks. But the sudden departure of the widely respected Ms Greene and her replacement as chief executive with a Microsoft veteran, coupled with another cut to guidance, suggest that competitive pressure and, possibly, economic weakness are taking their toll. VMware’s reticence does not help matters, especially as this is not the first sudden drop in the stock’s short life. With a further update expected alongside quarterly earnings on July 22, investors should brace for more disappointment.Post and read comments on this Lex
763;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-07-08T18:30:22Z;VMware shares dive after founder ousted;;VMware, one of the world’s fastest-growing software companies, on Tuesday sacked Diane Greene, its founder and chief executive.The company also cut its sales forecast, warning that full-year revenues were likely to fall “modestly below” previous predictions of 50 per cent sales growth.Shares in VMware fell nearly 25 per cent after the announcement, contributing to a slide of almost 70 per cent since October.Ms Greene’s dismissal marks the end of an era for VMware, which last year passed Oracle to become the youngest software maker to reach $1bn in annual sales.It comes as VMware is facing increased competition from industry heavyweights such as Microsoft and Oracle in the market for “virtualisation” software.Virtualisation greatly increases the efficiency of big computer systems by allowing companies to run more than one task on a single computer server.VMware said Ms Greene had been replaced by Paul Maritz, a former Microsoft executive who managed the development of Windows 95 and other software releases before he retired from the company in 2000.“Paul is a leader in the software industry,” said Joe Tucci, VMware’s chairman and chief executive of EMC, the data storage company that controls 85 per cent of VMware’s shares. “He has decades of experience building one of the great franchises in software history.”Mr Maritz joined EMC in February after it bought Pi, a software company he founded in 2003.Mr Tucci said VMware’s board had voted to replace Ms Greene after it failed to convince her to hand over CEO duties to someone with more experience running big companies.“It’s not the way we wanted to do it,” Mr Tucci said. “We were very hopeful that Diane would take a very significant role in the company.”Ms Greene founded VMware in 1998 with her husband, Mendel Rosenblum, a professor of computer science at Stanford University. During her years as CEO, she established a reputation as an unconventional manager with a strong independent streak.EMC bought VMware for $635m in 2004, floating 10 per cent of the company last year. It has more than doubled in three months, turning it into the world’s fourth-biggest software company by market capitalisation.But the company’s stock price has since fallen sharply amid concerns that it may not be able to sustain its meteoric growth rate.The company’s sales are expected to approach $2bn this year. VMware controls 80 per cent of the market for virtualisation software.Shares of VMware fell 24.2 per cent on Tuesday to $40.31. EMC’s shares lost 10.1 per cent to $13.51.
764;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Adding IT to the SME toolkit;;"The past few years have seen a marked change in the marketing of software and services. Vendors such as SAP and Oracle, which had previously confined their attention to the giants of the business world, have begun to court small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a cornucopia of new products.“So many companies that have traditionally focused on large enterprises are now going into the SME market. It is amazing. Everything is about SMEs,” says Joslyn Faust, principal analyst specialising in the SME market for Gartner, the consultancy.But, she warns, it is not necessarily to everyone’s benefit. “Many of these vendors do not understand that it is a totally different business model. Service, support and pricing are all very different. The products need to be very simple and they all need to work together. SMEs are worried that the IT they are offered will prove to be too complicated, too costly or that the vendor will consider them too small for proper support,” she says.Buying consumer-grade technology is one answer for very small firms.Eilert Hanoa, chief executive of Mamut, a European provider of integrated software and internet services for SMEs, shares Ms Faust’s concerns: “There is a misconception within the SME sector that technology is expensive and that it is a luxury a small business cannot afford. Most SMEs have few people to turn to for technology advice and this has led to an abundance of fear, uncertainty and doubt when buying IT.“This sorry state of affairs has been compounded, and in some cases encouraged, by an IT sector that has done the SME sector a disservice by downsizing enterprise applications for the SME market without addressing their need for less complexity.”SAP, however, one of the world’s largest software groups, has seen a significant change in its mix of customers over the past 10 to 20 years. At one time it was a provider of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software only to large corporates, it now estimates that 70 per cent of its customers – about 35,000 globally – are SMEs.Simon Etherington, head of the SME division for SAP in the UK, says the sector is covered by a three-product family: Business One, an out-of-the-box business management system for companies with less than £30m-£40m in turnover; Business by Design for larger groups; and Business-all-in-One for vertical industries. These products are generally marketed to customers via channel partners who can offer technical help and business advice.Are there any companies too small for an SAP offering? “If there are, we haven’t found them yet,” says Mr Etherington.But he warns that IT is no magic bullet. The customer, he says, must have a clear vision of what it wants to do, where it wants to go and how it thinks IT can support its objectives.He says that SMEs may have an advantage because they see their business processes – essentially what the business does – more clearly than bigger enterprises. And any IT investment must be treated as a business project rather than an IT initiative, he counsels.Dawn Baker, head of marketing for the small business division of Sage, the UK accounting software group, concurs: “Small businesses have to make monthly decisions based on cash flow. So an owner may be faced with the dilemma of whether to take £100 ($197) extra as a bonus or use it to buy a piece of software.“Another option, especially for businesses at the upper end of the SME sector is to look into hosted versus on-premises software solutions, as this might provide a higher degree of flexibility with less up-front investment. Either way, any investment in IT should be linked to a business plan.”Big-ticket technologies such as ERP are not alone in being reconfigured to fit a smaller customer. Virtualisation – running a number of operating systems and application packages on the same server – is becoming increasingly attractive to small companies, not simply because of savings on the cost of servers but because of disaster recovery and business continuity.Martin Niemer of VMware, a leading vendor of virtualisation software, says that companies with only four or five servers and fewer than a dozen staff are virtualising their servers as a protection against downtime, “which could cost them a huge amount of money”.Typically, VMware consolidates applications from 10 machines on to a single server. The latest servers can run as many as 30 virtual machines.So how do we define an SME or SMB (small and medium-sized business)? Definitions vary geographically. In Europe, a small company might have 10-49 employees and a medium-sized one, 50-250. In some regions, 5,000 people might still constitute a medium-sized company.Smaller concerns are generally seen as more flexible and agile than their larger competitors. Simon Devonshire, head of SME marketing for O2, the mobile operator, says small businesses are typically quicker to adopt new technologies than large corporates.“This is largely the consequence of a difference in the attitude towards technology in small versus larger businesses. In large corporations, new technologies such as the latest handheld mobile device and laptops are often viewed as a privilege, restricted to senior management.“Small businesses are more likely to recognise the business benefit that a new technology will bring as opposed to seeing it as a status symbol.”Again, the technology cannot be deployed unthinkingly.Michel Robert, managing director of the European hosting group Claranet warns that SMEs must be sure their investments will move the business on. “Most SMEs don’t care if the technology is the newest or the fanciest or the quickest. They care about reliability and about whether it will take them in the right direction. SMEs cannot afford to experiment and get it wrong.”He points to the dangers of growing complexity, which SMEs may be ill-prepared to deal with. He recommends outsourcing the bread-and-butter operations: “This will allow you to focus the technical resources you have on the future and on innovation and on aligning IT with the business.”The impact of the internet on SMEs has been particularly strong. While a couple of decades ago, an SME might be considering what accounting package to buy, today it is chiefly concerned with connectivity.Chris Stening of Easynet, part of the BSkyB group, says the company has seen an exponential demand for broadband from SMEs driven by e-mail, web traffic and online applications.“The internet has changed the way small businesses think about themselves,” he says.A company can use a cleverly designed website to make it seem larger than it really is: equally, a failed internet connection can quickly cost a small company more than it can afford.A survey carried out among UK SMEs by Quocirca, the consultancy, for Easynet Connect, the company’s SME network, says connection has become vital for many: “While a quarter of companies could work for days with no internet connection, most companies require failures to be fixed inside a day. For one in four, time to fix is even tighter at less than an hour and for some no break is acceptable.“In such critical situations, a second redundant connection has to be worth considering,” Quocirca recommends. The survey shows that from a simple web presence and e-mail, SMEs are selling online, using internet protocol telephony and networked video. Almost half use the network for remote back-up and disaster recovery.Are there simple guidelines that SMEs should follow in their adoption of IT? Joslyn Faust of Gartner suggests that potential buyers should not focus on price too strongly. “Free or almost free does not mean stress-free,” she says, adding that new additions must work with existing equipment if the company is not to have problems as it grows.She also says it is important to make sure that the vendor understands the customer’s business. “Too many do not understand these vertical markets, which leads to frustration for their customers as they get up to speed.”There are heartening signs, she says, that vendors are working towards the idea of “one-stop shopping” for SMEs. “That is what SMEs have always wanted but what they have not been able to have because of the state of the market. It takes a few years for vendors to get it right.”"

Olympic gold medallist and three times America’s Cup winner Russell Coutts will skipper one of the boats. He will be joined in the afterguard by French multihull expert Franck Cammas, who has skippered the Groupama trimarans to ocean race victories and records.On the second BMW-Oracle Racing boat James Spithill will take the helm. He will be joined by Volvo Ocean Race and America’s Cup-winning tactician John Kostecki for the Cowes regatta, which takes place from August 2-4.BMW-Oracle Racing, currently the challenger of record for the next America’s Cup, have been training hard in Extreme 40s because the next edition of the oldest match-racing contest will take place in multihulls, probably next March.The five-venue European iShares series has attracted extra interest because of the legal wrangle that has scuppered the America’s Cup since last year’s successful staging in Valencia.The continuing court battle was instigated by Larry Ellison, chief executive of software group Oracle and owner of BMW-Oracle Racing, against Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi team. The case is being fought in the New York courts through their respective sailing clubs, the Golden Gate Yacht Club and the Société Nautique de Genève. The American side in essence alleges that the Swiss have broken the terms of the Deed of Gift, the ancient rules that govern the America’s Cup that was first staged in 1851.The future of the event is becalmed until the case is settled. But one possibility is that the next Cup could be a two-team event between Alinghi and BMW-Oracle Racing in multihull boats, rather than the traditional competition involving several teams from various countries in monohull yachtsBMW-Oracle Racing are building a new multihull, rumoured to be a massive trimaran, for their next America’s Cup challenge. Their two Extreme 40s recently competed at a special “Just the Best” regatta in Italy, where Spithill’s team triumphed.“We are putting more time into racing the Extreme 40s now, as well as match racing,” said Coutts. “Until the new boat arrives we will keep pushing our learning curve on multihulls as much as we can.”IShares event director Gilles Chiorri said: “Having such a race between BMW-Oracle Racing and Alinghi will be very interesting – Cowes is, after all, where the America’s Cup began — and we know they have some very good crew in Franck Cammas, James Spithill and Russell Coutts. It will be very exciting for us to have such a high-profile team joining us in the iShares Cup, but I am sure the other teams will give them a good run for their money.”The other teams lining up for the third event of the 2008 iShares Cup at Cowes are: Teamorigin, skippered by Rob Greenhalgh, who is leading the iShares Cup circuit overall; BT, skippered by Nick Moloney; Holmatro, helmed by Andreas Hagara; iShares, skippered by Olympian Hugh Styles; double British gold medallist Shirley Roberston on JPMorgan Asset Management, who won the first event of the circuit in Lugano; Oman Sail, skippered by Pete Cumming as part of a unique project from the sultanate; Team Aqua, helmed by Cameron Appleton; and Volvo Ocean Race, skippered by Extreme 40 class designer Herbert Dercksen.Simon Greaves is FT.com’s sailing correspondentsimon.greaves@ft.com"
766;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-06-27T20:35:26Z;Wall St shares slide almost to March lows;;Surging oil prices, poor earnings reports from the technology sector and a slump in financials pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Index briefly into bear market territory and the S&P 500 to within a hair’s breadth of its March lows on Friday.The Dow fell to its lowest level since September 2006 – down more than 20 per cent from its October highs – before recovering slightly.The index is on course for its worst June since the Great Depression, down 10.2 per cent.The S&P 500 fared little better. Technical analysts warned that if the index broke through its March lows it could retest its 2002 lows at 1,172 points. The S&P is set for its worst monthly performance since September 2002, down 8.7 per cent.Friday began positively after the US Department of Commerce released data showed that consumer spending doubled in May while personal income also jumped, in part thanks to government tax rebates.Observers warned that tax rebates would have only a short-term effect and one already largely priced into the market.Leo Kamp, chief economist of TIAA-CREF, the financial services company, said: “Markets are seeing through this transitory increase in demand and consumption and are expecting a very slow economy afterwards.”New data on sentiment suggested that consumers had largely discounted the rebates as well. The University of Michigan index showed consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 28 years in June.Consumer facing stocks initially stabilised but fell back. Dillards fell 3.4 per cent to $11.58 while ConAgra fell 6 per cent to $19.67. The consumer discretionary sector fell 0.7 per cent while consumer staples fell 1.2 per cent.Poor earnings results in the technology sector added to the gloomy mood. Micron Technology and Palm came under pressure following disappointing earnings reports after the close on Thursday. Micron slipped 12.7 per cent to $6.10 on Friday while Palm fell 8.3 per cent to $6. The sector lost 0.4 per cent.Financials were the biggest laggards as they were all week. JPMorgan lost 3.5 per cent to $35.05. Morgan Stanley fell 0.1 per cent to $36.81 after Moody’s said it might cut the brokerage’s credit rating.The benchmark S&P 500 pared losses at the close but ended the day down 0.4 per cent at 1,278.49 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 11,348.96. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3 per cent to 2,315.63. Equities had been volatile during the week, stoked and stymied in equal measure by the fluctuating price of oil and the fortunes of corporate America.Negative earnings reports from the likes of UPS and Oracle had weighed on sentiment. Over the week, UPS lost 10 per cent to $60.37 while Oracle gave up 3.7 per cent to $21.29.Markets had to contend with rising inflation expectations. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold, noting the risk of rising inflation due to surging oil prices.Stocks rallied on the news but fell back sharply a day later as the dollar weakened, oil prices rocketed and analysts warned of further writedowns at leading banks and brokerages such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.Citigroup lost 10.6 per cent to $17.25 over the week and Merrill dropped 9 per cent to $32.70, dragging the sector down 6.6 per cent – its biggest drop since February.Over the week the S&P 500 lost 3 per cent for its fourth consecutive weekly drop while the Dow Jones dropped 4.1 per cent.On Friday as oil advanced, energy stocks made gains. Chevron rose 0.7 per cent to $98.08 while Schlumberger added 0.9 per cent to $105.90. The broader sector advanced 0.9 per cent.Healthcare stocks rose 0.6 per cent after Senate Republicans blocked a bill to cut billions of dollars off health plans tied to Medicare. Humana rose 3.1 per cent, Tenet Healthcare 1.1 per cent and Coventry Health Care 2.9 per cent.
767;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-06-26T20:41:33Z;Dow at lowest level since September 2006;;"Spiking crude oil prices, poor corporate earnings and more bad news from the banking sector sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average scuttling to its lowest level since September 2006 and knocked the S&P 500 below 1,300 points on Thursday.Technology stocks were hit particularly hard after Oracle and Research in Motion disappointed markets late on Wednesday with forecasts of slower growth and a profits miss, respectively.Oracle declined 5 per cent to $21.42 and RIM 13.3 per cent to $123.46 while the technology sector as a whole slumped 3.6 per cent – its biggest one-day fall since early January.Fourth-quarter results from Nike added to the gloom as the group reported a drop in US profits because of higher spending on advertising. Nike shares fell 9.8 per cent to $59.50.The broader consumer discretionary sector fell back sharply, losing 3.5 per cent as oil prices jumped above $140 a barrel.General Motors shares also suffered, falling 10.8 per cent to $11.43 – touching their lowest levels since 1955 along the way – after Goldman Sachs recommended selling shares in the carmaker. A similar downgrade for Lear, the maker of car seats, sheared 16.4 per cent from its share price taking it to $15.15.Analysts now expect second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 9 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.Goldman struck again in the financials sector with a note that added Citigroup to its “conviction sell” list on the basis that it might take as much as $9bn in writedowns in the second quarter.Goldman also cut its recommendation on brokerages from “attractive” to “neutral”, citing deteriorating fundamentals and a delayed recovery process, and forecast $4.2bn of second-quarter writedowns at Merrill Lynch.Citigroup hit its lowest level since 1998, down 6.3 per cent to $17.67. Merrill Lynch dropped to a five-year low, falling 6.8 per cent to $33.05.The financial sector as a whole lost 4.4 per cent while an index of investment banking stocks fell 4.8 per cent.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: “When you mix up the higher oil prices and the weakness in financials it continues to push this market lower …without question the S&P 500 is headed back to its March lows.”All 10 leading industry groups were in the red, dragging the S&P 500 down
2.9 per cent to 1,294.18 points, its lowest level in three months. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3 per cent to 2,321.37 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3 per cent to 11,455.86 points and has lost 9.4 per cent so far in June, its worst month since the Great Depression.Homebuilders struggled after Lennar, the second-biggest US homebuilder, reported a fifth successive quarterly loss and one that was larger than expected.Stuart Miller, chief executive, said: “The remainder of 2008 will likely see further deterioration in overall market conditions.’’That news swamped a report by the National Association of Realtors showing existing home sales rose
2 per cent to a 4.99m annual rate in May after falling for the previous two months.Lennar fell 8.4 per cent to $13.34 while DR Horton and Centex slipped 5.7 per cent to $11.80 and 7.7 per cent to $14.21, respectively.In the background, macro-economic data did little to improve the mood. A four-week average of initial jobless claims rose to its highest level since October 2005.Amid the widespread malaise, industrials tumbled 3.9 per cent, led by GE and United Technologies. GE fell 5.2 per cent to $26.53 and a five-year low, while United lost 4.9 per cent to $62.79.Even the best performing sectors lost ground. Consumer staples fell 2.1 per cent after ConAgra Foods predicted fiscal 2009 earnings that undershot some projections. ConAgra fell 5.5 per cent to $20.92.Smith and Wesson, the gunmaker, was a rare exception, rallying 6.7 per cent to $5.45 after the US Supreme Court ruled that a sweeping ban on handguns in Washington DC was unconstitutional.Searching for a note of optimism in the broad-based sell-off, Mr Detrick said: “We haven’t seen a major spike up in volatility.“People are obviously losing confidence but they are not yet ready to throw in the towel.”"
768;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-06-25T23:25:57Z;Newer units and sales rally lift Oracle;;A recovery in US software sales and a stronger performance from some of its newer businesses have helped Oracle to report a stronger end to its fiscal year than Wall Street had expected.The figures on Wednesday came a year after the crisis in subprime credit markets stirred up worries about the knock-on effects on big technology companies, such as Oracle, which rely heavily on sales to banks.The world’s second-biggest software company brushed off those concerns, thanks to the breadth of its geographic reach and expanding product portfolio.“We like our strategy and we like our ability to execute,” said Larry Ellison, chief executive officer.However, the company issued a cautious financial forecast for the present quarter, damping the mood and leading to a 3 per cent drop in its shares in after-market trading.Mr Ellison said the latest results again demonstrated that Oracle’s strategy, based on a spate of acquisitions to improve economies of scale and acquire a wider range of products to sell to existing customers, was working.While Oracle said it had now exceeded its financial targets for the first four years of a five-year financial plan, some analysts and investors have grown concerned that the company will run out of steam as it exhausts the options for big software acquisitions.Safra Catz, president, sought to scotch those fears, saying: “We don’t think our strategy is in any way running out of gas.”With the chance to cross-sell newer applications and middleware products to existing database customers “our model has enormous leverage”, she added.Results for the latest quarter were helped by a rebound in the applications business after a weak period earlier in the year.Sales of new software licences jumped 36 per cent to $989m, with much of the growth coming from acquisitions.Overall, Oracle reported revenues of $7.2bn, up 24 per cent from a year before, and net income of $2bn, or 39 cents a share.Ms Catz said Oracle was no longer as cautious as it had been earlier this year, when the collapse of Bear Stearns raised fears about a downturn in demand across the sector.In spite of that, Oracle’s forecast for the present quarter, calling for revenue growth of between 18 and 20 per cent and pro forma earnings per share of 26-27 cents, fell short of some analysts’ estimates.
769;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Perspectives: Industry raises its voice to catch the ear of Brussels;;"The rancorous arguments over the patentability of computer software, which raged in Europe a few years ago, had some unexpected but beneficial outcomes.One was the establishment in 2005 of the European Software Association, whch was founded to give Europe’s software and services companies a louder voice in the regulatory and other debates affecting them. Many well established software companies felt their views had been drowned in the noise from small, special interest groups.Today the Brussels-based ESA has representation from the main European Union countries and some from outside.There is a Russian member, 1C Company, for example, while Eilert Hanoa, the vice-chairman, is chief executive of Mamut, the Norwegian software house.The organisation has just elected as chairman Jeremy Roche, of the UK-based software company Coda. To qualify for membership, a company must develop software and carry out significant research and development in Europe, which explains the curious fact that the US groups Microsoft – through its French subsidiary – and Oracle are both full members.Is there really a need for yet another industry association? In the UK, for example, Intellect absorbed the old Computing Services and Software Association, while the Business Applications Software Developers Association (BASDA) looks after the interests of business software developers.Mr Roche has no doubt of the need for such an organisation, noting that the European software industry is fragmented, trading across many markets in many countries.He says most of his members are so busy concentrating on their businesses that they have little time to assimilate the trends in technology, legislation and economic climates that are influencing all these markets.Mr Roche says 7.8m people are employed in software businesses across Europe, giving the industry some comparability with the motor industry, but without its visibility or political clout.He points out that as much as 25 per cent of the growth of the European economy comes from software, services and high technology industries – which should entitle the ESA to a seat at the table when issues affecting these industries are on the agenda.Why should ESA’s views have any influence with the European Commission? Because the delegates are all business people, and senior business people at that – chief executives or senior managers only is the rule. Mr Roche believes that commission staff welcome the change from lobbyists and the like.The involvement of the ESA is particularly important at this time when the commission is in the throes of producing a white paper dealing with key information technology issues. It is generally felt that Brussels is not well informed about IT or the way that, as industries converge, legislation appropriate to one can handicap another.There are, for example, many ways of distributing software these days – as a compact disc or as a service through downloads. Software companies can become entangled in legislation designed to regulate the television business and dealing with content and royalties.Then there is the hugely important question of skills and staffing. There are not enough skilled IT staff in Europe and the position is getting worse, as able students turn away from mathematics and the sciences.Meanwhile, the numbers of science students graduating in China and India dwarfs Europe’s output, raising fears that Europe’s software industry will face increasing competition – not only from the west but from the east, with potentially disastrous consequences.“We do not do enough to promote ourselves as an industry and get the attention we deserve,” Mr Roche says. “Because we are fragmented, we do not promote ourselves as an attractive profession.”The ESA therefore wants to see the creation of a framework in which Europe is seen as an attractive place to develop software. Among the measures it will be pressing for in its discussion with the commission are ways to increase the supply of skilled workers without increasing costs and the integration of the business environment across the EU.This would include the harmonisation of fiscal reporting and common electronic document interchange. Mr Roche accepts, however, that this latter objective will be hard to achieve. He also wants to see measures which would encourage research and development across the European states.And how does the ESA stand on software patents: it was, after all, the issue which catalysed its formation?Essentially, it argues that intellectual property must be protected but that individual companies should be free to choose their own approach. Some might find patenting the right approach; others would want to rely on copyright, trademarks or the concept of “trade secrets”.The software industry is not only fragmented, it is diverse and the legislation which governs it should reflect that fact."

771;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
772;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;More than just plain sailing;;They race on lakes, seas and even canals, crewed by some of the world’s finest sailors. And the Extreme 40 catamarans that will be zipping across the water off Hyères on France’s south coast this weekend may offer a foretaste of the next America’s Cup, sailing’s most venerable competition.The event is the iShares Extreme 40 Series, and features the Swiss Alinghi team that retained the America’s Cup in Valencia last year, together with such leading yachtsmen and women as Dame Shirley Robertson, Erik Maris and Randy Smyth.The racing began at Lake Lugano on the Swiss-Italian border last month and, after Hyères, moves to Cowes, off Britain’s south coast, in early August, then to Kiel in Germany and ends on the canals of Amsterdam in September.The five-venue series, now in its second year, has attracted extra interest because of the legal wrangle that has scuppered the America’s Cup since last year’s successful staging in Valencia.The continuing court battle was instigated by Larry Ellison, chief executive of software group Oracle and owner of the American sailing team BMW-Oracle Racing, against Swiss billionnaire Ernesto Bertarelli’s Alinghi team. The case is being fought in the New York courts through their respective sailing clubs, the Golden Gate Yacht Club and the Société Nautique de Genève. The American side essentially alleges that the Swiss have broken the terms of the Deed of Gift, the ancient rules that govern the America’s Cup that was first staged in 1851.The future of the event is becalmed until the case is settled. But one possibility is that the next Cup could be just a two-team event between Alinghi and BMW-Oracle Racing in multihull boats, rather than the traditional competition involving several teams from various countries in monohull yachts.Hence Alinghi’s participation in the Extreme 40s series as the team eagerly learn and hone the skills of multihull racing. Team Origin, the UK team skippered by Robert Greenhalgh that also hope to challenge in the next America’s Cup, have joined this catamaran circuit for the same reason.The series may be benefiting from the America’s Cup fall-out, but its organiser believes it has hit upon a spectacular sailing formula. “The inaugural circuit in 2007 was a great first step, but we believe 2008 is going to see this circuit really come into its own,” says Gilles Chiorri, director of organiser OC Events. “We want to build on the success of the sometimes unconventional, restricted, short-course racing we saw in cities like Amsterdam. Racing on the canal produced some of the best action that we have ever seen within the sport of sailing.”Herbert Dercksen, an Olympic sailor and chief executive of TornadoSport, which builds the catamarans used in this event, says: “The Extreme 40 is capable of reaching speeds of 40 knots …Also, the Extreme 40 flies a hull [travels on one hull] over three metres above the water, giving the sensation of gliding like a bird.“After the last Olympics people were talking about how to commercialise sailing, how to change the sport to attract spectators and sponsors. We decided it’s about offering a package of action, attraction and addiction …while providing an excellent return on investment for sponsors and supporters. This series delivers the excitement of racing to those who love the thrill of close contests.”Meanwhile in Hyères, Shirley Robertson, Britain’s double Olympic gold medallist, will be aiming to retain her JPMorgan Asset Management team’s lead after the opening regatta at Lugano. She gained 10 points for winning five races, followed by Team Origin in second with nine, and the BT team third with eight.Alinghi – skippered by Ed Baird, the America’s Cup winning helmsman – had begun the series as firm favourites after storming into first and second places in the training races last month off Valencia. But after winning one race on Lugano, they suffered a spectacular capsize that broke their mast.In total 11 teams, each with a four-man crew, will contest the series. These include Aqua, with its British and New Zealand crew, Dutch-crewed Holmatro, sponsor iShares, and Volvo Ocean Race, also with a Dutch crew.Andreas Hagara, Holmatro’s skipper, tips the Swiss team to win the series. “I think Alinghi will be the boat to beat. They’ve spent the most days on the water and they’ve done the most tuning work, so they are fast and their teamwork is good after that many days.”Dercksen, though, thinks the racing could be very open: “Alinghi put in a very good performance in Valencia and they definitely set a good benchmark, but I think with guys like Greenhalgh, Shirley and Hagara sailing, they’ll give them a good run for their money.”
773;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-06-08T18:07:35Z;Information technology;;Who has not, when confronted by the daily exasperation of office technology, questioned the parenthood and purpose of information technology departments? Advocates of computing in “the cloud” hope to make them largely superfluous.Instead of going to the effort of installing and maintaining computing locally, all those tricksy applications, not to mention storage and data processing, can be provided centrally from shared infrastructure. Merrill Lynch estimates that more efficient management of resources – such as servers – could provide services at a cost five to 10 times cheaper than that provided by a more traditional in-house approach.The revolution has been a long time coming. Computing on tap as a concept was floated as far back as the 1960s. Sun Microsystems has been actively pushing grid, or utility, computing for almost a decade. What has changed is the rise of viable business models such as software-as-a-service. Salesforce.com is the most high-profile of these companies, but Oracle, Microsoft and SAP are all investing in subscription-based services aimed at small businesses – typically those with fewer than 1,500 employees.So there are some valuable niches to exploit. On current growth rates, Saas sales should double between 2006 and 2011. And if subscription services can show real economies of scale in distribution and sales – not something that Salesforce.com has yet demonstrated – sky-high valuations for Saas companies might be justified.But the segment’s sales of about $3bn remain a small fraction of a global $270bn software market. The impact of inertia should not be discounted either. Chief executives tend to dislike replacing equipment that still works. Mainframes were superseded by servers decades ago but IBM still makes and maintains them. Important security and regulatory questions have to be answered before large companies will consider the cost of moving any form of critical data into the cloud. To hope for more than slow, if steady, progress over several years is to build castles in the air.
774;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-05-28T00:27:36Z;Car manufacturing: Vehicle makers appreciate the virtues of virtual design;;Electronics may be responsible for about 90 per cent of innovation in automobiles, but they also provide vehicle makers with their biggest challenge – keeping up with innovation in consumer electronics.The success of Apple’s iPod was one such challenge. Customers were asking how they could connect these tiny digital music players to their cars’ audio systems. “Manufacturers had not foreseen the success of the iPod or of MP3 players in general,” says Willem Bulthuis, vice-president, automotive, for NXP Semiconductors, formerly Philips’ Semiconductors.”With our experience of audio and video systems, NXP was one of the first to provide chips for USB (universal serial bus) interfaces in cars.”Computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems have been standard for years, but the latest developments in digital technology are revolutionising motor vehicle design, manufacture, retailing and capabilities in ways that could only be hinted at by earlier, simpler systems.The most popular CAD and CAM systems are now well established and have become critical elements of product lifecycle management software from companies including Altair Engineering, Dassault Systèmes, Siemens and Oracle (through its acquisition of Agile Software). PLM software includes CAD and CAM, tool design and manufacture, digital manufacturing, supply chain management and workflow management.Shaun Clark, managing director of Applied Group, a reseller and consultant, partnering with Dassault Systèmes, says that primary manufacturers and component suppliers are modelling products in three dimensions using software, such as the French group’s Catia, before building physical prototypes.The ideal is to have a single digital mock-up of the vehicle to be used as the “blueprint” by all suppliers. “If you have many subcontractors and they are all producing prototype parts for your vehicle and you change an important part, how many will be affected and have to go back and re-engineer their part,” he asks. “If you can minimise that by using the digital model at the prototyping stage you can reduce costs. As soon as you go to hard prototyping, things slow down and costs rise.”John Deere, the US maker of agricultural and other heavy equipment, is at the forefront of digitally assisted manufacturing. It is experimenting, in conjunction with the Iowa State University, with haptics, a technology that enables a user to “feel” the experience of assembling and disassembling heavy components.Users hold a kind of motor-driven stylus, made by SensAble Technologies of Woburn, Massachusetts, in each hand while looking at 3D images of the components on a computer screen. When the two parts are put together, the user “feels” the collision through the stylii.Jerry Duncan, John Deere’s university relations manager, says the technology could be used in design and manufacturing. In conjunction with the university, the company has already developed a training programme for spray painters using haptics.The modern manufacturing line itself is significantly more flexible than in the past, turning out a cabriolet one moment, a van the next. This leads to complex logistics issues, as supplies of doors, wheels and other components have to be ready to be fitted to the correct vehicle.Barcoded adhesive labels are currently used to identify components but these can become dirty or scratched. Instead, Powerlase, a UK company, uses solid state lasers to engrave barcodes directly on to aluminium, and galvanised and stainless steel.Samir Ellwi of Powerlase says: “The barcodes are indelible and far more robust than adhesive counterparts. Engraved barcodes can be read by scanners even if scratched or painted over.”Another approach is the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. These have the added advantage that they can be used to distinguish between a genuine aftermarket product and a copy and could be used to identify stolen vehicles or parts, according to Mr Bulthuis of NXP.Technology is also having to reflect changes in the way dealers operate, as they now tend to sell a variety of vehicles.Dealer management systems allow buyers, when choosing a new car, to select options and accessories, automatically register the vehicle and create a link to a finance company. It will tell the buyer when the new car is to be delivered, help sell their old vehicle back to the dealer and set the aftersales market process running.Alastair Sorbie, chief executive of Swedish enterprise software group IFS, says that first tier manufacturers are under constant pressure to produce better quality vehicles at a better price.He says: “The cost of IT content in that situation is obviously under pressure the whole time, so if we can replace high-cost, old legacy mainframe systems with modern, low cost products then that has to be attractive.”Modern, low-cost electronics and computer software are giving vehicles capabilities that could only be dreamed of in the past.Mr Bulthuis points out that there are more than 100 processing units in the average car and that his company alone has sold more than 2bn of the transceivers that let them communicate.Manufacturers have developed sensors for detecting dangerous pressure levels in tyres and a dangerous lack of attention in the driver. A combination of global positioning equipment and mobile radio enables cars to be tracked and charged for their use of the roads.KPIT Cummins designs software that automatically reduces speeds on wet roads and controls the oil inflow and level of emissions. NXP is developing the ignition key of tomorrow, whose chief advantage will be to tell drivers, via a tiny screen, if their cars are locked once they are in the supermarketA few years ago Flexray, a kind of internet for the individual motor car, was still in development, but last year, it made its appearance in a top-of-the-line BMW.Flexray is a standard agreed by most of the world’s leading car makers which defines the in-car communications which will make steer-by-wire, brake-by-wire and so on possible.For the BMW, it’s being used for stability to control, to ensure the car always has the best possible road holding.
775;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-05-28T00:25:41Z;Sweeping away a sector’s chaos;;It sounds like an apocryphal story, but Nigel Woodward, London-based director of financial services at Intel, insists it is true.“At one of the big UK clearing banks, the core accounting system still does calculations in pounds, shillings and pence,” he says. Decimalisation was introduced in the UK in 1971, 37 years ago.The scale of the IT transformation needed in many areas of the financial industry is mind-boggling. Cobbled-together systems are still the bedrock of a hugely expanded sector accounting for an estimated 7 per cent of global gross domestic product.While bad systems did not cause the present credit crisis, they probably contributed. “Some big banks failed to keep track of the risks as the volumes built up,” says Intel’s Mr Woodward.He uses the example of sub-prime mortgages. When a bank bought a collateralised debt obligation (CDO), “was the transaction recorded and tracked back to a residential property in Texas,” he asks. “The bank might already have had a full exposure to property in Texas but didn’t know.”Technology-enabled scale allowed traders to run ahead of banks’ ability to measure risk, he says. And when regulators and auditors started demanding answers about the scale of banks’ exposure, extracting the information from fragmented systems and databases was difficult and time-consuming. Hence revisions to banks’ profit warnings, as the scale of risk was progressively uncovered.Jeremy Badman, partner in the strategic IT and operations practice focusing on investment banks at Oliver Wyman, highlights the problem that arose with credit default swaps, a mechanism used by banks to lay off risk that has turned into a market measured in trillions of dollars.It started as a market where people fixed deals by phone, recorded them on a spreadsheet and faxed contracts. Back-office processing was manual. But as volumes increased, settlement remained manual, and three-month piles of unmatched contracts built up – alarming regulators over uncertain risk positions.The lesson, says Mr Badman, is that technology has to support innovation, and processes must be “industrialised” quickly when a new product is successful. The trouble is that many financial institutions find this hard, because they rely on gummed-up legacy systems.Rudy Puryear, global head of the IT practice at consultant Bain, explains: “Many of the IT solutions have been layered on over 15 or 20 years or more. In the 1990s everyone went out and wanted to buy a best-of-breed solution and then had to bolt that on to the legacy system. Then everybody wanted web access, plus companies have made acquisitions of companies using different systems.“Almost every organisation I have walked into has a huge amount of unnecessary complexity in IT. It drives up cost and it slows down response in terms of time-to-market. We want IT to be an enabler of change. Right now it is very often like a block of concrete, adding rigidity to organisations.”His recommendations? “You have to recognise that you have a complexity problem and that it is bad. It is driving up cost and constraining the ability to respond to the market-place and it is using up more and more IT dollars.“You have to start saying you are not going to introduce more complexity. You have to create a future-state view of where you want to migrate this to in, say, five years time. You need to push a lot of shared, common, off-the-shelf solutions. So, as you make incremental decisions, you can measure it against how it helps you towards your desired five-year target.”One example of this kind of thinking in action is Oyster, a ticketing system for Transport for London, by which users pay fares with a smart card, which stores cash, and can be used to pay for travel and other services.Jonathan Charley, head of banking, Europe, at EDS, which advised on Oyster’s creation, says it was built as a stand-alone solution because “to integrate it into an existing system would have been a huge challenge”. The system was built on an off-the-shelf package of services-oriented architecture, put together “like Lego bricks”.Clipping on ready-made flexible units that can take over tasks fragmented across existing systems seems a promising way forward. Charles Marston, who previously worked in the interest rate derivatives operation of a bank, founded systems and software company Calypso in San Francisco in 1997 to develop a universal front and back office platform.Today, Calypso offers an off-the-shelf system that can be used to trade a host of financial instruments, from spot foreign exchange via derivatives to equities and commodities, yet which also supports straight-through back office tasks such as settlement, and allows banks to capture the data they need for risk and capital management. About 80 institutions have bought the system, including HSBC, Dresdner and Calyon.As Peter Van der Vorst, chief financial officer of Sybase, an integration, data management and platform company, points out, one of the biggest challenges for many financial firms is keeping pace with the need to process vast and booming volumes of information at appropriate speeds.So Sybase has just launched a product called RAP, designed to handle algorithmic computer-based trading, service the data needs of the quantitative analysts who write the algo programmes, and deliver the data needed to monitor trades for risk management and compliance.Retail institutions, too, are finding legacy systems an encumbrance to business development. Nationwide, a UK building society, has decided to embark on a wholesale system renewal using an off-the-shelf solution from software house SAP.Darin Brumby, divisional director for business systems transformation at Nationwide, says shifting to a new platform will enable it to introduce new products – different kinds of account, for example, and a suite of mortgages – that the current system cannot support.It will also allow improvements to front and back office organisation. It is tantamount to creating a new building society around the changed market and customer needs. Although it is costly, “we think there is a good first-mover advantage”, he says.SAP and US rival Oracle believe a pre-integrated offering is the best solution. Over the past few years they have been positioning themselves for the colossal orders that are beginning to flow as financial institutions start replacing legacy systems.Rajesh Hukku, senior vice-president of financial services at Oracle, reckons the company has spent $30bn buying best-of-breed suppliers and developing a pre-built application integration architecture.This one-stop-shop purchase of a core banking architecture with the features of your choice that are all promised to work seamlessly has won some other big converts. Citibank, the world’s biggest with 350,000 staff, is among them, replacing 59 versions of its old corporate banking system with a single Oracle solution, in which, for example, a base in Singapore services 14 banking operations in Asia. It is, says Mr Hukku, the biggest legacy system replacement ever.The idea is that each bit can access all the data, and off-the shelf packages of analytics, for example, will keep a bank compliant with Basel II regulations, credit risk, and liability management, while assuring the flexibility to add in regulatory changes without complicating or compromising performance. “Two plus two equals five, if not 11,” Mr Hukku says.It sounds like nirvana. And today, maybe it is. But will it still be the best answer in 10, or even five years? “We know that things will change,” says Mr Hukku, “but the basic requirement will always be to look at core data in certain aggregations.”David Hunt, head of technology consulting at Capgemini Financial Services, agrees on the importance of data, but cautions that the IT industry still does not necessarily deliver all the right answers. “What we are not good at, as technologists, is doing that low-cost, throw-away innovation,” he says.Yet financial services firms need to experiment with products as consumer technology changes.Today’s private bank customers “may be happy to come to the office and have a fat cigar, but their inheritors might want to bank on their X-box 360 or mobile phone,” says Mr Hunt.Tomorrow’s systems won’t just need to be agile, he says. In consumer, as well as investment banking, they will need to support rapid innovation of products, and rapid industrialisation of those that succeed.It is a far cry from the days when they wrote that program in pounds, shillings and pence. Financial businesses are learning that they cannot see far into the future. System designers must learn not even to try.Jerry Norton, head of financial services at consulting and software group Logica, deserves the last word. A layered approach that separates fundamental systems from distribution channels can help. But fundamentally, it’s about philosophy, he says. “Most other things – consumer products, even buildings – have a design life-time.”Sure, a general ledger doesn’t change much. But isn’t it time systems were sold with an end-of-use date warning?
776;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Activists and mergers;;Takeover talks generally boil down to two sets of management, their respective bankers and affiliated lawyers sparring in a windowless office. But, as Jerry Yang, Yahoo chief executive, is discovering, there can be a critical third party lurking in the background: the activist investor.Carl Icahn’s decision to challenge Mr Yang over the failure of Microsoft’s attempt to take over Yahoo serves as a reminder that activism is not just about access to leverage and a loud mouth. The situation at Yahoo is tailor-made for Mr Icahn. Yahoo’s rejection of an apparent $33-a-share proposal was roundly criticised when Microsoft walked away. The subsequent drop in Yahoo’s share price indicated the level of confidence shareholders had in Mr Yang’s alternative strategy. There is a decent chance Mr Icahn will be able to push Yahoo and Microsoft back towards a deal – as he did when BEA Systems yielded to Oracle this year.For corporate management of any halfway decent company with its stock price is in the doldrums, the spectacle of Yahoo shows how complicated it is to defend against an opportunistic raid in an age of activism. Boards are duty bound to try to extract the best price possible from a potential buyer. But if they overplay their hand, they risk a sudden drop in the share price, heavy turnover in the shareholder base, stinging rebukes from investors and the appearance of an activist.What is more, buyers, not relishing the risks and costs of a hostile campaign, know all this. After all, it is not hard to imagine that when Steve Ballmer walked away from Yahoo rather than launch a full-scale attack, the chief executive of Microsoft harboured hopes that Mr Icahn or someone of his ilk would come in and do the fighting for him.Post and read comments on this Lex
777;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-05-26T18:32:08Z;Wal-Mart launches global IT system;;Wal-Mart has begun rolling out a global information technology system in a break with its traditional reliance on the home-grown IT that underpinned its rapid expansion in the US.The world’s largest retailer selected Germany’s SAP software over competition from Oracle last October. It has stepped up hiring in its IT department, with an accompanying increase in corporate costs, as it starts to implement the changes.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said the “efficiency of the home grown system has not kept pace with the corporation’s growth”.“It is going to be expensive to implement, but it will be far more efficient once we’re up and running and …it is scalable. As you continue to see us grow, enter new countries, it’s something that can accommodate that better than our home-grown solution.”Rising IT costs contributed to a 20 per cent increase in Wal-Mart’s corporate expenses in the first quarter of this year, the company said without naming the total amount, adding that, without the expenditure on “transformation” projects, corporate expenses would have increased by 3 per cent.Mr Schoewe said this month that the additional expenses “will continue to be a headwind for the rest of this fiscal year and for several years to come”.The first phase of the global roll-out is expected to be completed in the next two years, with a second and third phase completed in three to five years.The shift to an external software package represents a significant shift for Wal-Mart, whose IT department historically spearheaded the development of technologies that have in the past transformed its business. These include developing its “Retail Link” system in 1991, which give suppliers access to current sales and inventory data on their products on the company’s shelves.Wal-Mart will continue to develop its own IT solutions, including RFID wireless tagging solutions, and hopes to create a global e-commerce platform that would both unify the systems used by existing online operations in the US and Europe and be replicable in new markets.Tesco, Wal-Mart’s UK rival, relies on Oracle’s software for a global software system that was most recently deployed to support its US Fresh & Easy chain.
778;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-05-26T17:08:53Z;Google, Yahoo, Microsoft: antitrust confusion;;Financial markets are abuzz with the possibility of a Microsoft-Yahoo merger or a Google-Yahoo to block it. A heavy dose of the chatter is consumed by the regulatory implications of either: will the antitrust agencies in the US and European Union approve the transaction? The deals pivot on such anticipations.Of course, antitrust laws are meant to encourage efficient mergers and disrupt the rest. But that careful delineation proves a challenge.The standard approach begins – and, some would say, ends – by defining the relevant antitrust market. If a Yahoo merger is seen as involving two advertising businesses, then market shares are modest and competitive concerns evaporate.Framing the market as online search advertising, however, upsets this conclusion. In that case, Google accounts for about 62 per cent of US sales, Yahoo 20 per cent and Microsoft 9 per cent. This level of concentration generally leads authorities to oppose intra-industry mergers – “three to two” combinations.Yet, online search adverts compete with television commercials, newspaper classified ads and other marketing media. The question is, to what degree? This is an arduous, fact-intensive inquiry. There are multiple ways to botch the mission. The first is that the inquiry can drag.A potential 1995 IBM acquisition of Apple, which might have created a powerful rival to challenge Microsoft’s PC dominance, crumbled under the one-year delay that US antitrust approval was expected to take.The second is that the government’s analysis may get the economics wrong. The proper policy aims to deter only anti-competitive deals. But the balancing act is a tough exercise.Hence, a third problem surfaces when a delicate consumer welfare analysis is roughed up by hard-ball politics. Interests opposed to mergers routinely lobby regulators and legislators to thwart their foes. Google has blasted Microsoft as a monopoly that should be prevented from buying Yahoo – but it is only returning Microsoft’s fire in the Google-DoubleClick merger, when the software giant failed to convince US or EU authorities that the deal was anti-competitive. In breaking off its effort to buy Yahoo, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, admitted that a “host of regulatory and legal problems” pushed it to walk.The evidence proffered by rivals is often excellent – but it proves the reverse of what is intended by the lobbyists. As Judge Richard Posner noted in a merger case involving medical facilities that came before the Federal Trade Commission: “Hospital Corporation’s most telling point is that the impetus for the Commission’s [antitrust] complaint came from a competitor …The hospital that complained to the Commission must have thought that the acquisition would lead to lower rather than higher prices – which would benefit consumers.”There is great confusion about the state of competition policy. In January 2007, for example, The Wall Street Journal reported: “The federal government has nearly stepped out of the antitrust enforcement business, leaving companies to mate as they wish.” This would be news to the lawyers at Yahoo, Microsoft or Google.Moreover, the US government has tried to prevent important mergers in recent years, only to be over-ruled in court. The Department of Justice blocked Oracle-PeopleSoft (2004) and the FTC tried to stop Whole Foods-Wild Blue (2007) but both were over-ruled and the deals completed.In March, Sirius Satellite Radio was cleared – after a 13-month DoJ investigation – to buy rival XM Satellite Radio. (Disclosure: I wrote two white papers at the request of the merging parties in 2007.) But the merger still languishes because the Federal Communications Commission, with duplicative review authority, dawdles.The FCC wants the merged company to “agree” to lease (at nominal cost) channels to a minority-owned programming company. Using merger approval as an opportunity to coerce payments to politically favoured constituents is a perfect policy inversion: the “competitive analysis” shifts into monopoly-priced extractions by the state.The Sirius-XM merger delays have been triggered by concerns from terrestrial radio broadcasters. When anti-competitive strategies sabotage consumer interests, this perverts the enterprise of antitrust. As important as preventing undue concentration is the need to prevent regulators from serving as nuisances that sandbag the very social progress they were assigned to protect.The writer is professor of law economics at George Mason University, where he is director of the information economy project at the National Center for Technology and Law

RSA, now a division of EMC, has announced improvements in its security software for the popular handheld device.In a so-called two-factor authentication scheme, users must own a security token and type a password. RSA’s software makes it easier to distribute these software tokens, which are stored inside each BlackBerry. Another improvement lets BlackBerry users securely access their virtual private network via Wi-Fi when working in the office so saving airtime charges.HP’s thin client notebookHewlett-Packard is jumping on the desktop virtualisation bandwagon with new mobile thin client hardware. While it may look like a conventional notebook, the HP2533t runs Windows XP Embedded instead of the usual Windows XP or Vista, and has a 1GB flash drive instead of a traditional hard disk. In keeping with thin client philosophy, no data reside on the HP2533t, so security managers can sleep soundly if the device gets lost or stolen. The best bit is its weight: just three pounds. Prices start at $825 in the US.Oracle updatingOracle is sticking to its promise as regards updating the sprawling product portfolio inherited from past acquisitions. The latest product to get a refresh is JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and, more precisely, its Financial Management and Compliance Console, which now offers role-based views and pre-defined metrics such as financial ratios or accounts receivable. Oracle acquired the JD Edwards product family along with its previous owner PeopleSoft in 2005 and says it will support it well beyond 2010.Lotus liberationYour colleagues use Microsoft but you’re still hooked on Lotus. Help is at hand as IBM has unveiled new software to let Lotus users “liberate” business content from SharePoint, Microsoft’s web-based collaboration platform. Lotus Quickr Content Integrator is designed to make it easy to move content from SharePoint sites and Microsoft Exchange folders into Lotus Quickr, IBM’s rival collaboration offering.Data archivingReflecting the fresh importance given to data archiving, Hewlett-Packard has enhanced its database archiving software, HP Database Archiving. It includes a visual design environment to simplify designing archiving projects to cope with the growing quantities of data that must be retained for regulatory or legal reasons. Database coverage is also extended to include Microsoft SQL Server and provide new capabilities for Oracle.Insurance efficienciesInnovation and insurance don’t often appear in the same sentence. But IBM believes new technologies such as service-oriented architectures can boost the operational efficiency of the insurance sector. Its new SOA-powered Insurance Operations of the Future (IOF) solution can extract the relevant information from inbound documents e-mails or voicemails, enrich it and then route the task to an appropriate process.Call centre limboDo your customers get lost in call centre limbo?

780;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-05-15T14:01:04Z;Wall Street’s big Yahoo hope: If anyone can, Icahn can;;Carl Icahn might well have a better chance of bringing Yahoo and Microsoft together than Steve Ballmer ever had of doing it on his own.That’s the message the Yahoo stock price has been screaming. With the activist investor mounting a proxy fight, Yahoo’s shares now actually stand higher than they did on several days when Microsoft was still pursuing its unsolicited bid.Is this rational? Two things suggest it may be.One is that it took Microsoft to drop its takeover offer for some of Yahoo’s biggest shareholders to show their hand. Remember that Bill Miller, who controls 6 per cent of the stock, had been publicly calling on Microsoft to pay $40 a share: once Steve Ballmer balked, Miller’s comments suggested he’d have taken $34 after all. Gordon Crawford, also with 6 per cent, said something similar.This is valuable information to an investor like Icahn. Potential sellers don’t normally put their cards on the table quite so publicly.The other reason to believe a deal has a better chance with Icahn on the scene is his track record in oiling the wheels of difficult negotiations. Exhibit One is the resolution of Oracle’s bid for BEA Systems earlier this year. With BEA publicly holding out for $21 a share, Oracle actually walked away from its offer of $17 a share: the deal (with Icahn acting as broker) eventually got done behind the scenes at $19.375. This was a bigger gap to overcome than the difference between Microsoft and Yahoo, as one investor in takeover stocks points out.The big risk for the hedge funds that have been piling into Yahoo’s shares this week is that Microsoft can’t be brought back to the negotiating table. Having wasted three months and considerable credibility already, though, it seems almost unimaginable that Ballmer wouldn’t come back – at the right price.
781;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-05-14T21:23:41Z;Icahn stalks Yahoo;;The day talks between Microsoft and Jerry Yang collapsed, he may as well have painted a target on his back. The Chief Yahoo is now said to be in the sights of the arch-activist, Carl Icahn. Having rejected Microsoft’s proposal of $33 per share, Yahoo’s stock had sunk to about $24.50 in mid-morning trading on Tuesday. Investors are not buying Mr Yang’s assertion that Yahoo can surpass the valuation placed on it by Microsoft under its own steam.Now that Mr Icahn is said to be involved, however, Yahoo’s stock has jumped to more than $27. The thinking is that Mr Icahn would force the company back into takeover negotiations, as he did with a reluctant BEA Systems after it rejected Oracle. If so, Mr Icahn would need to hurry. His main lever would be to put up an alternative slate of directors at Yahoo’s shareholder meeting. The wrinkle is that the deadline for doing so is on Thursday.Mr Icahn could conceivably pull together a full hostile board in such a short space of time. But even if that proved too difficult, he could nominate just a handful of directors instead. A “short slate”, if elected, could still make life difficult for Mr Yang.Investors buying on the rumour, however, should beware. A few new directors would be no guarantee of a deal actually happening – so they would need to be good enough to contribute meaningfully to the company’s turnround. Moreover, the collapse of Microsoft’s bid has left Yahoo in a twilight zone, subject to doubts over strategy, questions regarding leadership and residual hopes of a takeover. It is precisely in that sort of situation that Mr Icahn can thrive. But it is also one in which the mere mention of his name can be enough to move the share price.Post and read comments on this LexLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

782;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-05-14T03:17:59Z;Process management: Making complex business simpler;;"Steven S Smith, chief technology officer for the US bank Wells Fargo Financial, introduced his company to business process management last year.Note how he did it: “I didn’t go to our divisional chief executive and say: ‘We are going to invest in this tool’. Instead, we brought the technology in and worked together with the business on a specific issue. It was the business manager who presented to the divisional CEO. He said: ‘Look at the benefits of this new technology’.“All the IT people were sitting in the room with big smiles on their faces. They didn’t have to say a word. It was the business bragging about how wonderful it is,” he says.When the business side of an organisation has good things to say, unprompted, about a new technology, something unusual is happening and, for many companies, that something is business process management.It is a methodology underpinned by a technology and it is a hot ticket.Accenture, the world’s largest consultancy, already has a global director for BPM, Jim Adamczyk.He describes it as a mindset: “It is something that has mostly been going on for a long time. What has changed is the convergence of the business need for process engineering with the evolution of technology that lets people build systems flexible enough to supply the need.”In a new book* Kiran Garimella, Michael Lees and Bruce Williams of Software AG, the European consultancy, say that BPM represents a culmination of all the collective experience, thinking and professional development in business management over the past several decades.“It’s customer first. It’s business focused, it empowers people in all corners of a business to be more successful. It brings people and systems together. BPM is where all the lofty goals and best strategies are coming home to roost,” they say.It sounds too good to be true and it has already attracted the attention of a string of software houses and consultancies from the “pure play” vendors such as Pegasystems, Savvion and Lombardi at one end to the big “stack” vendors including Oracle and IBM at the other.It is easy to see why Mr Adamczyk worries: “I fear that this is being hyped as one of our endless series of silver bullets, but at core we are trying to align the domain of the business – what the business needs – with what IT can understand and build.”What is driving the adoption of BPM? Ram Menon, head of worldwide marketing for the pure play vendor Tibco, argues that increasing business complexity is the chief cause: “At the core, it’s about agility, efficiency and productivity. Businesses are continually under pressure to get more work done with fewer resources.“Regulatory compliance is another driver. Rules such as the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments directive (MiFID) and Sarbanes-Oxley in the US have a significant process dimension. In healthcare, it’s HIPAA. Almost every industry has its list of compliance requirements.“Used appropriately, BPM helps companies streamline processes, reduce cycle times and get things done faster. This frees employees to focus on areas where they can add real value.”BPM provides the tools to enable organisations to examine, analyse and improve their processes, with a process being anything that transforms resources and materials into products or services.“This transformation is how a business works; it’s the magic elixir of the enterprise,” say the Software AG authors. “The more effective this transformation, the more successfully you create value.”BPM software provides the technological underpinning that facilitates communication and mobility of data across applications. Only in the past few years has the software become mature enough to be used reliably for this purpose.There are four main phases: process analysis, process design, process automation and business activity monitoring – which provides the feedback for further improvements.Here are two examples of BPM in action.University College London Hospitals comprises seven large hospitals in central London treating hundreds of thousands of in and out-patients each year through a bewilderingly large number of specialisms.Government targets demand that no more than 18 weeks elapse between first referral and the start of treatment. James Thomas, UCLH IT director, knew the existing manual methods of tracking patients through what are known as “care pathways” could not cope.He wanted to introduce technology that would enable tracking by exception. Only if a staging post on the care pathway failed – a missing laboratory report, for example – would a warning flag be raised. The UCLH system sends an e-mail to the individual responsible to alert them to the deficiency.In conjunction with Logica CMG, the consultancy, Mr Thomas used BPM software from Lombardi to map the care pathway for a single specialism, discovering in the process that the first and last thirds of the process are identical. The middle third depends on the particular specialism involved.Business activity monitoring (BAM) software was used to monitor the progress of the patient along the pathway. “It’s your conscience. It’s an incredibly good policeman,” Mr Thomas says.The system will be live across one hospital in the group by the end of this month; the whole of UCLH by the end of the year. But it has not been easy: “Getting people to acknowledge that they work to processes and to document those processes and then work through harmonising those processes is not easy. You’re talking about administrative and clinical staff in different hospital buildings.“Potentially, people might see this as a form of electronic Big Brother that sends them e-mails when they haven’t done something. We have to turn that on its head and say the task facing us is too big for our current way of working – this is something to help us break up and digest the problem.”At Wells Fargo Financial, Mr Smith was concerned that it was taking too long to complete certain business processes. The test bed for the BPM software that he brought in was the process that tracked the answers the bank gave customers who asked for a loan.“The specific issue was: how to track the salesperson’s response to the customer after a decision had been made on a loan. If the customer failed to take up the loan even if it was approved, what was the reason,” Mr Smith says.Tracking the process manually would have required hiring another 20 staff across the US; four were already in place.The BPM software took four months to install – Mr Smith blames the delay on his team’s reluctance to use “agile” development methods rather than the tried and tested “waterfall” technique – but it resulted in automating the process for the whole of North America using three rather than the four existing staff.The bank has implemented a number of BPM systems after that first deployment. In one, the process for adding a new merchant to the bank’s private label credit card product, which used to take weeks now takes only a day or so.Mr Smith says that, with so many BPM vendors, it is important to choose the most appropriate by bringing them into the facility and asking them to interface with the existing systems.These two examples demonstrate important principles of BPM deployment.First, the need to start in a small way – a single process such as Mr Thomas’s patient care pathway or Mr Smith’s loan agreement is enough for proof of concept.Second, the need to capture the hearts and the minds of the people who have to use the system. Mr Thomas insisted, for example, that hospital staff would not have to use new techniques or undergo extra training to make full use of the system.Rod Favaron, chief executive of Lombardi, says companies will see three kinds of benefits from BPM, properly deployed: effficiency, effectiveness and agility.“In the era of Service Oriented Architecture and on-demand market messages, agility is a well understood concept. In the world of process management, the ability to change quickly is essential,” he says.“Customers on average change their key processes between four and seven times a year. New opportunities can arise. New partners or customers need you to support a different way of doing business.“Government regulations can require companies to change their processes. BPM provides the platform they need to be able to change processes faster and in a more controlled fashion than any other option.”*BPM Basics for Dummies by Kiran Garimella, Michael Lees and Bruce Williams, Wiley Publishing.

783;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-05-13T06:01:41Z;Event processing: A monitor that can set alarms ringing;;Complex event processing (CEP) is a nascent three-letter acronym for an old concept: a way of sifting masses of business data in real time to enable patterns to be discerned and better business decisions made.It can be thought of, along with Service Oriented Architecture and Business Activity Monitoring, as an essential component of a Business Process Management suite of software.A white paper from BEA Systems, the middleware group now in the process of being taken over by Oracle, says the goal of CEP is to enable information contained in the events flowing through all layers of the organisation to be discovered, understood in terms of its macro-level impact and acted upon in real time.Put together business process management and complex event processing and you get intelligent business processes that react to changing conditions in real time, providing continuous visibility, BEA says.Signals that cause the CEP system to raise an alarm can come either from the outside – a particular item of data causes a reaction – or from the inside, where the system itself polls its sources on a regular basis looking for significant change. Legacy systems are not typically event-driven: this additional layer of software is needed to coordinate their activities.Traditionally, CEP has been the preserve of the financial community, used to support algorithmic trading, where computers are programmed to make automated decisions on when to buy and sell and how to execute a set of orders.Computer systems can act at a speed that would be impossible for any human trader tasked with monitoring separate flows of information – stock prices on one set of screens, for example, and world news on another – looking for correlations that might suggest a trade is desirable.CEP, business activity monitoring and business process management are spreading well beyond the financial services industries, however. Phil Gilbert, president of Lombardi, a specialist US-based BPM software group, says the company has been working with Dell Computer for several years.“With Fedex and UPS we are coordinating Dell’s global computer shipments,” he says. “We receive real-time feeds from third-party logistics carriers for the status of every single shipment.“The moment any of those goes into a ‘distressed’ state, the software fires off a dispatch in real time to people in the call centre based on who the customer is and in what geography. Humans can then deal with the exception and ensure the computer is delivered. Over the course of the past four or five years, this has saved Dell hundreds of millions of dollars.”Dr Giles Nelson, director of technology for the European arm of the US-based group Progress Software, says systems of this kind have been around – but with disadvantages.“Either people would have had to build a bespoke system tailored for a particular use (and therefore expensive and inflexible) or they would have used a database management system,” he says.“All the data would have been brought in and stored in the DBMS which would have been structured to provide answers to queries easily. It would not have scaled. With the quantities of data involved, you would not have been able to get an answer quickly enough.“An event processing system turns the DBMS concept on its head, saying: ‘We know pretty well what question we want, we know what pattern of behaviour we are looking at in all this data’. CEP enables you to do that better.”Dr Nelson objects to use of the term “complex” and last month IBM renamed it “business event processing” in an attempt to demystify the subject. But whatever it is called, it is becoming critical to modern business.Colin Clarke, vice-president for customers at the event processing company StreamBase Systems, points to the dangers that CEP addresses.“Recent high-profile examples such as the meltdown at Société Générale have shown the dangers inherent in relying on anything less than monitoring profit and loss and risk-based exposure in real time, “ he says.“Trading systems that monitor not only for anomalies but also for risks inherent in trading must trigger affirmative, swift action.”He acknowledges the problem of the sheer volume of data modern businesses have to deal with.“Real time profit and loss systems and portfolio stress-testing require platforms able not only to handle tremendous volumes but also to incorporate complicated pricing algorithms that correctly price complex securities while capturing intricate interactions between diverse asset classes,” he argues.Indeed, research across Europe commissioned this year by Progress Software indicated that 75 per cent of business managers are expected to absorb data from at least 11 regions.The demand for comprehensive, accurate and current business information was also found to be acute and 88 per cent of businesses said they needed better information flow up and down the supply chain. Only 50 per cent of businesses canvassed had access to information in real-time.“In a world where large enterprises are bombarded with 1m events a second,” BEA Systems concludes, “CEP is the only technology able to filter out unnecessary data, recognise patterns and aggregate, process and derive composite events that matter.”
784;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:00:27+0000;Derren Brown, Garrick Theatre, London;;"Thanks to numerous television outings, Derren Brown is Britain’s most recognised “psychological magician” (his term). A few years ago he played Russian roulette live on TV. Mercifully his new show is far gentler fare, but no less impressive for it.From the off there is an enjoyably wry sense of humour; a video screen talks us through a few fairly standard concentration exercises, with inevitably surprising results. When the man himself takes to the stage he is surprisingly likeable, with a nice line in politely smutty banter.The first half of the show offers a range of Guess The Card tricks and phone calls to unsuspecting friends of audience members asking them to guess sequences of numbers. On press night every trick ran like clockwork, eliciting gasps of surprise from the participants.Following the interval, Brown explains his fascination with the Oracle Act – a popular routine from the early 1900s in which the magician would receive questions from unidentified members of the audience in sealed envelopes and then proceed to identify first the questioner, then the question, and finally the answer without opening the envelope, by asking a series of questions to which he receives “yes” or “no” answers.Brown puts the act in context by performing a couple of routines from the largely fraudulent psychics and mediums of the era. While he disavows any claims to spiritual phenomena, the results of these séance-style goings-on are quite spectacular. However, it is the Oracle Act that really defies belief. Brown’s correct guess rate is astounding: he repeatedly pulls the right names, numbers, occupations and private fears apparently out of thin air. He then blindfolds himself, and dispenses with the cards, building to a crescendo where he works on several audience members at a time.In some ways this is a slight evening in the theatre. Other than pondering how the tricks might be done, there isn’t much to chew over here. But in terms of sheer astonishment, it is hard to think of a theatrical equal."
785;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-30T18:22:28Z;Slowdown at SAP;;The prospect of implementing an SAP program for the first time tends to bring managers out in a sweat. Investors anticipating the software company’s results have learnt to feel the same way. On Wednesday SAP shares dropped 3 per cent after its first-quarter numbers missed expectations.Sales of new licences, which contribute about half of sales, were weak. Because these should generate follow-up maintenance contracts, they are a good signal about future growth. The Americas were particularly weak: excluding the impact of recently acquired Business Objects, licence sales fell almost 10 per cent year on year. An exceptional first-quarter performance in 2007 does offer some mitigation but a tougher market fits the darkening picture painted by US competitor Oracle at the end of March. It is taking longer for software customers to sign contracts and deal sizes are down.SAP has stuck confidently to full-year guidance for overall sales growth (excluding Business Objects) of 12 per cent to 14 per cent. With the first quarter at the bottom of the range, that looks optimistic. SAP sells software with claimed strategic benefits for businesses, which provides some protection from the cycle. But, if the economic outlook worsens, SAP will feel the impact of sweeping cuts to capital expenditure budgets.The group has another problem in that it still largely relies on selling software to big companies. SAP is targeting smaller businesses with its first foray into an online, on-demand service called Business ByDesign. But the move is proving harder than expected. SAP had hoped to have 10,000 mid-market customers by 2010 but it is, by its own admission, 12 to 18 months behind target. The roll-out has been reduced to just six countries this year. It makes sense to proceed slowly in order to get the product right but continued difficulties in this competitive segment will raise concerns over SAP’s long-term growth prospects.Post and read comments on this Lex
786;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-30T17:22:20Z;SAP delays software rollout;;SAP on Wednesday delayed the roll-out of its new online software for medium-sized businesses – a crucial part of its growth plans – and reported a steep fall in first-quarter profits.The German group had hoped to generate €1bn from supplying its internet-based Business ByDesign software to 10,000 small to medium-sized customers by 2010. However, it said that it would take 12-18 months longer than expected to reach this target.Business ByDesign is the company’s first foray into web-hosted software for the mid-market. Companies such as SAP and IBM are trying to cater for smaller customers as orders from big enterprises slow. The small business IT market is estimated to be worth about $400bn, but potential suppliers face stiff competition from entrenched competitors such as Microsoft.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said SAP was slowing down the roll-out as it looked for ways to reduce the cost of running the internet services. “We need to automate the running of the services, otherwise the cost base will be too high and the profit will not be good enough,” he said.Mr Kagermann has promised that margins from the internet business will be the same as those of SAP’s other businesses. “I want to prove to the market that this way of selling software will not lead to a margin decline.”While the company looks for ways to cut running costs, it will limit roll-out of Business ByDesign to just six countries and fewer than 1,000 customers.SAP missed analysts’ estimates for its results for the three months to the end of March, reporting a 15 per cent increase in software and services revenues to €1.74bn, against expectations of around €1.8bn.The weak results echo a disappointing performance by US rival Oracle last month, and compound fears that the software market may be slowing in the uncertain economic climate.Mr Kagermann said the US remained a tough market, with customers spending less on software deals. He saw no signs of a slowdown spreading to Europe.US sales, which account for a quarter of revenues, fell by 1 per cent, while European sales, which account for half of SAP’s business, rose 22 per cent.Total revenues were €2.46bn ($3.8bn), up 14 per cent from a year ago. But net income fell 22 per cent to €242m, as SAP was hit by €130m in charges related to its acquisition of Business Objects last year, and a €40m investment in the Business ByDesign service.Earnings per share fell 19 per cent to €0.21.SAP reiterated forecasts that software and services revenues would grow 24 to 27 per cent at constant currencies this year, and said operating margins, excluding costs related to Business Objects, would be higher than expected because it was cutting back investment in Business ByDesign.
787;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-24T02:21:37Z;Economy: New brew helps region achieve prosperity;;The recent decision to close the Scottish & Newcastle brewery, a landmark on the M4 near Reading, is emblematic of the change in the Thames Valley economy over the past decade.Long famous for the Courage brewery, the end of brewing in the town marks the final demise of its three historic industries of beer, biscuits and bulbs.Now, the sprawling campuses of Microsoft and Oracle are a far better symbol of the town’s prosperity. Close to the doomed brewery, drivers on the M4 can also see a tower identifying GreenPark, a large commercial office park where Cisco Systems has its headquarters.The Thames Valley’s £32bn-plus ($63bn) economy is now dominated by knowledge-based industries, primarily information and communications technology and life sciences.With Heathrow acting as a magnet for large international groups, especially from the US, space for business to grow and a healthy labour market, the sub-region has been growing at a pace. The direct labour force amounts to 641,000 people, but the total workforce within an hour of the Thames Valley towns is close to 3.7m.In the past five years, the Thames Valley has been the UK’s fastest growing region, averaging 3.5 per cent economic growth after inflation, well ahead of the 2.5 per cent national average. It is also due to grow 2.6 per cent this year, with some predictions of faster growth than any other region in Europe.Productivity is high, averaging £49,000 per worker in 2006, £8,600 higher than the south-east average. And the workforce is skilled: 29 per cent of employment is in the knowledge economy, compared with the national average of 17 per cent, and 37 per cent of people in employment hold a degree.One-fifth of Thames Valley workers are employed in managerial and senior positions, five points higher than the UK average.But the figures do not tell the whole story.In particular, the lack of basic skills among large parts of the population, notably in Reading and Slough, causes concern.Tim Smith, of Reading UK CIC, the economic development company, says: “We have got some serious pockets of underactivity. As much as 20 per cent of Reading residents lack basic skills.”“The skills of the indigenous Reading population have not kept pace with the emerging ICT businesses that have made Reading their home.”High house prices are also exacerbating problems around affordability and inequality, doubling across the sub-region since 1998.The Thames Valley is one of the most entrepreneurial parts of the UK, with new business start-ups making up more than 10 per cent of all companies. Windsor and Maidenhead have the highest number of business start-ups in the UK.And with more than 500 Californian companies based in the sub-region, it is easy to see why Peter Norris, project director at the Thames Valley Economic Partnership, says: “We want to be Silicon Valley-like.”Yet historically, the area has lagged places such as the US in entrepreneurial activity. “A few years ago we were not Silicon Valley-like in terms of enterprise and innovation,” says Mr Norris. “We had no brand for innovation and were seen as a place for global companies.”But he says that this is changing, backed by a number of initiatives and business networks, and as the large global companies spawn spin-offs and attract clusters of smaller specialist companies around them.“What we want is high growth, creative and innovative world-beaters,” he says.Vodafone, Microsoft and Oracle, in particular, have bred start-ups, often with former employees licensing unused intellectual property.The Key Revolution is just such a business. Three former Vodafone employees have licensed technology to use mobile phone Sim cards as a secure gateway to the internet.Miles Cheetham, its chief marketing officer, says it is a relatively new model for Vodafone but offers huge potential scope to develop the technology. In addition, he believes the Thames Valley, with its huge network of IT and communications talent, is the ideal place for such businesses to develop.“We have used our old networks as much as we can and called in favours from old pals. There is a very supportive environment in the Thames Valley,” he says.The Thames Valley’s research and development capabilities are also often overlooked, says Mr Norris. Nineteen of the top 20 life sciences companies in the UK have a base in the Thames Valley and west London. “There are more people employed in R&D in the Thames Valley than in Oxford and Cambridge combined,” adds Mr Norris.It is undoubtedly the international inward investment that has transformed the Thames Valley, and while the US has continued to account for about half of all new investment projects, and a huge proportion of the new companies are still in the software sector, the origins of the investment is changing.“The French and the Australians have accounted for the biggest increase in inward investment over the past 12 months,” says Aengus Murray at TVEP. “Judged by the number of new projects, Australia is now making up 14 per cent of the investment into the Thames Valley.”Almost inevitably, the proportion of Chinese and Indian companies is increasing too.However, the long-standing base of inward investment could be weakened by international market conditions. With the prospects of an American downturn, Mr Murray says the number of inquiries from US companies has slowed markedly so far this year.Given the Thames Valley economy’s growth path and international reach, though, that may not matter too much.
788;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-24T02:21:37Z;IT & Telecommunications: Home for technology giants and minnows;;The past 20 years have seen the Thames Valley develop from a relative backwater to become a vital European hub for the telecommunications and information technology industries.Almost 80 per cent of inward investment to the region in 2006-07 was within the IT, software and communications sector and so vital has it become that it is sometimes nicknamed “Europe’s Silicon Valley”.It is home to both extensive operations of the world’s largest names and the ambitions of start-up companies alike, with Vodafone, Siemens, Hutchison 3G and Ericsson just some of the many companies based there. Only this February, Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry mobile e-mail device, opened its European headquarters on Slough Trading Estate.Sometimes the region’s nickname appears to take on a literal meaning as 50 per cent of new investments to the region comes from US west coast technology companies looking to expand into the UK and the rest of Europe. Microsoft, Oracle, Dell and Cisco Systems all have large research and development centres.Smaller start-up companies from Europe, including France and the Czech Republic, are also attracted by the region. According to the annual investment review for the area published by the Thames Valley Economic Partnership, 54 foreign-owned, high-growth businesses have invested in the region for the first time in the last year.Companies from around the world have been attracted by a skilled, mobile workforce, the transport hub of Heathrow, the proximity to London, competitive tax breaks and – especially for North American companies – an English-speaking population.“More than 1m UK jobs depend on the success of the ICT sector which generates more than 6 per cent of GDP. Its importance to our economy is unquestionable,” says Lord Digby Jones, the former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. “It is no coincidence that many ICT firms have their European HQ as well as their research and development operation based here,” he adds.“The Thames Valley has been a feeding ground for ideas rather than a manufacturing centre,” says Karl Havers, head of Ernst & Young’s UK technology practice, and based at its Reading office.The increasing convergence between technology and telecom worlds has created a wealth of opportunities that are being filled by small, dynamic companies.The software industry in particular is rapidly growing as it evolves to become the “brain” within technology hardware. Last year saw 67 per cent of the investors looking to expand into the UK offering software related products and services.As in previous years, companies from North America accounted for around 60 per cent of the new investment, but companies from the Asia Pacific region are also moving in. Japan’s Just Systems, which provides XML and service oriented architecture, is locating its European headquarters in Slough.A virtuous circle has also been created in which companies are finding it easier to look for skilled local talent. According to the Thames Valley Economic Partnership, 55 per cent of the UK’s software workforce in the south-east is based in the Thames Valley.Markets are also being created for ancillary and infrastructure services. Small companies, such as France’s Mobilgov, are striving to improve corporate and organisational security, both online and against the threat from the use of unauthorised equipment, such as PDAs, smartphones, USB sticks, and external and internal hard drives.New datacentres are being built to contain the vast consumption of data from telecoms companies and internet service providers such as O2, Vodafone and Orange. IX Europe, bought last year by its US peer Equinix, will relocate its largest London datacentre to a new £15m ($29m) centre built in Slough.Other companies in the region include Newbury-based Micro Focus, which supports and extends the life of legacy software based on Cobol software coding that still performs vital functions in large companies.All have realised that it is vital to be physically located close to partners and resellers of their technology.Yet the region’s fortunes remain closely tied to the world’s technology and telecom world. Old-timers remember that many US companies pulled out of the area in the wake of the dotcom slump, while even as recently as 2005, there was a surplus of office space.Despite fears about a slowdown in global technology spending, there is little evidence of large-scale pull-outs, according to Mike Baker, partner at Strutt & Parker, the property consultants. Although overall office take-up for the region was down from 1m sq ft a year ago to 623,000, the computer and technology sector’s market share remained the same. “The sector is more than holding its own,” he says.But Mr Havers at E&Y warns that the evolving nature of technology means companies also have to change, particularly in the type of staff they recruited.“If you need to work across cultures, you need to get it right,” he cautions. “You will get all sorts of partnerships. If you’re selling a product, you’ll also need to sell the best service. You’re talking about trust and relationships.”
789;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-24T02:21:37Z;Heart and soul of the UK economy;;The Thames Valley has many faces. It is the M4 corridor of US companies, the rural beauty of the Berkshire downs, the history of Windsor, the affluence of Henley and Eton, the new town of Bracknell, the immigration of Slough, and the resurgent confidence of Reading.Centred on Berkshire, but stretching into south Oxfordshire and north Hampshire, it is difficult to identify its boundaries clearly. To the rest of the nation, it lacks a strong regional presence.But with a net contribution of almost £4bn ($8bn) to public coffers, there can be little doubt that the Treasury at least is aware of the “sub-region’s” attributes.The Thames Valley has transformed itself in the past 25 years, and the changes are continuing at a pace. Taken as a whole, the sub-region is the most potent economic area outside London.Jim Braithwaite, chairman of the South East England Development Agency, says: “It is the heart and soul of the British economy. The Thames Valley is the engine-room of everything we do.”Fuelled by the Heathrow phenomenon that brought US software and IT companies to a convenient location near London, the sub-region is now the hub for the ITC and life sciences sectors.The statistics speak for themselves: higher than average productivity, almost 30 per cent of employment in the knowledge economy, a skilled but tight labour market and earnings almost 10 per cent higher than the south-east average.Yet the perception of some Thames Valley towns still lags reality.Slough is indeed the most ethnically diverse town in the UK, with the largest Sikh community in the country and the biggest Muslim community in the south-east, and where 80 languages are spoken. At the same time, it is home to more European corporate headquarters than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined.The site of the world’s first industrial estate, it has moved on from manufacturing and Slough Trading Estate, where the BBC comedy The Office was set, is undergoing a much-needed redevelopment to cater to the knowledge economy.Reading, a market town 40 years ago, is entering the second stage of its urban renaissance. It is the capital of the Thames Valley, where Microsoft and Oracle have large campuses, large new developments have transformed the town centre into one of the top ten UK retail destinations, and its football team plays premiership football in a recently built stadium.The Thames Valley sees itself in competition as a business location not with other UK regions but other European destinations, such as Paris, Frankfurt or Amsterdam. It has done well by those comparisons in the past two decades. But it now faces challenges if it is to maintain its competitive edge.There is some irony in the fact that it must grapple with shortcomings in two of the factors that have underpinned its success: transport infrastructure and skills.A fifth of areas in Reading and a quarter in Slough are among the 10 per cent most deprived in the south-east. More than 10 per cent of the working age population of Slough have no qualifications at all.And while its connections to London and overseas remain arguably its greatest asset, increasing road congestion, inadequate rail services and, most visibly, Heathrow Airport’s capacity and access problems threaten to undermine its edge.The travel factor cannot be underestimated as the workforce relies to a great extent on the road network. For example, 40,000 people commute into Slough to work, while 30,000 commute out every day.The recent Terminal 5 debacle, which served just to exacerbate the complaints of “Heathrow hassle” among industry leaders, leaves Thames Valley businesses seething. “I shudder when anything happens to Heathrow or the M4,” says Mr Braithwaite.Not a region that has historically taken a vociferous lobbying role, Thames Valley businesses and public sector bodies have been increasingly forthright, particularly on transport issues.There is a widespread perception that the sub-region is used too much as a cash cow for the Treasury, with too little of its tax contribution being returnedby government in the form of investment. This prosperous part of the south-east is not seen as an investment priority in Whitehall, many believe.Ruth Bagley, chief executive of Slough Borough Council, says that of the £80m Slough which collects in business rates, it gets back just £42m as part of its grant. “Unless it continues to be supported, our economy will risk declining,” she warns.The potential “tipping point” for the Thames Valley – the moment at which the sub-region’s advantages are eroded to such a point that skills and businesses depart – was identified in a 2006 report by Deloitte, the professional services firm.It highlighted potential contributing factors for a decline, including inadequate infrastructure, pressure from Heathrow, near full capacity in the labour market, skills shortages, declining productivity growth and high costs from pay levels and industrial rents.Similar concerns were picked up this year in a “state of the sub-region report” produced by Berkshire’s local councils. It pointed to poor direct links to Heathrow from the west, a lack of affordable accommodation for business and employees alike, and concerns that the much vaunted Crossrail project could actually result in the loss of rail capacity into London as it will need dedicated tracks.The authorities also warned that priorities for the sub-region were “at best, incoherent”, with few links to government to lobby for political and resource support.Of course, the lack of a coherent voice is exacerbated by the existence of the plethora of different councils in the sub-region with varying political priorities: there are six separate unitary authorities in Berkshire and another two outside in Basingstoke and Deane and Wycombe District.Ms Bagley says: “The six unitaries in Berkshire have traditionally worked independently of each other on their economic agenda, and some have done very little.”However, she says that this is beginning to change, as the local authorities realise they need to understand their economies better and as government starts to devolve spending to local authorities rather than the regional development agencies.There has also been good cross-party co-operation recently on the transport agenda, with strong support from Martin Salter, Reading’s Labour MP, and Theresa May, the Conservative MP for Maidenhead.One sign of that increased co-operation is the creation of a new economic strategy board for Berkshire, made up of representatives from all the local councils as well as private sector figures, which will work to form a unified economic plan. The board had its first meeting this month.Some are disturbed by the chatter of a tipping point, feeling such negative projection could damage the Thames Valley’s image. But Ian Smith, senior partner at accountants PwC in Reading and a member of the new economic strategy board, insists it has been helpful to ensure that such a point is never reached.“We are getting nowhere near the tipping point,” he says. “But we have made more noise on these issues and it’s focused people’s minds more.”Many agree that Heathrow expansion and a direct western link to the airport are critical priorities for the sub-region. And the increased noise has met with some success, notably Reading Borough Council’s five-year lobbying effort to secure a £425m upgrade for the town’s rail station, crucial for removing a bottleneck in the routes west of London.However, as Tim Smith, of Reading UK CIC, the economic development company, says of the push to secure funding for the station upgrade: “It shouldn’t be that hard.”The concern that large international companies could easily leave the region is less of a worry as they have grown in the area, Mr Smith believes. “The big change over the past five years is our global players are much more integrated with the local community and so we are much less vulnerable to being treated as a parking lot.”That is borne out by the decision of Vodafone, a home-grown multinational, to stay in Newbury when it built its new headquarters a few years ago. Billy Davidson, its group property manager, says the company considered moving but concluded the combination of labour availability, costs, access to London and quality of life was unbeatable.He says: “A big part of the decision to stay was the labour force in the Thames Valley and that we have great employees located in and around Newbury. And in some respects it was an economic choice, too, because compared with London and Bristol further down the M4, it is a relatively cheap location.“The nature of our sector means more people are choosing to work remotely and avoid the rush hour. And if you’re talking about work-life balance, then the fact that 40 per cent of our guys live within 10 miles of the office is fantastic.”

The cap was set at 65,000 in 1990 and although that number was raised to as much as 195,000 during the dot-com boom it was subsequently allowed to fall back to the original limit.Last year immigration authorities received applications for more than twice the number of available visas in the first two days alone, forcing the government to hold a lottery and leaving many companies disappointed.“There has to be a better way,” Robert Hoffman, vice-president of government and public affairs at Oracle, the software company, said. “We are dealing with an immigration policy that clearly does not benefit the US economy.” Congressional attempts to increase boost numbers failed last year after the issue became bogged down in ill-fated attempts to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill.The government has made available another 20,000 visas to graduates with master’s degrees from US universities and last week it announced an interimrule to extend the time that some foreign-born students with specific degrees may remain in corporate training programmes. However, a government spokesperson said any increase in the cap would have to be approved by Congress.Legislators introduced three separate bills to reform the H-1B system but they face an uphill battle to win support because US politicians are cautious about taking a stand on immigration issues, companies said.Business leaders claim the US economy is the biggest loser. Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, told Congress last month that US companies were being forced to locate staff in countries that welcome skilled foreign workers as a result of visa caps.
791;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-07T07:04:29Z;Microsoft/Yahoo;;Is Microsoft finally getting ready to play hard? During the two months of phoney war since the software giant launched its unsolicited offer for Yahoo, it has avoided doing a Larry Ellison. Given the integration and regulatory risks inherent in buying Yahoo, a friendly deal makes more sense than a bloody battle along the lines of those waged by Mr Ellison’s Oracle in recent years.But the softly, softly approach has made no headway. Microsoft’s latest letter to Yahoo explicitly threatens a proxy fight, and the chance it will reduce the value of its offer (initially pitched at a 62 per cent premium).It is a credible threat. Yahoo has no suitor to match Microsoft’s bid. Given recent mis-steps and the strength of rival Google, investors would be brave to bet on a straight Yahoo turnround.In fact, Yahoo’s best negotiating position seems to be Microsoft’s desperation to acquire the internet portal – as a last chance of catching Google – coupled with the hope that Microsoft will not risk outright war. After all, it could take a year to clear regulatory hurdles in the US and Europe. A rudderless Yahoo could continue losing ground to Google.The stand-off looks like a battle over how much Yahoo’s backing is really worth to Microsoft. The answer is: probably a few dollars. Microsoft originally bid $31 per share. The implied offer has slipped to about $29.50 as Microsoft’s stock has fallen.Even at this stage, Microsoft cannot really want to follow through on its threat of cutting its offer and waging an aggressive proxy fight. Given the strategic importance of the deal for Microsoft, Yahoo should still be able to push the bid above $31. But it is a delicate balance.The longer Yahoo holds off, the more desperate Microsoft will become. That could force it to raise its offer to secure a deal. It could also mean Microsoft loses patience and goes nuclear. Unless the two sides start talking soon and avoid a bitter showdown, it is Google that will emerge as the clear winner.Post and read comments on this Lex
792;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-06T22:32:45Z;Yahoo board huddles over Microsoft bid;;Yahoo’s directors were in discussions late on Sunday about Microsoft’s latest gambit in its unsolicited takeover approach, amid signs that the embattled internet company was preparing to dig in deeper against its suitor’s current bid.“The offer still undervalues us,” said one person close to Yahoo, after Microsoft hinted that it might reduce its original offer if Yahoo continued to turn its back on negotiations.The weekend discussions at Yahoo were called hurriedly to consider a response to a letter from Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, which was made public on Saturday.The letter, which amounts to Microsoft’s first official statement since it disclosed its bid more than two months ago, signalled the software company’s impatience at the lack of any headway and its attempt to turn up the heat on Yahoo’s board.Mr Ballmer promised an all-out takeover battle before the end of the month and hinted that Microsoft would cut the value of its offer if negotiations did not start soon. “If we are forced to take an offer directly to your shareholders, that action will have an undesirable impact on the value of your company from our perspective, which will be reflected in the terms of our proposal,” he wrote.A person close to Microsoft refused to confirm this meant it would cut the value of its offer but called Mr Ballmer’s letter “self-explanatory”.The value of Microsoft’s cash-and-stock bid has slipped from its original $31 a share as the software company’s own stock has fallen, taking it to $29.36 a share at Friday’s close, or about $42bn.The decline gave Yahoo even less reason to change its stance, the person close to Yahoo said.Speculation has been rife on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley that Microsoft would eventually sweeten its bid for Yahoo, at least taking it back to the original $31 and potentially lifting it higher in return for a negotiated deal.In hostile takeover fights in the US, threats to cut the value of a bid are not unusual and are sometimes followed by eventual increases. Larry Ellison, chief executive officer of Oracle, has used the tactic in his own hostile deals, threatening to reduce his offer for BEA Systems last year and actually reducing his bid for PeopleSoft before eventually paying a higher premium for both companies.In his letter, Mr Ballmer argued that in the two months since Microsoft first revealed its bid, “the public equity markets and overall economic conditions have weakened considerably, both in general and for other internet-focused companies in particular”.At the same time, public indicators suggest that Yahoo’s search and page view shares have declined. Finally, you have adopted new plans at the company that have made any change of control more costly.”In one sign of Wall Street’s growing concern about the state of the internet advertising market on which Yahoo depends, shares in rival Google have fallen by 16 per cent over the past two months.
793;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-06T18:18:01Z;Techs buck the trend on debt;;With the US economy turning down and some corners of the debt markets in turmoil, financial leverage has been going out of fashion fast. But that has done little to slow a sea-change in the balance sheets of some of the technology industry’s leading lights.Last week, Dell said it would become the latest to relax its traditionally conservative financial structure. Don Carty, the computer-maker’s chief financial officer, said: “We do expect to access capital markets to increase our leverage.”On the same day Oracle tapped bond markets for $5bn, the biggest debt offering by a tech company in 18 months, to finance its purchase of BEA Systems.Meanwhile, bond investors are preparing for the debut of the industry’s biggest cash machine: Microsoft. The software company has said it will turn to the market for the first time if it pulls off its cash-and-stocks offer for Yahoo, worth $42bn.The willingness of tech companies to contemplate greater leverage reflects a historic shift in capital structure, whatever the shorter-term cycles in the economy or the financial markets. Some companies that once believed they needed big financial cushions have become willing to increase financial risk to increase shareholder returns or make acquisitions.Brent Thill, software analyst at Citigroup, said the annual maintenance fees charged by mature software companies amounted to a “really reliable, high-margin part of the business that generates a lot of cash to support higher debt”.You’re seeing an increasing trend [for using debt],” he said.The willingness to contemplate big debt-financed acquisitions is a sign of the change in outlook.A borrowing binge by chip companies pushed debt-raising by tech companies to a previous peak in 2006, before a cyclical downturn.Not all these moves paid off. AMD’s assumption of debt to buy graphic chipmaker ATI in 2006 weakened the semiconductor company as it came under a new competitive assault from Intel. It eventually turned to sovereign investor Abu Dhabi to rebuild its finances.But this year the tech industry’s borrowing is back on track to hit new records.Additional reporting by Kevin Allison
794;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-05T03:53:57Z;Buffett shows Gates the way on investments;;"Warren Buffett may trust Bill Gates to spend his money wisely, but Gates has been wise to defer to his long-standing friend on how best to invest it.Several months after the “sage of Omaha” promised most of his fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2006, his pledged Berkshire Hathaway shares were its largest single equity stake. And they out-performed the foundation’s other investments, offering an early hint of Buffett’s overtaking of Gates this year as the world’s richest man, according to Forbes magazine’s annual rankings.Gates and his fund managers say little publicly about their stock-picking habits, but US regulations mean they are required to publish details of how the foundation’s $33bn endowment is invested. The result reveals a cautious investment policy, with returns a little below the benchmark for US endowments and more preference for “old economy” industrial investments and government bonds than risk-taking “new” sectors, such as information technology.Anyone hoping to use the data to mirror Gates’s investment policy faces a frustrating barrier: the time-lag on the documents posted online late last year means that they provide information only for 2006.Nevertheless, the document, the US Internal Revenue Service’s 990-PF that runs to 422 pages, offers intriguing insights into how the foundation’s advisers balance maximising long-term returns with sufficient liquidity to fund short-term spending.The filings may also, by extension, reveal something of the investment strategy of Gates’s own estimated $56bn fortune, given that BGI – Bill Gates Investments – looks after not only the foundation’s money but also his personal fortune.The bulk of the filings are devoted to the minutiae of grant giving, providing plenty of nuggets for those trying to seek funding from the foundation, which stresses that it does not accept unsolicited requests.But dozens of pages also list its individual investments. These show that the foundation held on to the entire first tranche of $1.6bn in Berkshire Hathaway shares that Buffett provided.After Buffett pledged the bulk of his fortune over a number of years to the Gates foundation, the entity split in two, creating the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to spend the money, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Asset Trust to manage it.Buffett, while now a joint trustee along with Gates and his wife in the former, has no direct role in the latter, reinforcing conflict of interest rules. And the foundation says it respects government rules to avoid excess business holdings in a single company.But the fund managers clearly trusted Buffett’s investment insight. They had long taken the decision to diversify its portfolio by selling down the Microsoft shares that Gates regularly pledges to it, one reason that he is personally no longer in Forbes’ assessment the world’s richest man. Yet they held on to Buffett’s shares, at least until the end of 2006. The decision looks wise in hindsight, since the Berkshire Hathaway stake appreciated by 13 per cent to $1.8bn from August-December 2006.Had the foundation placed all of its assets into Berkshire Hathaway shares throughout the year, its value would have risen 23 per cent. In fact, the total reported gains were a more modest 12.3 per cent, or $3.6bn.While foundations are understandably cautious, since they need to ensure long-term growth as well as short-term cash for grants, the Gates foundation is more conservative than many of its peers.The Commonfund Institute in Connecticut estimates that US foundations with endowments of at least $1bn grew on average by 15.6 per cent in 2006.Furthermore, the Gates’s portfolio was more cautious on higher risk investments than others, notably including a more recent aggressive management approach by the UK’s Wellcome Trust, its nearest rival in health philanthropy.The filings show $19bn was held in bonds and notes, with only $13.4bn in equities and smaller proportions in futures, forward contracts, securities lending and $120m in private equity.The foundation keeps no stake in Microsoft and few investments in other software companies except Oracle. But there are considerable sums in pharmaceuticals.Merck, which is among those companies selling HIV medicines and trying to research an Aids vaccine, comes top, with $341m; GlaxoSmithKline, with research and sales in HIV and malaria, also does well by the foundation, with $271m.There could be one other reason why the foundation’s investment policy was intentionally conservative. Under US rules, the more it is worth, the more it must spend.To maintain its low tax status, it must give out 5 per cent of its total assets each year. At a time when it was starting to adjust to the challenge of expanding to cope with Buffett’s enormous pledge, a little caution in spending was understandable.But with a pledge to expend all assets within 50 years of the death of the last of its three trustees, that barrier at least will soon expire."
795;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-04-04T22:43:39Z;Microsoft v Yahoo: Words, words, words;;Microsoft and Yahoo continue to circle each other like wrestlers, each waiting for the other to show its weakness before getting into a clinch. At a time like this, just about anything either side says is pure rhetoric.That is the best interpretation of today’s report that Microsoft is ”evaluating” its bid in the light of deteriorating market conditions. This is a thinly-disguised version of the Larry Ellison treatment: soften up the target by cutting the value of a takeover offer (something Ellison did while Oracle stalked PeopleSoft) or at least threatening to (his treatment of BEA Systems.)Like Reuters, I also talked to “people close to Microsoft” today, but I came away with the distinct feeling that not much has changed. No matter. With the arbs starting to sweat (most were probably thinking they’d have banked a nice profit on this deal by now) Yahoo’s stock has slipped 3 per cent.Only two things are certain. One is that, whatever the rhetoric, Larry Ellison eventually ended up raising his offers to win PeopleSoft and BEA. The other is that the real negotiation between Microsoft and Yahoo will be conducted behind closed doors, not through these public posturings.

The software giant has validated Nokia’s Intellisync Device Management solution for Siebel CRM, which Oracle acquired in 2005, while the Siebel Wireless version of its flagship CRM product is now available for the Nokia E90 communicator.
Finally, Oracle has announced that Oracle Database Lite, its new client database for mobile devices, supports Symbian 9, the leading smartphone operating system.• Investment banks have more pressing concerns at present than optimising office space. But should the bull roar again, AMD of the US has a hardware solution that allows institutions to squeeze in more traders and workstations.
The ATI FireMV 2260 graphics card allows multiple large screens to be crammed into tight desk space, boosting “trader density” and reducing energy consumption.
AMD acquired ATI, a specialist in graphics cards, in 2006.• Dell claims to have edged ahead of arch-rival Hewlett-Packard in the server price/performance race with two new servers aimed at smaller businesses.
The US computer giant says its rack-mounted PowerEdge R300, based on the quad-core Intel Xeon x5460 chip, achieves up to 26 per cent better performance than a comparable system from HP, while the T300, which adopts the traditional tower format, has a claimed 31 per cent performance advantage over HP.
Prices are $1,249 and $999 respectively.• We have heard of mash-ups, but how about smash-ups? IBM has announced Smash, which is designed to overcome security concerns about using mash-ups (which for the uninitiated are web-based applications that draw data from various internet sources).
IBM’s secure mash-up technology allows different web-based sources to talk to each other, but keeps them separate, so malicious code cannot creep into enterprise systems. In true glasnost spirit, IBM is contributing Smash to the OpenAjax Alliance.• Business Objects, now owned by SAP, has announced Xcelsius Engage 2008, the latest version of its data presentation tool that can be used by anyone familiar with a spreadsheet, or so BO claims.
Improvements include a redesigned interface based on Adobe Flash technology and full integration with Microsoft Excel.• Zoho, the US software-as-a-service specialist, has unveiled Zoho People, a human resources application aimed at SMEs with more than 50 employees.
It is available as a beta release and comprises modules for organisation definition, recruitment, forms, checklists and employee self-service. It can be customised and link to other Zoho Saas offerings.• It took 20 years but HP has finally produced an inkjet printer that can cancel print jobs in mid-stream.
Coinciding with the 20th anniversary of the Deskjet range, HP has unveiled the Deskjet D2500, which has a one-touch print cancel button to stop the printing of unwanted pages and so save ink.
In 20 years, the price of the Deskjet printer has tumbled from $995 to $49 for the new D2500.
The same cannot be said for the price of ink, which today is almost as expensive as the printers themselves."
797;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-03-28T19:35:23Z;Europe positive after central banks act;;European shares made strong headway this week, boosted by a positive mood on Wall Street and reassurance from central banks in Europe that they would support money markets.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index managed to hold on to most of its gains, in spite of slipping 0.5 per cent Friday, adding 3.2 per cent over the week to 1265.47.Europe’s bourses, closed on Monday for Easter, surged on Tuesday after Wall Street welcomed JPMorgan’s raised offer for Bear Stearns.“We had a bit of a recovery this week as we scrambled to catch up with gains in the US,” said Nick Nelson, head of European equity strategy at UBS.The downtrodden financial sector was the immediate beneficiary, as companies that suffered heavily in nervous markets last week staged a recovery.They were given a further boost after central banks in the UK and Switzerland added extra funds to money markets in a bid to ease pressure on high interbank lending rates. The European Central Bank said it was also ready to step in.Anglo Irish Bank jumped 11 per cent over the week to €8.71 and UBS gained 3.8 per cent to SFr28.29.Banco Popolare was boosted by 12.5 per cent to €11.55 as investors bet that the Italian bank’s 2007 results, due Saturday, would be better than feared.Germany’s Hypo Real Estate gained from the same phenomenon after its results left investors relieved the news was not worse.The bank’s shares soared 22.8 per cent to €16.49, even though it warned shareholders it could miss its profit targets because of further subprime-related writedowns.Germany’s Commerzbank was one of the week’s biggest winners, adding 16.4 per cent to €20.13. Unlike Deutsche Bank, which warned in its annual report this week that its profits were threatened by market conditions, Commerzbank reiterated its 2008 outlook.There were also rumours Friday that Commerzbank could become part of a three-way merger with Deutsche Postbank and Allianz’s Dresdner unit. Deutsche Postbank added 2.1 per cent to €19.49 while Allianz gained 11.8 per cent to €126.06.While US macroeconomic data remained gloomy, the Ifo survey of German business sentiment rose to a seven-month high in March.“The German economy seems to be muddling through quite well, though whether or not US and European economies are decoupling, their stock markets are tied closely together,” said Kevin Gardiner, global equity strategist at HSBC.Europe’s software companies could testify to that. Ripples quickly spread across the Atlantic when US company Oracle Corp missed revenue forecasts and Lehman Brothers cut its earnings forecast for Google.German competitor SAP fell sharply, but recovered after another US company – Accenture – revealed strong results. SAP ended the week 0.9 per cent up at €31.66, while France’s Cap Gemini added 8.7 per cent to €35.88.Elsewhere, OPAP, Europe’s biggest betting company, jumped 11.6 per cent to €22.20 after the Greek company’s 2007 profits beat expectations.Finnish paper maker Stora Enso took a knock Friday after Moody’s, the rating agency, said it might cut the company’s long-term credit ratings to “junk” status. The shares also fell 7.1 per cent on Thursday after going ex-dividend, but after a strong showing on Tuesday they were only down 1.3 per cent at €7.51 for the week.
798;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-03-27T20:37:21Z;Soothing notes boost Europe’s bank stocks;;Soothing noises from European central bankers helped boost financial stocks Thursday, offsetting weakness in the tech sector and driving key indices into positive territory.The central banks of Britain and Switzerland added extra funds to money markets to ease pressure on high interbank lending rates, while the European Central Bank said it was ready to step in with extra cash as needed.Société Générale rose 1.9 per cent to €64.78, BNP Paribas gained 1.6 per cent to €64.63 and Deutsche Bank was 1.1 per cent higher at €72.85.Better-than-feared results from Germany’s Hypo Real Estate stoked hopes that the toll taken by the credit crunch may now be priced in to European equity markets.The bank’s shares rose 14 per cent to €16.96, even though it warned shareholders it could miss its profit targets amid further writedowns in the wake of market turmoil and its exposure to a €1bn portfolio of collateralised debt obligations rooted in the US mortgage market. There was relief on trading floors that the company’s statement did not contain evidence of fresh problems.Also helping buoy the FTSE Eurofirst, resource stocks rose in line with strengthening commodities markets and renewed bid speculation.French group Eramet was the latest name linked with bid interest from Vale of Brazil after the demise of its talks with London’s Xstrata. Eramet gained 1.6 per cent to €506.21.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 1 per cent to 1,271.59, a rally of 13 points. Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax 30 gained 1.4 per cent to 6,578.06, and the CAC 40 in Paris climbed 0.9 per cent to 4,719.53.Shares in Finnish paper makers UPM-Kymmene and Stora Enso fell as they went ex-dividend, down 7.2 per cent to €11.32 and 7.1 per cent to €7.49 respectively. UPM gained nearly 5 per cent on Wednesday after Jussi Pesonen, chief executive, said demand for paper would continue to be strong in 2008.OPAP, Europe’s biggest betting company, topped the gainers on the Eurofirst 300, jumping 14.2 per cent to €22.84 after the Greek company’s 2007 profits beat expectations.The strong results boosted investor confidence that the monopoly will be able to cope with new competition if Greece deregulates its betting market.In the US, software stocks fell after Oracle Corp missed revenue forecasts and Lehman Brothers cut its earnings forecast for Google. This in turn triggered broad weakness in European technology stocks.German software company SAP fell 4.2 per cent to €31.28, France’s STMicroelectronics dropped 1 per cent to €6.67, and Nokia lost 0.2 per cent to €19.85.German solar cell maker Q-Cells rose 14.7 per cent to €59.24. The company raised its outlook after securing contracts for solar grade silicon from a Canadian supplier.The company added that it would enter the market for developing large-scale solar power projects.Sebastian Growe, an analyst at Equinet, said: “Given Q-Cell’s strategy of quick capacity expansion, paired with cost competitive sourcing, the entry into wafering and huge potentials from the new technologies, Q-Cells should remain at the cutting edge.”Shares in Randstad jumped 10.4 per cent to €29.26 after UBS upgraded the Dutch staffing company to “buy” from “sell” and raised its price target from €25 to €35.The UBS upgrade helped Randstad rivals such as Adecco. Adecco shares rose 1.3 per cent to SFr56.90.
799;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-03-27T20:30:43Z;US shares fall amid earnings concerns;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second day in a choppy trading on Thursday as concerns about earnings in the technology and financial sectors overcame initial enthusiasm at better-than-expected data on employment and growth.On Wednesday night Oracle posted disappointing results which knocked sentiment in the whole sector, analysts said.Third quarter sales at the software company were $5.35bn, undershooting analysts’ forecast for $5.42bn, while net income climbed 30 percent to $1.34bn.Oracle, which is often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector and of the broader business environment, said an increased threat of a recession had made customers more prudent in their technology spending.“[The results] put salt in the wound and reminded people that tech earnings are not going to be as ebullient as was hoped,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The market had a big rally last week and when you are consolidating you are vulnerable to almost anything - good news, no news or bad news.”Oracle shares dropped 7.2 per cent to $19.43. Fellow software companies Microsoft and Akamai Technologies also slipped - 1.8 per cent to $28.05 and 6.4 per cent to $30.06, respectively.Meanwhile, Google stocks dropped, 3.1 per cent to $444.08, after the internet search company said it had seen slower growth in clicks on text ads, adding to worries about an economic slowdown.The Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.9 per cent at 2,280.83 points while the benchmark S&P500 index - which rose as much as 0.3 per cent before falling back - dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,325.78 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1 per cent to 12,302.70 points.Banks remained in focus after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said that Merrill Lynch and UBS may post losses this quarter on write-downs of $6bn and $11.1bn, respectively, due to escalating credit problems.Merrill shares fell 5.7 per cent to $41.90 and an index of investment banking stocks slid 5.1 per cent.On Wednesday Ms Whitney slashed her earnings estimates for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 by an average of 84 per cent for a number of related banks including Citigroup, Bank of America and Wachovia.Citigroup lost 1.2 per cent to $21.79, Bank of America fell 3 per cent to $38.64 and Wachovia lost 3.4 per cent to $27.07.Lehman stocks were worst hit by the sector sell off, slumping 8.9 per cent to $38.71.Ms Whitney noted that further downward revisions were likely and that banks’ capital ratios could come under serious strain going forward as ratings downgrades to securities forced banks to hold more capital in reserve.In February over $370bn of securities were downgraded – more than three times the amount downgraded in October which was previously the single most disruptive month for the debt market in terms of selling pressure from ratings.“As many expected the fourth quarter to be the ”kitchen sink” for the industry, we believe first quarter results, to be reported in two weeks time, will be a rude awakening,” she said.Markets initially rallied after new data showed that initial jobless claims fell unexpectedly and revised growth figures suggested that the US consumer was not quite ready to give up spending.But by mid-afternoon that enthusiasm had for the most part petered out.Results from Lennar however, provided some unexpected momentum for housebuilders. The company reported $88.2m losses in the first quarter due to write downs in asset value.Sales plummeted 62 per cent to $1.06bn compared to last year and average selling prices, deliveries of new homes and new home orders also dropped, while the cancellation rate hit 26 per cent.Still, moderately optimistic outlook statements from Lennar executives helped the stock gained 1.8 per cent to $17.90.Housebuilders proved particularly resilient given data released on Tuesday painting a bleak picture of a sector stung by declining house prices.Pulte Homes added 1.6 per cent to $14.42 and DR Horton rose 2.2 per cent to $15.53.Utility stocks were the only other bright spot as upgraded earnings forecasts helped drive shares Sempra Energy higher, and peers benefited from investors looking for a safe haven.Sempra shares added 3.9 per cent to $53, while Teco Energy rose 2.8 per cent to $15.74.
800;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-03-26T22:42:10Z;Oracle says customers delaying spending;;Oracle on Wednesday said some corporate customers had delayed their spending on new software in recent weeks, triggering a 7 per cent fall in its shares in after-market trading as Wall Street suffered another bout of nerves about a wider slowdown in technology demand.However, company executives also said the pipeline of potential new business entering the all-important fourth quarter of the company’s fiscal year was much stronger than usual at this stage.Also, stronger profit margins enabled the database software maker to hit earnings forecasts in its latest quarter, with net income rising 30 per cent to $1.3bn, or 26 cents a share.Most big technology companies do not report earnings for another month, making Oracle’s figures a closely watched barometer of broader IT demand.The spending delays that took hold in February, at the end of Oracle’s third fiscal quarter, left the company’s revenue growth for the quarter at 15 per cent after stripping out the effects of the falling US dollar, slower than the 17 per cent growth Wall Street had been expecting on this basis. Including currency changes, Oracle reported revenues of $5.3bn, up 21 per cent from a year before, helped partly by acquisitions.”Customers got a little more cautious in the light of what’s happening in the financial markets,” said Safra Catz, Oracle’s co-president. “We just saw a few things get delayed a little bit.” Some customers added “a second level of approval” before signing off on purchases, slowing buying decisions, she added.The shortfall was particularly marked in Oracle’s application software business, where it has mounted a series of acquisitions to compete more aggressively against German rival SAP. Sales of new application software licences grew only 2 per cent in constant currency terms, to $415m, or some $100m short of Wall Street forecasts.Ms Catz said Oracle had seen “a massive increase in the pipeline” of potential new business for the fourth quarter, which represents a disproportionate share of its total annual sales. On the basis of the greater caution shown recently by customers, Charles Phillips, co-president, said Oracle was assuming that the proportion of these potential deals that are completed in the current quarter would be five percentage points lower than normal.Despite that more conservative expectation, Oracle said it expected revenues to grow between 10-20 per cent in the current quarter, with pro forma earnings per share up 14-18 per cent. “The could be some upside – quite a lot of upside – to the guidance, but we want to be cautious,” said Ms Catz.
801;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;US shares fall as recession fears reinforced;;Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday, snapping a three session winning streak after new data suggested the broader US economy faces a downturn and concerns about banks’ earnings weighed on sentiment.Durable goods orders in February unexpectedly dropped 1.7 per cent - and by 2.6 per cent excluding volatile orders for transport equipment - according to the Commerce Department.John Ryding, chief US economist at Bear Stearns, said: ”This weaker than expected report points to declining capital spending in the first quarter, falling orders, and a significant pickup in inventories in relation to sales. This is another report that has a strong recessionary feel about it.”The numbers for machinery orders were notably anaemic and the news hit shares in General Electric and United Technologies.GE fell 0.3 per cent to $37.15 while United Technologies dropped 0.8 per cent to $69.61.The series comes after another batch of economic indicators on Tuesday highlighted plummeting confidence among consumers in the US and further pain in the housing sector.Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman, said: “Now that we have moved past the euphoria about Bear Stearns being bought out and the steps that central banks are taking, we are back to thinking about micro-economics and about consumer confidence and the like.”The benchmark S&P 500 index - which fell as much as 1.2 per cent - closed down 0.9 per cent at 1,341.13 points, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,324.36 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.9 per cent to 12,422.86.Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in February fell less than expected but still at the slowest sales pace since February 1995.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the data, in addition to other recent reports, suggested home sales could be approaching a bottom but shares in house builders tumbled nonetheless.Centex fell 8 per cent to $23.73 while Lennar lost 6.8 per cent to $17.59.Hovnanian fell 9.4 per cent to $11.05 after Moody’s cuts its rating, citing losses, high debt and a weak macro environment for the economy and for housebuilders.Moody’s said the ratings outlook for the company was negative.The banking sector was also in sharp focus again after Germany’s Deutsche Bank warned that disruptions to revenues and writedowns relating to the global credit crisis could threaten its annual profit targets.On Tuesday a number of banking analysts cut their estimates for the sector, pushing financials into the red.That trend continued after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney slashed her forecasts for earnings in fiscal 2008 by 84 per cent on average and said further downgrades were likely.Ms Whitney sharply cut her estimates for Citigroup by 309 per cent to reflect possible writedowns of $13.1bn in the first quarter of 2008, on mortgage backed securities and other assets.Citigroup shares fell 5.9 per cent to $22.05 and an index of investment banking shares fell 4.1 per cent.Bank of America, the second-biggest US bank by assets, dropped for a second day, falling 2.8 per cent to $39.84, while Wachovia lost 6.7 per cent to $28.02.Fresh doubts emerged about the Clear Channel takeover. The two private equity firms leading a $19bn buyout of the largest US radio operator are at odds with banks financing the deal, increasing speculation that the deal could collapse.Clear Channel shares plunged 17.3 per cent to $26.93 in morning trading.Technology stocks too were sold off as investors worried about what third quarter results from Oracle, after the close, might contain.Oracle, often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector, was down 0.7 per cent at $20.94 at the close.Microsoft fell 2 per cent to $28.57 and Novell also dropped 0.6 per cent to $6.52.Commodity-related stocks were the exception to the bearish mood, climbing for a third straight day as oil prices rose and further dollar weakness sustained the recovery in gold, base metals and agricultural commodities after last week’s sell-off.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining added 5.4 per cent to $97.44 and 1.3 per cent to $47.44 respectively.Shares in oil companies rose after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said crude oil will average $92.30 a barrel this year, up 27 percent from last year as declining reserves increase extraction costs.The New York-based investment firm also raised its price targets for related companies including Apache, which was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, up 6 per cent to $119.75.But higher oil prices hit airline stocks. American Airlines shares slid 10.6 per cent to $8.61 and Delta shares fell 12.3 per cent to $8.74.

It has an enlarged range of pay-as-you-go software that can be accessed using its grid compute utility service.Sun has added 14 applications to its Network.com catalogue of on-demand software, including tools for animation, computational mathematics, life sciences and computer-aided engineering.

●Rivals have been predicting – unsuccessfully – the demise of Sun Microsystems’ proprietary hardware and operating systems for years.HP hopes to hasten the decline with tools to help Sun users move to HP hardware. It has struck a deal with Transitive, a specialist in virtualisation software, to help customers migrate enterprise applications from Sun’s Sparc-based servers to HP Integrity servers running either Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Novell SUSE Linux.

●Just in time for convention season, Intercede of the UK has joined with CoreStreet of the US, to develop a smart-card-based identity solution for big events.The aim is to make it easier to verify the identities of large numbers of individuals.
●More on identity, this time from Oracle, which has launched a new version of Oracle Identity Manager to automate the process of adding, updating and deleting user accounts from applications and directories.The latest release includes additional “attestation capabilities support” to automate certification of access privileges – a key requirement in many compliance regimes.

●Symantec, the security software group, has announced two software-as-a-service offerings for small and medium-sized enterprises.Symantec Online Backup and Symantec Online Storage for Backup Exec, aim to help SMEs overcome their aversion to making regular back-ups. Online Backup costs from $25 a month for 5GB, while the Online Storage for Backup Exec service costs from $38 a month for 10GB and is designed to be used with Backup Exec, Symantec’s on-premises backup product.

●Many banks and other big businesses still use Cobol, the veteran mainframe programming language.But Cobol applications are ill-equipped for service oriented architectures.Ilog, the French software house, steps into the breach with a Cobol add-on for its JRules product that allows IT departments to author and manage business rules for Cobol code written decades earlier."
803;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-03-03T20:56:59Z;Trio to depart HSBC in boardroom shake-up;;"For the past few years, shareholders in HSBC have been grumbling about the shortcomings in the bank’s corporate governance. Now it appears that HSBC is responding to some of their criticisms.The bank on Monday announced a boardroom shake-up that will see three long-serving non-executive directors step down at the annual meeting in May. At the same time, HSBC also revealed it was putting in place a new long-term incentive plan for senior executives.The directors who are stepping down – Lady Dunn, Sir Brian Moffat, and Lord Butler – have been criticised in the past because their long tenure on HSBC’s board means they are no longer deemed independent.They are being replaced by two non-executive directors: Safra Catz, the president and chief financial officer of Oracle, the US software group, and Narayana Murthy, one of the founders of Infosys, the Indian IT services group. HSBC is also elevating three of its most senior executives to the board: Vincent Cheng, chairman of its Asian operations: Sandy Flockhart, its chief executive in Asia; and Stuart Gulliver, head of HSBC’s investment banking division.Separately, Stephen Green, HSBC’s chairman, on Monday revealed the bank was consulting shareholders about a long-term incentive plan for executives. This would measure performance based on return on equity, cost efficiency, capital ratios and total shareholder return relative to a group of rivals.Top HSBC investors criticised the new pay plan, saying they had misgivings about both the size of the potential pay-outs and the ease with which it appeared that HSBC’s executives – whose pay already ranks in the top 25 per cent – will be able to earn these rewards.Shortcomings in the current plan have been highlighted by Knight Vinke, the activist investor that is agitating for change at HSBC. Knight Vinke has argued the bank should include emerging market banks – rather than just large US and European banks – when measuring performance. Mr Green said Monday it was “likely” HSBC would update its list of rival banks to reflect the shift in its strategy.Investors largely approved of the changes to the board, even though some criticised the bank for not addressing long-held concerns about the elevation of chief executive to chairman and the “unwieldy” size of the 21-person board. Both these things appear to flout the UK’s codes on good governance."
804;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-02-27T19:33:10Z;Opening the windows on Microsoft;;"Andrew Grove, former chief executive of Intel, popularised the Silicon Valley motto: “Only the paranoid survive.” In the preface to his book of that title he wrote: “The more successful you are, the more people want a chunk of your business, and then another chunk, and then another, until there is nothing left.”That sentiment epitomised the behaviour of many technology companies in the late 20th century, from Intel to Oracle and Microsoft. They lived in fear of a technology inflection point that would suddenly strip them of their leadership and benefit an upstart funded by one of the Valley’s venture capital firms.Under Bill Gates, Microsoft was among the most paranoid of technology companies in defending its hard-won Windows near-monopoly of desktop operating systems and extending its strength into other software niches. Whenever it took its eye off the ball – as it did in the early days of the internet browser – it rapidly fought back.A better slogan for the internet age is: only the sociable thrive. Companies such as Google, IBM, Sun Microsystems and Salesforce.com no longer try to eradicate competition at all costs. Instead, they believe they will get more by encouraging others to reinforce them by building software and services that fit with their own.This is the context in which Microsoft last week announced – to jeers from sceptics – that it was folding the hand that it had played against regulators for over a decade. Instead of keeping as much of its software code hidden as possible, the company would publish details of some of it and encourage other companies to use them.It is no coincidence that Mr Gates, the company’s co-founder and guiding spirit for more than 30 years, steps down this June from full-time work at Microsoft to run his foundation and has handed over his title of chief software architect to Ray Ozzie, an industry veteran who is instinctively more open to collaboration.The changing of the guard has not placated the European Commission’s antitrust enforcers or Microsoft’s competitors. Thomas Vinje, a lawyer who represents some of them in Europe, called for “a permanent change in Microsoft’s behaviour, not just another announcement”.I agree with Mr Vinje that the fact that Mr Ozzie says Microsoft is going to do something does not prove that it actually will. But I differ on why. I do not think that Mr Ozzie and his allies are pulling another fake. I believe they want to alter its culture and modus operandi. The question is whether they have the power.The reason for my doubt is that Microsoft remains Mr Gates’ creation, although he has already handed over the role of chief executive to Steve Ballmer and welcomed on board outsiders including Mr Ozzie. And it will take more than putting thousands of pages of software code on the internet to alter his legacy.Why even try, you might ask, since the company’s paranoia has brought it enormous success? One reason is that it wants to placate regulators. “We have been through a 10-year fight and I don’t want it to turn into a 100-year war,” says Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel.Only on Wednesday, it was fined €899m ($1.36bn) by the European Commission for its past failure to license protocols – the code that enables programs to interact with Windows and other Microsoft software – openly and cheaply enough. Its new policy should at least stop it having to pay further fines on the issue.But regulation is only part of the story. A bigger motivation for Microsoft is that it is in danger of being left behind in the mash-up era. Windows used to have a fair claim to be the only software platform for which it was worth most developers writing applications but their freedom of manoeuvre is now greater.IBM has countered its past software weakness by supporting open source development of Linux; Google has built rivals to Microsoft’s Word and Outlook programs and is encouraging other companies to work with it on mobile phone software; Sun has even made its Solaris operating software open-source.Mr Ozzie wants to follow this trend by making it easier for outsiders to write software that works seamlessly with not only Windows but other programs, including its Office suite. Disclosing its protocols is only a start. It also needs to simplify the way it builds software to make it easier for other programs to plug in.There lies the rub. Like other large companies, Microsoft has an established culture and entrenched interests, notably the product groups in charge of big money-spinners such as Office and Windows. These groups have got into the habit of secrecy, not only with outsiders but even with other parts of the empire.Thus, the Windows division might have handed out full details of most protocols to the people it knew in the Office group but kept some data secret from other Microsoft developers, and even more hidden from outsiders. Its managers wanted to limit full access to those they trusted to write software that worked cleanly with their own.Mr Ozzie is trying to blow this up by forcing Microsoft’s developers to disclose information fully, and on an equal basis, to everyone. This may, in turn, force them to write software that is better adapted to the era in which working sociably with others, inside and outside Microsoft, is a competitive necessity.His statements and now his actions suggest that he is genuine. But taking on three decades of culture and ways of working in a huge corporation is very difficult. Mr Gates may be leaving the building but persuading his paranoid spirit to depart is something else again.john.gapper@ft.comRead more of John Gapper’s columnsRead John Gapper’s Business Blog"
805;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Microsoft predicts rise of the datacentre;;A handful of US companies is set to dominate the emerging market for “cloud computing”, which will assume a central role in the information technology world, according to Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft.His prediction – in an interview with the Financial Times – points to a future in which the distinctions between software, hardware and internet companies fall away and a small number of big technology companies, each running a collection of vast datacentres, controls the IT landscape.Cloud computing involves the centralised storage and processing of information – a shift that could reduce the role of desktop computers and the servers and other equipment run by many companies. This is forcing companies such as Microsoft to rethink their strategies.Mr Ballmer predicted that a new super-group of tech companies would dominate the cloud computing market, each of them managing what amounts to a giant centralised computer made up of a number of big datacentres.“Amazon has one. Rumours are Google will have one. We’ve said we’re going to have one,” Mr Ballmer said.The predicted emergence of a group of super-powers in corporate computing points to a far greater concentration of influence in the technology world. The winners would have the resources to operate at very large scale, bringing down unit costs for computing to a level others cannot match.Internet retailer Amazon was the first to start renting out capacity in its datacentres to other companies, selling storage and charging companies based on the number of transactions it processes for them. While Google has started offering online applications to companies, it has yet to start selling computing capacity in this way.Mr Ballmer was speaking before the launch this week of one of Microsoft’s most important new products this year, its latest software for servers known as Windows Server 2008. The software marks Microsoft’s entry into the market for “virtualisation” technology.The launch represents Microsoft’s attempt to catch up with VMware, a software rival that has dominated the first phase of virtualisation. However, a key piece of Microsoft’s own virtualisation software will not be ready. The software company has promised to deliver the piece, known as a hypervisor, by August.
806;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-02-21T19:24:46Z;Is this a new era of openness for Microsoft?;;Can Microsoft, the fiercest predator in the software jungle, really change its spots? That was the question left open Thursday after the company laid out what it claimed was a significant adjustment to its technology strategy.Certainly, regulators and competitors who have tangled with Microsoft over the years sounded far from convinced.”We have heard high-profile commitments from Microsoft a half-dozen times over the past two years, but have yet to see any lasting change in Microsoft’s behaviour in the marketplace,” said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to the European Committee for Interoperability Systems, a body which includes IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Adobe.At issue is whether the company is sincere when it says that it will open up some of its software to make it easier for other companies’ technology to interoperate, or work seamlessly with, its own.That was one of the issues at the heart of the long-running European case against Microsoft, which forced the company to make the communications protocols on some of its servers more freely available. Sceptics point to that battle, as well as accusations of foot-dragging to implement a similar requirement made by US regulators more than five years ago, as evidence that Microsoft has yet to get serious about true openness.To support its latest claim, the software group made four promises: that it would create “open connections” to its most highly-used products, make it easier for customers to move their data out of Microsoft software, act more transparently over its adoption of industry standards, and build better relations with others in the software industry.These broad commitments point to a range of issues that have bedevilled Microsoft’s relations with many others in the technology industry in the years that it has reined supreme.For instance, its “embrace and extend” approach to industry standards has long been one off its most controversial technology tactics. By taking a commonly used standard, then adding its own “extensions”, or additional features, Microsoft has frequently been criticised of trying to undermine standards and impose its own proprietary versions in their place.In another heated case, Microsoft has so far failed to have the new document formats contained in the latest version of its Office applications declared an industry standard by the international standards organisation, a designation it needs to convince governments and others to store their data in the formats. Critics claim that Microsoft’s technology does not meet the requirements of a true standard. The next stage of that review is due to be heard shortly.In a gesture to its opponents, Microsoft said Thursday that it would let outside developers add whatever document formats they like to the Office suite of applications, and set them as the defaults.In the biggest part of its new openness initiative, Microsoft said it would freely publish two types of technology that it had generally kept more guarded, at least for its most heavily-used products: its applications programming interfaces, which act as the “hooks” that other developers use to write software that runs on its platforms, and the communications protocols needed for different products to interoperate seamlessly. Yet according to the critics, it will be some time before the real impact of these moves can be assessed.“Today’s [Thursday] announcement is still all about the rest of the world interoperating with Microsoft on Microsoft’s own terms, not the other way round,” ECIS said. “So long as that is the strategic orientation, the interoperability devil will always be in the technical and commercial details.”
807;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-02-20T21:12:48Z;Microsoft nears hostile bid for Yahoo;;Until recently, the idea that Microsoft would even consider a hostile takeover bid for one of Silicon Valley’s leading companies would have seemed unthinkable.But with only three weeks to go until a critical deadline in its manoeuvring for control of Yahoo, that is exactly the step the software giant has positioned itself for.Conventional wisdom in the Valley has long held that even friendly takeovers are a deeply risky move, since top engineering and management talent is often lost. Hostile bids are seen as a scorched earth tactic better left to old-line industries that have run out of more constructive ways to create value for their shareholders.From the start, Microsoft issued a veiled threat that it would “pursue all necessary steps” to press its bid. With Yahoo’s board still weighing its options, that has led in recent days to signs of more direct sabre-rattling.To force through its offer, Microsoft is now preparing to submit its own directors for approval at the next Yahoo shareholder meeting. It has until March 13 to trigger that proxy fight, with Yahoo’s shareholder meeting normally held in June.The software company is also considering launching an exchange offer directly to Yahoo’s shareholders, inviting them to accept its cash and stock bid, although the internet company’s poison pill would stop Microsoft gaining control without board-level support.Sending a message about its intentions at this stage looks like a heavy reminder to Yahoo that time is running out. A company that is prepared to publicise an unsolicited offer carrying a big premium, as Microsoft did on February 1, has already signalled that it is willing to follow through to a full hostile proxy battle, according to Morton Pierce, a merger and acquisitions specialist at Dewey & LeBoeuf. “It’s like a chess game – I assume they thought through this step and assumed they’d be rebuffed initially,” he said.If Microsoft is forced to launch an all-out war, it can at least draw some comfort from Oracle’s acquisition of software rival PeopleSoft in the Valley’s most heated hostile takeover.“The textbook had always said not to try a hostile if you’re in any way worried about the impact on people and products,” said one investment banker based in Silicon Valley. “But Oracle changed the mindset. PeopleSoft held up very well for more than a year while it was under attack.”But one difference in that case was that Oracle had little need for either PeopleSoft’s senior management team or its rank-and-file engineers, and based its acquisition on substantial job reductions.In an interview with the FT at the weekend, Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, repeated that the company saw Yahoo’s engineers as an asset. However, he also indicated that Microsoft believed it had the technical resources to go it alone in the search business.Other executives say that in some critical areas of technology, such as its search advertising system, Microsoft is ahead of Yahoo, suggesting that it would see little need for Yahoo’s overlapping technology.As one Silicon Valley investor said: “A hostile takeover indicates that the value in the less volatile parts of the business, like brand name, installed base, customers and infrastructure, is more valuable than the volatile parts of the business, like engineers and executive talent.” That would be a bitter message for Yahoo employees and one reason the company has promised severance packages in the event that any takeover leads to lay-offs.In spite of the preparations for war, most analysts still believe that Microsoft is hoping to press Yahoo into submission before it has to take that step.At least on the surface, a higher offer is not part of that campaign, with Microsoft executives in recent days reiterating that their offer is “full and fair”. But with Yahoo’s shares trading slightly above the offer price, Wall Street expects that Microsoft will eventually sweeten its bid.“Generally, a proxy contest leads to the [target company] agreeing a deal,” said Mr Pierce. “At some point, Yahoo would give in.” That is an assumption that Microsoft may soon have to put to the test.

809;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-02-17T18:26:28Z;Amazing poised for growth;;Amazing Global Technologies, the acquisitive IT services group, expects to report a second consecutive year of 30 per cent organic growth in 2008 as it ponders market conditions for its potential listing on Aim.The Guernsey-based group has hired Cenkos Securities to advise it in meeting its long-stated goal of floating on London’s junior market.But Bradley Hall, chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times that current conditions meant the market was in effect closed.Nevertheless, Amazing saw 2007 full-year revenues rise to nearly $45m (£23m) from just $1m in 2006 as the company set itself up.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose nearly threefold to approach $4m.The group resells business resource planning software owned by Oracle, including JD Edwards and Siebel, to mid-sized corporations in emerging markets.It has more than 1,000 consultants in mainly emerging countries in eastern Europe and Latin America.Despite completing five acquisitions during the year, it also had an organic growth rate of 32 per cent.“We’re expecting a growth rate of 30 per cent plus in 2008,” said Mr Hall.“We’re also looking to take revenues up to $180m by the end of the year.“In 2008 we have a goal of dramatically scaling the business.“In central and eastern Europe we are focused on acquisitions and opportunities in countries that have either recently or are poised to join the EU.”The group has forecast that the series of acquisitions in Australia, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland and the UK in 2007 would add an aggregate of $50m in annualised revenue.Amazing was founded in April 2005 by Mr Hall, the former chairman and chief executive of Icon Capital Corp, the San Francisco-based merchant bank.Its president is Simon Arkell, the former Australian Olympic pole vaulter.It is backed by a group of unnamed London-based hedge funds that contributed a total of $31.5m in a round of financing in December 2006.
810;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-02-11T10:20:20Z;Valley view: Microsoft’s swoop ruffles some feathers;;"An earthquake has been shaking Silicon Valley to its roots. Microsoft’s bid for Yahoo – worth $44.6bn on February 1, the day it was announced – is the biggest takeover offer this hi-tech capital has seen.It is not as large as that East Coast deal between AOL and Time Warner in 2000, when giddy “bubble” valuations priced it at $112bn. But it is more than twice the size of Hewlett-Packard’s acquisition of Compaq Computer in 2001, worth $18.7bn.More than the money though, Microsoft’s unexpected swoop from its Redmond, Washington eyrie has been a huge shock to Silicon Valley’s system. Usually, it is Valley companies doing the consolidating, whether it is HP or Larry Ellison’s rapacious Oracle.This is also the first big internet consolidation. While AOL-Time Warner was an unholy marriage of new and old media, Microsoft and Yahoo would be trying to merge their extensive internet content and services – in itself a mighty task.“People are so shocked at the magnitude of this, it’s just been hard for people to get their heads round it,” one Yahoo executive told me last week.To a few workers, the advance of the Microsoft machine seems comparable to the tanks rolling into Tiananmen Square.In a way, it would represent a loss of innocence for the yodelling Yahoos, to be taken over by a process-driven company founded in an earlier era that has been a follower rather than a leader in the internet age.It is hard to imagine Microsoft matching this Yahoo core company value: “Fun: We believe humour is essential to success. We applaud irreverence and don’t take ourselves too seriously. We yodel.”Microsoft’s bid is also a reality check for Yahoo employees. The company is being valued on the basis of its 500m-strong audience and advertising dollars rather than for its innovation as an internet pioneer and its fostering of Web 2.0 companies.Last year’s M&A advertising action was a harbinger. Google made a bid for DoubleClick, Microsoft acquired aQuantive and Yahoo bought out RightMedia as a race developed over who could aggregate the biggest audience and advertising network.Looking back, Yahoo’s growth seems haphazard compared with the methodical way Microsoft achieved dominance in PC operating systems.It began as “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web” a directory of website listings hosted on Stanford University servers in 1994. As Yahoo, it quickly gained popularity and you can still sample how people used to find their way round the web at dir.yahoo.com.At the time, Jerry Yang and David Filo were getting huge attention for creating this prime destination, but no one could figure out how they might make money out of it. No one, at that stage, had figured out the web, full stop.Yahoo became a “portal”, a gateway to various services, including Yahoo Mail. It began to earn money from display advertising and offered premium services for a fee.But it missed the next internet wave, paid search, losing out to Google’s superior technology and business model.Google’s culture does seem similar to Yahoo’s: there is the same sense of fun on the Googleplex campus with its whiteboard graffiti, Lego sets and weird sculptures.But Google has shown much more focus on its core search products, while Yahoo has spread itself across too many services.If Yahoo is forced to capitulate to Microsoft, one view is that the company’s failure and a lost battle for the Valley could be turned into victory for Google in the larger war.Microsoft could be biting off more than it can chew. Services and content overlap so much between Yahoo and MSN or Windows Live that integration will be hellish. Many services will have to be closed and their value will be be lost. The process could be such a distraction for Microsoft that Google could increase what already seems an unassailable lead.If this is to become a clash of the titans over advertising dollars, what of the rest of the industry?Microsoft’s move has taken the spotlight off social networks and Facebook, a third internet wave in the Valley that both Google and Microsoft missed, but has yet to come anywhere near their level of profitability. Social networks and even virtual worlds could come to challenge both.However, Web 2.0 start-ups must have more fears about their future. Yahoo has acquired a long list of such companies – Flickr, Upcoming, JumpCut, Del.icio.us, MyBlogLog to name a few; Google has been much more choosy and Microsoft has barely dipped its toe in the water.The one hope is that Microsoft will acquire some of Yahoo’s genes and ingest the spirit of the Valley, adding its marketing muscle and enabling the next wave of innovation here."
811;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-02-11T08:37:28Z;Tech cash piles;;Have technology companies finally smelt the coffee? For years they built up cash mountains almost as a badge of honour, refusing to pay out big dividends for fear of losing their reputations as growth companies.Now they are beginning to accept reality. Most areas of the tech industry have matured considerably. In many cases, strong cash flows mean a net debt position actually makes more sense than a balance sheet stuffed with cash. Generous dividends remain scarce. But a growing number of companies have moved beyond share buy-backs as a way of keeping their cash balances at seemly levels, to writing cheques for acquisitions. Oracle kicked off the trend in 2003 with its hostile pursuit of PeopleSoft and then Siebel Systems. Cisco has since paid $6.9bn for Scientific Atlanta. Nokia is paying $7.7bn for Navteq. And Microsoft is betting its $21bn net cash balance, plus roughly the same in stock, on an unsolicited bid for Yahoo.Few companies have taken the route of mature IBM, which now has net debt of $19bn. But there is a growing willingness among technology companies, in a world where share price multiples have returned to earth, to use their cash. Companies such as Oracle and Microsoft have even pointed to traditional old economy benefits, such as cost savings, when selling their acquisitions to investors.Expect more pressure on the hoarders of the sector to spend their cash. Intel and Dell, for example, are no longer young growth companies, yet they retain a combined $23bn of net cash. Google and Apple are, however, unlikely to join the party. Both retain huge firepower. Google has flirted with using its cash, paying $3.1bn for DoubleClick. But it is still building up fast, and neither company is likely to rush into mega-deals or returning cash to shareholders. There are few obvious bid targets. They want to retain flexibility. And, even after recent share price falls, investors are still far more worried about their growth prospects than the efficiency of their balance sheets.Post and read comments on this Lex
812;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-02-01T23:59:00Z;Yang’s options shrinking fast;;Jerry Yang must be starting to understand how Alfred Chuang of BEA Systems felt when Larry Ellison of Oracle came calling last year. Like Chuang, the Yahoo boss has just been landed with a takeover offer at such a big premium that he can’t possibly just ignore it. Also like Chuang, the options for other deals – or for staying independent – are shrinking fast. Here are the other partnerships or alliances that Yang could have grabbed at in the last year or so, and the chances that he can turn to them again now as he looks for an alternative to Microsoft:News Corp, sensing the chance to consolidate its position on the internet, at one stage proposed combining MySpace with Yahoo in return for a large stake in the internet portal. For Rupert Murdoch, the opportunistic move would have meant trading the hot social networking site for a slower growing but far more stable property, but Yahoo saw less value in the idea. To judge from the noises emanating from around News Corp today, there’s little interest in trying to revive the idea.Time Warner has also at times considered something similar for its AOL unit, merging it into Yahoo and keeping a piece of the action. If Yahoo falls to Microsoft, Time Warner will be robbed of its two most obvious partners as the online advertising market consolidates, so Jeff Bewkes might be expected to try to intervene. However, people close to Time Warner seemed distinctly underwhelmed by the thought of wading into the fray against Microsoft.This has been one of the more intriguing options. Yang is said last year to have considered out-sourcing Yahoo’s search advertising to Google. Project Panama, the overhaul that was meant improve the efficiency of Yahoo’s search advertising system, has been only a qualified success: Yahoo could boost its earning per share by 25 per cent by partnering with Google instead, according to Mark Mahaney at Citigroup. As Yahoo searches for ideas to boost shareholder value while staying independent, this looms as the most likely alternative. Much will depend on whether Google wants to go head-to-head with Microsoft in such a direct way.A higher offer from Microsoft to win over Yahoo’s board seems the most likely outcome. A year ago, before Yahoo’s shares hit the skids, Microsoft was willing to pay $60bn, according to one well-placed source. Times have changed and there’s no way Yang can hope for that kind of happy ending any more, but holding out for a bigger pay-day still seems his best option.
813;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Competition issues weigh on Bill Gates in London;;Bill Gates faced a fairly benign crowd at the Institute of Directors in London on Wednesday morning where he made his last UK speech before his retirement.But it was not without a few moments of controversy.When the 1000-strong audience was given a chance to question Mr Gates, one IT manager of a law firm accused Microsoft of being overly dominant in corporate software and complained of the arrogance of the company’s sales force. With other suppliers, he said, he could fire and re-engage them if their terms and conditions changed, but not so with Microsoft’s Office package.Mr Gates was immediately on the defensive, saying there was plenty of competition in corporate software.“I’d like to see the terms and conditions you have with IBM and we can immediately match them,” he said, sounding more like a keen-as-mustard sales rep than an executive less than six months away from slipping the corporate leash.Oracle and many other companies also provided competition, he said. The problem was competition in corporate software just wasn’t covered as much in the media.Mr Gates went on to stress how innovative the software sector was.“People should wish that other commercial sectors were as competitive and innovative as the software space. Just think what food would cost and the advantages you would have experienced.”The competition issue was clearly still a very sore point with him. Earlier, when questioned about his most stressful moments at Microsoft he had sighed “Trying not to be sued by your own government. Especially when it is unjust.”Perhaps it is not surprising given the recent US decision to extend its close anti-trust scrutiny of Microsoft by another two years, and the new competition case opened in the EU earlier this month.Mr Gates was visibly happier when talking about his future plans at his charitable foundation, tackling the world’s health problems and giving away most of his fortune. Then, the shoe will be on the other foot, as he gets to chivvy governments for not being generous enough and demand large sums of money from them.
814;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-29T18:10:23Z;A revolution is taking shape;;When the founder of Microsoft retires this year, it will not only mark the close of a remarkable business career. It will signal the end of an era in computing.“The next sea change is upon us.” Those words appeared in an extraordinary memorandum that Bill Gates sent to Microsoft’s top managers and engineers on October 30 2005.Belying its bloodless title – “Internet Software Services” – the memo was intended to sound an alarm, to warn the company that a new revolution in computing was under way, and that it threatened to upend Microsoft’s traditional business.What had always been the linchpin of Microsoft’s success – its control over the PC desktop – was fading in importance. Thanks to the proliferation of broadband connections in homes and offices, people no longer had to buy packaged software programs and install them on their computers. Instead, they could use their web browsers to tap into software supplied over the internet from central data-processing plants.“The broad and rich foundation of the internet will unleash a ‘services wave’ of applications and experiences available instantly,” Mr Gates wrote. This new wave, he said, “will be very disruptive”.It is not hard to understand what spurred the memo. As Mr Gates composed it in his office at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington, his fears about his company’s future were taking concrete shape just 200 miles away, in a small town named The Dalles in northern Oregon. That’s where Google, the internet search giant, was building a massive data centre on the banks of the Columbia River.Large, windowless warehouses, each the size of a football field and adorned with cooling towers, dominated the site. An article in the International Herald Tribune described the complex as “looming like an information-age nuclear plant”.It was an apt description. What Google was building was a vast computing centre, by all accounts the largest and most sophisticated on the planet. Designed to house tens of thousands of PCs, all wired together to work as a single supercomputer, it was, indeed, the information-processing equivalent of a nuclear power station, able to pump data and software into millions of homes and businesses.The Oregon centre, now largely complete, is just one of dozens of “server farms” that the company has built around the world, holding an estimated 500,000 computers.But Google is not just using its computing grid to process web searches. It is also supplying services such as word processing, spreadsheets, and e-mail – programs that have long been the mainstays of Microsoft’s profitability.By supplying business computing as a set of simple services, Google, and other utility providers such as Salesforce.com and Amazon Web Services, threaten to render large parts of the IT industry obsolete.No corporate computing system, not even those operated by big companies, can match the efficiency, speed, and flexibility of plants such as Google’s. One analyst estimates that Google can carry out a computing task for one-tenth of what it costs a typical company.That is why the big data centres make Bill Gates and other technology executives so nervous. They encapsulate the full disruptive potential of utility computing. If people and businesses can rely on central stations to fulfil all or most of their computing requirements, they will be able to slash the money they spend on their own hardware and software. All the dollars saved are ones that would have gone into the coffers of Microsoft and the other tech giants.What is happening to computing today is a revolution, the biggest upheaval since the invention of the PC in the 1970s. But it is not without precedent. It bears a close resemblance to what happened to mechanical power 100 years ago.Until the end of the 19th century, businesses had to run their own power-generating facilities, producing all the energy required to run their machinery. As industrial technology advanced, the means of generation grew more sophisticated, progressing from waterwheels to steam engines to electric dynamos, but the equipment was always located at the site of a business and maintained by its employees.Like data-processing today, power generation was assumed to be an intrinsic part of doing business.But with the invention of the alternating-current electric grid at the turn of the century, that assumption was overturned.Suddenly, manufacturers did not have to be in the power-generation business. They could run machines with electric current generated in distant power plants by big utilities and fed to their factories over a network of wires. With remarkable speed, the new utilities took over the supply of industrial power. Scores of private power stations were dismantled.What made large-scale electric utilities possible was a series of scientific and engineering breakthroughs – in electricity generation and transmission as well as in the design of electric motors – but what ensured their triumph was not technology but economics. By supplying electricity to many buyers from central stations, the utilities achieved economies of scale in power production that no individual factory could match. It became a competitive necessity for manufacturers to hook their plants up to the new electricity grid in order to tap into the cheaper source of power.The success of the utilities fed on itself. As soon as they began to supply current to factories, they were able to expand their generating capacity and increase economies even further, achieving another great leap in efficiency. The price of electricity fell so quickly that it soon became possible for nearly every business and household to afford electric power.The commercial and social ramifications of the democratisation of electricity would be hard to overstate. Electric light altered the rhythms of life, electric assembly lines redefined work, and electric appliances brought the Industrial Revolution into the home.Cheap and plentiful electricity shaped the world we live in today. It is a world that did not exist a mere 100 years ago, and yet the transformation that has played out over just a few generations has been so great, so complete, that it has become almost impossible for us to imagine what life was like before electricity began to flow through the sockets in our walls.The transformation in the supply of computing promises to have equally sweeping consequences. Software programs already control or mediate not only industry and commerce but entertainment, journalism, education, even politics and national defence. The shock waves produced by a shift in computing technology will thus be intense and far-reaching.We can already see the early effects all around us – in the shift of control over media from institutions to individuals, in people’s growing sense of affiliation with “virtual communities” rather than physical ones, in debates over the value of privacy, even in the growing concentration of wealth in a small slice of the population.All these trends either spring from or are propelled by the rise of internet-based computing. As information utilities grow in size and sophistication, the changes to business and society – and to ourselves – will only broaden. And their pace will only accelerate.One place where the changes will be particularly sweeping is the corporate IT department. As the capacity and capabilities of the computing grid expand, it will continue to displace private systems as the preferred platform for computing. Businesses will gain new flexibility in assembling computing services to perform customised information-processing jobs. They will no longer be constrained by the limits of their own data centres or the dictates of a few big IT vendors.Because of computing’s modularity, companies will have a wealth of options as they make the leap to the utility age.They will be able to continue to fulfil some of their computing requirements inhouse, while relying on outside utilities to satisfy other needs. And they will be able to fine-tune the mix continually, as the capabilities of the utilities advance.In contrast to the switch-over to electricity utilities, buyers do not face an all-or-nothing choice when it comes to computing.While capital-constrained smaller companies have strong incentives to embrace the full utility model quickly, most larger companies will need to balance their investments in inhouse computing with the benefits provided by utilities.They can be expected to pursue a hybrid approach for many years, supplying some hardware and software requirements themselves and purchasing others over the grid.One of the key challenges for corporate IT departments lies in making the right decisions about what to hold on to and what to let go.In the long run, the IT department is unlikely to survive, at least not in its familiar form.It will have little to do once the bulk of business computing shifts into what Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, calls “the computing cloud”. Business units and even individual employees will be able to control the processing of information directly, without the need for legions of technical specialists.Bill Gates’ 2005 memo made it clear that Microsoft had no intention of surrendering. It would turn its legendary competitiveness against the upstart utilities in the hope of sustaining its dominance in the tech business.Putting economic muscle behind its words, the company has launched a huge program of capital investment to expand its utility computing capabilities and try to catch up with Google.In 2006 alone, Microsoft invested $2bn more than it had previously expected to spend, much of it going to build and equip utility data centres. It is using the centres to deliver an array of services to businesses and consumers, through its Windows Live, Office Live, and MSN brands.Other big tech companies recognise their businesses are under threat, and they, too, are taking steps to adapt to the utility age. Oracle and SAP have begun offering web-based software services in addition to their traditional applications. Hewlett-Packard and Sun have opened up utility grids to provide computing power for a metered fee.Even large IT consulting firms such as Accenture, which grew rich on the complexity of traditional information systems, are establishing practices devoted to helping clients make the shift to utility services. Nobody wants to be left behind.Not long after Bill Gates wrote his memo, he announced his intention to step down from his managerial role at Microsoft.He would slowly hand over his remaining responsibilities to other executives and then he would retire from his day-to-day work at the company he had built into the superpower of the PC age.Gates’ departure, scheduled for this summer, is richly symbolic. It marks a turning point in the brief but tumultuous history of computing.The time of Gates and the other great software programmers who wrote the code of the PC age has come to an end. The future of computing belongs to the new utilitarians.Listen to Nicholas Carr warning companies and governments of the dangers they face when they surrender ownership and management of their increasingly important online operations.

815;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-26T00:54:38Z;Court allows companies to patent software;;Hi-tech companies will be able to patent software programs after a key court decision that may move the UK closer to Europe in its treatment of computer-related inventions.The High Court on Friday said that the Patent Office was incorrectly applying the law in automatically rejecting claims for computer programs, in a case brought by four small British businesses.The ruling should help level the playing field in an industry dominated by corporate titans such as Microsoft and Oracle, intellectual property experts said.“This is a win for hard-working inventors and small businesses, who need patent protection to take advantage of any niche in the market,” said Ed Round, a patent attorney at Marks & Clerk.The dispute centred on a practice note issued by the Patent Office in November 2006, stating that computer programs were generally not patentable in the wake of a high-profile ruling in a case brought by Neal Macrossan, an Australian inventor.The guidance put the UK at odds with the European Patent Office, which has allowed companies to patent computer programs if they can demonstrate some sort of innovative technical effect.The four companies, which were seeking to patent technologies ranging from skin imaging techniques to semi-conductor chip design, appealed to the High Court last year against the Patent Office refusal of their claims.All four distribute their products on computer discs or by downloads over the internet.Mr Justice Kitchin on Friday ruled that contrary to the Patent Office’s practice note, computer programs were not automatically excluded from patentability.If companies could show that their programs made a substantive inventive contribution they would be eligible for protection regardless of the fact that they were distributed on a computer disc, the court said.The decision should ease the burden on small technology companies who were going to Europe to seek patent protection, where the hurdle for computer-related patents was generally lower, lawyers said.Before Friday’s judgment, Mr Round said he had routinely been advising clients to apply for patents abroad rather than risk having their claims rejected in Britain.Controversy and confusion has swirled around the issue of software patent protection for years, and there are still marked discrepancies bet-ween the European approach and the more generous approach to intellectual property protection taken in countries such as the US and Japan.A spokesman for the Patent Office said the body was “carefully considering’’ the ruling.
816;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-24T15:46:22Z;IT skills: Big names help youngsters press right buttons;;IT companies have a long history of helping and supporting young people gain access to information technology and skills. But what has changed radically over the years is the nature of this support.In the past, support was mostly about donating computer hardware (“putting boxes into classrooms or community centres”), but now, the emphasis is on providing young people with a whole range of skills covering IT, life skills, entrepreneurship and employability, to prepare them for the world of work or further education.There is also a strong emphasis on IT companies working in partnership with governments, as well as public and private bodies. And there is much emphasis on volunteerism, with company employees encouraged to become tutors or mentors.“IT skills are needed in both the developed and emerging economies, whether your job is in retail, manufacturing or transport,” says Pamela Passman, Microsoft’s corporate vice-president for global corporate affairs. “Everybody is concerned with creating jobs for young people and we know that IT can play an important role in this.”Microsoft’s Unlimited Potential (UP) – Community Technology Skills programme supports a global network of more than 37,000 community technology centres in 102 countries through a system of cash grants and software, totalling $252m to date. The projects UP supports include a programme in the Bronx, New York, where young men out of prison can go back to the classroom to learn IT and employment skills. Microsoft has also formed the Youth Empowerment programme with the International Youth Foundation, which aims to train 10,000 people aged 16-35 in Africa in IT skills and entrepreneurship.In France, Alcatel-Lucent and a number of telecoms companies have formed the Cercle Passeport Télécoms project. This has a network of 152 volunteer tutors and operates in the suburbs around France, where there are many disadvantaged youths.“We’ve helped more than 300 young people aged 18-25 prepare for entrance examinations to get into telecoms schools,” says Beatrice Tassot, executive director of the Alcatel-Lucent Foundation. The project has been so successful that it has been extended to the US.Oracle Academy is a programme that provides students with business and technology skills. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (Emea), more than 195,000 students in 59 countries are now studying the Oracle Academy programme as part of their curriculum in 1,500 educational institutions.Get-IT (Graduate Entrepreneurship Training through IT) is a training programme launched by Hewlett-Packard aimed at young people aged 16-25 who are living in disadvantaged communities. It helps those taking part to acquire IT skills to become better qualified for employment or running their own business. So far, HP has provided 35 local non-profit training institutions throughout the Emea region with trainers and equipment. Around 6,000 students aged 16-25 are expected to benefit from Get-IT.Jeanette Weisschuh, HP’s head of global citizenship for the Emea region, says: “There’s a lot of IT training, but it’s also about filling the gap between that and entrepreneurship. For example, what IT tools do you need if you want to handle invoices or keep track of orders? It’s very pragmatic.”The Cisco Networking Academy Programme runs in more than 160 countries, and more than 2.4m students (mostly aged 16-25) have passed through it. There are around 10,000 Cisco Networking Academies worldwide and Cisco works closely with non-governmental organisations.“Our expertise is ICT technology but NGOs are used to dealing with disadvantaged youngsters. We provide a number of training packages that give young people the skills to help them get a job,” says John Edwards, director of the Cisco Networking Academy Programme for Europe and emerging markets. The training is a combination of hands-on experience and online activities and tests.Microsoft, Alcatel-Lucent and Merrill Lynch are some of the private sector partners in entra 21, an alliance launched by the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Youth Foundation. Entra 21 aims to improve the employability prospects of young people aged 16-29 in Latin America and the Caribbean by helping them gain ICT skills and jobs through training, mentoring and work experience.“We think that education can make the biggest difference to young people’s lives,” says Eddy Bayardelle, president of the Merrill Lynch Foundation. “It’s also about life skills and global citizenship.”
817;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-24T15:46:22Z;Youthful force for change in society;;Around the world, young individuals are demonstrating the power of the next generation to effect change, and becoming active participants in finding solutions to some of the problems they face.While non-governmental organisations, companies and governments all play a vital role in improving the health, education and employment prospects of the younger members of society, there is an increasing recognition of the power of young people themselves to make a contribution.Take, for example, three of last year’s Global Fellows in the YouthActionNet programme – an International Youth Foundation initiative: Rachel Nampinga, a 29-year-old Ugandan, is the driving force behind the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change. Abhishek Bharadwaj, a 29-year-old from Mumbai, is building partnerships and spearheading advocacy campaigns to address homelessness. And Neilesh Patel, a 25-year-old American, is connecting health professionals with global volunteering projects.The problems they face are pressing. On the healthcare front, young people experience a high prevalence of unplanned pregnancies. About half of all people newly infected with HIV are below the age of 25 and adolescents between 15 and 19 are twice as likely to die from complications during pregnancy or childbirth as those over the age of 20.The risk of unemployment is also high. Young people make up almost half of the world’s unemployed, according to the World Bank’s most recent World Development Report, which for the first time focused on young people under the title “Development and the next Generation”. Some 100m new jobs will be needed for these people in the Middle East and North Africa alone, said the report.In addition, the bank found that companies doing business in countries such as Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia, and Zambia saw poor education and work skills as severely hampering their operations.For Bill Reese, president and chief executive of the International Youth Foundation (IYF), enhancing the work skills of young people is crucial. “Even in the poorest countries, up to 30 per cent of national budget is spent on education, and that’s an appreciable amount of money,” he says. “But often there is no sense of what the market is going to need and what skills [young people] are going to need.”Promoting employability is the focus of the Education and Employment Alliance (EEA), a partnership between the US Agency for International Development and the IYF that works in Egypt, Indonesia, India, Morocco, Pakistan and the Philippines – countries with high unemployment rates – to increase job training and education programmes.Companies are part of the process. The EEA’s partners include corporations such as Microsoft, General Electric and Oracle. Microsoft is also working with the IYF in Africa to improve the employability of young people. Launched in May last year, the programme is modelled on the IYF’s entra 21 initiative, which aims to improve the IT skills of young people in Latin American and the Caribbean.For companies involved in these and other initiatives, there are sound business reasons for participating – for young people are future employees and customers. “It’s not a jump for companies sourcing and selling in the developing world to realise that the demographics are huge,” says Mr Reese. “And they understand that the social investments need to be there, too.”At the same time, there is a growing recognition that young entrepreneurs need to be given more support so that they can help reduce unemployment through their own small businesses.“About 20 per cent of young people have the potential to start their own business but fewer than 5 per cent do so,” says Andrew Devenport, executive director of Youth Business International (YBI).“So we need to support that missing 15 per cent because if they can start successful businesses, they can potentially offer employment to some of the remainder of the world’s under-employed or unemployed young people.”To do so YBI, which is part of the International Business Leaders Forum, founded by the Prince of Wales, offers disadvantaged young people around the world loans and business mentors. Mr Devenport says the mentoring is an essential part of the programme. “When you start any new business, regardless of personal circumstances, the big thing is to have a shoulder to lean on and someone who can provide advice and access to external networks,” he says.While companies and organisations such as YBI and the IYF are focusing on equipping young people for their future working lives – whether as employees or as entrepreneurs – increasingly, young people themselves are also coming up with innovative solutions to global problems.For these people, technology is the fundamental tool enabling them to get their projects off the ground, to mobilise others to join them and to spread knowledge and information about the challenges they face and the successes they have experienced.In a world where access to technology – whether through a mobile phone or websites such as MySpace and Facebook – is becoming more widespread, young people are better equipped than ever to find ways of improving their own lives and the lives of those around them.These youngsters are not only entrepreneurial and technologically savvy, they are also plugged into global networks and connecting as never before, using technology to share ideas.Several of the IYF’s YouthActionNet Global Fellows are using the power of technology in this way. In Albania, Mjaft!, which translates as “Enough!”, is a youth movement founded by Erion Veliaj and a group of his student friends that uses text messages to spread the word about issues ranging from the failings of the education system to human trafficking.In Australia, Tom Dawkins has created Vibewire.net, a website designed to promote youth participation in democracy by encouraging people to contribute articles, music and essays to the site.Such individuals possess not only technological know-how. They also have an energy and idealism that prompts them to take risks and look beyond traditional obstacles at new ways of addressing poverty or global healthcare.“We’ve seen this outpouring of energy from young people all over the world who are wanting to help with these issues,” says Deepti Doshi, talent manager at Acumen Fund, a non-profit venture fund that uses entrepreneurial approaches to address global poverty. “And they can see they can do things a bit differently.”In the corporate world, recruiters talk of a generation of employees who want to work for companies they see as responsible members of society, while young social entrepreneurs are coming up with innovative solutions to everything from combating climate change in Nairobi to educating peers about the dangers of HIV/Aids in Beijing.In the world of philanthropy, the children of wealthy families are also becoming more engaged. “We’ve come in contact with young people of wealth who feel a real sense of stewardship and a responsibility to do something with their resources – and they are approaching it with real creativity,” says Beth Cohen, director of the Global Philanthropists Circle at Synergos, a non-profit organisation addressing poverty whose Next Generation Group focuses on young philanthropists and social investors.Alan Williams, vice-president for leadership and engagement at the IYF believes that young people in all spheres of life have more potential than ever to contribute to change. “[This is] a generation of young people who are more civically engaged than previous generations,” he says.
818;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-18T22:38:25Z;VMware undaunted by rival’s catty comments;;As the boss of the hottest company to emerge from the software industry in 2007, Diane Greene has had to deal recently with a familiar rite of passage: the jibes of Larry Ellison.The Oracle founder likes to take pot shots at new rivals, and so it has been lately with VMware, the “virtualisation” software company Ms Greene and her computer scientist husband founded a decade ago this month.Mr Ellison has been characteristically dismissive. He recently compared the company to Netscape, and predicted that Microsoft would quickly eclipse it as it did the browser pioneer. For good measure, he added that the base layer of software on which virtualisation depends, called a hypervisor, was so simple that his cat could write it.Ms Greene’s tart response, delivered during an interview with the Financial Times at VMware’s Silicon Valley headquarters: “If his very smart cat could write it, my very smart tortoise could write his database.”The public barbs highlight just how much is at stake in the race to occupy this arcane corner of the software world. Not since Google has the Valley thrown up a company that has made such a splash on Wall Street. In highly volatile trading since its initial public offering this summer, VMware’s stock market value jumped as high as $48bn before settling back to about $33bn, making it the world’s fourth most valuable independent software company behind Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.Like Google, VMware created one of the most promising new technology markets of the decade almost single-handedly. Virtualisation lets companies run a number of tasks simultaneously on a single server by fooling each application into thinking it has sole use of the machine. In effect, it creates a number of “virtual machines” operating side-by-side on each computer – a money-saving ruse that has made it the hottest trend in datacentres.Fewer than 5 per cent of today’s corporate servers employ the technology, yet this has already been enough to drive VMware’s revenues to an expected $1.3bn last year, up more than 80 per cent from 2006 and cementing its position as one of the fastest growing software companies ever.In another similarity with Google, this eye-opening success has attracted the attention of a powerful adversary in the shape of Microsoft. The software giant has said it will include its own rival virtualisation software with its Windows server operating system, starting in the second half of next year.Ms Greene counters that Microsoft’s Windows-centric approach to the world makes it a “silo of homogeneity” and not suited to the heterogeneous world of virtualisation, where applications running on different operating systems can all coexist in the same architecture.Yet Microsoft’s long-term prospects in this market look much better than they did in search. An estimated two out of every three corporate datacentres run Windows, giving Microsoft an immediate opening.Microsoft is one of three big risks looming on the horizon for VMware. A second, alluded to in Mr Ellison’s feline taunt, is that the base layer of its software will become commoditised. An open source version, known as Xen, has already gained a sizable following.The third risk is that, even if VMware can withstand its first real dose of competition, the virtualisation market will not turn out, ultimately, to offer as big an opening as its huge market valuation implies.Ms Greene is counting on virtualisation continuing to make steady inroads into the server world, while also revolutionising the desktop PC business. By attracting much greater attention to the technology, this year’s spectacular IPO could turn out to be an important catalyst in bringing this vision closer. “You can go to your dentist,” says Ms Greene, “and they’ve heard about this virtualisation stuff.”
819;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Tech execs defiant despite possible gloom;;When “times are tough, you’ve really got to trim the fat in your business, and our software will help you do that”. So said Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, seven years ago – just weeks before a collapse in orders forced him to issue a profit warning, signalling the beginning of a severe tech recession.Similar bravado has been in evidence this week, even as Wall Street took fright at a cautious forecast from Intel and braced for the fall-out from an economic slowdown in the US, the technology sector’s biggest market.“We have not seen so far any hesitance of enterprise clients to invest in software,” Henning Kagermann, chairman of SAP, said. “If the market gets tougher, [customers] need to improve performance, and this is by automating, bringing more software in, getting better insights.”Jonathan Schwartz, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, made a similar claim as he unveiled an internet-related acquisition this week. “Even in the midst of uncertain times, customers look to the internet as a source of efficiency.”Executives like these brush off comparisons with the last tech downturn. One-off factors, such as fears about Y2K and over-inflated promises during the internet bubble, distorted the picture then, said Mr Kagermann. “People hyped up the next generation of software,” he said.Tech executives also point to their broader diversification. While emerging markets represent 10-15 per cent of the revenues of most big tech companies, they have come to account for a far larger part of their growth.IBM, giving details on Thursday about a positive earnings report that has been one of the few bright spots for tech this week, said that nearly a quarter of its business is now in countries where revenues are growing 10 per cent or more in local currency terms.Yet a tighter economy could still expose those companies that don’t have the product mix, global reach or variable cost structures to withstand falling IT budgets and consumer spending in the US – even if an economic slowdown doesn’t spread more widely.The stock market has already cast its votes, handing the tech sector – which normally enjoys a January rally – its worst new-year start for years.The rout has focused on the cyclical, capital-intensive chip sector, with Intel slumping 28 per cent since the start of the year. A boom in PCs is expected to cool this year, pushing shares in Hewlett-Packard and Dell each down by 16 per cent. And profit-taking has hit high-fliers like Apple (off 20 per cent) and Research in Motion (26 per cent).
820;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-17T02:27:34Z;Oracle acquires BEA for $8.5bn;;Oracle led a fresh round of consolidation in the software industry on Wednesday as it pulled off the $8.5bn purchase of BEA Systems, a middleware company it has stalked since last summer.Meanwhile, Sun Microsystems picked up one of Europe’s most closely watched young tech companies – open source database company MySQL – for $1bn, and SAP announced it had sealed enough support to close its €4.8bn ($7bn) purchase of Business Objects.Oracle won over BEA’s board as it raised its offer for the company by 14 per cent to $19.375 a share. The move echoed a pattern also seen with its purchase of PeopleSoft, the landmark deal that triggered wider software consolidation, when Oracle eventually paid considerably more than it originally offered, in spite of threats to reduce the value of its offer.While lower than the $21 a share that BEA’s board had said it wanted, the final price still represents a partial victory for Alfred Chuang, BEA chief executive.Oracle’s decision to go public with its interest in BEA, a company it had pursued off and on for years, came after shareholder activist Carl Icahn had taken a stake in BEA and called for a sale of the business.Since signing a confidentiality agreement with BEA that gave him access to internal company data, however, Mr Icahn has been largely silent, giving the company time to regroup and present a stronger case to Wall Street about its efforts to turn its business around.The acquisition will put Oracle almost neck-and-neck with IBM in terms of its middleware, a layer of software in complex corporate IT systems that has become increasingly important amid the rise of the internet, said Ian Finlay, an analyst at AMR.Also, with a presence in application software that IBM does not have, and a stronger middleware business than SAP, Oracle is now the only company other than Microsoft able to sell a full “stack” of software to corporate customers, he added. Meanwhile, Sun’s acquisition of MySQL marks the latest attempt to kick-start a software business that has frequently failed to live up to the company’s hopes. Jonathan Schwartz, Sun CEO, said his company would be able to sell other software and services around MySQL’s products.Started by two Swedes and a Finn, MySQL has been the most successful of a number of open source database companies that have tried to challenge a market dominated by Oracle, IBM and Microsoft.Marten Mickos, its CEO, is fond of saying that by distributing its software free of charge and selling service and support, his aim has been to reduce the size of the global database market by a third, and take a third of what was left.Mr Schwartz said that MySQL had revenues last year of $70m, an increase of 50 per cent from the year before, and that he planned to continue its disruptive business model.Additional reporting by Maija Palmer in London
821;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-16T23:59:00Z;Open season on Open Source;;"You could forgive Kevin Harvey of Benchmark Capital if he sounded a little smug when I spoke to him earlier today about the eye-catching $1bn sale of MySQL. A longtime venture investor in open source companies, Harvey has had to put up with a few knocks along the way. As he put it:When we first invested in Red Hat it was thought to be totally insane. When we funded MySQL it was only partly insane.Benchmark’s purchase of a 26 per cent stake certainly looks pretty smart now. Harvey (whose earlier successes have included eBay) wouldn’t say how much he had invested, but MySQL took in around $39m in all.It’s hard to shake off the lingering feeling, though, that open source as a pure-play strategy will never add up to much, and Sun’s purchase of MySQL seems to confirm this. Sure, it’s hugely disruptive to the software establishment, but it’s beginning to look like open source has more value when used as part of a traditional technology company’s armoury, rather than as a stand-alone business.Sun hopes that owning MySQL will give it a chance to sell other (proprietary) software to users of the open source database. That is the same idea that prompted earlier open source acquisitions by Novell (of Linux distributor SuSe) and IBM (middleware company Gluecode.) Oracle didn’t even bother making an acquisition but simply declared that it would support Red Hat’s version of Linux, dealing a big blow to that company.It seems only Red Hat really believes in trying to build a pure open source software ""stack"". At around $500m a year and growing at 30 per cent, Red Hat’s revenues are not to be sneezed at. But, tellingly, it is Sun, not Red Hat, that has bagged MySQL. Equally tellingly, MySQL’s investors discovered that the company was worth more as takeover-bait for Sun than as a stand alone business. ""It was on the IPO track until Sun convinced us to take this track,"" says Harvey.Maybe Sun has overpaid. But if Schwartz is right and MySQL is worth more dead than alive (as it were), then it suggests that the dominant software models will be hyrbid ones, not pure open source."
822;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-16T21:45:00Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off;;Wall Street stocks retreated again on Wednesday during a volatile session in which Intel’s earnings figures prompted another bout of selling in the technology sector.Materials and energy companies also came under pressure as crude oil briefly dipped below $90 a barrel and traders bet that a weakened US economy would cause demand for commodities to slump.The market was split with financial stocks enjoying a bounce after JPMorgan cheered the investors by avoiding severe subprime-related losses. However, Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, fell sharply after it slashed its dividend to shore up capital reserves.Retail names also rallied as traders went bargain hunting in discount and department store names. Meanwhile, traders also rushed to cover short positions in the beaten-down homebuilder sector.A late sell-off left the S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent at 1,373.20, its lowest close since November 2006. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,394.59 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 12,466.16.However the Russell 2000 small-cap index advanced 0.4 per cent to 699.91 but remains 18 per cent below its July peak.Large-cap technology stocks sold off in early trading after Intel‘s quarterly profits lagged Wall Street’s expectations and its fiscal first quarter revenue outlook disappointed analysts. The shares fell 12.4 per cent to $19.88 as brokerages cut price targets on the stock.Expectations of bumper earnings growth made tech a stand-out sector in 2007 but the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 9.7 per cent this year with the PHLX semiconductor sector index down 12.7 per cent.Fourth quarter earnings are expected to hold up well, averaging gains of more than 20 per cent. But Todd Salamone, vice-president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, warned that the bulls could set the sector up for a fall.He said: “The tech sector is expected to have strong earnings growth so it may have more trouble beating estimates.”BEA Systems was a bright spot, soaring 18.5 per cent to $18.46 after Oracle agreed to buy the business software company for $8.5bn. Oracle’s shares rose 2.9 per cent to $21.92.The financial sector rebounded after JPMorgan’s results revealed much less exposure to subprime damage than some of its rivals. Fourth quarter earnings fell 34 per cent to $2.97bn, worse than expected, as the bank took a $1.3bn writedown on mortgage investments.However JPMorgan’s problems were small compared with the $18.1bn in writedowns that Citigroup revealed on Tuesday. Citi reported a $9.8bn fourth quarter loss and revealed a sharp rise in consumer credit costs. JPMorgan’s shares rose 5.8 per cent to $41.43 but Citi fell 2.6 per cent to $26.24. Merrill Lynch, expected to reveal heavy losses on Thursday, rose 3.9 per cent to $55.09.Also reporting on Wednesday, Wells Fargo, up 3.3 per cent at $27.37, said fourth quarter profit fell 38 per cent, in line with expectations.Shares in Ambac Financialplunged 38.7 per cent to $12.97 after the bond insurer said it would raise $1bn in new capital and slash its dividend to help preserve its triple-A rating. Ambac also said it expects to take a $5.4bn pre-tax writedown for the fourth quarter. MBIA, a rival, fell 16.5 per cent to $13.40.Investors took profits in the agribusiness sector, which escaped the worst of the new year sell-off on hopes that the global food price boom would offset a slowing US economy. Monsanto fell 8.6 per cent to $112.70 and Mosaiclost 9.4 per cent to $91.71.Energy and materials were the worst performing of the S&P 10 leading sectors as traders priced in waning US demand. National Oilwell Varco gave up 6.1 per cent to $64.14 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 6.6 per cent to $88.63. However falling crude prices were a boon for the struggling transport sector, with truckers and airlines receiving a boost.A comparatively modest increase in consumer price inflation in December, which rose 0.3 per cent compared to expectations of a 0.2 per cent uptick, may leave the door open for the Fed to cut interest rates aggressively, as the futures market now expects.David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley, said: “The Fed is now clearly downplaying the emphasis on inflation while raising their focus on the downside risks”.The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book regional survey showed the US economy continued to grow at the end of last year, but at a slower pace, providing some comfort to investors fearing a recession.
823;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2008-01-16T19:21:18Z;Database records and a new order for the Web;;Hidden behind some billion-dollar database-company acquisitions – on what must be a record-breaking day for number of deals in the sector – came a little funding news that could eventually have equal significance for the way we organise our information online.While Sun was paying $1bn for MySQL, Oracle was buying BEA Systems for $8.5bn and SAP was wrapping up its $7.15bn Business Objects acquisition, San Francisco-based Metaweb received $42.5m in second-round funding led by Goldman Sachs.Metaweb says its aim is to build a better infrastructure for the web. Its first product is Freebase – “an open, shared database of the world’s information.”Web sites have been able to provide more relevant and meaningful results for users’ searches in recent years, thanks to XML, which allows more detailed tagging and categorising of information.Wikipedia is an example of information being organised by users themselves in an even more structured way and Freebase is extending this by drawing on Wikipedia and many other sources for its open database.It differs from Wikipedia in listing facts and statistics rather than articles on subjects. This rawer format allows others to sort and repurpose the information into new forms on their own web sites. Freebase is also different from Google Base in eliminating any duplication of data and providing a community editing tool.It is still early days, but Metaweb hopes to make money by serving ads next to the information that Freebase throws up – a model where Google has been rather successful and where Metaweb could become a threat – as well as by charging for some commercial uses of its APIs.
824;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Microsoft wars;;When Microsoft conceded defeat in its nine-year antitrust battle with Europe’s competition authorities, another legal challenge became inevitable. Indeed, emboldened by the software giant’s submission, its rivals have persuaded Brussels to launch a second investigation with potentially bigger consequences for markets in desktop and internet applications. There may be a case for Microsoft to answer. But the European Commission should try to avoid another protracted legal fight.Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner, should give complaints by IBM, Oracle and Sun Microsystems a fair hearing. Their allegation that Microsoft has abused the dominance of its Office product by unfairly keeping secret information to hinder the interoperability of rival software is a serious charge. So is the separate claim by Opera, the Norwegian browser company, that Microsoft illegally linked Internet Explorer to its Windows system.While the Office dossier deals with an entrenched part of Microsoft’s business, the other complaint touches on a newer one. The outcome, therefore, will probably be more relevant to businesses and consumers using internet applications. Fortunately, the legal principles established by the earlier case mean the Commission can proceed swiftly. But it should be careful too.It needs first to consider what the market might achieve without regulatory prompting.Microsoft’s opponents suspect it wants to extend its dominant platform to the internet and that it will try to do so by controlling standards. But it may not succeed. Nimbler rivals such as Google already have applications running on the internet. Microsoft’s efforts to set international standards for a new version of Office have hit opposition from governments too. If the market forces the company to open up, then EU action may not be needed.Second, should the Commission’s inquiry uncover evidence of unfair practice, then going on a prosecutorial rampage should be a last resort. That would add only to lawyers’ billable hours. Remedies may again be hard to enforce and rendered irrelevant by product evolution.There are signs Microsoft is ready to respond to a flexible and diplomatic approach. The company’s reaction to the investigation has been to stress its co-operation. That is a good omen. It shows that Microsoft has learnt from experience. The company has every incentive to placate the competition regulator. Negotiation could yield results. The Commission’s goal is to make software markets more competitive. Its inquiry should be forward looking and not just rake over the past.
825;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-12-26T19:47:24Z;Transocean and Google reap M&A rewards;;Technology groups Google and Oracle and energy companies XTO and Transocean enjoyed the best share price performance among US corporations making large domestic acquisitions this year, according to Dealogic data.Figures from the data provider show how shareholders have been willing to reward big deals in the technology and energy sectors, while financial services groups have been unable to offset the pain of the credit squeeze with large acquisitions.Wachovia and Bank of America, the two North Carolina-based banks, were among the worst performers, according to Dealogic.Google took the top spot. Its shares rose 47 per cent between its announcement in April of the $3.1bn purchase of Doubleclick, the internet advertising company, and December 14. The search engine outperformed the S&P 500 index by 44 per cent.Second place went to Trans-ocean, which in July made a bold consolidation move in the oil services sector, acquiring rival GlobalSantaFe for $17.6bn. After the deal was announced, Transocean outperformed the S&P by 31 per cent.Meanwhile, Oracle was rewarded for its purchase of Hyperion Solutions, a rival software group, and XTO gained in the wake of its acquisition of assets from Dominion Resources.The Dealogic analysis has been running for four years, offering some evidence of investor reaction to big consolidation moves.However, it falls short of an evaluation of the best and worst deals. A company’s ability to implement projected cost savings or revenue targets related to a merger often cannot be calculated for months after a deal closes.The worst performer in 2007 was Vulcan Materials, which makes construction aggregates. It agreed to buy Florida Rock Industries for $4.5bn in February, just as the US housing market began its decline. Vulcan shares have underperformed the S&P index by 29 per cent since then.Bank of America also suffered after its $21bn purchase of Illinois-based LaSalle Bank in April. Its shares have fallen 17 per cent compared with the index.Wachovia has underperformed the S&P by 24 per cent since its $6.8bn takeover of AG Edwards, the brokerage, which was agreed at the end of May.
826;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-12-21T21:57:49Z;RIM brings cheer as Wall Street closes on high;;Wall Street ended the week on a high note on Friday with technology stocks leading the charge after some strong results from Research In Motion cheered the market.The banking sector rallied on reports that Merrill Lynch is seeking a multi-billion-dollar capital injection and financials appeared untroubled by reports that plans for a “superfund” to bail out troubled structured investment vehicles were being dropped for lack of demand.Energy and materials were the pick of the S&P’s leading sectors as commodity prices surged and retailers rebounded after the Commerce Department revealed a sharp rise in consumer spending.The S&P 500 closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,484.46 on Friday for an increase of 1.1 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent on the week to 13,450.65 while the Nasdaq Composite fared better, gaining 2.1 per cent to 2,691.99 over the period. The Russell 2000 small cap index climbed 4.2 per cent to 785.60 this week, helped by an increase in deal-making.The New York Stock Exchange set a volume record in the first hour on Friday as traders settled positions before the holidays and as several types of derivative contracts expired – a quarterly event known as “quadruple witching”. However, volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called “fear barometer” – fell to its lowest level since the end of October, down 19.7 per cent for the week at 18.68.Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry e-mail device, capped a good week for technology after it said third-quarter net in-come more than doubled to $370.5m and revenues soared. The company’s up-beat fourth-quarter guidance exceeded analysts’ estimates and the shares jumped 11.9 per cent on the week to $118.63. UBS raised its price target to $155.RIM’s stellar results came in the same week that Oracle increased second-quarter profit by 35 per cent, helped by strong software licence sales. Its shares rose 7.1 per cent to $22.71 this week.Adobe Systems, the software company, beat estimates with a 21 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits and the shares edged up 0.2 per cent to $42.18.“There’s been no crisis in technology. The momentum has been phenomenal,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Financials had a mixed week as investors were forced to weigh up whether to avoid the sector because of more mortage-related losses or buy into the stocks because of the prospect of big capital infusions from abroad.Reports that Merrill Lynch is in talks with Temasek, Singapore’s state investment agency, about a potential multi-billion-dollar investment moved the shares higher on Friday.Like many US banks, Merrill could benefit from a boost to its capital reserves after it took $8.4bn in writedowns in October. The shares fell 2.3 per cent on the week to $55.54 after an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton forecast Merrill would take another $8.6bn in writedowns this quarter.Morgan Stanley this week tapped China Investment Corp for $5bn as it an-nounced a total of $9.4bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter and posted the first loss in its history. The shares ended the week up 8.1 per cent at $54.37.Bear Stearns, which in October took a $1bn investment from China’s Citic Securities, fell to its first loss this week, after it wrote down $1.9bn for the quarter. The shares fell 5.6 per cent to $89.95 on the week.Investors were rocked by the threat of credit downgrades on monoline bond insurers.A downgrade of bond insurers could seriously affect world credit markets, triggering sharp losses on insured securities.MBIA, fell 27.4 per cent to $20.03 this week after it revealed $30.6n in exposure to complex debt securities. Fitch Ratings warned it could cut MBIA’s triple-A rating unless it raised $1bn in capital.Fitch issued the same warning to Ambac Financial on Friday after identifying $32.2bn in exposure to collateralised debt obligations backed by subprime collateral.However, Ambac’s shares rose 16.9 per cent to $26.66 on the week after Moody’s affirmed its triple-A rating.Transport stocks were disappointing after FedEx, the logistics company, and Union Pacific, rail operator, issued weak earnings guidance, citing rising fuel costs. The shares fell 1.7 per cent to $94.29 and 3.5 per cent to $126.02 respectively.
827;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-12-21T09:46:17Z;Oracle heartens Asian markets;;Asian shares rose on Friday for the first time this week, shrugging off lingering subprime worries and China’s latest interest rate rise. Many investors took heart from strong results and a reassuring outlook from US technology company Oracle.The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares was up 1.4 per cent by late afternoon in Tokyo.”We are not getting much of a year-end rally,” said Ivan Leung, chief investment strategist in Asia for JPMorgan private bank in Hong Kong. ”But valuations are coming down in Asia and are beginning to look quite attractive again.” He said he expects the next few weeks to be quiet but that volatility would pick up again in the new year.Japanese stocks were boosted by news of moves towards reorganization of the electronics industry.The Nikkei average gained 1.5 per cent to 15,257.00 and the broader Topix index rose 0.8 per cent to 1,469.20.Electronics companies were buoyed by news that Hitachi was in talks to sell a major stake in its ailing hard disk drive business to a private equity firm.Shares of the electronics conglomerate jumped 3.6 per cent to Y805 after the Nikkei newspaper reported it was in talks to sell just under 50 per cent of its loss-making HDD business to Silver Lake, a US private equity firm which already owns Seagate, the world’s largest HDD manufacturer.Hitachi has struggled to turn around its HDD business, which was acquired from IBM in 2003.The sector also attracted attention due to news that Toshiba will pull out of a liquid crystal display joint venture it has with Matsushita and Hitachi and buy panels from Sharp instead.Sharp gained 2.9 per cent to Y1,956 while Toshiba added 2.5 per cent to Y837.Steel companies benefited from a strong industry outlook, extending solid gains made earlier in the week on news that they would increase cross-shareholdings in each other. Nippon Steel rose 4.9 per cent to Y661 and JFE Holdings gained 3.2 per cent to Y5,530.On the downside, Canon, which expects to post record profits this year, lost 2.2 per cent to Y5,240 after a Nikkei report that it might miss its full-year operating profits forecast.Banks went into retreat after Bear Stearns, which has been battered by the subprime problem, announced it would make a net loss that is four times more than expected. Mitsubishi UFJ declined 1.2 per cent to Y1,041 and Sumitomo Mitsui dropped 2.3 per cent to Y839,000.Orix, the leasing and non-bank group, lost 6 per cent to Y18,520, after Goldman Sachs downgraded the shares to “neutral” from “buy.”In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 2.3 per cent to 27,626.92. Property stocks benefited from the latest inflation figures, which showed that prices in November rose by 3.4 per cent in the previous 12 months – the fastest increase for nine years. That, investors believed, would increase demand for property as a hedge against inflation.Markets in mainland China took the People’s Bank of China’s 18-basis-point increase on Thursday in the cost of borrowing in stride. Property shares retreated but financial stocks held firm as the magnitude of the increase in rates was less than many in the market had feared. The Shanghai composite index ended up 1.2 per cent at 5,101.78 while the smaller Shenzhen composite added 1.4 per cent to 1,375.89.Australian stocks rose for the first time in a week as a rise in new car sales in November, by 1.1 per cent, suggested that consumer confidence was holding up in the face of subprime gloom. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed 1.1 per cent higher at 6,247.00, just off the day’s peak.Financial stocks took the lead on the view that they’re looking oversold. Some also cited rumours that China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange has taken small stakes in some Australian banks, though the China regulator denied any such investment. National Australia Bank closed up 3.6 per cent at A$37.81 and ANZ Bank advanced 2 per cent to A$27.40.South Korean shares made their biggest rise in three weeks as investors focused on the anticipated effects of this week’s presidential election. The Kospi rose 1.8 per cent to 1,878.32. The financial sector benefited as the president-elect, Lee Myung-bak, has suggested that a ban on big conglomerates owning banks may be lifted. Kookmin, the country’s biggest bank, rose 3.7 per cent and Shinhan Financial jumped 6.8 per cent.Elsewhere in the region, Thai shares rose 1.7 per cent to 804.97, ahead of Sunday’s elections, the first since the military coup in 2006. Singapore’s Straits Times index gained 1.6 per cent to 3,411.18.
828;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-12-20T23:19:32Z;Netsuite takes the Wall Street tiger by the tail;;"Full marks to Larry Ellison (not to mention Credit Suisse and WR Hambrecht) for their management of the Netsuite IPO, but it seems that sometimes you just can’t plan for Wall Street’s apparent irrationality.This had all the makings of one of those headline-grabbing IPOs that leaves a company’s early shareholders with an uncomfortable feeling that they have somehow been short-changed. The bankers come up with a price that is meant to give the stock a comfortable ride in the after-market, only to see trading go through the roof. Initial investors are left to wonder how much money was left on the table (this summer’s VMware IPO was the most glaring recent example.)It seemed that the Dutch auction format used for the Netsuite IPO was going to iron out that effect. In recent days the indicated price range was raised twice, from an initial $13-16. The shares were eventually priced on Wednesday at $26 each. This is a company that is far smaller than Salesforce.com, which has grown far slower than Salesforce.com, and which has yet to prove its business model works – yet the pricing was at a significant premium to Salesforce.com on any measure you care to take.It looked as though Ellison, CEO of Oracle and controlling shareholder of Netsuite, had called the IPO traders’ bluff. If they wanted to bid up the auction to a dizzy level to assure themselves of an allocation, he was not above hitting the bid and taking the money. When the shares opened on Thursday they settled just above the issue price, despite very heavy trading. Any premium had seemingly gone to the company and its early investors.So how to account for what happened in the last two hours of trading? Netsuite’s shares eventually drifted all the way up to $35.50, to yield a significant first-day ""pop."" It seems that, with a shortage of shares in the IPO, there’s just no way to handle the weight of money looking for a home in the ""software-as-a-service"" sector (Salesforce was also up 8 per cent Thursday.) But when the lock-up ends and Netsuite insiders get to unload more of their shares it should be a different story."
829;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-12-20T21:50:20Z;Tech sector rallies after Oracle calms concerns;;"Wall Street stocks posted modest gains on Thursday with technology stocks leading the pack after strong quarterly results at Oracle helped allay fears of a slowdown in corporate tech spending.However, the major equities seesawed throughout the day after MBIA, a bond insurer, said it had billions of dollars in exposure to high-risk securities, stoking credit market fears.Financials were a weak point after Bear Stearns fell to a big loss and made more mortgage-related writedowns. Meanwhile, a gauge of future economic growth fell to its lowest level in two years and a measure of regional manufacturing activity contracted sharply.In a choppy session, the S&P 500 rose as much as 0.6 per cent in early trade, then fell into negative territory, before closing 0.5 per cent higher at 1,455.06. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 13,245.64, while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 1.5 per cent at 2,640.86.“Nothing seems able to push the market up [much] because we have these daily torpedoes with respect to credit,” Bill Knapp, chief investment strategist at MainStay Investments, said.MBIA’s shares fell 26.2 per cent to $19.95 after it revealed $30.6bn in exposure to collateralised debt obligations, including $8.1bn of high-risk securities known as “CDO-squared”.Fitch Ratings put MBIA on watch for a possible credit rating cut and gave the company four to six weeks to find $1bn to shore up its capital reserves. A downgrade of a top monoline like MBIA could trigger severe stress in credit markets and potentially huge losses on insured securities.“MBIA simply did not disclose arguably the riskiest parts of its CDO portfolio to investors,” an analyst at Morgan Stanley said. The cost of insuring MBIA’s debt soared.News of the disclosure came a day after Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit outlook on several bond insurers, including MBIA, to “negative” – meaning a downgrade is more likely – and cut one, ACA Financial Guaranty, to junk.Bear Stearns fell to a $854m loss in the fourth quarter, the first deficit in the investment bank’s history and much worse than analysts had anticipated.Mortgage-related writedowns totalled $1.9bn, $700m more than previously advised, and the company posted negative net revenue of $379m, compared with $2.4bn a year ago. The shares closed up 0.9 per cent at $91.42, but are down 44 per cent this year.Bear’s results followed a terrible quarter for Morgan Stanley, which also fell to its first loss after taking a total of $9.4bn in mortgage-related writedowns.There was better news from technology giant Oracle, which increased second-quarter profit 35 per cent to $1.3bn, helped by a jump in software licence sales. Revenues increased 28 per cent to $5.3bn.The results beat expectations and the shares rose 6.5 per cent to $22.10 after several analysts raised their target prices on the stock.Oracle’s results provided support to a range of large-cap technology stocks including IBM, up 1.6 per cent at $108.84, and Microsoft, 2.1 per cent higher at $35.52. Qualcomm, the wireless chip developer, rose 2.2 per cent to $39.12 after it raised its fiscal first quarter profit outlook.Technology was among the best-returning sectors this year, but confidence wobbled in recent weeks after Cisco’s chief executive cautioned about prospects for sales to financial companies. After the market closed Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handheld e-mail device, said third-quarter profit more than doubled to $370.5m.The shares closed up 4.8 per cent at $106.99 and climbed another 6.7 per cent after-hours.The transport sector had another disappointing day after FedEx, the logistics company that is seen by many investors as an
economic bellwether, rep-orted a fall in second-quarter earnings from $511m to $479m.While that beat expectations, the company’s third-quarter guidance was below analysts’ forecasts and FedEx also cut its fiscal 2008 capital expenditure forecast. The shares fell 1.1 per cent to $93.63.Retail stocks were also sold after Rite Aid, the pharmacy chain, posted a wider-than-expected $84.8m quarterly loss. The shares fell 31.7 per cent to $2.80."
830;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-12-20T01:17:04Z;Netsuite doubles IPO price to $26 a share;;Shares in Netsuite, whose initial public offering has become the software industry’s most prominent since this summer’s launch of VMware, are set to open at an unexpectedly high level on Thursday, following a surge in interest that prompted the company to price the stock at double its most conservative estimate of a week ago.Netsuite late on Wednesday put a price on the shares of $26, lifting the proceeds from the offering to more than $160m and valuing the company at $1.55bn. It had first indicated a likely price of $13-$16, but raised the range twice during the Dutch auction used to price the offering and eventually priced the shares above even that level.The IPO caps a year in which companies like Netsuite, which deliver their products as a service over the internet rather than as traditional “shrink-wrapped” software for companies to load and run on their own servers, have edged closer to centre stage in the technology world.Though still accounting for only an estimated 6 per cent of the overall software market, so-called “software as a service”, or SaaS, has been the fastest growing part of the business and has started to reach a scale where its long-term potential is being reflected in the financial markets.In Silicon Valley, most venture capitalists have focused on this for some time as the preferred model for software start-ups. Wall Street’s growing interest has contributed to a near-50 per cent jump in the shares of market leader Salesforce.com since the beginning of September, lifting its value to over $7bn. Meanwhile, established software companies have also become more active, with SAP and Microsoft both unveiling significant online services in recent months aimed at the small business customers that are the main focus of the technology.The SaaS market, which amounted to $3.7bn in 2006, is set to grow at a cumulative rate of 32 per cent a year to the end of 2011, lifting revenues to nearly $15bn, according to an estimate from technology research firm IDC.Though still considerably smaller than Salesforce.com, Netsuite’s revenues of $77m in the first nine months of this year make it one of the most prominent companies in the field, stimulating interest in its IPO even at a traditionally quiet period of the year.Netsuite has also attracted attention thanks to founder Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, who will continue to own 55 per cent of the stock after the IPO through a private investment fund. To avoid potential conflicts of interest – Oracle faces growing competition from internet-delivered software and has also been talked of as a possible acquirer of companies like Netsuite – Mr Ellison has agreed to put his shares into a “lockbox” that will leave him with no control, except to decide on any future change in control at Netsuite.At a multiple of nearly 15 times the company’s expected revenues for this year, the IPO pricing puts Netsuite at a considerable premium to the 9.6 multiple of the better-established Salesforce. Though still expanding faster than the larger company, Netsuite’s growth is expected to slow to around 57 per cent this year, compared with 51 per cent for Salesforce.Netsuite has yet to break into profit, reporting an operating loss equivalent to 26 per cent of its revenues in the first nine months of this year, compared to the 2 per cent operating profit margin of Salesforce.
831;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle brushes off downturn fears;;Oracle on Wednesday brushed aside Wall Street’s lingering concerns about a US-led slowdown in technology demand as it reported surprisingly strong quarterly numbers and issued a confident forecast for the coming months.The news, which lifted Oracle’s shares nearly 7 per cent in after-market trading, capped a strong run this year in which the company’s recent string of takeovers has started to feed through into a noticeable lift in revenues and profit margins.Oracle disclosed that it had continued to hold talks with rival software maker BEA and its investment bankers about a possible acquisition – even after its $17-a-share offer was rebuffed this autumn – but that these had now been called off.“We’ve concluded that no friendly deal can be done with the current BEA board at a price and terms acceptable to Oracle,” said Safra Catz, co-president and chief financial officer.BEA now faces a deadline of the end of this year to find out whether Carl Icahn, the activist investor, plans to fight a proxy battle to have the board replaced at its next shareholder meeting, a move that might once again open the door to Oracle.Underpinning Oracle’s latest earnings was a 28 per cent jump in revenues to $5.3bn, comfortably ahead of market expectations of $5.04bn, while new licence revenues rose 38 per cent, to $1.7bn. The decline in the US dollar contributed seven percentage points of growth in both cases.Net income rose 35 per cent to $1.3bn, or 25 cents a share, while proforma earnings of 31 cents a share topped Wall Street expectations of 4 cents.Oracle’s “broad, diversified customer base” enabled it to escape any fall in orders due to the upheaval in financial markets in recent months, and the pipeline of potential new orders re-mained strong, Ms Catz said.
832;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-12-19T21:59:16Z;Uncertainty on bond insurers adds to volatility;;Wall Street stocks seesawed wildly on Wednesday before closing mostly lower after a rating agency lowered its credit outlook on several bond insurers, and cut one to junk, raising fears of further turmoil in credit markets.There was encouraging demand for $20bn in term funds auctioned by the Federal Reserve but it was not enough to reassure investors on another topsy turvy day for the major equity indices.Although Morgan Stanley pleased the market by announcing a $5bn capital injection from China it also wrote down another $5.7bn, leaving traders uncertain whether financials represented a buying opportunity.The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.6 per cent in early trade but later fell by about the same amount before closing 0.1 per cent lower at 1,452.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 13,206.95, but the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.2 per cent at 2,601.01.Financials pared solid early gains after S&P said “worsening expectations” for the performance of mortgage-backed securities meant it was lowering its outlook on MBIA and Ambac Financial’s AAA-rating to “negative”, meaning a downgrade is more likely.Ambac said it was confident of the performance of its insured portfolio and was taking measures to reinforce its capital position and its shares rose 1.8 per cent to $27.46. MBIA fell 2.5 per cent to $27.02. S&P cut ACA Financial Guaranty’s credit rating from A to CCC, in effect, stopping it from insuring more debt.Morgan Stanley rose 4.2 per cent to $50.08 after it said China Investment Corp, an investment vehicle controlled by the Chinese government, would inject $5bn to help shore up its balance sheet.Morgan fell to its first ever quarterly loss after it took a total of $9.4bn in mortgage-related writedowns, $5.7bn more than the company had advised in November. Full-year earnings were down 62 per cent to $3.44bn.Bear Stearns, 2.2 per cent weaker at $90.60, reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday and is also expected to report a loss for the quarter.In other earnings news Palm disappointed investors after it fell to a $9.6m second-quarter loss and revenues slid 11 per cent to $349.6m, just below expectations. The shares sank 6.9 per cent to $5.52. Results from Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, are due on Thursday. It rose 1.4 per cent at $102.13.After the closing bell Oracle, the enterprise software firm, reported a bigger-than-expected 35 per cent increase in quarterly net income, helped by a sharp rise in license sales. It closed 2.3 per cent lower at $20.76 but rose 3.7 per cent after hours.Quarterly profit at General Mills, the breakfast cereal producer, gained 1 per cent to $390.5m while revenues rose 7 per cent. The shares fell 1.8 per cent to $57.99 after the company said soaring costs will force it to raise prices.
833;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Brussels hears new complaint over Microsoft;;Microsoft on Thursday faced the first fresh complaint over its market practices in Europe since it lost a long-running antitrust battle with the European Commission this autumn.Opera Software, a Norwegian company whose web browser accounts for slightly less than 2 per cent of online traffic, said it had filed a new complaint with the Commission, in which it accuses Microsoft of abusing a dominant position by tying its own Internet Explorer browser to the Windows operating system.Opera also complains that Microsoft is hindering interoperability by not following accepted web standards.The case marks the first time a competitor has tried to take advantage of a recent landmark legal ruling to try to limit Microsoft’s business practices. In the September judgment, Europe’s Court of First Instance upheld an earlier Commission decision that Microsoft had unlawfully abused its dominant market position, over the tying of its Media Player software to Windows.A Commission official confirmed the Opera complaint and said it would be studied carefully.Microsoft said it would co-operate with any Commission inquiry but added: “We believe the inclusion of the browser into the operating system benefits consumers, and that consumers and PC manufacturers already are free to choose to use any browsers they wish.”The Opera complaint harks back to the “Browser Wars” of a decade ago, which led to US antitrust action against Microsoft. Although the US did not object to Microsoft’s practice of tying its browser to Windows, it found the company had abused its market power in defeating Netscape.Remedies agreed were designed to make it easier for consumers to select different browsers to run on Windows, and to make sure PC makers were free to pre-install any default browser.The case has the backing of some of Microsoft’s biggest rivals through the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, a body that includes IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and AdobeThomas Vinje, ECIS’s legal counsel, said: “Browers are the gateway to the internet. Microsoft seeks to control this gateway.”Opera said it was asking for either an unbundling of Explorer from Windows and/or the pre-installation of alternative web browsers on desktop computers, with a requirement that the company adheres to open web standards.
834;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-12-11T01:12:44Z;LinkedIn’s platform play;;LinkedIn, the business networking site, on Monday gave the world the most detailed glimpse yet of its forthcoming application platform, which will be rolled out over the next few months.Seeking to capitalise on the success of Facebook’s platform strategy, LinkedIn’s platform will do two things: First, like Facebook, it will allow outside developers to build applications that live inside the LinkedIn site. Second, it will allow outside companies to embed LinkedIn data in their own applications. The results could be interesting, as Eric Eldon of VentureBeat writes:With this platform, it’s easy to imagine LinkedIn data appearing within Salesforce and Oracle business software, along with these [companies] creating modules that feature information from their software within LinkedIn. The result of this sort of integration: You’d automatically see valuable business connections as you’re working.Because of its exclusive business focus, successful applications on LinkedIn may have difficulty gaining traction on other social networks where users place a greater emphasis on games and entertainment. Still with 16m business users, LinkedIn is already a big and potentially lucrative market in its own right. With Facebook rumoured to be working on ways for users to distinguish between social and work relationships, and with individual companies examining ways to take advantage of social networking technologies to encourage better communication between their own employees, further distribution opportunities may not be far behind.
835;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;US group might bid for troubled SAP unit;;Rimini Street, a US-based provider of software support, said it was interested in buying TomorrowNow, the SAP unit at the centre of a corporate spying scandal.“We are interested, but we are proceeding cautiously and need to analyse it first,” Seth Ravin, chief executive of Rimini Street, told FT Deutschland, the FT’s sister paper in an interview.SAP, the German software group, revealed at the beginning of the week that it was exploring options for the troubled unit, including selling it.Mr Ravin was among the founders of the Texas-based TomorrowNow and sold the company to SAP almost three years ago.He declined to say whether talks were going on with SAP.The scandal surrounding TomorrowNow, which like Rimini Street sells software maintenance and support to former Oracle customers, broke when SAP’s arch-rival filed a lawsuit earlier this year accusing SAP of corporate espionage.In the wake of the scandal, TomorrowNow’s chief executive and several senior member of management resigned on Monday.SAP is under pressure to announce a swift solution for TomorrowNow in order to avoid further damage to its image.The announcement was widely seen as unsettling customers relying on long-term software support.Since SAP’s announcement, Rimini Street had received a dozen enquiries from TomorrowNow customers “exploring a possible transition”, Mr Ravin said.Customers were uncertain since SAP had not been clear about “what they are doing with TomorrowNow,” he added.Rimini Street is seen as one of the few potential buyers for TomorrowNow, as most big IT service provider are working in collaboration with Oracle and are said not to be interested.
836;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-11-20T14:44:10Z;Interview: On a mission to silence the doubters;;"How can a bunch of “hackers” create an operating system that can run mission-critical applications?” This is a question that Jim Zemlin is proud and relieved to say is no longer asked of Linux, the open source software that is increasingly becoming a force in corporate computing.It is now used by, among others, the banks Credit Suisse First Boston and Bank of America. The internet retailers Amazon and Ebay both use Linux as does Tivo, the innovative personal video recorder group. Motorola has used a version in the Razr mobile phone; and IBM is a prominent supporter of Linux, as are Intel and Oracle.All of which persuades 37-year-old Mr Zemlin that the first, acceptance, stage of the Linux development model is now over. “This is a pervasive operating system,” he says. “You no longer hear questions about whether a ‘hacker’ OS can run mission-critical systems.”Mr Zemlin is the first executive director of the Linux Foundation, formed at the beginning of this year through a merger of the Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group (of which he was executive director), both of which were promoting the adoption of Linux.Derived from Unix, Linux was and continues to be developed by the Finnish software engineeer, Linus Torvalds, and a worldwide army of independent developers. Mr Torvalds, whose independence is guaranteed by the Foundation, retains his power of veto over the technological developments that define the Linux kernel, the functional heart of the software. Mr Zemlin’s job is to act as a combination of standard bearer, evangelist and defender for the operating system.His taste for the last role was tested within a few months of taking office, when Microsoft claimed open source software, including Linux, violated a large number of its patents and could expose users to inherent risks. “It’s all hogwash,“ Mr Zemlin says.“The fact is that Linux does provide better price performance than Windows. There is no greater risk in using open source software than proprietary software from a legal perspective. If you want choice as a consumer of technology, open source and Linux is a far better path than, over time, being locked into a proprietary platform.”At the time of Microsoft’s complaints, Mr Zemlin suggested the software giant was indulging in old fashioned FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). Just looking at the numbers” he told the magazine Computerworld, it is easy to see that if the scare campaign merely delays an average large business’s migration from Windows to Linux by a single day, Microsoft is $34m better off.You would expect no less from the man leading the Linux charge, but Mr Zemlin has no illusions about the resilience of the opposition or the need to strengthen Linux’s hand in the fight for market share. Windows controls the desktop and has a 40 per cent share of the server market. Linux is in second place on about 25 per cent, with the rest made up of Unix variants.“Linux needs to up its game to compete with its primary competition, which is Windows. To do this, it needs to look at the reasons it was successful in the first place and analyse its weaknesses,” he reasons.Its principal strength is the speed and power of its innovation model, the consequence of simultaneous progress by thousands of software developers across the globe. “People use Linux because it provides a rapid innovation model. It provides an incredible time-to-market advantage.“The Linux kernel releases every three months with new functionality. There are 2,000 lines of code added to the kernel every day; 2,900 lines of code are changed every day. There are more than 2,900 core contributors to the Linux kernel. The world has never seen such a sophisticated, broadly spread, rapid development model.”He points out that “distributions” of Linux – the Linux kernel together with complementary software to create complete operating systems and which are packaged by commercial companies – are released every six months compared with the seven years it took Microsoft to release Vista, the latest version of Windows.Linux’s principal weakness is the fact that, unlike Microsoft Windows, where the symbol on the box is a guarantee that the bits will work together, Linux is not an easy platform for application developers. “This does not really exist in Linux outside some specific distributions such as Red Hat and Novell. To get the whole platform to compete effectively,” Mr Zemlin says, “we ne ed to take a federated approach to that kind of interoperability.”The approach being taken by the Linux Foundation is to create a standard, the Linux Standard Base, that will allow the companies who create Linux distributions to have a specific set of components that make up what is thought of as Linux. If that is consistent from one version of the operating system to the next, it will provide that reliable development platform.Individual developers would compete on the quality of innovation they add to the standard. “Where files are stored is not a differentiator; a new security module is. Competing on these higher levels of technology is what is going to thrust Linux ahead.”Mr Zemlin points out that what motivates open source developers is not just the freedom to do more or less what they want but the desire to win. “These guys have devoted their lives to writing this software. For them, it’s a 24-hour-a day job. I get e-mails at 3am from guys who have some new thing they want to talk about for Linux.”Before joining the Free Standards Group and the Linux Foundation, Mr Zemlin was a member of the founding management team of Corio, an enterprise application service provider, and vice-president of marketing for Covalent Technologies, which developed products and services for the Apache web server.Educated at the University of Minnesota, Mr Zemlin read political science and Japanese: a long way from information technology, some might think, but his grandfather was a co-founder of the Cray supercomputer company and his father worked for Control Data Corporation, so supercomputing is in his veins. And significantly enough, three quarters of the world’s top 500 supercomputers use Linux.So what should the IT director be thinking about Linux? “What you are going to see from the Linux platform is better hardware utilisation, better price performance, better security. These are all things any IT organisation should be considering.“You will also get choice, because Linux is not locked in to any single vendor like Microsoft. This is a great advantage to an IT organisation that wants to drive down cost and purchase competitive components.“New technologies from Linux will include power management. Power is becoming a dominant cost in the data centre. One development is the ‘tickless kernel’ which cycles down the processor when it is not in use. This was an idea that was accepted and now is being rolled out to everyone,” Mr Zemlin says.And has the Foundation a secure future? Mr Zemlin smiles: “We are extremely well funded. We have a diversity of stakeholders. The platform itself represents a multibillion dollar marketplace in hardware and services related to Linux. It would be hard to imagine Linux disappearing any time in the near future – or the Foundation for that matter.”"

838;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;SAP shakes up leadership at US unit;;The chief executive of TomorrowNow, a US unit of SAP at the centre of a corporate spying scandal that has ensnared the German software group in a high profile lawsuit, quit on Monday, the company said.SAP also revealed it is looking at various options for the troubled unit, including selling it. The news late on Monday night marks the latest step in an unfolding saga that has represented an unwelcome setback for SAP in its most important market.The scandal broke when arch-rival Oracle filed a lawsuit earlier this year accusing SAP of corporate espionage. It levelled the claims against TomorrowNow, a Texas-based company that had been acquired by SAP to sell software maintenance and support to former Oracle customers. That gave it a key role in SAP’s strategy of trying to win over Oracle customers, since the need for continuing support for older software is one of the main reasons companies are hesitant to switch between suppliers.According to Oracle, TomorrowNow had used the sign-on details of several Oracle customers to access that company’s computers and allegedly remove information about its products.The German company admitted in July that TomorrowNow had made “inappropriate downloads” from Oracle’s machines, though it also said that the information had been kept inside the subsidiary and that none of it had been viewed by executives in other parts of SAP.SAP said on Monday that Andrew Nelson, chief executive of TomorrowNow, and “several members of his senior management team” had “chosen to resign”. It did not give details about the extent of the departures, or whether SAP had asked for the resignations.When the scandal first broke, SAP sent one of its own executives, Mark White, to oversee the subsidiary as executive chairman. On Monday, it said that Mr White was working to “assure retention of key managers and support personnel” and make sure customer support was not interrupted.The signs of upheaval at TomorrowNow appear to represent a victory for Oracle in what has turned into one of the most heated confrontations in the corporate technology market. The US and German software companies have been on a collision course over the past four years, since Oracle embarked on a series of acquisitions to challenge SAP in its core application software market. While confined to an arcane part of the corporate IT market, the bitterness of the rivalry has guaranteed it a prominent place in business press headlines, culminating in the barbs thrown over the corporate espionage suit.“Our primary focus is TomorrowNow’s existing customers, who will be supported through this management transition,” Mr White was quoted as saying. “SAP is prepared to manage through these changes to ensure that TomorrowNow’s obligations to its current customers are met.”
839;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;BEA profits hit by stock option revision;;"BEA Systems, the software company that has been stalked by Oracle, on Thursday restated nine years of accounts to reflect $424m of understated employee option charges, almost wiping out its reported profits for the entire period.At the same time, however, the embattled software company reported a rebound in its profit margins in the latest quarter, potentially strengthening its hand as it tries to make its case for resisting Oracle’s recent $7.1bn bid.The profit numbers were the first BEA has reported since the middle of last
year as it has been embroiled in an internal investigation into stock option backdating.Like many other technology companies, the software maker said it had not treated options issued to employees at below market value as an expense.Had it done so, the extra non-cash charges would have reduced earnings in the years between 1997-2006 to $32m, it disclosed.However, Alfred Chuang, chief executive officer, said that BEA’s latest figures pointed to a “significant improvement in profitability” that justified the rejection last month of Oracle’s $17-a-share bid.BEA’s board said at the time that it would not consider a bid below $21 a share.For the latest quarter, BEA reported that its operating profit margin had risen to 17 per cent from 11 per cent a year before, reflecting tight cost control as revenues advanced 11 per cent to $384m.BEA also issued an optimistic forecast for earnings in the current quarter.At the mid-point of its target range, the company’s profit margin on a pro forma basis would be 27-28 per cent ahead of Wall Street forecasts, Mr Chuang said.While representing a strong recovery after a slump in BEA’s performance earlier in the year, the latest figures did not point to an across-the-board recovery.Sales of new software licences – a key indicator of a software company’s health – dropped by 1 per cent from a year before, to $134m.While an improvement from the 9 and 13 per cent declines of the preceding two quarters, it showed that sales of BEA’s fast-growing AquaLogic line of software had yet to make up for its declining WebLogic brand.BEA put its improved profit performance down to control of general overhead costs and lower expenses related to sales.Also, economies of scale had worked to its advantage as more of its revenues had fallen to the bottom line given the heavily fixed-cost nature of its business, executives said.BEA’s claim that the figures supported its argument for at least $21 a share in a takeover came a day after Oracle had hinted that it was no longer even prepared to pay the $17 it had originally offered.Speaking to financial analysts, Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive, indicated that falling technology stock prices on Wall Street had reduced the value of the company."
840;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-11-16T00:05:18Z;BEA puts a gloss on the numbers;;"It seems that BEA Systems can juggle numbers just as much as Oracle can (see note below.)Announcing earnings on Thursday, CEO Alfred Chuang wanted Wall Street to overlook his gigantic stock option backdating charge (which virtually wiped out reported profits for the past decade) and focus instead on the software company’s rebounding profit margins. And not just any profit margins but pro forma figures which, among other things, excluded the costs of hiring all those lawyers and bankers to keep the barbarians (in the form of Larry Ellison and Carl Icahn) from the gates.Shouldn’t expenses like these be seen as a normal cost of doing business, one analyst wondered?It isn’t normal to come under fire from a hostile bidder and a shareholder activist at the same time, retorted BEA executive Bill Klein. ""We don’t believe that both of these circumstances can continue for the long run."" Is that reasoned analysis or wishful thinking?"
841;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;The consolidator’s curse;;"Growing a company through acquisitions can feel a bit liking eating Chinese food. Two hours after you’ve had a meal you’re hungry again.Larry Ellison must be starting to feel that way. When he bought PeopleSoft, he promised it would put Oracle on course for earnings per share growth of at least 20 per cent a year. He’s more than met that promise (that is, if you care to overlook the little matter of amortisation – more on that below.)The trouble with strategies like this is, they only work if you keep buying. Prices have been going up and suitable big targets are getting scarcer – which explains why this has now become a preoccupation on Wall Street, to judge by the questions Ellison faced at his company’s annual financial analyst meeting on Wednesday.Ellison’s message to the doubters: ""We have found some very attractive targets, and we think we can do it for a while longer."" Compared to the horizontal software plays he has bought so far, the next spate of deals might involve more ""vertical"" companies that specialise in specific industry sectors. ""We can buy a typical vertical company that’s running at 5 per cent [operating margins] and run it at 30 or 40 per cent,"" Ellison boasted.The trouble is, the bigger Oracle gets, the hungrier it becomes. According to Charles Di Bona at Sanford C Bernstein, Oracle will have to spend $52-58bn on acquisitions over the next five years to keep its earnings per share machine ticking over at the desired rate. So either the deals have to get bigger – in which case the risk of overpaying and the complexity of integration go up – or Oracle has to spread its net wide and trawl for large numbers of smaller transactions.There’s no question that Ellison’s consolidation play has been a huge success. The outcome of his current circling of the beleagured BEA Systems should give some idea of how long he can keep it up.Footnote: What is the right measure of earnings for a serial acquirer like this, anyway? Oracle likes to boast about its pro-forma earnings per share. But as the deals have flowed, the amortisation of intangibles has picked up: 12 per cent of operating profits in the 2006 fiscal year, rising to 15 per cent in 2007.Look at it another way. Back in 2004, Oracle’s earnings per share looked roughly the same on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. In the three years since, the pro-forma number has jumped by 98 per cent: the GAAP number is only up 62 per cent. Like too much Chinese food, all those deals start to show on the waistline in the end."
842;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-11-15T02:13:39Z;Ellison warns BEA on possible future bid;;Any future Oracle takeover bid for BEA Systems will be for less than the $7bn it offered last month, Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive officer, warned on Wednesday night.The blunt threat, issued at Oracle’s annual financial analyst meeting in San Francisco, marked a characteristically sharp public response in what is shaping up to become the latest in a string of drawn-out takeover sagas mounted by Mr Ellison.It echoed his unusual tactic of lowering Oracle’s bid at one point during its heated bid for rival PeopleSoft, although Oracle eventually paid a considerably higher price to win over the company’s board.“If we made another offer [for BEA], the price would be lower,” Mr Ellison said at Oracle’s annual analyst meeting on Wednesday. Pointing to the recent retreat in technology stocks, he added: “Clearly the $17 price seems too high now.”While Oracle’s own shares were hit hard last week in a broader downturn in tech stocks, BEA’s shares have remained largely unchanged as investors have anticipated a renewed bid from Oracle.BEA has rejected Mr Ellison’s unsolicited approach on the grounds that it undervalued the company, though it has said it is open to an offer at an appropriate price.While he did not reveal whether Oracle would renew its approach to BEA, the Oracle CEO said: “It looks like noone [else] is going to buy BEA. We were the only buyer then.”BEA, which has also been caught in an options backdating investigation, said that it would file its overdue accounts on Thursday. It has claimed in recent weeks that the additional financial information in those accounts would help to support its argument that Oracle’s $17 offer undervalued the company.While suggesting that he would only offer a lower price in future, Mr Ellison also said that a deal at the original price would be very beneficial to Oracle shareholders. “At $17 a share, it was a highly accretive transaction,” he said.The comments about BEA came as Mr Ellison faced a spate of questions from financial analysts about whether Oracle would be able to continue its recent record of rapid acquisition-fuelled growth.“We think we have found some very attractive targets, and we think we can do it for a while longer,” Mr Ellison said.
843;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-11-13T22:06:53Z;Wall St rallies as confidence returns;;US stocks enjoyed their best day in almost two months after Wal-Mart’s latest quarterly earnings helped restore a measure of confidence in the health of the US consumer.Financial stocks surged even as Bank of America became the latest group to disclose big writedowns.Investors were cheered after the chief executive of Goldman Sachs said the bank did not expect to make any significant writedowns.Meanwhile, technology stocks rebounded, with Apple leading the charge, bringing an end to a four-day losing streak for the sector.Stocks extended gains after the National Association of Realtors said pending home sales rose last month, the first increase since June.The S&P 500 index closed 2.9 per cent higher at 1,481.01 its biggest advance since mid-September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose back above 13,000, gaining 2.5 per cent to 13,307.09 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.5 per cent to 2,673.65.Wal-Mart saw a higher-than-expected 8 per cent rise in third-quarter profits and raised its full-year earnings forecast. Its shares climbed 6.1 per cent to $45.97, their biggest one-day gain in five years.Adrianne Shapira, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the retailer was “an excellent place to hide in the current choppy macro environment”.Home Depot underscored lingering concerns about the US retail sector after its quarterly profit fell 26.8 per cent. The home improvement chain has been hurt by the deteriorating US housing market. The results matched Wall Street’s forecasts and the shares gained 2.3 per cent at $29.12.The S&P retail index rose 3.8 per cent at 435.64. Macy’s gained 6.6 per cent at $30.65, Nordstrom rose 4.5 per cent at $34.50 and Office Depot jumped 5.4 per cent at $19.84.The better tone in stocks triggered a 23 per cent slide in equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index. The Vix closed above 31 on Monday, its highest level since March 2003, but fell to 24 on Tuesday.“Markets are likely to remain volatile during the coming week as risk aversion predominates,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “But the equity correction has already run a long way, and there could be signs of relief to come.”Financials enjoyed bumper gains after Goldman Sachs‘ chief executive said he does not expect the bank to take any significant asset write-downs. Speaking about the firm’s difficult-to-value level three assets Lloyd Blankfein said: “We’re confident we have a grip on the valuation of these things.” The shares soared 8.5 per cent to $233.04, their biggest one-day advance in six years.But Joe Price, Bank of America‘s chief financial officer, addressing the same conference, said his company expected to record $3bn in writedowns related to its exposure to collateralised debt obligations. But its shares still rose 5.2 per cent at $46.27 after the bank said it was sitting on a potential gain of more than $30bn on its investment in China Construction Bank.E-Trade Financial jumped 40.8 per cent at $5 after BMO Capital Markets said the online brokerage was “highly unlikely” to go bankrupt. The shares plunged 59 per cent the previous day after an analyst raised the possibility of a run on E-Trade’s bank.Other banks and brokerages surged. Lehman Brothers rose 9.2 per cent at $63.49 after an analyst at UBS said potential losses from CDOs were “negligible”. Citigroup rose 6.9 per cent at $35.90 while JPMorgan added 6.3 per cent to $45.05.The S&P investment bank index rose 6.8 per cent at 190.68 while the financial index rose 4.9 per cent at 426.93. Also on the rebound were technology stocks, a sector that has borne the brunt of recent selling pressure on concerns about a slowdown in corporate tech spending.Apple rallied 10.5 per cent at $169.96 on reports it was in talks about launching its iPhone in China. Oracle gained 5.6 per cent at $20.52 while Research In Motion rose 9.7 per cent at $112.55.But Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research said there remained an “underlying inconsistency between being pessimistic on US consumer trends and optimistic on technology spending activity”.
844;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-11-12T20:00:13Z;IBM in $5bn cash deal for Cognos;;IBM unveiled its biggest acquisition on Monday with the $5bn cash purchase of software maker Cognos.The deal marks Big Blue’s response to the rapid consolidation of the business intelligence software market, which was triggered by Oracle’s recent purchase of Hyperion and SAP’s agreement to buy Business Objects.It also accelerates the company’s acquisition-fuelled drive to boost the size of its software business, which already accounts for 20 per cent of revenues and 40 per cent of gross profits.Although IBM pulled off 11 software deals last year, and its software strategy was given a big lift more than a decade ago by the $3.5bn purchase of Lotus, it has typically looked at deals worth $1bn or less.Business intelligence software, which draws data from a range of corporate systems to give business managers a view across their operations, has long been seen as a strategically important part of the software market.Analysts said the purchase of the three biggest business intelligence companies for a total of $15bn largely completes a wave of consolidation in the corporate software market. The deal frenzy has encompassed some of the biggest categories of business software, from application software makers such as PeopleSoft to middleware companies such as BEA Systems, which has been the subject of an unsolicited approach from Oracle.Business intelligence “was the last of the biggies”, said Lee Geishecker, an analyst at AMR Research. Future acquisition activity is likely to focus on companies with specific industry expertise or geographic presence, she added.Steve Mills, head of IBM’s software business, denied that the acquisition of Canada’s Cognos had been prompted by other deals in the sector.“If IBM was going to invest in this space, Cognos was the logical offering,” said Ms Geishecker. Acquisitions by its rivals might have forced IBM’s hand in terms of timing, she added, since Cognos’ position as the only big independent company left might have attracted other potential acquirers such as Hewlett-Packard.Owning Cognos would help IBM sell more of its other “middleware”, including its Websphere and DB2 database products, said Steve Mills, head of IBM’s software business.Mr Mills claimed that the architectural similarity between Cognos’ software and that of IBM would make it possible to pull off a rapid integration of the two companies’ products. He contrasted that with Oracle, which faced a fundamental rewrite of much of its code to assimilate a number of acquisitions, and SAP.At $58 a share, the deal represents a premium of nearly 10 per cent to Cognos’ share price at the end of last week. Cognos is Canada’s largest software company, with 4,000 employees.
845;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-11-09T23:26:14Z;Confidence in US tech sector melts away;;US stocks fell sharply this week as credit market losses at financial companies and fears of a decline in corporate spending on technology unsettled US equity markets.Confidence in the tech sector’s ability to rise above mortgage-related problems evaporated amid worries about falling technology budgets at big banks. An index of large-cap technology stocks posted its worst weekly performance in more than five years.Credit market jitters flared after big writedowns and rising loan-loss provisions at financial companies. The automotive sector suffered after General Motors posted the second largest quarterly loss in US corporate history.The S&P 500 closed down 1.7 per cent Friday at 1,453.70, its lowest in two months and 3 per cent lower for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.4 per cent on the week at 13,042.74 points.Both indices fell below their 200-day moving averages this week, commonly viewed as a bearish indicator, and have erased all their gains since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in mid-September.“For all the rampant bullish talk from ‘containment’ to ‘resilience’ to ‘decoupling’, 75 basis points of Fed easing have done absolutely nothing for the stock market,” said David Rosenberg, chief US economist at Merrill Lynch.Consumer staples and utilities fared best as investors sought safety in recession-resistant stocks. The CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer – spiked 23.7 per cent to 28.48 on the week, a level last reached at the height of the summer credit squeeze.The most significant losses were in the tech sector. The Nasdaq Composite was 5.8 per cent lower on the week at 2,627.94. Large-cap tech stocks, previously considered safe havens by investors, fell even more. The Nasdaq 100 shed 6.8 per cent to 2,034.30, its worst weekly sell-off since April 2002.“The breadth of this year’s rally in tech has been narrow, only 25 per cent of tech companies have outperformed the index,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment strategist at Harris Private Bank. “If the economy really slows down and inflation picks up, this is a group of sitting ducks.”The slide in tech stocks was sparked by Cisco Systems, whose chief executive said “dramatic year-on-year decreases in orders” from big banks could slow growth. Its stock fell 12.1 per cent at $28.58 on the week.Investors view Cisco as a bellwether for the technology sector and the comments sparked a big sell-off.Cognizant Technology Solutions shed 24.7 per cent at $32.75 after its fourth-quarter revenue guidance missed expectations. Oracle fell 12.1 per cent at $19.36, Apple was down 12 per cent at $165.37 and Google fell below $700, down 6.6 per cent at $663.97.Financials had another highly volatile week. Morgan Stanley, down 8 per cent at $54.20, declared a $3.7bn loss on subprime mortgage-linked securities.Wachovia lost 5.1 per cent on the week at $40.65. It said its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations – securities linked to the troubled mortgage market – had lost $1.1bn in value during October. American International Group’s quarterly earnings declined 27 per cent and the shares fell 3.6 per cent on the week at $57.02.Washington Mutual fell 13.9 per cent at $20.51 after it increased its credit loss provision to $1.3bn this quarter and forecast mortgage lending would plunge next year. Citigroup declined 11.7 per cent to $33.10 on the week. Its shares had fallen for eight days before a modest rally Friday.Capital One Financial, the biggest US credit card issuer, fell 11.3 per cent to $54.26 after it said writedowns on bad credit card debt could reach the “mid-$5bn” range. American Express fell 3.3 per cent at $56.49.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – the government-chartered companies that own or guarantee about 40 per cent of US mortgages – declined 6.9 per cent to $49 and 13.7 per cent to $41.70, respectively. Both companies were subpoenaed by the New York attorney-general, who has widened his inquiry into the US mortgage industry.General Motors and Ford Motor shed 15.5 per cent at $31.28 and 8.4 per cent at $8.20 respectively on the week. GM reported a $39bn loss after taking a non-cash charge against future tax benefits.Retailers dipped after disappointing October sales data. Wal-Mart declined 2.9 per cent on the week at $42.90. The S&P retail index fell 6.3 per cent at 415.50. The luxury sector was hit hard. Nordstrom, the upmarket store, fell 11.3 per cent to $32.38 and jeweller Tiffany & Co fell 11.6 per cent at $43.92.
846;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-11-08T23:55:20Z;Tech sell-off;;A technical correction? Until Thursday, the technology sector had outperformed the S&P 500 by some 16 percentage points in 2007. Then a few choice comments from John Chambers, head of Cisco Systems, and Ben Bernanke were enough to cause panic. It was a nervous day in general, but tech stocks dropped more than 5 per cent at one point.Big names led the drop. Cisco, which kicked things off with its chief executive’s comments about slowing demand for network equipment by banks and auto companies, fell 9.5 per cent. Oracle, the enterprise software group, was not far behind. Apple and Google, more focused on consumer businesses, also took a beating.Tech’s run-up this year arguably made it ripe for a fall at the first whiff of trouble – before Thursday the sector commanded a 44 per cent premium to the market on a 2007 earnings multiple. Mr Chambers is known for his optimism, so his gloomy words on Wednesdaywere unsettling. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve chief repeated his wider warning about weak economic growth.The big unknown remains how far the subprime and housing woes will spread. Banks, conserving cash to the point where it distorts overnight money markets, are unlikely to be big IT spenders for a while. Neither are Detroit’s struggling carmakers. But Mr Bernanke’s words served to highlight the possibility that the trouble may not end there.Some investors appeared to have begun regarding tech as a safe haven relative to battered financials. IT is the third largest sector in the S&P 500 in terms of earnings. Since October 1 it is the only one where analysts have upped earnings growth estimates for the four quarters beginning July 2007, according to Thomson Research. Without doubt the latest sell-off involved some indiscriminate dumping. But investors arguably needed reminding of IT’s propensity to crash.
847;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
848;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Slowdown fears hit tech stocks;;Fears that a cyclical slowdown may be starting to eat into corporate spending on technology sent a shiver through Wall Street on Thursday, denting a sector that had been largely immune to the jitters in the US stock market.The tech sell-off was triggered by uncharacteristically cautious comments late on Wednesday from John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, as the networking equipment company reported its latest results. It also reflected the volatility that has crept into high-flying stocks such as Google and Apple after recent big gains.Among the hardest hit were software maker Oracle and storage company EMC, each of which dropped by more than 7 per cent on concerns about slowing growth in spending by “enterprise,” or large corporate, customers. Cisco shed nearly 10 per cent of its value, or $19bn.“The US enterprise, probably as a surprise to no one, is experiencing some softness,” Mr Chambers said, pointing in particular to “dramatic decreases” in orders from the banking industry amid the credit crisis.Thursday’s chill on Wall Street comes amidst the tech industry’s strongest period of growth in several years. Sales of US tech companies rose by 9 per cent in the third quarter, even after excluding the benefits of the weaker US dollar, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein. Inventory levels remained low at the end of September, suggesting that demand continued to be strong.However, according to a survey by Citigroup released last week, the mood among chief information officers in the US and Europe has started to turn more cautious, with most predicting that IT budgets will grow by only 1-2 per cent next year.While not pointing to an outright fall in tech spending, the troubles in the US banking, automobile and housing industries in particular could take the shine off a strong period for the industry, according to Andy Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research. US companies had been expected to increase their spending on hardware and software by 8 per cent next year, after increases of around 5 per cent in each of 2006 and 2007, but that rosy picture now looks in doubt, he added.High-flying consumer tech stocks also dropped heavily on Thursday as the reverberations from the corporate IT market spread. Google fell back by 5.3 per cent, leaving the shares below $700, while Apple dropped by 5.8 per cent, though both are still up strongly this year.
849;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-11-08T22:05:46Z;Wall St falls as credit crisis widens;;Technology shares suffered sharp falls on Thursday after Cisco Systems raised fears that subprime losses could cause big banks to cut back on technology spending.Renewed concerns that credit market problems could spread into the broader economy hit a broad range of tech stocks.“If there is a concerted slowdown in financial services you are going to have a big problem,” Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman, said.The Nasdaq Composite fell as much as 3.7 per cent but recovered some of these losses late in the session.Other major indices rebounded strongly late on as short sellers covered their positions. Financial stocks closed mostly higher, having traded sharply lower for most of the session.Retailers also showed weakness after some disappointing sales data. But materials stocks rose after BHP Billiton’s takeover approach for Rio Tinto provided a boost to the sector.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1474.74 having fallen as much as 1.7 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent lower at 13266.29.Technology indices experienced by far the biggest falls. The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.9 per cent lower at 2,696 and has now declined more than 5 per cent this month.Volatility, as measured by the CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s fear barometer – remained above 26, a level of unease last seen before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in mid-September.Despite a late rally the S&P 500 remained below its 200-day moving average for a second day. “If it stays below for 10 days then you’re in trouble – you’ve got a bear market,” said Brian Gendreau, investment strategist at ING Investment Management.The slide in the technology sector was a particularly bearish signal for investors who have lately become accustomed to outperformance by tech stocks.The falls were precipitated by Cisco Systems, which fell 9.5 per cent to $29.63 on fears about its growth prospects.John Chambers, chief executive, said the company had suffered a “dramatic” decline in orders from US financial and automotive companies. Although its current quarter forecast was in line with expectations, bullish investors had hoped for more.The comments were a blow to confidence in large-cap tech stocks, which suffered sharp sell-offs.Oracle shed 7.9 per cent to $20.35, IBM fell 4.5 per cent at $106.11, Google fell 5.3 per cent to $693.84 while Apple lost 5.8 per cent at $175.46.“I think it [the tech market] got ahead of itself. Could there be a 10 per cent correction by the end of the year? Yes, there could be,” Mr Parower said.Investors were also focused on Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, who gave testimony before Congress on Thursday. He cautioned that economic growth would “slow noticeably” in the fourth quarter and the weak dollar and the higher price of energy would increase headline inflation in the short term.Retailers were in the spotlight after they reported some weak same-store sales for October. Wal-Mart sales increased by just 0.4 per cent, below the 1.1 per cent rise expected by analysts. The stock was down 0.7 per cent $43.62. “So far, the majority of retailers have missed expectations,” said Thomson Financial.Shares in Sotheby’s fell 28.4 per cent to $35.84 as two analysts downgraded the stock after a major art sale failed to reach its estimate.But Ford’s third quarter earnings gave the automotive sector reason to cheer after a $39bn loss at General Motors punctured sentiment the previous day. Ford narrowed its third-quarter loss to $380m, a big improvement on its $5.2bn loss a year earlier. The shares rose 2.9 per cent at $8.48.Investors in the financial sector were focused on Morgan Stanley, which declared a $3.7bn loss on subprime mortgage-linked investments, resulting in an expected $2.5bn hit to net income. The investment bank’s shares rallied 4.9 per cent at $53.68 as the losses were less than many had predicted.Although the S&P financial index closed higher, AIG fell again, down 3.3 per cent at $56, after profit declined 27 per cent, more than expected. Citigroup, which has now fallen for eight consecutive days, was down 1.5 per cent at $32.90.

851;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-31T15:26:55Z;Icahn criticises BEA over Oracle bid;;Activist investor Carl Icahn turned up the heat on BEA Systems on Friday, pressing the embattled software company to let shareholders decide on a $6.7bn bid from Oracle if no better offers emerge.His call came after BEA had declared that it was quite prepared to let Oracle walk away rather than start negotiations at the price that is currently on the table.Mr Icahn’s intervention late on Friday came as the two software companies prepared for a weekend of brinkmanship over the unsolicited bid. Oracle has promised to abandon its offer, of $17 a share in cash, by Sunday afternoon if BEA does not either accept the terms or agree to let its shareholders vote on the proposal.For its part, BEA on Friday released a terse letter that repeated its view that the price “significantly undervalues” the company, and that it therefore assumed the offer would expire this weekend. The biggest independent maker of the “middleware” used to build internet-based applications, BEA has held out of a price of $21 before it will enter negotiations.Rather than risk losing the premium represented by the Oracle bid, BEA should launch a full auction of the company, Mr Icahn said.“If a topping bid emerges, then all the better,” he said. “But if no topping bid arises it should be up to the BEA shareholders to decide whether to take the Oracle bid or remain as an independent company.”One person familiar with the matter said BEA had held discussions with other technology companies since Oracle went public with its offer earlier this month. However, the nature of those discussions, or whether another bidder might emerge, was unclear.Few rival bidders would be able to match the sort of cost savings from a deal that Oracle could achieve, according to analysts. One of the few that could, IBM, is BEA’s biggest rival, making it likely that any offer would attract anti-trust attention. The scale of the potential savings have led some analysts to suggest that Oracle could pay over $20 a share for BEA and still generate short-term financial benefits for its shareholders.
852;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-29T20:25:39Z;Oracle stalks BEA;;BEA Systems is facing the big squeeze. On one side, activist investor Carl Icahn owns 13 per cent and is pushing for a sale. Given that he bought into the software company at around $13 a share only a few months ago, even Oracle’s opening shot of $17 looks attractive.On the other side, Larry Ellison’s Oracle could be embarking on a bear hug. It has now let its original bid lapse, in the face of BEA opposition. But it has not gone away. First, BEA’s middleware has long made sense as a way to bolster Oracle’s product set. Second, Oracle has demonstrated it can bid aggressively for software companies, such as PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems, and generate big cost savings while hanging on to their customers. BEA would be a continuation of that strategy.Meanwhile, BEA faces the same challenge as PeopleSoft. If Oracle’s approach turns into a long bear hug, there is a risk that BEA customers will simply wait to sign new licence deals until the ownership question is cleared up. That could harm BEA’s results, softening it up for Mr Ellison. And BEA has the extra problem that, because of the options backdating scandal it is delinquent on its filings and hence unable to release financial information that could show the business is really worth more.In the absence of clear rival bidders, and with its hands tied behind its back on releasing financial statements, BEA’s board has limited options to force Oracle higher. But it is right to try. Mr Ellison has shown in the past how much he is willing to go above his opening bids, while still making them a success. BEA’s claim that it will only talk at $21 makes it a hostage to fortune. But at least it might buy it some time to be able to tell the world how the business is really performing.
853;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-24T02:48:09Z;Oracle issues BEA deal ultimatum;;Oracle on Tuesday threatened to walk away from its proposed acquisition of BEA Systems by Sunday unless the embattled software company agreed to a deal.While the threat wiped nearly 4 per cent from BEA’s share price by mid-afternoon, the stock still stood above the $17-a-share Oracle offer, pointing to a belief on Wall Street that the brinkmanship had not seriously damped the prospect of a deal and that Oracle or another buyer would still end up paying a higher price.“Oracle has no interest in a long, drawn-out process to acquire BEA,” Chuck Phillips, Oracle’s president, wrote in a letter addressed to the company’s board on Tuesday. The letter followed what Oracle said had been another rejection by the BEA board of its all-cash offer.BEA rejected the latest approach, repeating its earlier claim that the offer “seriously undervalues” the company and adding that it was open to “a transaction that appropriately reflects BEA’s value, reached through a reasonable process.”The attempt to bring a quick end to the BEA battle is in stark contrast to the fight over PeopleSoft, the deal that launched Oracle’s ambitious attempt to force consolidation in parts of the business software market. That fight lasted 18 months, in part because Oracle had to persuade a court to overturn a US antitrust objection to the deal.Though he started by offering $16 a share for PeopleSoft and insisting at one point that that was his “final” price, Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive officer, eventually paid $26.50 a share to win over the PeopleSoft board.Justifying the offer for BEA, Mr Phillips said it represented a 21 per cent premium to the price the day before the proposal was announced and a 44 per cent premium to the level before activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed in August that he had bought a stake in the company.Mr Icahn, BEA’s biggest shareholder and a critic of the company’s management, has been pressuring BEA to find another buyer.

Its revenues grew from £119,235 in 2002 to £18.3m in 2006.ByBox has about 1,200 secure lockers around the UK and works mainly to deliver items for big companies such as Siemens, Coca-Cola, Fujitsu and the RAC – usually urgently needed spare parts.Automated alerts can be sent to customers via e-mail and text when a delivery has been made. The company is expanding its network into France and is considering offering its services to the general consumer market.Other companies heading the list included Rocela, which helps companies manage software licences; Virtual IT, which provides IT support for smaller businesses; Think, an internet marketing company; and Miniclip, an online games portal.Simon Kerton-Johnson, a partner in Deloitte’s technology, media and telecommunications practice, said this year’s list was notable for the broad range of technology businesses included.“Last year the winner was a telecoms company that aggregated content for mobile phones, and in the past three or four years the market has been driven by this sector.“This year companies are succeeding in all categories, from ID theft to security and search optimisation,” he said.“It shows the healthy state of the technology market,” he added.“The companies in the list tend to be the leading edge of what is to come. They tend to make it into the Fast 50 when the idea they have been working on starts to catch the mass market mood,” Mr Kerton-Johnson said.Software was the biggest sector represented, with 10 software businesses making the list. Telecoms was the next largest sector, with five companies.However, more than half of the companies were classified as “other” with business models ranging from ByBox’s secure mailboxes to video games.Many of the companies in the Fast 50 are expected to be acquired by larger businesses.“Realistically, a number of them are quite explicitly looking for an exit route,” Mr Kerton-Johnson said.However, 14 of those in last year’s list have made the 2007 rankings again, showing that many have staying power as independent businesses. Last year’s winner, MX Telecom, for example, is ranked 20th in this year’s list.Four of the Fast 50 in profileRocela

855;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-16T21:46:52Z;Executive departure may delay Oracle plan;;Oracle’s ambitious plan to unify the software applications it assumed through acquisitions appeared on Tuesday to be heading for a delay, following news that the executive in charge of the project is to leave the company.John Wookey’s elevation two years ago to run Project Fusion put him in one of the most high-profile positions in the company following its purchases of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and other smaller companies.By unifying these companies’ software applications on a single-code base, Fusion is intended to create integration between the various products, making it a central part of Oracle’s long-term strategy to compete with SAP.Oracle refused to comment on Mr Wookey’s position. Yet one person close to the company said he would leave early next year, after a transitional period. The job of overseeing the Fusion work has been passed to Thomas Kurian, who will combine it with responsibility for Oracle’s middleware, the software layer on which the applications depend.The shake-up has also led to greater responsibilities for Charles Rozwat, executive vice-president of server technologies.The upheaval has prompted speculation that Fusion has fallen behind schedule. Large parts of the software seem likely to appear next year as planned, according to the person close to Oracle, though this person stopped short of saying the entire project would be completed next year.
856;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-14T21:03:04Z;SAP allays fears of Oracle bid war;;SAP has sought to allay investor fears about a new bidding rivalry between the German business software maker and US rival Oracle by pledging big acquisitions only to enter new markets rather than to consolidate existing ones.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said the offers by SAP for software maker Business Objects and that of Oracle for BEA Systems – both valued at €4.8bn – showed the two groups were still on different paths.“We bought a company that complements our product line in a fast-growing market in which SAP is not market leader,” he told the Financial Times.“We believe in complementary deals. We’re not interested in a classic consolidating of markets.”Investors last week dumped SAP stock for fear the largest business software maker in the world had given up its goal of growing organically to ape Oracle, which has spent $31bn (€21.8bn) on rivals in recent years. The German group’s stock price lost 5 per cent after it announced by far its biggest acquisition to gain a leading position in the market for business analysis programmes, an “end-user” area in which SAP is weak.But investor fears of a bidding war with Oracle ebbed on Friday when the US group announced an unsolicited bid for BEA Systems, a move to consolidate its position among makers of software to bundle disparate applications. Mr Kagermann said SAP was well positioned in the market for so-called service oriented architecture.He was not considering a counter offer for BEA, or a bid for any other company in a market that had “so much overlap” with SAP.He said this was consistent with SAP’s strategy of growing organically in its two core units that provide the software spine or “platform” for corporations, and address the needs of small and medium-sized companies.But he repeated adverse investor reaction would not stop SAP from committing to more deals in the end-user market. “We’re categorically not excluding further big acquisitions,” he said.Business Objects specialises in programmes that sift corporate data to help executives decide strategy. Mr Kagermann noted “that many analysts believe that there are still interesting opportunities in this sector”.
857;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-12T22:38:21Z;Oracle launches $6.7bn bid for BEA;;Oracle, the US business software company, on Friday made an unsolicited $6.7bn (£3.3bn) bid for BEA Systems, a San Jose-based software maker that has come under pressure from Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor.The deal comes as Oracle is trying to overtake rivals SAP and IBM by pursuing an aggressive acquisitions strategy.BEA rebuffed the offer, arguing that it “significantly undervalues” the company.Shares in BEA rose above Oracle’s offer price of $17 a share, indicating investor hopes of an increased bid. On Friday, shares in BEA closed more than 38 per cent higher at $18.82.Oracle’s $17-a-share offer represented a 25 per cent premium to BEA’s share price at the close of business on Thursday.“We have made a serious proposal including a substantial premium for BEA,” said Charles Phillips, Oracle president. “We believe our all-cash offer provides the best value for BEA’s shareholders and the best home for BEA’s employees and customers.”If successful, the deal would represent Oracle’s biggest takeover since its $10.3bn acquisition of PeopleSoft three years ago.It would also mark the latest in a string of deals in the software sector this year. SAP earlier this week announced plans to buy Business Objects, the Franco-US software company, for $6.7bn.Shares in Oracle edged 2 cents lower to $22.44 on Friday in New York.Mr Icahn last month sparked a fresh wave of takeover speculation when he reported that he held more than 8 per cent of BEA shares and called for the company to be sold.The corporate raider has since increased his stake in the company to 13 per cent. Mr Icahn did not return a request for comment.Shares in BEA, which makes middleware, or software that connects business functions such as billing and supply chain management to back-office databases, fell more than 30 per cent between October and March. They began to rise again in August after the company reported its second-quarter results.BEA has been the subject of takeover speculation since the beginning of the technology downturn in 2001.The company was an early leader in the middleware market but it has struggled to gain momentum in recent years amid strong competition from rivals such as Oracle and SAP, both of which have moved to bolster their middleware offerings.Charles di Bona, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the deal’s valuation was “financially unattractive” for Oracle at $17 a share. However, Brent Thill, an analyst at Citigroup, said a price of up to $20 a share could still make financial sense for Oracle, assuming big cost cuts at BEA. Mr di Bona said he did not expect a rival bidder to emerge.

There are not many banks in Commerzbank’s €20bn size bracket, which are large enough to be meaningful but small enough for a bigger bank to digest,” said Matthew Clark, German banking analyst at KBW.Commerzbank has a 45 per cent share of relationships in the German mid-cap market where a generational change in management in the coming decade could spark a wave of sales and listings, Mr Clark said adding that private and investment banks were eyeing the sector with interest.Over the week, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 1.0 per cent to 1600.99, with the telecommunications stocks posting strong gains.Spanish group Telefónica surged 11.4 per cent to €21.54, after it predicted annual sales growth of up to 8 per cent and promised faster dividend payments.Citigroup upgraded its recommendation from “hold” to “buy” and raised its target price from €19 to €26.50.“Telefónica continues to offer the combination of strong domestic cash generation and growth in Latin America.

861;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;SAP buys Business Objects;;SAP has changed its mind. The German software maker has spent the last few years talking up its organic growth strategy and has only occasionally indulged in small deals. This has been in marked contrast to the $20bn-plus spending spree of rival Oracle. Yet SAP has now joined the game, with a friendly €42 per share offer for Business Objects. SAP’s largest ever acquisition, which places an enterprise value of €4.2bn on the French group, prompted a 4 per cent fall in the share price.For a company that has been rebuilding investor trust after a profit warning in 2006, the abrupt change of direction will not help. While it makes sense to gear up, many investors had hoped that excess cash would be returned via a buy-back. And it did not help that, after SAP launched its bid on Sunday, Business Objects announced yesterday it had missed third quarter earnings estimates. The group has clearly been dressed up for a sale. Oracle’s purchase of Hyperion this year left only Canada’s Cognos and Business Objects as independent providers of the data-crunching software known as “business intelligence”. With SAP’s own product in this attractive niche comparatively weak, its hand has been forced.Still, Business Objects is the market leader, and the multiple paid of 30-35 times revised 2007 earnings is not that far from the 28 times that Oracle paid for Hyperion. Two fifths of Business Objects’ customers use SAP software, suggesting a decent opportunity for cross-selling, and the deal will improve SAP’s US presence. There should also be savings from shared marketing and from cutting overheads, even though the business will be run as a standalone unit. Provided that its core activities continue to grow, SAP can be forgiven for the reversal in strategy.
862;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-08T19:20:18Z;SAP signals hunger for deals;;Germany’s SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, Monday signalled it could look at further acquisitions even as its departure from an avowed strategy of organic growth sent investors running for cover.Outlining an agreed takeover offer worth €4.8bn ($6.7bn) for Franco-American software house Business Objects, SAP chief executive Henning Kagermann said SAP was on its “way to proving we can make larger acquisitions”.The company’s announcement late Sunday that it was buying the market leader in programmes to collect and sift corporate data knocked 4 per cent of SAP stock in trading Monday.The shares closed at €39.95 in Frankfurt.Investors were rattled because Mr Kagermann had for years underlined SAP’s superiority to US rival Oracle by pointing out the German company was focused on organic growth – not dealmaking.To catch SAP, Oracle has spent billions on buying rival makers of central business programmes as well as end-user suppliers such as Hyperion, a Business Objects rival, it bought for $3.3bn (€2.3bn) this spring.But at a press conference in Frankfurt, Mr Kagermann said the largest acquisition in SAP’s history was not a reaction to Oracle.“We have not seen … that Oracle is gaining market share,” he stressed.He said the move was consistent with SAP’s strategy outlined as far back as 2003. Having “done our homework” in its two core sectors, which would still grow organically, SAP now had time to look at end-users’ needs.As demand for traditional manufacturing and supply-chain management slows, SAP said that sales of business analysis software were growing at around 10 per cent per year from current annual sales of about €10bn.In buying Business Objects, SAP would be able to offer its clients more integrated features, Mr Kagermann said, stressing that demand for such end-user features would likely continue to rise over the next years.“There are other areas in which such a move would make sense,” Mr Kagermann said, noting that ever more companies wanted integrated software. “But [the acquisition of Business Objects] is by far the most important.”SAP has spent the past years reinventing its so-called business process platform, the nervous systems of companies’ IT systems, and making a foray into the market for mid-sized companies, which critics argue came late.
863;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-08T19:20:18Z;A new mantra to explain SAP purchase;;Having spent years stressing organic growth over the acquisitive strategy of arch-rival Oracle, the departure of German business-software maker SAP from its big corporate mantra proved surprisingly matter-of-fact.But, as so often with Henning Kagermann, chief executive of the world’s largest maker of business software, it was not so much that he was changing tack – the world was at last beginning to understand things he said all along.The €4.8bn ($6.7bn) agreed takeover offer for Franco-American software group Business Objects was entirely consistent with SAP’s goals to grow in three sectors, Mr Kagermann said in Frankfurt.Organic growth was – and would remain – the mantra for the two areas that had been the focus of attention for the past four years: revamping the software backbone that all companies need, and luring smaller businesses.In both areas, buying other companies made no sense because SAP was a clear market leader and so confident about its technological leadership that it saw no need for any outside help, SAP’s chief executive explained.But, apparently forgotten by everyone, except Mr Kagermann, was SAP’s third ambition: to diversify from supplying software backbones, so-called business-process platforms, to selling programmes for end-users. And this, Mr Kagermann implied, had al­ways been a very different pro­position. So-called “business user solutions are very different”, he said, noting that this market is growing and consolidating extremely quickly.“We have some innovation and know-how [in this field], but we have to accept that there are other [market] leaders,” he said, noting a slew of smallish companies that had long focused on addressing specialised user needs.“People expect us to embrace the latest and coolest technology,” Mr Kagermann said. That’s why SAP decided it would be better quickly to buy in potential big sellers rather than start time-consuming development.One of these is compiling and sifting through corporate data to improve performance. According to SAP, Business Objects is the clearleader in this market with annual sales of €10bn and yearly growth of 10 per cent.Mr Kagermann said adverse reaction by investors – SAP stock fell 4 per cent to €39.95 – had more to do with the fact that “the market is not educated” than with any inconsistency at SAP. It would in time come around.SAP had in past years al­ready bought software makers Virsa and OutlookSoft to offer its customers, respectively, in­tegrated programmes to check legal compliance and assess corporate performance. But in spending $200m on OutlookSoft, for example, SAP long made these moves look part of a pocket-money fin­anced sideshow that would not lay claim to corporate res­ources to any noticeable extent.Having announced a deal 34 times bigger than the OulookSoft move this spring, Mr Kagermann strongly hinted that the time of trifling “fill-in acquisitions” had ended, presaging fill-in purchases easily above the billion mark.SAP had proven it could grow organically and that it could innovate. “Now we are on our way to proving that we can make larger acquisitions,” he said, declining to name what fields are next.“There are other areas in which such a move would make sense,” Mr Kagermann said, noting that ever more companies wanted integrated software “But [the acquisition of Business Objects] is by far the most important.”
864;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-10-08T11:25:13Z;SAP buys Business Objects for €4.8bn;;"Germany’s SAP on Sunday night launched a €4.8bn (£3.3bn) bid for Franco-US software maker Business Objects in what seems a departure from its long-term strategy to expand only organically and by smaller purchases.The world’s largest maker of business software said it would offer €42 a share for the company, which specialises in business-analysis packages; a 20 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price in Paris.The decision was seen as a response by SAP to a purchase by Oracle, its US archrival, which in March bought Hyperion, a smaller rival of Business Objects, for $3.3bn (£1.6bn).SAP denied its agreed bid was a change of tack. Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said the company had bought interesting applications with “end-user appeal” before. SAP would continue to expand its core business organically.In a conference call, he said that was consistent with SAP’s 2003 strategy statement. After changes to the main software platform, SAP was looking at individual applications.Mr Kagermann said this opportunity to combine “market leaders in their respective domains” was “an opportunity unparalleled” in the German group’s history. He declined to give details of new products.SAP said the move, financed by cash and debt, would go through if supported by 50.01 per cent of Business Objects’ shareholders. It hopes to close the transaction in the first quarter of next year.The deal would mildly dilute earnings in the coming year, but boost profits in 2009 and beyond. “Financially and not just strategically, this is a good deal,” Mr Kagermann said.It comes at a sensitive time for the German software maker. It is spending €400m to introduce software for small businesses, which will, for the first time, be hosted on the web by its own computer centres.But analysts and investors reacted negatively to the deal, sending SAP shares down more than 5 per cent to €39.90, the worst perfomers on Germany’s Dax-30 index of blue-chip stocks.In a note to clients, analysts at Société Générale wrote: “This deal raises serious strategic concerns, in our view, which should cause the market to reconsider the current premium rating for SAP’s shares.”"
865;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-28T08:39:17Z;Technology stocks;;Shades of 1998? Back then, credit turmoil forced the Federal Reserve to cut rates, and technology stocks embarked on the mother of all bull runs. This time, a cocktail of credit market paralysis and housing woes forced the Fed’s hand. The technology sector is again partying (although, admittedly, not quite like it’s 1999).There are plenty of reasons. Superficially, tech appears insulated from the epicentre of economic weakness. As US consumer spending related to housing has slowed (big-ticket appliance sales rose 0.8 per cent in the first half year-on-year), spending on computers, peripherals and software rose 8.4 per cent. That is helpful, given tech companies’ increased consumer focus. Apple, Google and Cisco, for example, are enjoying the new digital media product cycle.Even corporate technology spending is running well ahead of overall US capital investment. Unless economic weakness spreads aggressively, the argument goes, the sector should not get hit by credit and housing worries.Large technology companies also enjoy large, and growing, overseas exposure, where economic conditions look more robust. The weak dollar artificially boosts those earnings.Finally, tech companies benefit from strong, simple balance sheets – without mark-to-market or funding concerns. And consolidation, led by the likes of Oracle, should continue.The sector now trades on almost 20 times 2007 earnings, according to Citigroup. While a premium to the broader market, that is nothing like the heady days of 1999. If the Fed can stop economic weakness spreading, the tech sector looks well positioned to run further.Stock markets are showing an unhealthy faith in the Fed’s ability to contain powerful forces in credit and housing. Tech may not be a safe haven: it will suffer if consumer weakness spreads and, as proved by the last downturn, corporate tech spending can be intensely cyclical.As in 1999, the pockets of huge secular growth that do exist are already accompanied by punchy valuations. If the Fed trips up this time, tech will take a tumble.
866;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-21T21:22:33Z;Wall St enjoys best week in six months;;"Wall Street stocks had their best week for six months after the Federal Reserve surprised markets by slashing interest rates by half a percentage point.The S&P 500 on Tuesday enjoyed its biggest one-day gain since March 2003 as investors bet that low interest rates would lend support to the US economy.The decision to cut both the Fed Funds rate and the discount rate – the rate at which banks can borrow directly from the Fed – appeared to calm equity markets as share volatility eased.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, a measure of future market volatility, fell 24 per cent to lows last reached at the end of July before the credit squeeze.Trading volumes were high on the week and on Friday the New York Stock Exchange set a new volume record for the first hour of trading.Equity markets surged even as the dollar fell to a new record low against the euro.The CurrencyShares Euro Trust exchange traded fund, which tracks the price of the euro, closed the week at an all-time high.The S&P 500 was 2.8 per cent higher on the week at 1,525.72, within 1.8 per cent of its all-time high, set in July. The Dow Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.8 per cent at 13,820.19 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.7 per cent at 2,671.22.Large-cap companies saw particularly strong gains. The Russell Top 50 index of the largest US companies by market capitalisation hit its highest level since 2001.“I’m surprised at the strong snap back – it’s almost like we discounted everything that happened over the last three months,” Joe Ranieri, managing director of trading of Canaccord Adams, said. “The weaker dollar is going to be good for earnings at the larger cap companies, particularly in the tech sector.”The Nasdaq was lifted on Friday by some positive earnings news from Oracle and details of a share buyback by Texas Instruments.Google set a new all-time high, up 5.9 per cent for the week at $560.10.However, it was a disappointing week for Microsoft, down 1.3 per cent to $28.65, after a European court upheld a European Commission ruling that the software group had abused its near-monopoly position.Oracle reported a 25 per cent rise in quarterly profit. The stock was up 9.5 per cent on the week at $21.98.Texas Instruments was 5.6 per cent higher at $36.62 after its board approved a $5bn share buyback programme and announced plans to raise its cash dividend by 25 per cent.In other earnings news, Nike said quarterly profit rose 51 per cent. Shares in the athletic shoe and clothing company were flat for the week at $57.26.The week’s earnings news was dominated by the brokerage sector as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns turned in their third-quarter report cards.Goldman and Lehman surprised the market with better-than-expected earnings, up 10.2 per cent to $209.98 and 5.4 per cent to $62.70 on the week, respectively.But Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley disappointed.Shares in Morgan, which reported a 17 per cent third-quarter profit decline, were down 2.5 per cent on the week at $64.44. Bear’s earnings fell 61 per cent after fixed-income revenues plummeted but its shares ended the week flat at $117.32.Transport stocks lagged the market as crude oil set a series of record highs.FedEx, down 4.7 per cent at $104.10, cut its earnings forecast for the year due to higher energy costs and uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook.Shares in Harman International Industries plunged 21.3 per cent to $85.The company confirmed rumours that Goldman Sachs and KKR would not complete their planned $8bn purchase of the audio equipment maker.Mattel, up 6.6 per cent at $23.94, finished the week with an apology to the Chinese people for damaging the reputation of their manufacturers after the recall of around 21m toys. On a
visit to Beijing, Thomas Debrowski, executive vice-president of worldwide operations, said the majority of toys were recalled because of design flaws, not poor Chinese manufacturing.It was another volatile week for homebuilder stocks as positive news about the relaxation of regulation of mortgage lenders was overshadowed by more downbeat data on housing starts, which declined 2.6 per cent in August. But the S&P materials index recorded strong gains as investors bet on the continuing strength of the global construction boom."
867;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-20T22:29:40Z;Market turmoil fails to dent Oracle’s growth;;The upheaval in financial markets this summer has not yet had any effect on spending by the technology industry’s big corporate customers, according to Oracle’s most recent earnings.On Thursday the maker of database and other corporate software reported surprisingly strong growth in what is traditionally its weakest quarter of the year.Concerns that the credit crisis would dent corporate confidence and hit technology spending have led to greater volatility in tech stocks in recent weeks. A particular cause of unease has been demand from the financial services sector, one of Oracle’s biggest markets.Responding to a question from an analyst about whether the company expected market turbulence to lead to weaker demand, Safra Catz, co-president and chief financial officer, said: “Pipelines are extremely strong – but we read the same papers you do.”The breadth of Oracle’s operations, and the foreign currency benefits from the falling US dollar, would provide a degree of stability in a period of greater uncertainty, she said.Chuck Phillips, co-president, added that while the upheaval on Wall Street would lead to job cuts, there were no signs yet of customers there cutting back on spending.The software company said that in the three months to the end of August its revenues had climbed to $4.53bn, up 26 per cent from a year before and above market expectations of $4.35bn. Net income rose 25 per cent to $840m, or 16 cents per share.On the pro-forma basis on which Wall Street assesses the company, earnings reached 22 cents per share, 1 cent above estimates.Oracle’s figures were helped by the acquisition of Hyperion Solutions, a maker of business intelligence software, and the falling US dollar, which contributed 4 percentage points to reported growth.“The strength in the quarter was very broad-based, across all product lines,” Ms Catz said.Revenue from sales of new software licences, which is a closely followed indicator of broader business health, rose 35 per cent to $1.1bn, well ahead of most forecasts.
868;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-20T21:59:17Z;Tech stocks regain safe haven status;;The technology sector sounds an unlikely safe haven for investors. But despite some creeping concerns that have returned in recent weeks, much of Wall Street is still betting on technology remaining one of the most resilient corners of the stock market for at least the rest of this year.Even before the market volatility that set in this summer, the return to tech came as a surprise.Tech stocks have been a persistent underperformer relative to the wider market since the end of the 1990s. The strong 2003 rally, coming after three bloody years in the wake of the dotcom bust, proved an exception. In the event, tech stocks once again lost ground relative to the rest of the market, albeit less spectacularly than before, and investors looking for growth turned elsewhere, particularly to the emerging markets.“It wasn’t that investors were concerned about technology,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “It was that they just weren’t even interested.” This spring, something changed. US tech stocks began a rebound that has left them outperforming the broader market by some six percentage points so far this year.A similar recovery set in in Europe. As is often the case with broader stock market moves like this, a number of explanations have been advanced to try to explain the shift.A search for reliable sources of growth in a weakening economy is the one most frequently heard.The go-go days of the 1990s may be far in the past, but solid demand from corporate buyers – starting with an unexpectedly strong PC market – has kept growth rates higher than many observers expected.According to Richard Kaiser, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, the technology industry’s reliance on corporate spending has made it a particularly attractive alternative at a time when fears about a downturn in US consumer spending have been rife.US tech companies have also benefited from their big international exposure, which brings a doubled benefit: the foreign currency effects of a falling dollar, and a high exposure to emerging markets that are finally starting to account for a material slice of sales and profits.To top it off, both the boom and bust in the debt markets have also been held up as reasons for the out-performance of tech – a paradox that smacks of the post-event rationalisation that often accompanies broader market moves like this.First, the debt-fuelled private equity boom brought an acquisition premium to some parts of the sector: then, as credit markets went into turmoil, tech companies’ strong balance sheets and lack of reliance on debt made them seem a haven.All of these rationalisations, however, gloss over the most powerful reason investors have been turning back to tech. In relative terms the sector, while not cheap, had got to the most attractive levels seen since before the 1990s boom.By last year, according to Bernstein, tech stock multiples had shrunk to 1.33 times the broader market, compared with 2.41 times in 2001.Some say the wind started to come out of the tech sector’s sails in recent weeks, on fears about the wider economic effects of the financial market turmoil.With the financial services industry itself a big customer, the damage sustained in the upheaval could also have a direct impact.“People aren’t really concerned about technology per se,” says Mr Kaiser.“They’re worried about whether the US economy is going into a recession or not.”So far, tech companies are reporting little evidence of a downturn in demand. Yet despite these assurances, the stock market feels “disbelief in all this,” says one technology investor.“People are saying: ‘sure you’re doing well now, but what about next quarter?’” With the industry entering its seasonally strongest period of the year, that has added to fears that a sudden economic chill could hit tech disproportionately hard.This week’s US interest rate cut has certainly helped to ease some of the worries. Tech “tends to do well when the rest of the market does well, and the market does well after a Fed rate cut”, says Mr Levkovich.However, investors have been put on notice. In this more nervous environment, “the penalties for missing [earnings targets] go up dramatically”, says Mr Kaiser. That makes it important to hold stocks that display greater stability in earnings and geographic diversity, he adds. Meanwhile, even after the run-up that tech stocks have taken in recent months, valuations look less stretched than for years.Companies such as Microsoft and Oracle are trading at a premium of 10 per cent or less to the market, says one tech investor, adding: “We certainly don’t have a bubble here.”
869;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-18T23:55:41Z;Volvo Trucks’ valuable early warning system;;"For any manufacturing company, in-warranty failures represent a significant expense. There is the cost of the repair or replacement itself, administering the process and, often, a loss of customer good will.But an efficient warranty system can cut these costs and more. Customer satisfaction is higher if any warranty issues are handled efficiently and quickly. The manufacturer ties up fewer resources handling the repair, and goods are turned round more quickly.The product itself can even be improved, if the warranty system can feed data into both the manufacturing process and suppliers. And a good reputation for handling in-warranty repairs will even justify a price premium in some marketplaces.These are some of the benefits identified by Volvo Trucks, the heavy goods vehicle manufacturer, which created a new quality and warranty analysis tool (QWAT) a year ago. The system is based around SAS Institute’s Warranty Analytics software and an Oracle relational database.The scale of warranty operations at Volvo’s trucks division is significant. The company currently builds about 100,000 trucks – mostly tractor units for semi-trailers or rigs – each year. The standard European warranty on these vehicles is one year, with some vehicles covered by a 300,000km warranty.“With current production levels, and some good will campaigns, 200,000 to 300,000 trucks could produce a warranty claim or produce a problem that ends up in the analytics system,” says Micke Rydbeck, project manager for warranty systems at Volvo Truck Corporation. To add to the complexity, in Europe the vehicle could be taken to any one of 1,000 service points or, in North America, one of 350 sites.Added to this, the vehicles Volvo produces are simple, commodity items. Within the annual production total, perhaps as few as two vehicles might be identical, such is the range of variants and configuration options available to customers.An in-warranty failure might be the result of a particular, and quite possibly very rare, combination of components. The new system is much more effective at narrowing down the list of vehicles fitted with a particular part to those that are most likely to have problems.“It might not show up as a battery problem on each and every truck, but only when two parts are used in combination,” says Rydbeck.The business case for Volvo’s project was based on achieving more efficient warranty claims, reduced fraud, better reporting and improved recovery of warranty costs from suppliers.The warranty tool acts as a valuable early warning system, helping to pick up any potential faults before they occur in a truck. Improved trend analysis is a valuable feature of the new system: previously, quality control staff had to use three main tools and three data sources in what was still, largely, a manual process.But the earlier the company identifies a problem, the cheaper it is to fix. Advanced warning allows more vehicles to be examined and repaired during regular servicing. This reduces Volvo’s costs but critically, keeps customers’ trucks on the road for longer.The system also helps Volvo to give customers a wider range of configuration options without compromising on the manufacturer’s standards or increasing support costs. “We need to have a situation where we can produce trucks built to customers’ specifications that still nurture our core values of quality and safety,” Mr Rydbeck explains.Another important part of the analytics-based approach to warranty management is that it helps Volvo’s design and manufacturing teams react to after-market problems with the trucks, and prioritise design or production changes. These are all important benefits for Volvo customers.The project has had a significant impact on Volvo’s after-
market costs: cutting them plays a key part in keeping the manufacturer competitive.“Our warranty costs have fallen by 40 to 50 per cent in the past couple of years,” says Mr Rydbeck. “But it becomes progressively harder to lower these costs and harder to find the problems that cause them. Our warranty costs are now about the industry average, but were higher.”He believes that the new warranty management system, and in particular its analytical capabilities, will allow Volvo Trucks to deliver above-average service to vehicle owners while cutting its prices and increasing per-
vehicle margins.“If we can reduce our warranty costs, it gives us room to increase our margins while also being competitive on price,” he says.Volvo is also using its system to detect unusual or potentially fraudulent warranty claims. The analytics tool can go through historical claims data and identify claims that need to be checked. Rather than send a team of auditors to look at a dealer’s books, picking random samples, it can focus on claims that arouse specific suspicions.“During an audit we can focus on three, five or 10 claims that we are really interested in, rather than picking 20 at random. Dealers are getting the message, and we are at much less risk of fraud now,” says Mr Rydbeck.The system is also being implemented at US truck maker Mack and at Volvo’s bus operations. The next step for Volvo is to extend the warranty analytics system to key suppliers, a process it started in June this year.“We are opening up the system and showing suppliers information relating to them. Previously we reported to suppliers twice a year, but now we can show quality information to them and they can improve products immediately,” says Mr Rydbeck.“Because we can share our information, we can have a better conversation with suppliers.”"
870;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-17T21:57:26Z;US technology groups fear EU laws;;Apple and Google top the list of leading US technology companies that could fall foul of European antitrust regulation as a result of Monday’s confirmation of the European Union’s ruling against Microsoft, according to some industry analysts and observers.They said the defeat for the world’s biggest software company could prompt European regulators to try to force other companies that control dominant technologies to open up more of their technology to rivals, potentially weakening their grip on their core markets.Microsoft’s opponents, however, countered that the software company’s long-term control of one of the technology world’s key computing platforms had left it in a unique position, and as a result the outcome of the case had no implications for others.“I represent a lot of IT companies, and I am not in the slightest bit concerned on their part – and I know they’re not concerned either,” said Thomas Vinje, a Brussels lawyer who represents ECIS, a trade group whose members include IBM, Oracle and Nokia.Regardless of how the EU decides to apply the ruling in future, in principle it hits at the heart of how far companies must go to make their products interoperable with those of rivals.One of the two issues in the Microsoft case, this has become a fundamental question for technology companies as they try to balance a desire to build their own “proprietary” systems against demands from customers to be able to connect products made by rival companies more easily.“I think there will be other cases to define the limits of interoperability,” said Nicholas Economides, professor of economics at the Stern School of Business.Monday’s verdict “creates a significant requirement on any technology company to license its technology to others”, he said.Apple’s closed digital music system, which relies on proprietary anti-piracy technology, has already faced national-level opposition in several European countries, though the EU declined to pursue a complaint lodged by an Apple competitor last year.Meanwhile, Google’s dominance of the search business could draw more attention to the extent to which it opens up its online “platform” to other internet companies that want to connect their services, said Bill Whyman, of International Strategy and Investment Group.
871;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-16T21:03:18Z;Microsoft says rivals may rue siding with EU;;Microsoft, which will on Monday learn whether a top European Union court has annulled the landmark 2004 antitrust ruling against the US software developer, is warning technology rivals they should be careful what they wish for.The developer suggests that other software and technology companies such as IBM, Google and Apple could be next in line should the European Commission decision be upheld. It argues that the legal reasoning applied by the Brussels watchdog may well be turned against some of the very companies that have supported the Commission’s case and trigger a broader crackdown on the industry.Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, told the Financial Times: “Obviously, law that is made for Microsoft is going to apply to other market leaders as well. IBM, Google, Apple and others would have to look very carefully at the implications for their business models.”Mr Smith added: “This is a very significant judgement because it will shed light on the answers to two very important questions. Firstly, under what circumstances can market-leading companies improve their products for consumers? And secondly, what rights do market-leading companies have to benefit from their own breakthroughs and inventions?“The answers will affect companies far beyond the IT [information technology] sector and will set precedents that will rule the behaviour of market leaders across Europe for many years to come.”Monday’s ruling by the European Court of First Instance will decide whether the Commission was right to find that Microsoft had abused its dominant market position by shutting out competitors in adjacent markets such as media players and server software.The company was fined a record €497m and ordered to change its business practices. This included having to provide technical information about the ubiquitous Windows operating system to rivals.The court and Microsoft have since been at loggerheads over the precise meaning of the 2004 ruling, and Brussels last year fined the company an additional €280.5m for failing to comply with its orders.During the nine-year legal battle, the Commission has been supported by companies such as Sun Microsystems, RealNetworks and Novell and various industry associations. While some rivals have since struck deals with Microsoft to settle their grievances, some of the biggest names in the software industry continue to back the Commission’s hard line.The most prominent backers of the Brussels line are grouped in an association called Ecis. These include IBM, Oracle, Sun, Nokia, Adobe and Red Hat. Google has not formally sided with the Brussels regulator, but is understood to have raised concerns about Microsoft’s behaviour regarding web search engines.
872;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-14T23:31:26Z;Icahn calls for BEA Systems sale;;Carl Icahn on Friday called for a sale of BEA Systems, triggering a fresh round of speculation about the chances of an acquisition of one of the biggest independent makers of the software used in large corporate IT systems.The corporate raider reported in a regulatory filing that he had raised his stake in the company to 8.53 per cent, and said he may ask the company to hold a shareholder meeting and propose his own directors.However, BEA is in the midst of an internal investigation into options backdating and is not expected to resume formal financial filings for several months, delaying the prospects of any meeting.With a stock market value of more than $5bn, BEA ranks among the world’s dozen largest pure software companies. Its shares rose nearly 4 per cent on Friday’s news, to $13.25, al­though they remain 20 per cent below their high for the past 12 months. Nasdaq has again warned the group that it continues to be out of compliance with listing requirements due to the delay in filing its second-quarter results.BEA rose to prominence in the tech boom of the late 1990s, as its Weblogic “application server” software made it the main alternative to IBM for developers who wanted to write Java-based software applications to run over the internet.However, its fortunes declined as the application server business matured and it was outflanked by rivals such as IBM and Oracle, which built broader suites of the “middleware” layer on which corporate IT systems depend.“BEA is a little late to the game and doesn’t have the breadth of offerings for the majority of IT departments,” said Charles Di Bona, a software analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.In Friday’s filing, Mr Icahn said he believed “a strategic acquirer could utilise greater resources and market presence”, enabling it to cut overlapping costs and boost revenue growth from BEA’s newer products.Frequent speculation in Silicon Valley in recent years that BEA would become an acquisition target for a larger technology company has repeatedly proved unfounded. Larry Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, helped to fuel the speculation three years ago when he named BEA as one of a handful of companies on his list of potential acquisition candidates. Since then, however, Oracle has built its own suite of middleware products and is seen as less likely to make a bid.While BEA seemed a likely takeover candidate “three or four years ago, I think the moment has come and gone”, said Mr Di Bona.Some other Wall Street analysts continue to rate the chances of a takeover higher, helping to support its stock price.
873;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-14T21:56:13Z;Richest racers make waves in America’s Cup;;"Ernesto Bertarelli, whose Alinghi sailing team retained the America’s Cup in July, wants Oracle’s Larry Ellison, his arch sailing enemy, to pick up the phone and bring to an end their dispute over the next edition of sport’s oldest trophy before it heads for a bloody court battle.“It would be nice if he gave me a call for a change,” said Mr Bertarelli, the Swiss billionaire who last September sold Serono, the Bertarelli family’s pharmaceutical group, to Merck in a €10.6bn ($14.7bn) deal.Mr Bertarelli is focused on bringing modern sports business practice to the America’s Cup to create an international spectator sport rivalling F1 motor-racing and even the Olympics.For the moment, the struggle for supremacy of the seas is on hold until a legal stand-off between two of the world’s richest men is resolved. Mr Ellison, the 11th richest billionaire, according to Forbes, thinks Mr Bertarelli (the 76th) is playing foul ahead of preparations for the 33rd event.Mr Bertarelli on Saturday will announce a surplus of €65.5m out of the €240m of revenue generated from the 32nd America’s Cup, held in Valencia, and from preceding races to determine the challenger. This vindicates, he claims, his strategy to attract bigger audiences and more sponsorship.Alinghi, which beat Emirates Team New Zealand 5-2 to retain the “Auld Mug”, is to receive €30m, a further €30m is to be split between the other competitors and the remainder will go to America’s Cup Management, the organising body, which Mr Bertarelli controls.Mr Bertarelli wants to maintain the momentum built up by the event, which this year attracted 2.7m visitors, for Alinghi’s next defence of the cup in two years’ time, again in Valencia.Mr Ellison has other ideas.The rules allow the winning yacht’s sailing club to determine the venue, type of yacht and racing conditions for its cup defence, in collaboration with the first legitimate sailing club to throw down a challenge.Oracle, favourite for the 32nd cup until it was knocked out in the semi­finals of the Louis Vuitton challenger cup, fired off a lawsuit. It disputes the legitimacy of the 2009 challenger, Club Náutico Español de Vela, describing it as a “sham” yacht club helping Mr Bertarelli’s Société Nautique de Genève to establish one-sided rules for its next cup defence.Mr Ellison sought an injunction from the New York Supreme Court to halt Mr Bertarelli in his tracks, but this failed on Monday. Unless the parties settle out of court, legal arguments will be heard on October 22.“When I first heard about the lawsuit, I thought Larry must be bluffing,” said Mr Bertarelli. “ I rang him and said, ‘Why didn’t you call me?’ He told me he didn’t really have a clear reason [for the lawsuit]. He said, ‘Let me think about it and let me call you back.’ I haven’t spoken to him since.”The surplus made from the 32nd cup should help teams mount renewed challenges for 2009, says Mr Bertarelli. He wants the next cup fought between 90ft J-Class yachts with restricted design capability to generate closely fought racing.Oracle, Mr Bertarelli alleges, simply wants an exclusive race with Alinghi next year. “Everybody knows Larry can afford to pay for the entire cost of a challenge. Other teams can’t; they have to rely on partners and suppliers.”Mr Bertarelli accepts that, by the rules of the event, the defender is both “jury and party” of the protocol that governs each cup edition. But he denies Alinghi has any competitive advantage.Nor is he perturbed by the decision by Louis Vuitton, part of French luxury goods group LVMH, to bring an end to its 25-year association with the cup. Prada, the Italian luxury goods group, is ending 10 years of sponsoring a team.“As trustees of the America’s Cup, we ought to protect the interests of sailors and sailing teams, not Louis Vuitton,” says Mr Bertarelli."
874;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-09-10T09:19:29Z;New providers: Private sector continues to struggle for contracts;;"There had been a belief that with the rapid changes in technology – be it computing, processing or communications – that the grip of the big defence companies on the global defence market would be weakened, giving procurement agencies more choice at a time when the rationalisation of the defence industrial scene has reduced it somewhat. Unfortunately, such hopes and expectations have yet to be fulfilled.The respected Defense News list of the top 100 defence companies for 2006 shows no non-traditional defence providers in the top 50; arguably there are none there at all.Every company in the list has experience in defence to a greater, rather than a lesser degree. Defence might not be the majority business – Boeing (2nd) has a defence business that is less than half of the whole; United Technologies (10th) has a defence turnover of around 16 per cent of total – but both have been defence suppliers for decades.One reason is that the size of defence contracts, even in the US defence market, are still a fraction of the size of the commercial contracts. For example, while the US Army may look to buy 100-150,000 of a certain tactical radio over the course of three to four years, the global mobile telephone handset market stands at around 1bn annually.It should be remembered that for any country outside the US, a communications system contract may be for an average of 20-30,000 radios, spread over three to eight years. This is the case with the UK’s Bowman programme, or France’s PR4G radio project. The volumes are well below what many commercial companies are used to dealing with.As a point of note concerning military communications, Nokia sold its secure communications business to EADS, exiting the defence market, and traditional defence suppliers, such as Finmeccanica and Thales, have been quick to exploit commercial technologies that civilian companies either could not or would not develop for the military.In addition to the disparity of the market size for a commercial company to access defence contracts, they are frequently required by defence departments to jump through hoops – something the company is likely to be unaccustomed to. The bidding process for defence contracts can also easily run into years – generally rare in many commercial markets – all of which makes defence contracts unattractive for many commercial companies.Despite the drive towards Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment, there have been many limitations as to how adaptable equipment and systems that are used in the commercial/civilian world are for military applications.There are military requirements for shock and environmental tolerances that the vast number of commercial systems simply do not have to meet. While people have complained that in some cases, different defence departments have “Gold Plated” requirements for, say, temperature tolerances on computers and other electronics (when equipment is fitted in armoured fighting vehicles operating in Iraq in summer, then it is not unreasonable to ask for temperature tolerances of +60 degrees centigrade).This is not to say that non-traditional suppliers are not managing to access defence contracts. But it seems to be the case that rather than trying to access business directly, with the effort and cost involved, many non-traditional suppliers are acting as sub-systems primes to traditional defence contractors. It is in areas such as this that companies like Microsoft, Cisco, and Siemens are building up defence/security activities.One group of commercial companies who have attracted defence dollars is the satellite communications providers. Inmarsat, Intellsat and others have sold surplus bandwidth to many armed forces, faced with overseas operations and a need to shift logistics information to and from the home base. This is partly thanks to the fact that it is no longer an essential requirement for data traffic to be carried on secure satellite systems.Another example of commercial best practice being adapted to the military is the Paradigm consortium, which won the contract to modernise and operate the UK’s military satellite system on behalf of the MoD.Non-traditional defence providers have also accessed defence markets via the growing business of service provision. With large operations overseas requiring enduring support, it is cheaper for defence departments to let contracts to commercial firms, rather than keeping the work in-house. Many of these, especially for “soft” services such as catering and transportation of supplies, do go to experts in those skill sets, rather than traditional defence firms.Likewise, the contracting out of support of equipment in home bases and the drive to whole fleet management have allowed commercial providers of these services to bid, frequently successfully, against traditional defence primes.Arguably one of the most promising areas where non-traditional suppliers have been able to enter the defence arena has been in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.Both SAP and Oracle, though rarely the prime contractor, have accessed the modernisation of the administration and day-to-day operations of many defence departments.Where military business practices can easily conform to commercial best practice, there has been room to map current ERP platforms directly onto military institutions."
875;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-08-31T21:18:41Z;Wall St up as Bush offers subprime help;;"Wall Street ended the week mixed after a stuttering rebound followed the heavy losses suffered on Tuesday with continuing disquiet about the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis.The leading indices all closed higher for the day, after President George Bush announced that the US government would help some Americans with delinquent mortgages keep their homes.Markets appeared to have taken heart from earlier comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said the central bank would “act as needed” to prevent the credit crunch from damaging the US economy.Although markets were cheered by the president’s plan, William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS, said the Bush proposal – allowing the Federal Housing Administration to act as guarantor of some loans from homeowners who are more than 90 days overdue – was “palliative” rather than a solution to the subprime mortgage crisis.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent on the day, but was 0.4 per cent lower for the week at 1,473.99, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent for the day and 0.8 per cent for the week to 2,596.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher on the day and 0.2 per cent down for the week at 13,357.74.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies had gained 1.3 per cent for the day but was 0.8 per cent off for the week at 792.86.Higher equity volatility suggested that nervousness continued to cloud investor sentiment. The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index fell 7.1 per cent for the day to 23.29, but was 12.5 per cent higher over the week after dropping more than 30 per cent last week.The Bush plan gave relief to stocks after reports earlier in the week showed sharp falls in home sales and house prices had fuelled a bearish mood among investors.Countrywide Financial, the biggest US mortgage lender, rose 1.1 per cent for the day to $19.85, although the company’s shares finished the week down 5.5 per cent and have lost half their value since mid-June.Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage company, also recouped some of the losses it suffered on Thursday after reporting a 45 per cent plunge in second-quarter net income on a $320m loss on new mortgages. Its shares gained 2.6 per cent on the day, but were down 3.1 per cent for the week at $61.61.Accredited Home Lenders gave the mortgage sector a lift after Lone Star Funds, which had been seeking to abandon its $400m purchase of the struggling subprime mortgage lender, said it was prepared to complete the deal for a reduced price.Accredited shares soared 50 per cent for the week to $9.05.Investment banks staged a moderate recovery but still finished the week lower after Merrill Lynch said tighter credit markets would hit earnings at Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.It cut its profit estimates for the three banks and lowered the recommendations on their shares to “neutral” from “buy”. Financial stocks were dealt another blow on Thursday when Lehman Brothers Holdings cut its third-quarter and second-half earnings forecasts.Lehman Brothers, the biggest underwriter of bonds backed by home loans, was 9.2 per cent lower for the week at $54.83; Citigroup lost 3.3 per cent to $46.88; Bear Stearns was down 7.2 per cent at $108.66; and Merrill Lynch fell 3.2 per cent to $73.70.On the upside, technology stocks performed well, as investors welcomed positive earnings results and appeared ready to bet that companies in the sector would continue to be insulated from woes in the credit markets.Dell, the second-largest maker of personal computers, rose 1.8 per cent over the week to $28.25, as the company posted stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and Lehman Brothers raised its target price for the stock to $30.Apple climbed 2.4 per cent to $138.48 after the company issued invitations to an event next week at which it is widely expected to unveil a new version of the iPod digital music and video player.Oracle rose 1.7 per cent for the week to $20.28 after SAP, the German software maker that it is suing for alleged theft of program codes, offered to settle.In other sectors, Altria Group rose 0.3 per cent to $69.41 after it announced it would spin off Philip Morris International, its tobacco unit, and raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7 per cent to 75 cents a share."
876;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-08-29T20:28:13Z;Wall St rallies led by tech stocks;;Wall Street stocks rebounded strongly on Wednesday after sharp falls in the leading indices on Tuesday.Markets were lifted by the release of a letter from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to Charles Schumer, chairman of Congress’s Joint Economic Committee, saying the Fed is closely watching financial markets and is ”prepared to act as needed” should the economy be threatened.Shares were also bolstered by a resurgent technology sector, Altria’s long-awaited spin-off of Philip Morris International and some better-than-expected earnings results.Rebecca Engmann Darst, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers, said US shares had in effect “recovered from a sullen, late-session tantrum” on Tuesday, sparked by the release of somewhat dour minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting.She said it showed how at times the markets had strayed from examining fundamentals. “Investors seem more preoccupied with watching a circus freak show than the main attraction of the economy.”The S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent at 1,463.76 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5 per cent to 2,563.16.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.9 per cent higher at 13,289.29 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.5 per cent at 787.32.The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was up six basis points at 4.57 per cent.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index fell by 10.2 per cent to 23.63 after two days of sharp rises.The Nasdaq was boosted by healthy rises in several technology shares. Seagate Technology shares rose 3.8 per cent to $25.39 after the leading maker of computer hard-disk drives raised its first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late on Tuesday and several analysts lifted their price targets for the company’s stock.Apple was another strong performer, climbing 5.7 per cent to $134.08 after the company issued invitations to an event next week at which it is widely expected to unveil a new version of the iPod digital music and video player.Google rose 1.3 per cent to $512.88 after the internet search engine said George Reyes, its chief financial officer, would leave by the end of the year.Mr Reyes sparked a sharp drop in Google shares in February 2006 when he made off-the-cuff comments about the company’s need to “find other ways to monetise our business”.Oracle was another technology company in investors’ sights after SAP, the German software maker that it is suing for alleged theft of program codes, offered to settle. Its shares closed 4 per cent higher at $20.13.In other sectors, Altria Group rose 1.1 per cent to $69.80 after its expected announcement that it would spin off Philip Morris International, its tobacco unit. Altria also raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7 per cent to 75 cents a share.In earnings news, Big Lots had its biggest rise since March, gaining 9.9 per cent to $28.91 after the biggest US seller of discontinued goods reported second-quarter earnings above expectations.Borders Group shares rose 1 per cent to $14.94 after it reported a second-quarter net loss of $25.1m compared with a net loss of $18.4m last year. The slimmer-than-expected losses prompted Standard & Poor’s to upgrade the shares from “sell” to “hold”.“While industry conditions remain as challenging as ever, and we expect Borders Group’s turnround to take longer than management projects, the recent 35 per cent slide in share price mitigates further downside risk,” said Michael Souers, the ratings agency’s specialty retail analyst.In a sign that the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis continues to cloud investor sentiment, State Street shares fell 0.3 per cent to $61 on concerns about how credit-market turmoil has hit its managed funds.Mortgage applications fell by 4 per cent in the week to August 24, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.Dillard’s shares fell 0.6 per cent to $24.20 after it posted a hefty second-quarter net loss.Amgen was in the spotlight after a US federal court ruled that Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, had been infringing one of the biotechnology company’s patents. Its stock rose 2.4 per cent to $50.19 by the close of trading.Boeing shares were up 1.3 per cent to $96.90 after it said it had secured a $515m Nasa contract to produce the upper stage of the Ares I crew launch vehicle.Shares in PDL BioPharma plunged 20.3 per cent to $18.80 after the developer of technology for cancer medicines announced a restructuring and was downgraded by JPMorgan Chase.
877;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-08-29T16:14:30Z;Europe’s push for start-ups;;An idea that Europeans are hopeless at high-tech start-ups has taken root alongside older stereotypes of humourless Germans, food-obsessed Frenchmen and sexually repressed Britons. Europeans gaze longingly at the US, where geeky technologists set up big cutting-edge businesses such as Google, Ebay and YouTube, apparently without effort. “Why can’t we do that?” mutter politicians and academics.Saul Klein, a UK-based British ven­ture capitalist and entrepreneur, believes Europeans can, by putting in some extra ground­work to compensate for national barriers and risk-averse cultures.Mr Klein, a co-founder of the Lovefilm online movie rental business, is doing some groundwork himself by setting up Seedcamp, a week-long series of masterclasses for high-technology businesses from across the European Union. They start on Monday September 3 in London, with highlights covered in the Financial Times and on FT.com.Mr Klein, a venture partner at Index, the Silicon Valley-based in­vestment business, says: “We want Seedcamp entrepreneurs to build the next Google. We want European kids to believe they can succeed – from Riga, Istanbul or Hertfordshire.”The 20 participants have been chosen by a panel of venture capitalists from about 270 start-up teams from 40 countries. They will get free advice from successful entrepreneurs, professional advisers and executives from Oracle, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. On Thursday September 6 the teams will pitch for investment to the venture capitalists, which include names such as Index, Balderton, Atlas, Accel and DFJ Esprit. Five winning start-up teams will receive €50,000each. They will stay in London for a further three months, participating in technology demonstrations and presentations to investors.The barriers facing start-up evangelists in Europe such as Mr Klein are formidable. The region starts from a low base in investment terms, with venture capital of just €6.4bn committed in 2006, compared with about €20bn for the US, according to Library House, a venture capital data provider.The lack of investment partly reflects the unfamiliarity of European institutions with venture capital and the attractions of private equity. “They have been fixated on big leveraged buy-outs, like rabbits frozen in the headlights of a car,” says Jean Marc Patouillaud, a ­Paris-based partner at Partech International, a Paribas spin-off headquartered in San Francisco.Low economies of scale deter some investors, because small, high-tech companies require only a few million euros in capital at a time. Returns have also been poor, reflecting feverish fundraising before the dotcom bubble burst, and a hangover afterwards. “People bought at inflated prices and spent money on some business models that simply did not make sense,” says Björn Stray, a general partner with Northzone Ventures, with offices in Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen. But he says EU venture capitalists will gain better brag­ging rights as returns from the 2002-2005 investment round start feeding into five-year figures.Ohad Finkelstein, head of international investment at Venrock, a US investor that backed Intel, Apple and 3Com, believes European institutions can be too impatient: “Venture means risk. But in the EU a lot of companies do not get the second – or third – round funding they would in the US.”London has shown promise recently both as an incubator and as a service centre for European high-tech start-ups. The media hype is of hip young people who spend their days building disruptive websites in East End lofts and their nights partying. A more sober view is that London has a pool of bright, cosmopolitan workers and boasts the European outposts of several Silicon Valley-based venture capitalists.The financial muscle of the City of London is one reason the UK accounts for the lion’s share of venture capital investment committed in Europe.British companies won €2bn in investment in 2006, according to Library House. France, thanks partly to tax breaks for unquoted investment, won €840m. Israel was close behind. Europe-based venture capitalists ignore the fact that it is not officially European because it has great technologists and entrepreneurs. “Israel lives on the edge so its people are comfortable with risk-taking,” says Mr Finkelstein, who splits his time between London and Tel Aviv. Germany came fourth, with €460m in investment.One of the sillier calumnies perpetrated against the European high-tech start-up scene is that there is a lack of role models. Yet Europeans have founded some big, fast-growing businesses. The UK has fostered Lastminute.com, the travel retailer, Skype, the internet telephony company and Last.fm, the web-based radio station. France has Kelkoo, the online comparison site, and Meetic, the internet dating agency. Germany’s Samwer brothers created then sold Alando.de and Jamba, an online auction site and a ringtone business.With a pleasing circularity, footloose Americans based in Europe could be among the entrepreneurs who bolster the continent’s high-tech credentials.US expatriates are adding flavours to the melting pot. One is Eric Baker, whose Viagogo ticket auction website has attract­ed $50m from high-profile investors such as Brent Hoberman, Bernard Arnault and Jacob Rothschild.Mr Baker hopes to replicate the success of StubHub, a US ticket re­- sale business he helped start, that sold for $310m to Ebay this year. “The field has become much more international and there are vibrant ecosystems outside the US,” he says. “You need a pool of entrepreneurial collaborators, local role models and access to capital. All three factors are coming tog­ether in London and across Europe.”France: still over-taxed and over-regulated? Not for start-upsJulien Codorniou has a message for those who think France is a backwater for start-up activity: you do not know what you are missing.As head of Microsoft’s IDEAS programme in France, he should know. Set up two years ago to find and support promising start-ups, the initiative is the first for Microsoft. “France has always produced very talented engineers. But what is new is that in the past few years we have also seen the emergence of a new generation of talented entrepreneurs,” he says.Despite its reputation as the land of the over-taxed and over-regulated, Mr Codorniou believes France is a good place for a high-technology start-up.For example OSEO, the French government innovation agency, provides advice and financial support to young companies, while a research tax credit programme allows innovative companies to claim back at least 15 per cent of research and development spending.Olivier Protard, a managing partner at Sofinnova Partners, a big French venture capital group, is optimistic. “It’s true many young French people aspire to be a civil servant,” he says. “But there are also many young business and engineering school graduates who want to strike out on their own”Pan Kwan YukWHO’S AT SEEDCAMP?The 20 fledgling European entrepreneurs chosen to attend Seedcamp were announced on August 29 on the FT’s Tech Blog.

879;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-08-23T02:03:37Z;Series of small tech IPOs defy market turmoil;;A lossmaking, three-year-old internet concern, Accoona is not the sort of company you expect to see on Wall Street these days.More than 97 per cent of its revenues come from low-margin sales of consumer electronics. Strip out acquisitions and its stellar 90 per cent growth rate last year falls to less than 5 per cent.The New Jersey-based company is among many hopefuls that have floundered in efforts to board the search-engine bandwagon.Despite claims of having a more intelligent search algorithm than Google, “they have no market share at all”, says Greg Sterling, an independent search analyst. “It’s the problem of all the dozens of companies out there trying to get into the search business.”The dotcom bust was reckoned to have cured over-zealous stock market investors of companies like this. Yet Accoona filed for an initial public offering this month, joining a lengthening line of small tech companies with financial profiles that do not appear to make them obvious candidates for a stock market listing.A much-anticipated IPO in the wings, for instance, involves NetSuite, a software company controlled by Larry Ellison, boss of Oracle.NetSuite, which generated revenues of $67m last year, has sustained nearly $200m in accumulated losses since it was founded in 1998. According to a regulatory filing last month, it “may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future”.The pendulum has swung back quickly for tech IPOs.Less than a year ago, despondency from the dotcom bust hung heavily over Silicon Valley. The prevailing view was only companies with annual revenues of at least $100m and having operated for two quarters or more in the black could hope to go public.With the greater caution of investors, newcomers had the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to contend with.That piece of legislation was said to impose a $5m tax on any company intending to go public – enough to give the kiss of death to many potential IPOs, making it a target of fierce attack by the Valley’s entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.Times have changed. Tech IPOs made a surprise rebound in the first half of this year. Although much less frequent than during the dotcom boom, they displaced mergers and acquisitions as the favoured exit route for venture capitalists.This month’s debut of software maker VMware – its market value more than doubled in two weeks of trading to more than $26bn – may not have been typical of the many smaller companies seeking an IPO. But it reminded Wall Street of the potential goldmine from discovering the next hot tech company. It also showed that even amid market turmoil, IPOs by well-established technology companies could still get away.That has not meant a return to carefree days of the late-1990s. Even if they are unprofitable when they go public, tech companies need at least $40m in annual revenues and a business model poised to yield a profit soon, says David Chao, co-founder of Valley venture capital firm DCM.It is now easier for companies with lower revenues and no profits to come to the stock market. These days, most young software companies rely on subscription income, rather than on “up-front” licence fees that supported their predecessors.Since these fees are spread over several years while costs are still incurred at the outset, companies such as NetSuite and SuccessFactors, another “software-as-a-service” company that has filed for an IPO, appear worse on paper than traditional software companies, at least in their early days.The stable, recurring revenues that companies such as this can look forward to make them a more attractive investment than the early returns suggest, says Tom Blaisdell, a director of HireRight, a similar company that went public last week despite wider market upheaval.For tech hopefuls unable to show a strong business case, there is an option with echoes of the 1990s: latch onto the latest fad likely to resonate on Wall Street. “Calling yourself a search engine carries some appeal,” Mr Sterling says.
880;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-08-21T19:24:03Z;SOA and the FT Tech Hype Index;;"There’s a natural cycle in the corporate tech business. Suppliers come up with the latest Big Idea. PR departments promote the heck out of it. Tech journalists, always on the lookout for some shiny new thing, rush to write about it. Sometimes, customers even buy it. Within a couple of years the spotlight moves on to the next Big Idea – and noone stops to ask too much about the ideas that flopped.""Service-oriented architecture"" has been climbing this hype curve for some time. Yet the platforms on which SOA are meant to be built – such as those from Oracle and SAP – are still years from completion. Early adoption rates are very low. This may end up being the new architecture of the software business, but somehow these things have a way of mutating. Few customers bet big on a whole new architecture. In time, the idea is revised and adapted, a new label is found. The PR departments come up with a different slogan.A good mark of the hype is the number of mentions that a new technology gets in the media. The chart below shows a 12-month count of the press mentions of SOA (from the Factiva database of media sources.) For a comparison, look at what happened to another Big Idea that fizzled – utility computing. Turns out companies weren’t really ready for that one after all."
881;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-08-05T21:08:23Z;DFJ to acquire stake in Esprit Capital;;"Draper Fisher Jurvetson, one of Silicon Valley’s best-known venture capitalists, will signal on Monday the further globalisation of the venture capital industry through the acquisition of a stake in Esprit Capital Partners, the UK technology investment firm.In one of the first deals of its type, DFJ has taken a minority stake in Esprit, which was formed by last year’s merger of Cazenove Private Equity and Prelude Ventures to create one of Europe’s biggest technology-focused VC firms. The London and Cambridge-based firm has $500m of capital under management.The US firm is best known for its investments in companies such as Skype, the fast-growing internet telephony group; Baidu, the Chinese search engine that floated two years ago; and Hotmail, the e-mail application acquired by Microsoft.The deal underlines the trend for US-based venture capitalists to expand overseas either by forging partnerships with local firms or hiring a team on the ground. But it is the first time a US firm has directly acquired a stake in a European rival.DFJ was one of the first Silicon Valley venture capitalists to break free from the US industry’s domestic fixation when it opened offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and Singapore in 1999.Since then, more US funds have moved overseas as the huge amounts of money pouring into venture capitalists increased competition for the best deals, while stricter Sarbanes-Oxley laws made it harder to realise their investments.Sequoia Capital, known for investing in Google, YouTube and Oracle, has offices in India, China and Israel. Highland Capital, the Boston-based venture capital firm, is opening offices in Geneva and Shanghai this year.The Esprit deal allows DFJ to recreate the London link it lost five years ago when it split with DFJ ePlanet, its London-based overseas investment fund.John Fisher and Don Wood, two of DFJ’s managing directors, will join the investment committee of Esprit, which will be renamed DFJ Esprit and become the US firm’s exclusive partner in Europe.Mr Wood said: “We see innovation all over the world. We don’t just want to sit here in Silicon Valley, only making investments in companies we can drive to.”He said the 120 partners making up DFJ’s network of venture capital firms all shared some of their carried interest on investments. “This glues the network together,” he said.Simon Cook, chief executive of Esprit, said he was attracted to DFJ by the fact that it allowed his company to keep control of its investment decisions in London.The new company is expected to raise a fresh fund in the next year as its last fund, Esprit Capital 1, closed to investors seven years ago after raising £234m of capital."
882;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-07-22T21:01:20Z;Office chief explores new windows of opportunity;;"Mature cyclical product, or one of the main catalysts for the next leg of growth at the world’s biggest software company?To many, the Office suite of PC software applications has become a mundane part of working life. But to Jeff Raikes, head of Microsoft’s business software and server divisions, it is the starting point for a wave of software that will launch the company into new markets.He has pushed this vision since taking over the division six years ago: Office as the front door through which “information workers” will one day access a far wider range of the tools needed to do their jobs, from tapping into the core business applications that support their companies’ operations to holding conference calls with colleagues over their computers.Now with businesses that represent 58 per cent of Microsoft’s revenues reporting to him, Mr Raikes is in a position to try to prove that he can stitch together the software pieces to make it work.It is a grand scheme that is still in its early stages. David Smith, an analyst at Gartner, says that using Office as a platform to support other businesses is a strategy that is only “just getting off the ground” at Microsoft, and is an idea that has brought mixed success in the past.Also, some early moves have taken longer than expected to bear fruit. In business applications, a market where it is taking on SAP and Oracle, Microsoft has been slow to make a mark.“We have learned some things,” concedes Mr Raikes. “I thought small and
medium-sized companies would probably change their [enterprise] software faster because of the internet than, perhaps, what they did.”Despite that, analysts generally credit Microsoft with success in some parts of its vision, as well as in finding ways to refresh the basic Office software to continue to drive sales. The latest version, launched earlier this year, contributed to a 19 per cent jump in revenues from the business division in the most recent quarter, to $4.6bn.The best indication that the wider Office vision is gaining ground has been the success of SharePoint, a piece of server software first launched in 2001 that is integrated with Office. SharePoint has been steadily expanded to include document management, enterprise portal, search and other functions needed to
let workers in the same company collaborate more
easily.Mr Raikes compares the SharePoint strategy to the one behind Office itself: combining a set of tightly linked capabilities in one steadily expanding product. With 233 per cent growth over the past year, SharePoint has become one of Microsoft’s hottest new products for business customers.Ultimate success, however, will depend on two things. One is whether Mr Raikes can sell a broader set of applications to run on the foundation of Office, SharePoint and Exchange, the company’s e-mail and messaging server. Along with business applications and business intelligence, this includes workplace communications – a market which the Microsoft executive predicts is about to go through upheaval.Mr Raikes compares it to what happened in computing in the 1990s, when a vertically integrated industry moved to a horizontal structure based on standardised hardware and a new software platform.Thanks to the enabling technology of IP, the communications market is ripe for a similar change, he says.The other test for Mr Raikes will be whether he can manage the shift towards a new business and delivery model in the corporate software business, one that relies on internet-based delivery of services.His response: for all the attention given to companies such as Google and Salesforce.com, the corporate software business is not about to be revolutionised overnight. “We’re probably moving a lot faster than people realise, and …the market isn’t moving as fast as some of the competitors would like to make people perceive,” he says."
883;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;SAP confident over legal dispute with Oracle;;"SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, said it did not expect to pay large sums in the course of a legal dispute with US rival Oracle, which accuses the German company of corporate theft.Henning Kagermann, SAP chief executive, told the Financial Times on Thursday: “SAP reckons it won’t have to cope with a significant burden,” even after admitting a US subsidiary made “inappropriate downloads”, one of 150 charges filed by Oracle.Mr Kagermann’s comments came as SAP’s performance in the second quarter of the year suggested it has regained its footing after a jittery turn of the year. Investors cheered yesterday’s better-than-expected numbers and sent the group’s stock higher.After twice missing performance targets last year, SAP further rattled investors at the start of 2007 when it said it would take €400m ($552m) out of profits over two years to invest in a new class of software to attract small companies.However, in April, May and June, strong economic growth in Europe drove a sharp rise in software-licence sales to €715m; 18 per cent more than in the same period last year and an important indicator of future services revenue.Operating income rose 10 per cent to €556m and total sales increased at the same rate to reach €2.4bn. Software and services revenue rose 16 per cent to €1.7bn, with SAP repeating it expected a 12-14 per cent gain in the full year.Mr Kagermann said software launched last year was attracting an increasing number of customers. A web-based product for small companies – to be hosted on SAP computers – was on schedule to be launched next year. The company’s stock was €2.29 or 6.06 per cent higher at €40.065 per cent in Frankfurt, back around the €40-€45 per share level seen before investors were disappointed in the second half of last year.The German company emphasised how relaxed it remains about the suit filed by Oracle. The suit alleges SAP’s US subsidiary, Tomorrow Now, stole intellectual property from Oracle servers “on a grand scale”. Mr Kagermann said SAP was not making “materially relevant” provisions to cover potential costs from a suit. “There’s a [pre-trial] hearing in September and we look forward to hearing a third opinion from a judge.”SAP has dismissed two Tomorrow Now employees and it has suspended one manager in regard to the downloads. Mr Kagermann said the downloads had breached in-house rules. “But we don’t think any substantial damage was done” to Oracle, he added.Although he described himself as confident in regard to SAP’s case relating to the other charges, Mr Kagermann said he was also a “pragmatist” who would decide whether to pursue proceedings or to settle “depending on what is best for SAP”."

On Thursday the Swiss drugmaker put its managers where its mouth has been, promoting diagnostics chief Severin Schwan to replace Franz Humer as chief executive of the whole company.Mr Schwan’s most recent task has been to pursue the $3bn hostile takeover of Ventana, the US diagnostics specialist. If the bid comes off, Roche will have taken another big step down the road to transforming itself from a lumbering big pharma company, with a pipeline of new drugs that is running dry, into an innovative group, spanning drug discovery through to diagnostic testing.Putting Mr Schwan in charge of the whole group, in spite of the relative underperformance of the diagnostics division, is a powerful signal that Roche plans to go all out to harness that breadth of expertise and pinpoint the right drugs for the right patients.He has a hard act to follow. Although Mr Humer’s dual role as chairman and chief executive had fallen horribly out of fashion, he is widely admired for building a company that is the envy of many in the drugs business.He made the most of his predecessor’s $2.1bn purchase of Genentech 17 years ago, by realising that arms-length management was the best way to nurture the biotech company’s entrepreneurial spirit.Mr Schwan’s challenge will be to secure Ventana and tap all the possible synergies. There are obvious ones – the US company has a test to identify women who will respond best to Roche’s key breast cancer drug Herceptin, for example.But there are also vast opportunities to research and develop new drugs and tests in tandem.If he can crack personalised medicine, Roche will be able to pioneer more effective drugs and charge more for them – and its 7.5 per cent share price outperformance of its European peers over the past year can only accelerate.Bury the hatchetSAP v Oracle is one of the great mud-slinging matches in business.But, before the latest round of this perennial fixture between the software-makers gets fully under way, all involved should take a moment to reflect that it might be better to let it end in less of a bang than a whimper.This spring, Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison took the struggle to new heights when he filed suit before a US federal court accusing SAP of “corporate theft on a grand scale” via a US subsidiary that helps Oracle customers while coaxing them to buy SAP.With his usual low-key confidence that so riles Oracle, SAP chairman Henning Kagermann blithely dismissed the charges. But, to his rival’s delight, he soon had to recant after it turned out staff had downloaded things “inappropriately”.One-nil to Mr Ellison. Interpreting SAP’s mea culpa on one count of 150 as an admission of the main charge, Mr Ellison now seems set on pursuing satisfaction before the courts rather than working out some agreement with SAP beforehand.Mr Kagermann, for his part, does not appear to be doing anything to change his opponent’s tactics. Huffily, he says he is looking forward to a first hearing before a judge in September, implying that he reckons the charges could yet founder.Given his admission that some – though by no means all – things did go awry, this might be mere wishful thinking. It is time for him to approach Mr Ellison to stop the lurch into endless legal wrangles.Drinking upOut with the hooch and in with the Heineken.The Dutch brewer has just doubled its projected profit growth for the year after witnessing a boom in first-half sales to Asia.It is tempting to make the link between the two. But the truth is probably more prosaic, with profit-wringing really driven by cost-cutting in developed countries.Sales might be booming in China, as drinkers give up on rice wine and go upmarket but, without a dominant market share, this is low-margin business. Heineken has found big profits in other developing countries – in Nigeria, for example, where it accounts for four out of every five sales.But overall, emerging markets still account for only a third of Heineken’s profits – tiny compared with the two-thirds that InBev can boast and SABMiller’s share of nigh-on 90 per cent. With developing economies virtually the only source of growth for the industry, the Dutch brewer could appear vulnerable.Except that it is looking pretty strong in the US – also an emerging market of sorts, with wealthier consumers tending to trade up from weak local brews to cooler European brands.As that trend hits homegrown operators such as Anheuser-Busch, it isn’t entirely fanciful to imagine the US group inviting the controlling Heineken family round for drinks and takeover talks.
885;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Global temptations test Macquarie’s Australian resolve;;Legitimate grumbles about executive pay aside, Macquarie Bank’s track record of 15 years of uninterrupted profit growth is striking when judged alongside any of the world’s high-flying investment banks.It has certainly gained from the more than decade-long boom in its home market of Australia, but the performance of its international operations – where net income grew 70 per cent in its last fiscal year – is now central to its future.The case can easily be made that Macquarie has outgrown its domestic market. With that in mind, it is no coincidence that Macquarie on Thursday reiterated its pledge to remain headquartered in Australia. But the subject will remain near the top of the board’s agenda and ambitious senior executives are also likely to push the issue. Its decision earlier this year to apply for a UK banking licence has led some to speculate that it might one day move not only its head office but also its primary listing to London.From a regulatory point of view, London has advantages. Although it has served its shareholders remarkably well, Macquarie remains a risky play for any investor. It is exposed to the racier parts of the world’s capital markets, and vulnerable to volatility in the recently rattled world of leveraged loans. M&A and IPOs, meanwhile, are hardly for the faint-hearted. A large chunk of earnings come from performance fees, which can fluctuate widely, and that too might spook more risk-conscious investors.Still, it is tough to argue with the board’s “hopeful” view of yet another record year. To help keep its record intact, Macquarie may need to further its global ambitions.Time to make upSAP v Oracle is one of business’s great mud-slinging matches.

887;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-07-09T18:33:22Z;Observer: Thinking about UBS after Ospel;;"Last week’s shenanigans at UBS have opened an encyclopaedia of opinions about who might be the bank’s next chairman, should Marcel Ospel ever resign. The spin doctors would have us believe the wily ex-trader wanted to make way for a younger man, only to be overruled by his fellow board members clamouring for him to stay.The real world reckons Ospel, still only 57, recently remarried and in fine fettle, got increasingly cold feet about stepping aside. Add to that the recent questions about successor-designate Peter Wuffli’s skills and the ambitions of Marcel Rohner – Wuffli’s own planned successor as chief executive – and the dauphin’s fate was sealed.But Wuffli’s abrupt ouster and Rohner’s relative youth leave a yawning gap at the top. Ospel stressed in weekend interviews that the board had asked him to soldier on for at least another three years – suggesting he might be inclined to stay for ever.Failing immortality, however, he will have to make way eventually. The board’s decision that the bank’s CEO should not automatically become chairman rules out Rohner, who has yet to be fully tested anyway.So the most likely successor – or challenger – could come from the board’s own ranks. Step forward Sergio Marchionne, Fiat chief executive and professional hard nut. Marchionne conveniently has both finance and operational skills, as well as a fistful of experience running big Swiss companies. Definitely one to watch.Congestion ahead?Michael Bloomberg could never be accused of falling prey to “not invented here” syndrome. New York’s mayor has liberally borrowed ideas from London – most notably its congestion pricing scheme. Bloomberg announced a plan to create a congestion pricing zone, modelled on the one introduced by Ken Livingstone, London’s mayor, as part of a broader initiative to make the city more eco-friendly.Now it appears New York is preparing to borrow another idea: a 3,000-camera surveillance system around the Wall Street area that is modelled on London’s “ring of steel”. The New York Times reported on Monday that the city’s police department has secured some of the funding it needs to build a network of cameras and roadblocks better to protect Wall Street from terrorists.Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s push to introduce congestion pricing in Manhattan appears to be facing some stiff political opposition from leaders of New York’s state government. Bloomberg has won the support of Eliot Spitzer, New York’s governor, but powerful lawmakers are showing tepid levels of support, at best.If Bloomberg is thwarted on congestion pricing, as some believe is looking increasingly likely, it will mar what has been a happy streak for the billionaire mayor. He has been getting a lot of good press lately – he shared the cover of Time magazine with Arnold Schwarzenegger last month – and pundits are taking his potential candidacy for US president seriously.There is not much chance that a defeat on congestion pricing would hurt Bloomberg’s burgeoning national profile. Unless, of course, car-crazy Americans learn that Bloomberg wanted to charge a fee for drivers to encourage use of mass transportation.Golden touchSome eyebrows have been raised by the announcement that NetSuite, a software company, plans an initial public offering while apparently leaving Larry Ellison, Oracle’s multibillionaire chief executive, in firm control.Ellison, who is worth an estimated $21.5bn, controls 61 per cent of the company while his two children, David and Margaret, own another
13 per cent in trusts. They will retain a majority stake after the sale of about 10 per cent of NetSuite’s shares in the long-awaited IPO, according to a recent regulatory filing.The planned sale – which will be conducted on the basis of a Google-esque “Dutch auction” – values the Ellison stake at more than half a billion dollars. But Ellison’s control of NetSuite has prompted some to question if he will have a conflict of interest. Oracle and NetSuite are potential rivals.Evan Goldberg, a former senior software engineer at Oracle, persuaded Ellison to bankroll NetSuite when it was founded in 1998.This is not the first time that Ellison has hit gold by backing a former Oracle executive. Ellison helped Marc Benioff, a former Oracle salesman, start Salesforce.com – the top online customer relationship software company – at about the same time. Ellison continues to own about 4.5m shares in Salesforce.com, worth about $200m.Sleep is for mortalsWith the world awaiting the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor and next spurt of stop-start denuclearisation talks, now is not the time for North Korea to be napping.Certainly, Kim Jong-il is burning the midnight oil. Amid persistent rumours about the state of the Dear Leader’s health, North Korea’s state mouthpiece newspaper reports that Kim is in the habit of working through the night.“Staying up all night is my habit,” the famously idiosyncratic dictator was quoted as saying during a pre-dawn phone call to a sleeping comrade, who apparently responded: “General, 4am has already passed. How could you stay up all night again? Please take a break for a while.”But for the bouffanted Kim, constant working is nothing. After all, this is a leader who apparently hit a hole in one the first time he played golf, writes operas in his spare time and can make flowers bloom just by showing up at a garden."
888;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-07-03T21:09:25Z;SAP backtracks in Oracle suit;;German software maker SAP on Tuesday signalled it could seek an out-of-court settlement with Oracle after admitting a subsidiary made “inappropriate downloads” of its US rival’s software.However, the German group again denied charges of corporate theft and said computer firewalls had prevented SAP having sight of any information gleaned by employees at the subsidiary, TomorrowNow.Oracle filed a suit in the US in late March accusing SAP of stealing its intellectual property on a “grand scale” through TomorrowNow, a unit that services Oracle programmes.The US group’s move intensified the often rancorous rivalry between the two companies, which are battling each other and newer entrants including Microsoft and Salesforce.com for a share of the business-software market. SAP is the world’s biggest maker of programmes to control inventories or manage client relations.Henning Kagermann, SAP chief executive, denied all charges when the suit was filed and firmly rejected the idea of settling with Oracle out of court. But he said yesterday that an internal probe had revealed that at least one of Oracle’s 150 allegations was justified.Employees at TomorrowNow had, in a number of cases, “downloaded support material for customers they were not allowed to download”, Mr Kagermann said. “The clear procedures in place were apparently not followed in all cases.”Mr Kagermann told the Financial Times he would no longer rule out seeking a settlement out of court, conceding his previous rejection of such a move had been “based on the assumption that no point [in Oracle’s legal filing] was valid”.He left open the question of whether SAP would make a provision for potential litigation costs. He said SAP had not done so in the first quarter but would “obviously evaluate” the situation before publishing second-quarter figures on July 19.Noting the discovery of wrongdoing was “by definition not helpful” to SAP’s case, Mr Kagermann said. Mark White, the company’s US chief operating officer, had been put in charge of TomorrowNow and of efforts to find out who had breached company rules.SAP said the US Department of Justice had requested documents from SAP and TomorrowNow. But the company said it had no evidence Washington was considering parallel legal action.

That pushed the benchmark’s gain so far this year to 9.5 per cent, matching 2006’s total rise.The Nasdaq 100 index is higher by 11.9 per cent in 2007 and leads the major US benchmarks.While the Nasdaq was at fresh highs for 2007 on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain below their record closes made in early June.Against the backdrop of higher interest rates in recent months, growth stocks have started to outperform value stocks and that has been a plus for technology shares, traders say.A number of technology stocks were in news on Tuesday ahead of the July 4 holiday. UBS upgraded Business Objects to “buy” from “neutral” and shares in the business software maker rose 2.2 per cent to $40.32.Marvell Technology was up 1.9 per cent at $18.42, on news that it makes the Wi-Fi chip that enables the iPhone to connect wirelessly to the internet.Apple rose 4.9 per cent to $127.17 and Goldman Sachs said the company had sold at least 700,000 iPhones. Analysts believe the high-end iPhone model could provide profit margins of at least 55 per cent for Apple.Intel closed up 1.3 per cent at $24.59, and set a 52-week high of $24.60.Juniper Networks rallied 2.6 per cent to $26.47.Oracle shares rose 0.8 per cent to $20.07 and closed at a 52-week high. SAP, the German software company, said a division that provides support for business software applications made “inappropriate” downloads from Oracle’s web site.On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,524.87. Among leading sectors, energy, technology and financials led gains. Utilities were lower as the yield on the 10-year bond rose back above 5 per cent.Consumer discretionary stocks were also lower after pending home sales fell 3.5 per cent in May, their lowest level since September 2001. Consumer staples stocks also languished as analysts expect lower retail sales in general.Dividends were in the news after Standard & Poor’s reported a 7.2 per cent decline in the number of companies increasing their payments to shareholders during the second quarter of 2007, versus the second quarter of 2006.“The decline in dividend increases is disturbing, especially in light of continued, moderate earnings growth and the abundance of corporate cash,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. “We believe the present wave of corporate buy-backs is contributing to the slower pace of dividend growth in 2007.”In deal news on Tuesday, Kraft made a $7.2bn bid for the global biscuit business of France’s Danone. Kraft lost 2.5 per cent to $34.66.Shares in Wendy’s rose 2.7 per cent to $38.39. Activist investor Nelson Peltz said in a regulatory filing that Triarc, his investment firm, is a “natural strategic buyer” for the burger chain. Mr Peltz’s Trian Fund owns 9.8 per cent of Wendy’s. Triarc fell 1.6 per cent to $15.75.Meanwhile, Teck Cominco, a Canadian miner agreed to buy Aur Resources, a copper miner for some $3.9bn in cash and stock. Shares in Teck fell 3.2 per cent to $432.06.On Tuesday, the Dow rallied 0.3 per cent to 13,577.30.Weighing on blue chips was Caterpillar, down 3.1 per cent at $77.99. The maker of construction equipment was downgraded from “neutral” to “reduce” at UBS. The bank also cut its price target from $78 to $70 amid concern that Caterpillar faces decelerating revenues in its core businesses. So far this year, Caterpillar has risen 27.2 per cent and been one of the leading stocks in the Dow. An upgrade for Avon Products sent its stock up 2.8 per cent to $37.79.Dendreon, a biotech company, rallied 6.5 per cent to $7.70, amid recent hefty call buying in its July $7.50 and July $10 options. Traders expect a positive announcement about its prostate cancer drug.Carmakers were in the news with General Motors down 0.1 per cent at $37.98. GM was set to release its June sales figures later in the day.Shares in Ford slid 2.3 per cent to $9.42. The company said it would pay a premium to holders of its five-year bonds, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $1.47bn.The plan will result in a third-quarter pretax charge of $1.47bn. Ford also reported a 8.1 per cent decline in June sales.
890;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-07-02T22:43:46Z;NetSuite highlights tech resurrection;;NetSuite, a business software company controlled by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, registered to go public on Monday in the latest sign that lossmaking technology companies are again turning to public markets for capital.The company, founded in 1998, is part of a new generation of software companies that sell their products “on-demand”, charging a subscription for delivering the application as a service over the internet. While Salesforce.com and RightNow, among the first proponents of this new approach, went public three years ago, it is only in recent months that Wall Street’s appetite for technology stocks has revived.Mr Ellison owns 61 per cent of NetSuite’s shares, potentially adding hundreds of millions of dollars to his net worth after an initial public offering – though that is dwarfed by his Oracle stake, which is worth nearly $25bn.NetSuite lost $23m last year as its revenues grew 86 per cent to $67m. The business model of on-demand companies means that they reach profitability later than traditional software rivals, since their contracts are spread out over a number of years while marketing costs have to be recorded upfront. Once profitable, though, they stand to benefit from a steadier stream of subscription income.The return of technology and communications companies was one of the highlights of the IPO market in the first six months of this year, according to Renaissance Capital. Some 28 per cent of new public companies came from these sectors, it added.The moderate revival, though still far short of the IPO boom at the turn of the decade, comes in spite of widespread complaints in Silicon Valley that over-regulation in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has made it hard for young tech companies to go public.Aruba Networks, a networking equipment company, has been one of the best-performing IPOs of the year, even though the company has yet to record a profit.Salesforce.com, which has emerged as the leader of the new on-demand companies and registered a narrow profit last year, is valued at ten times its 2006 revenues, while the slower-growing RightNow trades at five times revenues.

Leading sectors included, energy stocks, boosted by a renewed rise in oil prices, technology and utilities.Financials reversed early losses and shares in Bear Stearns rose 2.8 per cent to $143.31. The bank has been the focus of worries that troubles in the subprime mortgage market could hurt Wall Street.Late on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had initiated a broad-based investigation into the troubled subprime mortgage market.“We have seen a lot of volatility in the market, exacerbated by the subprime fallout,” said Richard Sparks, senior equity options trader at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “The market seems to believe it is contained and not a major problem.”Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index experienced a wild ride. After a rise towards 19 early in the day, a level not seen since the start of March, Vix subsequently tumbled 17.9 per cent to 15.51 late on Wednesday.As stocks recovered ground during the day, home builders and real estate stocks also rallied after experiencing compelling weakness in recent days.Technology stocks led broad market gains and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 2,605.35, boosted in part by Oracle’s better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results. Semiconductor stocks rallied 2.2 per cent.Blue chips, lagged overall gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.7 per cent at 13,427.73.Downbeat economic news was a source of worry for stock investors early on Wednesday. Durable goods orders fell 2.8 per cent in May, greater than the expected 0.8 per cent decline and non-defence capital goods also slid sharply.Meanwhile orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, fell 3.0 per cent, reversing the 2.3 per cent rise in April. Year-on-year, orders for what is a barometer of business spending were lower by 1.4 per cent.The data pulled bond yields lower, and boosted the expectation of rate cuts later this year and for 2008. Worries still prevail that the weak housing market will hurt the overall economy.“Housing is a long, slow sore that will not heal anytime soon,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading. “The issue is what will be the spillover effects for consumption and it’s too early to say at this point.” For now, stocks are stuck in a range, said Mr Strazzullo.Anxiety among investors was also heightened after US Foodservice said it would postpone the financing of its $7.1bn buy-out by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts due to weak market conditions.Underwriters pulled a $1.5bn bond offering that was to be used to finance the purchase of the company from Royal Ahold by the two private equity firms – suggesting that ongoing trouble in the debt markets could damp the recent rush of buy-out deals.In spite of that concern two deals were announced on Wednesday.Guitar Center said its board accepted a $1.9bn cash buy-out offer from a private equity firm. Shares in the music retailer soared 19.8 per cent to $59.98.Meanwhile, People’s United Financial, the banking firm, agreed to buy the New England-based Chittenden Corporation for $1.9 bn in cash and stock. Chittenden shares rose 24.5 per cent to $35.15, while People’s United Financial fell 2.9 per cent to $18.17.Among stocks in the news on Wednesday, ConAgra Foods rose 4.5 per cent to $26.70 after a surge in its fiscal fourth quarter profit.Nike jumped 8.3 per cent to $58.29, after its said growth in the US and abroad had pushed profits up 32 cent in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period.Oracle reported a jump in quarterly profit late on Tuesday. The results beat the consensus forecast of analysts, and the company also issued a bullish outlook for the current quarter. Oracle shares rose 2.8 per cent to $19.69.Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp said that he expects his group’s acquisition of Dow Jones, whose shares fell 0.4 per cent at $58.56, will take place within the next two to three weeks or not at all. Mr Murdoch also said he did not intend to increase his bid of $5bn.Shares in Blackstone continued to slide, after the private equity firm listed at $31 a-share last Friday. The stock fell 2.7 per cent to $29.92, and is down 14.7 per cent so far this week.
892;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
893;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-06-26T22:24:26Z;Oracle boosted by stronger sales;;The growth in Oracle’s applications business, the area where it competes most directly with German rival SAP, slowed notably in recent months, according to quarterly figures released on Tuesday.However, stronger sales elsewhere helped the US software company top market forecasts for both revenues and earnings in the fourth and most important quarter of its fiscal year.Oracle, which has used a string of acquisitions to mount a challenge to SAP, reported new licence revenue of $726m from its applications arm, up 13 per cent from a year ago, helped in part by the recent purchase of Hyperion. Given the much higher growth rate earlier in its fiscal year, the latest application results are likely to come as a disappointment to Oracle investors, according to Bruce Richardson, analyst at AMR Research.Larry Ellison, chief executive, attributed the slowdown to “a very, very tough comparison” with the company’s performance in North America the year before. “It’s simply a matter of spectacular growth a year ago,” he said. Commenting on Oracle’s recent spate of acquisitions, Mr Ellison added: “I expect the pace to continue.”Safra Catz, president and chief financial officer, said Oracle’s forecast of revenue growth of between 18-21 per cent in the coming quarter, typically the slowest in Oracle’s fiscal year, showed its confidence in a new product cycle that was driving growth in its core database business. “We are really going on all cylinders,” she added.Overall, Oracle reported revenues of $5.8bn, up 20 per cent from a year before, though reported growth would have been a more moderate 16 per cent without foreign currency benefits. Net income rose 23 per cent to $1.6bn as Oracle boosted its margins.
894;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-06-26T21:56:27Z;Wall St slips as bulls lack conviction;;Blackstone, the recently listed private equity company slumped sharply and closed below its issue price on Tuesday, while the broad market again slipped in late trade.Blackstone fell 5.2 per cent to $30.75 after the stock listed at $31 a share and reached a high of $38 in its first day of trading last Friday.Late on Tuesday, the broad market turned negative as early gains on the back of lower oil prices and a pick up in deal activity subsided.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,492.89, down from a high of 1,506.12. Energy and materials stocks led losses, and financial stocks reversed early gains.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,574.16, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to close at 13,337.66.Amid worries over the US financial sector’s exposure to the troubled mortgage market, Bear Stearns rebounded 0.2 per cent to $139.35, after a 3.2 per cent fall on Monday. Its plan to lend $3.2bn to one of its struggling hedge funds has aroused fears that further problems in the mortgage market are likely to emerge.The stock was as low as $137 earlier in the day. It was lifted by the expectations among analysts that the bank might only have to provide half of the planned loan.After the closing bell, Bear confirmed that it would provide about $1.6 billion in secured financing to its High-Grade Structured Credit Fund after.”By providing this secured financing facility we believe we have helped stabilize and reduce uncertainty in the marketplace,” James Cayne, chief executive officer at Bear said in a statement.Bear’s stock rose 0.4 per cent to $139.89 in after-hours trade.The S&P financial sector fell 0.2 per cent yesterday, and that pushed losses for the year to 1.9 per cent. Financials are the only negative major industry group within the index for 2007.The American Stock Exchange Broker/Dealer index fell 0.1 per cent to 251.45 and remained below a record high of 267.69 set at the start of June.Two of its 12 members are sharply lower since the beginning of the year – Bear Stearns, down 14.4 per cent, and Merrill Lynch, off 9.3 per cent.One bright spot on Tuesday was utility stocks as some of them continued to attract buyers as long-term bond yields consolidated above 5 per cent.Allegheny Energy rose 2.1 per cent to $51.71 and Edison International gained 1.6 per cent to close at $54.70.Early in the day, the leading benchmarks extended opening gains despite the news that new home sales fell 1.6 per cent in May while consumer confidence fell in June to its weakest level since last August. For the past year, new-home sales were 15.8 per cent lower than their level in May 2006.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for home prices in 10 US cities fell 2.7 per cent from a year ago. It was the steepest decline since 1991.“Things are a little calmer today, the housing data was pretty much in line with expectations and the dip in confidence reflects higher energy prices,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is in a consolidation phase which is pretty typical for June.”Both the S&P and the Dow set record closes on June 4 and have subsequently struggled to sustain bullish traction.Mr Pado said that outlook should prevail unless recent lows in the S&P and the Dow – 1,488 and 13,251 respectively – are tested. “If we break through the lows, stop-loss selling will accelerate stocks to the downside.”The gloom over housing was highlighted early on Tuesday when Lennar, the home builder, reported it had swung to a second-quarter loss and warned it would likely post a loss in the third quarter. Shares fell 3.1 per cent to $37.55. The S&P homebuilder index decline of 2.5 per cent, extended its loss for the year to 27.6 per cent.In deal news, European suitors lined up for US companies. Basell, the Dutch chemical company, said it had agreed to buy Huntsman, the US chemical concern, for $6bn. Shares in Huntsman rose 28.1 per cent to $24.21.Roche, the Swiss drug maker, launched a hostile bid for Ventana Medical Systems, a tissue-based diagnostics specialist. Shares in Ventana surged 47.7 per cent to $76.43.Another mover on Tuesday was Google, which set a new record close of $530.26, up 0.5 per cent.Tiffany & Co, rose 0.3 per cent at $52.08. The fine jewellery retailer rose 4 per cent on Monday, amid speculation it could be a takeover target.Investors awaited whether the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones, will accept an editorial independence pact, agreed between the board of the company and Rupert Murdoch, that could facilitate News Corp’s $5bn bid for the company. Dow Jones rose 2.2 per cent to $58.77, while News Corp slipped 0.8 per cent to $23.31.In earnings news, Oracle said its fourth quarter earnings rose 23 per cent after the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock fell 1.6 per cent to $19.16 in regular trade. In post-market trade, Oracle rose 1 per cent at $19.36.
895;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-06-26T16:08:38Z;I-flex puts its faith in Oracle;;"For the founding team at i-flex, the Indian software company, things came full circle last month.The company’s management team, led by chairman and managing director Rajesh Hukku, took up parallel jobs running the new financial services unit of i-flex’s controlling shareholder, Oracle.It was the first time Mr Hukku and his team, including vice-chairman R Ravisankar, had worked directly for a multinational since they broke away from the former Citibank in the early 1990s and formed i-flex, one of the world’s largest sellers of banking software.“Obviously, the Oracle balance sheet is much bigger than the i-flex balance sheet,” says Mr Ravisankar, explaining the rationale for going with Oracle. “Therefore, the ability to grow the business through acquisitions becomes much faster through Oracle initiatives rather than just purely i-flex.”The move is part of an increasing investment interest by Oracle in i-flex, which is one of India’s most successful information technology companies, with revenue of $478m last year, up 39 per cent, and more than 280 banking customers in 100 countries.I-flex operates in an area considered to be the cream of the information technology industry – branded software products. Just as PC users recognise software such as Excel or Acrobat when they open their laptops, i-flex’s flagship product Flexcube is one of the main software packages used by financial institutions across the world.Branded software products remain only a small part of India’s IT and IT-enabled services sector. Of the sector’s total estimated revenue in the fiscal year ending in March of $31.3bn, excluding hardware, software products accounted for less than $6.5bn.I-Flex was originally formed in 1992 as Citibank Information Technology Industries Limited, or Citil, a unit of Citibank whose primary task was to serve banks in India.Citibank originally in-vested $400,000 in Citil for a 41 per cent stake and sold the remaining shares to employees and those from another Citibank unit. The unit developed Flexcube, which is now used across the financial services sector, from retail and investment banking to asset management and internet stockbroking.Mr Ravisankar says earlier banking systems took the basic customer account – in those days typically a savings account – as their core entity and tried to build around it.As banking became more complex, programmers were forced to write new software from scratch for every new product. As a result, the system became unwieldy, as did the customer experience.Launched in 1997-1998, Flexcube took the customer as the central entity of its system. It developed compatible software components for each new service or banking process, using the customer as the common thread linking them together.“Right from the design phase the system recognises that you can look at a customer relationship across the entire bank,” Mr Ravisankar says.“If a customer has a huge deposit with you and he’s one of your valued million-dollar customers and he has a credit card that becomes overdue in the credit card system, you don’t want to send him a rude letter saying I’m going to repossess your stuff without being aware that he’s one of your most valued customers,” says Mr RavisankarFlexcube also broke down financial processes into their common components. Calculating interest, for instance, is done for everything from bonds to deposits. So this can be made into an individual component ready to be slotted in when programmers are developing new software for a product.As Flexcube took off, Citil changed its name to i-flex Solutions. The company continued to expand quickly, forming a unit called Reveleus that offers software for risk analysis that, among other things, helps banks meet compliance standards under the Basel II capital adequacy rules.It began to amass acquisitions, culminating in last year’s purchase for $123m of US-based Mantas, a company specialising in software to detect, among other things, money-laundering.Two years ago, Citigroup sold its 41 per cent stake for $593m to Oracle. Mr Ravisankar says the Citigroup name was becoming an obstacle as i-flex began approaching the US group’s top-tier western rivals.“The Citigroup name getting replaced by Oracle, that is a big enabler for our
business and we’ve seen already the number of top-tier banks that have come onboard since then has been quite healthy,” says Mr Ravisankar.Oracle tried to buy up all of i-flex’s shares but ended up with about 82 per cent. In spite of this, it has begun pushing ahead with its plans to begin bundling i-flex’s offerings together with its other financial products.Oracle last week announced the first big initiative of this kind, under which Mr Hukku and Mr Ravisankar’s new “financial services global business unit” will be offering, as one package, Flexcube alongside a customer relations management system owned by Oracle.The shift by senior i-flex management to Oracle has prompted some to argue, however, that the Indian company has no future as a standalone entity.It is also facing increasing competition from formidable Indian outsourcing companies, notably Infosys Technologies, whose branded financial software is gaining traction in the market.Infosys and others are equally strong rivals in the war for scarce talent in India – an important concern for a mid-sized company such as i-flex, whose 8,500 employees are spread across the world.Mr Ravisankar denies, however, that i-flex is destined to disappear into Oracle. He points to its consulting business, under which i-flex is using its understanding of banking practices – developed through years of breaking down financial processes into their basic components – to help clients install the best systems.“We are offering a kind of a start-up kit consisting of proven best practice obtained from dealing with a huge range of financial institutions around the world,” he says. “We just launched it but we are getting a lot of interest in that.”"
896;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-05-30T09:30:10Z;What’s new: New blooms in the laptop jungle;;Spoilt for choice in the laptop jungle? Well, the choice just got harder with a clutch of new notebooks from Dell, including its long-awaited entry into the tablet PC market.Until now, Dell has distributed third-party tablet PCs. It hopes the launch of the Dell Latitude XT will expand the appeal of tablet PCs beyond their current niche of vertical markets.Other new laptops include an ultra-portable model, the Latitude D430, two Intel-based models, the Dell 630 and D830, and the AMD-based D531. Reflecting the IT industry’s growing green awareness, these notebooks can be configured to conform to the new stricter Energy Star 4.0 regulations.This time they are from Hewlett-Packard, which is blitzing the market with 16 models. If you can not take your home theatre on the road, how about the next best thing: a laptop with a 20-inch screen, the Pavilion HDX. Great for juggling monster spreadsheets – or watching Shrek III – but it costs almost $3,000 and weighs more than 15lb.More useful for road warriors is the ultra-thin HP Compaq 2710p which has a tablet screen you can write on and weighs 3.6lbs. Its keyboard has a built-in nightlight, so the dedicated can keep working when the rest of the aircraft cabin is asleep. Some of HP’s new notebooks use Intel’s latest Centrino Pro Mobile technology, which rival Dell has yet to employ.UK-based Autonomy has launched new software to track and trace forensically the lifecycle of every piece of data within an organisation. Based on Autonomy’s existing Intelligent Data Operating Layer (Idol) technology, the new module, called Idol Echo, is designed to help big business keep on top of increasingly tough compliance rules and regulations.For example, using Idol Echo, a company can track exactly who has heard, seen or forwarded an incriminating e-mail or voice mail.Oracle has announced a new release of its home-grown range of CRM software, thus confounding those who expected it to push existing users of Oracle E-Business Suite CRM on to the Siebel CRM platform (Oracle acquired Siebel, the CRM market leader, in 2005).Oracle E-Business Suite 12 CRM has a simplified user interface and streamlined CRM task flow, so processes such as placing an order can be completed without leaving the CRM application.Microsoft has given the world a preview of the next version of its popular database, SQL Server. The new product, code-named Katmai, is designed to “democratise” business intelligence (BI), making it easier to deploy BI data and applications throughout the enterprise. This is done through tighter integration with Microsoft front-end applications and SharePoint Server.The thinking behind Katmai is that any office worker should be able to access BI data using a familiar spreadsheet. Katmai will not be released commercially until 2008.Jaspersoft, an up-and-coming contender in the BI industry, has announced the latest release of its open-source BI software, Jaspersoft BI Suite version 2. Four new programs have been added to the Jaspersoft suite and it now supports a greater range of operating systems, including various Unix/Linux variants, Windows Vista and Windows 2000.It is available in French, German, Italian and Japanese, as well as English. Jaspersoft sells its products with conventional licences but an open-source edition can be downloaded free of charge.
897;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-05-17T21:57:28Z;IBM to switch focus to software division;;IBM embarked on another stage in its transformation on Thursday by pledging to derive half of its profits from software and double its revenues in emerging markets to $9bn by the end of the decade.The goals underline IBM’s strategy of moving further away from old-style hardware and decreasing its reliance on its large technology services arm by focusing on the high-margin market for corporate software.However, Sam Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the drive to boost profits in the software division would not put it on a collision course with the “big three” software groups: Microsoft, Oracle and SAP of Germany.“We are not going after the space they are in,” he said in an interview. “We are going after the thousand of other [companies] in this very fragmented software space.”Unlike its three major rivals, which have focused on creating vertically integrated “stacks” of software that operate at every level of a company’s system, IBM has focused on “middleware” that lies inside a corporate information technology system.IBM, whose software business is the second-largest in the world behind Microsoft’s, says that its strategy offers companies more flexibility in overhauling and adapting their legacy systems.The software division, which has been boosted by more than 50 acquisitions since Mr Palmisano took over in 2003, accounted for 40 per cent of IBM’s pre-tax profits of $13.3bn in 2006, up from 35 per cent in 2004.In a meeting with Wall Street analysts yesterday, Mr Palmisano said that strong growth in the middleware market made it likely that the software division would account for about half of IBM’s profit by 2010.The shift in the balance of earnings for IBM reflects its decision to abandon its origins by selling low-margin computers and printer businesses and move towards more profitable areas.“We made a conscious decision to go and seek where the value was,” Mr Palmisano said.He identified Brazil, Russia, China and India as a key source of revenue growth for IBM in the next few years.He said the “irresistible forces of globalisation” would help IBM double its revenues from emerging markets, which were $4.5bn in 2006, by 2010.The goal means IBM will have to increase emerging markets revenue at an average of 19 per cent a year between 2007 and 2010, faster than the 14-15 per cent over the past two years.IBM employs more than 53,000 people in India, and 10,000 each in China, Brazil, Russia and eastern Europe. It is expected to announce the opening of a third research and development centre in Beijing next month.IBM said it woud increase efforts to improve margins in IBM’s technology services business, which accounts for about half of its revenues and more than one-third of pre-tax profits, and continue to return cash to investors through share buybacks.IBM shares closed 0.5 per cent lower at $105.31 in New York trading.
898;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-05-16T20:36:48Z;Wall St rallies on billionaires’ bets;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Wednesday with trading influenced by a number of well-known investors revealing their latest purchases in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Early on Wednesday, stocks traded in a choppy fashion as a better-than-expected rise for industrial production in April was offset by news that building permits last month fell at their fastest pace since 1990.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was boosted by the disclosure that its constituents, Citigroup, and Johnson & Johnson were in favour among leading investors.The Dow closed up 0.8 p+er cent at 13,487.53, and set its 23rd record close for the year. The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,514.14 and edged closer to its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research said good earnings and guidance for the coming quarter should support stocks and that the S&P was building up to moving higher towards its 2000 record peak.Within the S&P, telecom, and financial stocks led the major sectors higher, while materials lagged.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that while all 10 major S&P sectors were still trading near their recent highs, “many seem to be rolling over a bit.”They said: “Financials, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and health care have all had slight declines after hitting overbought levels, and it will be key to see how they react to resistance levels.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,547.42, and shrugged off weakness among semiconductors stocks. Earnings and lower guidance from Applied Materials did weigh upon technology for much of on Wednesday and the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.2 per cent, following a slide of 1.1 per cent on Tuesday.Applied Materials, a chipmaker, reported better-than-expected earnings, but its guidance for sales disappointed investors. Its shares were down 3.1 per cent at $19.17.Meanwhile the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 0.7 per cent at 820.29 and rebounded from its lowest closing level in more than a month on Tuesday.A number of stocks were in the spotlight on Wednesday when Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment company, said it had invested in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, two railroads, and also bought stock in Wellpoint and raised its holding in Johnson & Johnson, two healthcare companies.Norfolk Southern rose 1.65 per cent to $56.79, Union Pacific gained 0.9 per cent to $119.39 and the S&P railroad index rallied 1.3 per cent, taking its gain for the year to 25.1 per cent.Wellpoint gained 1.6 per cent at $84.86, while Johnson & Johnson rallied 2 per cent to $63.05.Edward Lampert, the hedge fund manager, said late on Tuesday that he had purchased 15m shares of Citigroup. This prompted the shares to jump 4 per cent to $54.91. Analysts believe that the banking conglomerate could now become the next high-profile target for activist investors, given its underperforming share price in recent years. Such a move would show that even the biggest companies were not immune to activist pressure.Meanwhile, George Soros, another of the most famous hedge fund managers, said his stake in Microsoft had doubled, and the stock rose 0.55 per cent to $31.07. Mr Soros had lowered his holdings in Oracle, and shares were up 0.8 per cent at $18.99, while he had sold shares in Ebay, down 0.75 per cent at $33.25, and Take-Two Interactive, and shares in the video game maker slid 0.2 per cent at $19.08.Another big investor, Carl Icahn, a well-known activist, said he had purchased a large slice of Anadarko Petroleum, boosting its shares by 1.6 per cent to $47.20, and also bought shares in CSX, the railroad finished up 1.4 per cent at $46.40. Mr Icahn also disclosed that his stake in Time Warner, had been cut by nearly half. Its shares in the media group rallied 1.55 per cent to $21.60.In takeover news, Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash. Shares in the the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.8 per cent to $67.50.“We believe pressure on operating cash flow, as the company struggles to recapture lost market share, creates significant risks in terms of return on capital for an acquiring firm and we do not expect any higher offers,” said Robert Gold, medical devices analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.After the closing bell, Hewlett-Packard said second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year- earlier period. In after-hours trade, shares in the computer maker were 0.7 per cent lower at $44.86, after a rise of 1 per cent in regular trade.Shares in Amazon closed 4.4 per cent higher at $63.22, after the online retailer said it plans to launch a digital music store later this year and sell songs without copy protection restrictions.In earnings news, Compuware reported a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings and its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $10.67.Shares in Federated Department stores rose 1.2 per cent to $62.69 after its first-quarter profit rose more than 5 per cent, but missed analysts’ estimates.
899;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-05-15T00:41:59Z;Ex-Oracle VP accused of insider trading;;US regulators on Monday charged a former vice-president of Oracle with civil insider trading, saying he misused information about pending acquisitions gleaned by his wife, who was an assistant to Larry Ellison, the company’s chief executive.The Securities and Exchange Commission’s charges against Christopher Balkenhol mark the fourth time in a week that authorities have made information passing between husband and wife a part of insider trading charges.Mr Balkenhol has agreed to a settlement with the SEC in which he neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. He will return $97,222 in profits and pay penalties and interest of more than $101,000. No criminal charges were filed.The Oracle case represents something of a twist on spousal insider trading. In the other three cases, both spouses were allegedly part of the wrongdoing but this time the SEC did not allege Carolyn Balkenhol knew her husband of 12 years was misusing her inside information.Oracle would not say whether she still works for the company. Sarah Brody, the lawyer who represents the couple, could not be reached for comment.The SEC complaint, filed in federal court in California, said that in 2004 and 2005 Mr Balkenhol learnt from his wife that Oracle was in talks to acquire Siebel Systems and planned to make a tender offer for Retek Inc. He bought stock in both companies that he later sold at a substantial profit after the deals were announced.Three other spousal cases were in court last week, underscoring how the booming deal market has created opportunities for improper trading.Randi Collotta, a former Morgan Stanley compliance officer, pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiracy and fraud for passing on information about pending deals to her husband.A second Morgan Stanley analyst and her husband were arrested the same day on charges that he traded on information she stole from her employer.The SEC also sued a Hong Kong couple, alleging they traded ahead of News Corporation’s bid to purchase Dow Jones.The rise of two career couples has also complicated enforcement. “Now either one can be the one to hear of issues that may significantly affect share prices,” said Henry Hu, a University of Texas law professor.“It creates more opportunities than if the spouse had not been in the business world.”
900;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-05-04T17:54:17Z;Antitrust probe would focus on advertising impact;;Antitrust regulators in Washington would heavily scrutinise a potential bid by Microsoft for Yahoo, paying close attention to the impact the deal would have on the market’s internet advertisers, legal experts said on Friday.While few competition lawyers predicted the potential deal would be blocked, the combination of the second and third-largest internet search groups, which would have a combined market share in the US of about 38 per cent, would elicit a thorough investigation by the Justice Department. Unlike some transactions in which competition authorities examine the impact of a merger on consumers, a bid by Microsoft for Yahoo would be probed in a way similar to that of traditional television or radio deals, with a focus on the impact on opportunities for online advertisers.“There are a lot of ways into and around the internet and a lot of opportunities for advertisers,” said John Taladay, an antitrust lawyer at Howrey in Washington. “But these two companies would have just under 40 per cent of the market for search engines [in the US], which is perhaps the key source for advertisers to make initial impressions on consumers.”One senior antitrust lawyer said the Justice Department may be discouraged from attempting to block the deal because of Google’s dominance of the sector and the number of smaller players.The antitrust division of the Justice Department has under the Bush administration given the green light to a number of mega-mergers, including the takeover of BellSouth and AT&T by SBC. One notable exception was the DoJ’s failed attempt to block Oracle’s takeover of Peoplesoft.
901;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-04-29T18:17:32Z;Fighting dirty in bids;;In the idealised mergers and acquisitions market envisioned by financial theorists, companies assiduously sell themselves to the highest bidder in transparent auctions, during which the participants think only of shareholder value. In the real world, takeovers often turn into bare-knuckle bouts and the cold, hard truth is that it can pay to fight dirty.It is not yet clear whether ABN Amro’s initial stalling tactics and attempted pre-sale of LaSalle will ultimately result in a higher winning bid. But there is a proud tradition of unconventional defences achieving just that. At one end of the spectrum, there is Mannesmann, which in 1999 sought an injunction to prevent Goldman Sachs advising Vodafone, an action the presiding judge described as totally disgraceful. Yet Mannesmann’s dogged tactics ultimately elicited a final bid 73 per cent higher than Vodafone’s initial offer.In the US, PeopleSoft enacted a poison pill to try to fend off Oracle’s Larry Ellison, helping to secure a final price 59 per cent above the original offer. And this looks positively gentlemanly compared with Arcelor’s plan to deter Mittal Steel last year. It included handing control of a key asset to an autonomous Dutch trust and a proposed reverse takeover by Severstal, which would have left the company dominated by oligarch Alexei Mordashov. It paid off, though. Mittal’s winning offer was 44 per cent above its first shot.Why does fighting dirty sometimes work? Sometimes, the spectacle of dubious governance may encourage the target’s shareholders to redouble their support for the bidder. It is also striking that the examples cited earlier were all genuinely synergistic combinations. Perhaps by prolonging the auction period, target companies create time for the buyer’s investors to appreciate the deal’s industrial logic, and thus back a higher price. Still, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that basic psychology also plays a part – the more elusive the target, the more desirable it becomes.
902;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-04-27T07:53:28Z;Horn-Smith steps down at Sage;;Sir Julian Horn-Smith, the former deputy chief executive of the mobile phone giant Vodafone, on Friday stepped down unexpectedly as chairman of Sage, the UK’s largest software group, less than one year after his appointment, citing ”differences in culture and style”.His abrupt departure is a blow for the Newcastle-based group, with a market capitalisation of £3.4bn, which has been strongly acquisitive and has been seen as a potential target for leading players such as Microsoft, SAP and Oracle.Sir Julian, who had been part of Vodafone’s old guard instrumental in overseeing domestic and international expansion, became a director of Sage in February last year and stepped up to become its part-time non-executive chairman in August, just after he formally retired from Vodafone.He was already a non-executive director of Lloyds TSB, and has since been appointed a senior adviser to UBS and a member of the international advisory board to Altimo, the telecoms arm of Alfa of Russia, among other commitments.Tony Hobson, a non-executive director at Sage, will become acting chairman with immediate effect, while the company prepares to hire headhunters to find a long-term replacement.Sir Julian said: ”Sage is a truly outstanding company and it is with great regret that I have decided to leave. After careful consideration the board agreed that the differences in style and culture meant that change was necessary. I felt that the best solution was for me to stand down as chairman”Sage stressed ”there is absolutely no fall out, difference in strategy or over the future of the business.”The group reported pre-tax profits up 14 per cent to £221m last year on sales up 22 per cent to £936m. The shares added ¼p at 263¾p.
903;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-04-23T14:27:45Z;SAP boosted by strong sales growth in the US;;SAP, the world’s biggest maker of software for business, took a first step to restoring investor confidence by announcing strong growth in the first quarter of the year while pledging to face down a lawsuit from a rival.The stock traded 2.5 per cent higher at €37 per share late on Friday after the German company said sales of software and related services hit €1.52bn early 2007, a 15 per cent rise when adjusted for currency effects.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said strong sales growth in the US helped push SAP’s market share to 25.1 per cent, up 0.6 points from late last year, and again vowed to raise software sales by 12-14 per cent 2007.The Walldorf-based group that started with programmes to help big businesses manage inventories or customer details twice last year missed quarterly growth targets, raising fears it was failing to lure smaller companies.SAP in February said profitability would suffer 2007 as it earmarked €400m over two years for a new web-based software service for small companies – a segment being contested by US rivals such as Oracle and Microsoft, too.The German company’s share price fell by more than one fifth from €42 at the start of the year, a slide compounded by a lawsuit filed by arch-rival Oracle alleging SAP had stolen software ideas from its computer systems.Mr Kagermann said SAP would “aggressively defend” itself against claims a subsidiary misused Oracle customer gateways. “We have no intention to settle,” he said when asked if SAP might see a quick resolution.At the same time, he brushed off the recent departure of chief software developer and possible successor, Shai Agassi. He noted US success was the work of sales boss Léo Apotheker, now deputy chief executive.Investors seemed so cheered by positive news and robust words from Walldorf that they appeared largely to forgive first effects of the investment programme for the “AS1” project announced two months ago.Building computer centres to “host” customer data took €20m off earnings last quarter, SAP said. Operating income still rose 6 per cent to €433m as total sales climbed 6.1 per cent to €2.2bn, just shy of forecasts.
904;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-04-04T21:02:42Z;EU blow to Microsoft on Windows;;Microsoft will be forced to hand over to rivals what the group claims is sensitive and valuable technical information about its Windows operating system for next to no compensation, according to a confidential document seen by the Financial Times.The group is required to license the technical information to competing groups under the terms of the European Commission’s antitrust ruling issued three years ago. Brussels hopes the order will allow rivals to design server software that runs more smoothly with Windows.The Commission last month accused Microsoft of demanding excessive royalties from licences.Microsoft wants up to 5.95 per cent of companies’ server revenues as a licence fee.But the confidential statement of objections from the Commission in the long-running dispute makes clear that Microsoft will at best be allowed to levy a tiny fraction of the royalties it is demanding.According to calculations by the Commission’s technical expert, Prof Neil Barrett, Microsoft’s demands would mean that rivals could recoup their development costs after seven years.The Commission’s expert, who was suggested for the post by Microsoft, goes on to calculate that even an average royalty rate of 1 per cent would be unacceptable for licensees. Prof Barrett states that a 0 per cent royaltywould be “better” and adds: “We can only conclude on this basis that the Microsoft-proposed royalties are prohibitively high […] and should be reduced in line with this analysis.”Three Microsoft rivals that have reviewed the group’s pricing scheme extensively – understood to be IBM, Sun and Oracle – come to the same conclusion: “The prices charged by Microsoft are prohibitive and would not allow them to develop products that would be viable from a business perspective,” the Commission charge sheet says.A spokesman for the US group said: “Microsoft will respond to the latest statement of objections in full by April 23. We believe we are in compliance with the March 2004 decision and that the terms on which we have made the protocols available are reasonable and non-discriminatory.”The Commission declined to comment.
905;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;SAP shares fall after research chief quits;;SAP shares fell to a near two-year low in the course of Thursday trading, after the world’s biggest maker of software for companies lost its star product developer and prepared for succession at the top of the group without him.The departure of 38-year-old technology head Shai Agassi extended a run of bad news, which includes missed targets in two recent quarters, investor doubts about a new product and a lawsuit from rival Oracle alleging theft.But the shares managed to make up early losses as investors seemed to realise the likely elevation of sales chief Léo Apotheker to sole chief executive in two years’ time might be no bad thing, given a vital new product launch.SAP stock fell as much as 2 per cent to €32.83 per share, near a closing low of €32.80 recorded on May 23 2005, but they rallied to close only 0.5 per cent lower. However, SAP was still the loser among German blue chip stocks.Hasso Plattner, SAP chairman, said Mr Agassi’s “personal career timeline” had jarred with SAP’s plan to make him and Mr Apotheker co-chief executives after the departure of Henning Kagermann in the spring of 2009.People who know SAP said the US-based ex-software entrepreneur was not willing to spend years in tandem with Mr Apotheker, an SAP veteran fifteen years his senior, before someday – maybe – taking sole control.Mr Agassi said he would concentrate on public policy issues such as the environment. But SAP will retain him as “special consultant” to Mr Plattner – a move clearly designed to stop Mr Agassi working for competitors.His departure also led to a reorganisation of SAP’s top management, with Mr Apotheker being named deputy chief executive and Mr Kagermann taking over research from Mr Agassi, who will leave on April 1.Although Mr Plattner refused to say whether Mr Apotheker would actually succeed Mr Kagermann, further organisational changes show the influence the new deputy chief executive will wield at SAP headquarters in Walldorf.Half of a new 10-member executive council will report directly to Mr Apotheker. One of these, Hans-Peter Klaey, is in charge of SAP’s efforts to sell to small companies after coming to dominate the big company sector.SAP says a key to success in this sector is a new internet service “hosted” on its computers but investors have balked at an investment of €400m ($534m) and worry about nimble rivals. Its shares have fallen 25 per cent in a year.
906;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-03-28T08:43:46Z;Stronger yen hits Tokyo shares;;Shares of heavy exporters fell in response to a stronger yen and fears about the US economy, depressing the Japanese market on Wednesday afternoon.At the close of trading, the Nikkei 225 was down 0.6 per cent at 17,254.73. The broader Topix fell 0.7 per cent to 1,711.06. By late afternoon, the yen was trading at Y117.3 to the dollar.Among export-focused sectors, electrical machinery declined 0.8 per cent and the auto sector slid 1.7 per cent.Sony, the consumer electronics and entertainment giant, fell 2.1 per cent to Y6,080. Nissan Motor declined 1.8 per cent to Y1,274. Honda Motor fell 2.4 per cent to Y4,100.The market was also pushed down by falls in high-dividend shares, although sharp rises in consumer finance stocks limited the market’s overall decline.Troubled consumer lender Orient leapt 16.8 per cent to Y160 after a report in the local Nikkei newspaper said that it will receive financial support from trading house Itochu and Mizuho Corporate Bank, part of the Mizuho Financial Group.Itochu, however, slipped 0.3 per cent to Y1,156, hit by export fears, and Mizuho Financial Group ended 2.2 per cent lower at Y751,000, in line with a general downward trend among banking stocks.The news about Orient pushed up other consumer finance companies in the recently battered sector. Aiful closed 5.4 per cent higher at Y3,500. Acom leapt 6.7 per cent to Y4,750.Oil companies gained from a further jump in crude prices. Inpex, Japan’s biggest upstream oil company, rose 2.3 per cent to Y994,000.But sectors with companies that pay high dividends continued to fall, following the passing of Monday’s entitlement deadline. Investors buying since then are not eligible to receive dividend payments for the financial year that ends Saturday. As a result, the electrical and gas sector fell 1.9 per cent and iron and steel declined 2 per cent. Chubu Electric Power dropped 3.7 per cent to Y4,130. Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest steelmaker, declined 2.1 per cent to Y855.Oracle Corporation Japan, part of US computer software company Oracle, jumped 3.3 per cent to Y5,640 after saying parent net profit in the nine months to February grew 23 per cent to Y15.27bn. It cited strong corporate investment in information technology.
907;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-03-24T00:01:00Z;Next big European tech story – MySQL?;;Those who complain that Europe doesn’t produce enough big and ambitious technology companies should look for a moment at MySQL, the open source database company, started by two Swedes and a Finn.This is one investors should be looking at in any case, as the company has started signalling plans for an IPO on the Nasdaq before the end of the year.MySQL is the unknown giant of the database world. It’s kept a low profile so far in the financial press, but is well known among the internet community. Most internet sites, in fact, are to some extent built on its technology.Because basic MySQL database code can be used for free, a lot of internet start-ups with small budgets used it to build their databases. Now some of these companies have grown into Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Neopets and the like, giving MySQL an enviable client list.Marten Mikos, chief executive, told me the company estimates it has 10m customers, putting it at the number three position in the database market behind Oracle and Microsoft. He believes the company recently overtook IBM’s D2 database division.According to Mr Mikos, the 10m-user estimate is extremely conservative. The company doesn’t know exactly how many users it has, but it does know that 25m copies of its product are requested every year. If customers use the software for say, seven years on average, that would be 175m users.What is the catch? Only one in a thousand users pay MySQL anything.The basic database tools are completely free. You only pay if you want some support from the company, or you want to build your own closed-source application on top of the MySQL code.Revenues were just E40m in 2006. They have grown exponentially from around E1.5m in 2001, but are still far short of Oracle’s $14.38bn in 2006.Within the next 10 years, the company is aiming to reach revenues of around $1bn, as the number of paying users grow.This will be against a generally declining database market, as more and more companies go for free, open-source software.Danny Rimer, the venture capitalist whose firm, Index Ventures is a backer of MySQL, said Mr Mikos’ initial pitch to him was both stark and breathtakingly ambitious.Sitting in a grubby Stockholm youth hostel, he told Mr Rimer: “The database market is currently worth about $9bn. We will shrink that to one third of its current size and take a third of the rest.”This is not a European company lacking ambition.It has some way to go, but Mr Rimer, known for his role as one of the earliest backers of Skype, believes him.

The rally pushed the benchmark index above its 30-day moving average, an encouraging technical sign for bulls.“What the market needed was for the Fed to show some flexibility in these troubling times, and they did just that,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The markets are starting to stabilise and put into perspective some of the concerns that led to the recent sell-off.”The S&P closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,436.11, its fifth successive day of gains that put it up 3.5 per cent on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent on Friday to 12,481.01.The recovery came as Blackstone, the buy-out group, prompted reflection on the recent private equity boom by filing for an initial public offering to raise $4bn.Energy stocks made the biggest gains this week, buoyed by both rising oil prices and broad strength in equities. The S&P Energy index stands at its highest point since December,

Motorola fell 2.5 per cent to $17.75.The troubles dragged down chipmakers, with Broadcom falling 5.3 per cent to $32.32. Palm also suffered losses. The fortunes of the maker of the Treo phone waxed and waned this week as rumours of an impending offer swirled round the market. Motorola was considered a potential buyer. Palm stock fell from a high of $19.45 to stand 1.5 per cent up on the week at $18.10.Vonage stock plunged 25.9 per cent to $3 on Friday after a judge blocked the company from infringing patents owned by Verizon when directing its customers’ internet telephone calls to landlines."
909;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-03-22T21:08:04Z;Oracle accuses SAP arm of theft;;The increasingly bitter war between Oracle and SAP spilled over into the courts on Thursday as the US maker of corporate software accused its arch-rival in Europe of “corporate theft on a grand scale”.The case, which levels the theft claim against a Texas-based arm of the German company, is the most aggressive tactic so far in Oracle’s acquisition-fuelled drive to beat back SAP’s push into its core markets in the US.SAP declined to comment on the lawsuit.“We’re still reviewing the matter,” it said. “It’s not SAP’s policy to comment on pending litigation.”The lawsuit accuses the German company of gaining “repeated and unauthorised” access to Oracle’s customer support database and downloading large volumes of software and other material.That material was then used by SAP in its effort to draw Oracle customers to its own products, according to the suit.Though stopping short of accusing SAP of actually copying its software in its own products, the Oracle lawsuit hits at a central part of its business.People close to SAP were dismissive of suggestions that it or any of its subisidiaries were involved in any wrongdoing. They said Oracle appeared unsettled by SAP’s competitive edge and was now resorting to unjustified legal means to try to hinder the German company.So-called “enterprise” software companies, which sell mainly to large companies and governments, make a large part of their money from selling annual support contracts, which earn them income long after a customer has bought a piece of software.By directly copying its support materials, Oracle claimed that SAP was depriving it of support revenue, while also making it easier to draw customers over to SAP products.People close to SAP said that its Texas-based subsidiary, Tomorrow Now, was thought to be the cause of Oracle’s court action.An independent company that was set up to offer cut-price software support to Oracle customers, it was bought by SAP early in 2005. The move was seen at the time as a direct challenge to Oracle’s business.Tomorrow Now sells SAP’s “Safe Passage” programme, which it uses to try encourage Oracle customers to switch to SAP products.“It looks like we hit a raw nerve there,” said one person familiar with Walldorf-based SAP, without giving reasons for this supposition.According to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in the northern district of California, SAP employees signed into its support database claiming to be Oracle customers, including Honeywell International and Merck.The access typically came just days before the customers’ support contracts expired and they switched to SAP for their support.Information downloaded from the Oracle servers went far beyond the software and support materials that the particular customers were authorised to use under their licence agreements, it added.The US company claimed to have traced 10,000 illicit downloads in the four months to January of this year, showing that SAP had been engaged in “sweeping” its database for information.
910;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-03-21T20:24:52Z;US stocks spike on Fed statement;;US stocks spiked higher on Wednesday as Wall Street cheered hints from the Federal Reserve that it was no longer biased towards further rate rises.The Fed left overnight interest rates unchanged but investors’ spirits were lifted by small changes in emphasis in the committee’s statement.“The Fed included economic growth alongside inflation as something that they would make an adjustment for,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market reacted positively because it opens the door to the Fed cutting rates if there are any signs of the economy slowing.”The S&P 500 Index jumped 1.7 per cent to close at 1,435.04, a return to positive territory for the year to date.Financial and utility groups, which are most sensitive to changes in interest rates, led the rally.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility nicknamed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, at one point fell below its opening level on February 27, the day that global equities plunged. The index closed down 8.1 per cent at 12.2.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite surged 1.4 per cent to 2,442.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 12,422.13.The statement from the Fed followed a series of strong earnings reports.Morgan Stanley was among the best performers after it reported a 70 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, a rise well in excess of analysts’ estimates. Shares in the bank rose 6.9 per cent to $81.33.Oracle shares, meanwhile, advanced 3.5 per cent to $18.17 after the software group reported robust growth across its range of products.Software group Adobe Systems rose 6.3 per cent to $43.30 on the back of better-than-expected profit.Shares in Motorola fell in electronic trading after the company said it expected to make a loss in the first quarter. Edward Zander, chief executive, described the performance of its mobile devices business as “unacceptable”. Shares in the mobile phone operator were 0.4 per cent lower at $18.74 in trading after the closing bell.The beleaguered subprime mortgage sector received a boost. Accredited Home Lenders jumped 11.05 per cent to $11.96 after Citadel, a big hedge fund, said it had bought a 4.5 per cent stake in the struggling company.Fremont General rose 16.1 per cent to $10.19 after the group said it was selling $4.4bn of subprime loans.Homebuilders were also resurgent as concerns about the housing market eased. DR Horton stock, which has suffered steep losses of late, gained 3.4 per cent to close at $23.63. Toll Brothers rose 3.6 per cent to $29.61.Dow component Alcoa fell 0.7 per cent to $33.85 after analysts at Prudential cut their rating on the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”, citing lower US demand for aluminium.FedEx stock slipped 1.2 per cent to $110.99 after the package delivery group said it may fall short of its 2008 growth target if the economy does not improve.JetBlue cut its earnings outlook for this year because of high fuel costs and potentially weaker demand. But shares in the group rose 2 per cent to $12.21.
911;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-03-20T23:00:39Z;Oracle shares surge as earnings soar;;Oracle bounced back to report robust growth across its range of database, middleware and applications software products in the latest quarter, shrugging off the softness in sales that was apparent recently at arch-rival SAP.Referring to the quarter as a “blockbuster” for Oracle, Safra Catz, chief financial officer, said: “It was really outstanding across all products, all geographies.”Shares in the US software company on Tuesday rose by more than 3 per cent after news of its third quarter earnings, which showed that the company had made up lost ground after lacklustre growth in some areas of its business in the previous three months.Aided by acquisitions, revenues climbed by 27 per cent to $4.4bn (£2.24bn), above Wall Street estimates of $4.3bn, with four percentage points of the growth reflecting the lower US dollar. Pro-forma earnings, excluding amortisation and stock options costs and the basis on which most analysts judge the company, rose by 31 per cent to 25 cents a share, ahead of the 23 cents that had been expected. Reported earnings rose 36 per cent to 20 cents a share.Database and middleware licence revenues rose by 17 per cent in the latest quarter, or 13 per cent excluding currency translation effects, to $967m. Meanwhile, licence revenues in the more volatile applications division jumped by 57 per cent, or 52 per cent in constant currency terms, to $423m.The performance in applications, which has been the focus of Oracle’s string of acquisitions, returned the company to the sort of strong growth shown in other recent quarters, before the second quarter fall-off.Excluding the effect of all acquisitions, including that of Siebel Systems, which was completed during the same period a year before, new applications licence revenues grew by 32 per cent in the latest quarter, said Ms Catz.That compares with underlying growth of just 1 per cent in the preceding three months, reflecting the typical unevenness seen in the business.Ms Catz said that the performance reflected broad demand from customers, rather than any particular big contracts that may have distorted quarterly comparisons. Oracle executives also claimed further market shares gains over SAP, which fell short of sales targets in its own most recent quarter.Oracle’s shares climbed more than 20 per cent over the past 12 months on signs that its acquisition spree is paying off, while SAP’s stock has fallen by 15 per cent on concerns that its heavy investment in new products has yet to show any returns.
912;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-03-14T09:32:15Z;Product lifecycle management: Looking sharper in cut-throat world;;GDM Electronics makes printed circuit boards and electronic products to specifications supplied by customers. It is a cut-throat business in which size and low production costs usually give compeitive edge.Yet GDM, a mid-sized contract manufacturer based in high-cost Belgium, is going from strength to strength – in 2005, turnover grew 60 per cent.One of the keys to success is a PLM system, which has cut costs and allowed it to cut the time to introduce new products: “Before it would take us three months to start the supply chain. Now we can get a product into the market in just four weeks,” says chief executive officer Kris Laermans.Previously, the company had struggled to cope with its growing workload and with keeping track of the 100,000 components and 500 products that can be in active production at any time.“Product information management was causing us a lot of trouble and we realised that we could not do it with an Excel spreadsheet any more,” says Mr Laermans.GDM knew its existing ERP software, supplied by Belgian vendor M-Soft, was showing its limitations, but it did not know it needed a PLM system: “We hadn’t even heard of PLM,“ he says.It thought PLM was for design-intensive product development and it carries out very little design work. But when it discovered PLM was also suited to streamlining processes of contract manufacturers, it decided to increase the IT budget and buy a PLM system.In 2004, it opted for PLM software from Oracle and the software went live at the end of 2005. It immediately enabled GDM to decentralise production management from its headquarters in Belgium to the two factories in Slovakia and Romania where its products are made.Before the introduction of PLM, it had to employ staff in high-cost Belgium to keep in constant touch with the factories and deal with engineering changes, component shortages and scheduling problems. These tasks are now carried out by workers in the factories, with obvious savings on HQ payroll costs and time.“Our competitors are moving production to eastern Europe but thanks to PLM we have been able to move tasks like production management there as well,” says Mr Laermans.
913;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-03-01T23:49:50Z;Oracle to pay $3.3bn for Hyperion;;Oracle Thursday agreed to pay $3.3bn for Hyperion Solutions, a move that could touch off a spate of acquisitions by other big software companies as they scramble for a leading position in one of the industry’s fastest-growing markets.The deal will see Larry Ellison, Oracle’s acquisitive chief executive, add one of the leading providers of so-called “business intelligence” software to his growing slate of big purchases. Business intelligence software runs on top of the many separate applications and databases that big companies use, making it possible for executives to draw out and analyse information from different parts of their IT systems in a central place.As such, it has been seen as one of the key areas for spending by corporate IT managers as they try to gain more value from their sizeable investments in underlying systems in recent years.Analysts and industry executives predict that Oracle’s latest move could trigger a consolidation phase in this sub-sector.Apart from Indian outsourcing companies, which have yet to experience a consolidation phase, “this is the last virgin market” in IT that has long been ripe for mergers, said Bruce Richardson, an analyst at AMR, a technology research firm.Besides Hyperion, other leaders in the field are Cognos and Business Objects, both of which are public companies, and SAS, a private US concern.Besides Oracle, IBM and SAP are both potential acquirers of business intelligence companies, said Mr Richardson. SAP, which is Oracle’s arch-rival in applications software for big companies, could be the one most directly affected by Thursday’s deal, because many of its own customers also use Hyperion’s software, he added.Despite the risk to its business, SAP’s declared intention to avoid big acquisitions makes it unlikely that the German company will make a counter-bid of its own for Hyperion, said analysts at Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs.Oracle said it had agreed to pay $52 a share in cash for Hyperion, or $3.3bn in all. That represented a premium of more than 20 per cent to its closing price the day before.The valuation represents a premium to the prices Oracle paid for its other big acquisitions in recent years, its purchases of PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems, said Goldman Sachs.Hyperion’s shares jumped by $8.69 on the news, to $51.53.Hyperion is known, in particular, for its leading position in financial analytics software. Oracle has already tried to develop its own business intelligence business, through the expansion of a unit it acquired when it bought Siebel, and analysts said that effort was likely to be overtaken by its investment in Hyperion.

It eased back to 15.74, up 2.1 per cent.“It has been a sell-first and ask questions later kind of day,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “We are in a period of extreme uncertainty and volatility that is likely to continue.”By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent at 12,234.34. It slumped more than 200 points in the first hour of trading before recovering to move briefly into positive territory.The S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent lower at 1,403.17.After a long bull run, the S&P and Dow are down 1.1 and 1.8 per cent respectively for the year.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,404.21.Oracle stock gained 2.1 per cent to $16.77 after the group said it had agreed to buy Hyperion Solutions for $3.3bn in cash. Shares in Hyperion jumped 20.3 per cent to $51.55.The proposed deal fuelled takeover speculation across the sector. Shares in the software group Cognos, were 2.5 per cent stronger at $39.06 on talk of an approach from Germany’s SAP.Motorola shares jumped 1.7 per cent to $18.83 after Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, said he would increase his holding.Shares in Apple rose 2.9 per cent to $87.06 after analysts at Lehman Brothers raised their rating on the stock, anticipating strong sales of its new mobile phone.The troubles of mortgage lenders continued to weigh on sentiment.Shares in Countrywide were on the defensive after the mortgage lender said that the rate of defaults on its loans to borrowers with patchy credit had increased. Its shares eased 2.4 per cent to $37.44.IndyMac, which focuses on prime mortgages with less strict lending criteria, said that defaults on loans would hit its profits this year, sending its shares 6.3 per cent lower to $32.16.Goodyear advanced after the group said it was freezing its pension scheme for some employees. The potential savings lifted its shares 6.2 per cent to $26.15.Constellation Brands stock plunged 14.5 per cent to $20.06 after the drinks maker said its 2008 revenue and profit might decline.

916;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-02-27T22:38:14Z;Big Blue in the pink after changing tack;;"For years, IBM’s massive technology services arm has hogged the limelight, the symbol of its shift away from its old reliance on the “big iron” of mainframes and other hardware.It is software, though, that has quietly taken up the running. With little fanfare, Big Blue’s software arm, second only to Microsoft in size, has emerged to become the driving force behind the latest overhaul at IBM, capped in the final months of last year with growth of more than 10 per cent.Given the upheaval underway in the software industry itself, that makes IBM’s future increasingly dependent on technology shifts and new competitive rivalries, including one with Microsoft, which are very different drivers from those that traditionally shaped its business.Two things have propelled software to the forefront of the IBM story in recent months. At the start of this decade, the software division was growing at a negligible rate, held back by the slow decline of the operating system business. Little more than a year ago, though, revenue from faster-growing “middleware” – software that acts a layer between operating systems and applications, making it possible to run the highly complex IT systems of modern companies – finally grew to account for more than half of the total.The shift “has given us leverage on the rate of growth” and will mean consistently higher growth rates in future, says Steve Mills, the executive in charge of the division.The second, related event has been a notable increase in the pace of acquisitions. While IBM has a long track record of purchases (including the Lotus productivity software business and Tivoli, a systems management company, in the mid-1990s) it has become more acquisitive of late, buying 22 software companies over the past two years. Mr Mills plays down suggestions that this represents a new departure for the company, but it points to the growing range of opportunities that IBM sees as it extends its middleware reach.Behind this growth lies a strategy that sounds starkly different from rivals Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. While those companies have been racing to create vertically integrated “stacks” of corporate software, extending all the way up to applications used by individual workers, IBM has concentrated on creating a “horizontal” layer of middleware that lies in the guts of IT systems, where most workers will never encounter it.That strategy relies on a single belief: that legacy corporate IT systems are “measured in the trillions of dollars”, says Mr Mills, requiring extensive work as companies try to integrate them better, build on to them and adapt them to new business purposes. IBM has built five middleware brands – Lotus, Tivoli, Websphere, Rational and the DB2 database business – which as standalone businesses, would each rank among the world’s 25 biggest software companies, says Ian Finley, research director at AMR, a technology research firm.Mr Finley says that IBM’s middleware strategy has positioned it well for one of the biggest shifts currently underway in software: the rise of so-called “service-
oriented architectures”, or broader and more flexible software platforms on which companies can build more adaptable technology capable of changing with their business needs.This trend has vindicated IBM’s decision, made a decade ago, to move away from the applications business, instead partnering with other software companies, while it builds broader platforms. Some other broader software trends, however, may pose a bigger long-term challenge.One is the rise of open source software, a movement that IBM has itself championed by supporting the use of the Linux operating system.“They’re enthusiastic today, because it’s hurting Microsoft,” says Mr Finley. “But they may be less so in future,” as low-margin open source software moves into other parts of middleware.“The [open source] model is certainly viable,” argues Mr Mills. IBM has itself started to offer open source versions of some of its middleware, starting with application server software, for the low end of the technology market. But Mr Mills admits that to avoid seeing the more profitable parts of its business commoditised, “we have to keep moving up” to higher-value areas of software.A second potential challenge comes from the emergence of “software as a service” – the business of providing applications online as a service to companies, something pioneered by companies such as Salesforce.com and increasingly attracting the interest of Google.Customers that turn to these services will no longer need to buy the hardware systems and IT integration sold by other parts of IBM, says Mr Finley, putting pressure on IBM itself to step up to become a full service provider. To do that, though, would challenge the vow of denial that has kept it out of the applications business, a strategy that has underpinned its highly profitable partnership with other software producers. “That may be one area where they hesitate, and hesitate too long,” the analyst warns."
917;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
918;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-02-22T23:55:29Z;Salesforce.com: jam tomorrow;;"As Google dabbles with selling access to its software online (seems a pretty good deal at $50 a year), it’s probably a good time to take a closer look at the economics of this business, as exhibitied by acknowledged leader Salesforce.com.There’s no question that Marc Benioff’s software-as-a-service outfit has hit on a formula that appeals to customers. In fact, it just reported the addition of 90,000 new subscribers last quarter, taking the total to 646,000.Take a closer look at the business model, though, and this still feels like ""case unproven."" Like any other business that depends on subscribers, there are a handful of measures that really count: how much does it cost to attract new subscribers, how much do these subscribers pay each month, and how long do they remain customers? In the language of mobile telephone or cable TV companies, you have to watch customer acquisition costs, ARPU (average revenue per user) and churn.At Salesforce.com, some of these indicators are showing signs of stress. Sales and marketing costs are heading up: they just topped 50 per cent of revenue. Meanwhile, ARPU is coming down (it slipped by a couple of dollars in the latest quarter.) Churn is not a number that is readily apparent from the latest quarterly numbers, though Mr Benioff has said in the past that this remains minimal by the standards of most other subscriber-based businesses.With competition from Oracle and SAP picking up, all of these measures will bear close scrutiny in future. Over the last two quarters, operating costs have been growing faster than revenues for the first time, according to David Hilal at Friedman Billings Ramsey. There’s also the fact that, after deducting employee option-related costs, Salesforce.com doesn’t yet make a profit.This doesn’t mean that the model is broken: Mr Benioff’s dash for growth may eventually pay off handsomely. But it seems far too early to declare him the victor in the software-as-a-service game."
919;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-01-24T19:12:20Z;SAP takes new hit after alert on margins;;SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, took another hit to its shares on Wednesday after it warned that its 2007 operating margin would decline and it failed to provide guidance on software licence sales growths for the first time.The German company has now had 15 per cent wiped off its stock market value since the start of the year over investor fears that the days of stellar growth could be at an end. The shares closed 6.5 per cent down at €35.89.The results came as SAP said that it would launch a new product for mid-sized companies at the end of March, which would revolutionise the way they bought and maintained their computer systems.SAP is attempting to enlarge its traditional customer base from large corporations to small and medium-sized companies. The introduction of the new midsize product, which will see SAP “host” clients’ business programmes on its computers, will set new subscription services alongside the traditional task of selling software licences.SAP and its US rival, Oracle, in recent years have started to compete with suppliers to midsized companies, such as Microsoft and many specialists, as they fear that big corporations’ appetite for software could start to wane.Hanning Kagermann, SAP chief executive, said the new business model would “reshape the way midsize companies purchase, adopt and finance software” and render 10,000 extra clients and €1bn ($1.3bn) in sales from 2010.Although competitors such as Sage and Salesforce.Com already offer inernet-based, “on demand” packages for midsized companies, Mr Kagermann said that SAP would be the first to offer a full range of business programmes.This would mean that small companies would pay a subscription for upkeep and updating of applications and data housed in SAP computers.“I think SAP spending this much money to go into the mid market – and the fact that it is doing so in a tech-savvy way – is going to shake up the market,” said Julian Yates at Investec. Rivals would have to consider similar moves.But some investors seemed unhappy that the investment would cut SAP’s profit margins this year by one or two percentage points to 26-27 percent, far short of the company’s target of a 30 per cent return on sales.Undeterred, Mr Kagermann signalled for the first time that he would stay on as chief executive after his contract expires at the end of the year.
920;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-01-16T21:19:28Z;Symantec dents hope of rebound after Veritas ills;;Symantec pre-announced weak revenues and earnings for the second consecutive quarter Tuesday, again denting hopes on Wall Street that the world’s biggest computer security company would finally overcome the lingering problems from its acquisition of Veritas.Shares in the company fell by 9 per cent, wiping $1.5bn from its stock market value, after it warned of disappointing results from its data centre management division, which accounts for around a quarter of overall revenues.It also blamed higher costs resulting from an overhaul of its back-office systems and deeper business processes stemming from the Veritas deal.The latest disappointment also prompted Symantec to offer a more conservative financial outlook for the rest of its fiscal year, which ends in March, reversing a decision three months ago to leave its forecasts intact.Referring to its work for the large multinational companies that make up the bulk of the data centre management business, John Thompson, chief executive, said: “We think it’s prudent to dial back our expectations on some of those contracts.”He added that the company would announce cost-cutting moves when it reports its full earnings next week, to counter the pressure on profit margins due to weaker revenue growth and escalating costs.Symantec’s shortfall follows similar weakness from other big software companies, including SAP and Oracle. However, Mr Thompson said he did not believe this pointed to a broader slowdown in demand from big customers of IT companies.“I don’t think there is a macro challenge,” he said, adding: “Those of us with a large installed base are certainly being challenged at renewal time for a reduction in spending.”He blamed the revenue weakness on the fact that big customers had bought fewer new software licences when renewing their contracts.
921;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-01-15T20:23:15Z;Technology profit warnings;;Technology companies have a proud tradition of keeping investors on their toes. Should a smattering of warnings in the run-up to the earnings season cause broader alarm in the sector?Not yet. In recent weeks, Motorola, SAP, AMD have all indicated that results would fall short of expectations. But the misses so far can be explained largely by company or sector specific issues and do not necessarily foreshadow broad-based technology weakness.Take Motorola. It has suffered mostly from pricing weakness in its mobile phone division. Not only are prices for its leading Razr phone under pressure but there is a general problem when it comes to persuading consumers to buy top-end phones, particularly in less developed markets. That is affecting companies from Nokia to Samsung. It also has a knock-on effect on chipmakers. Texas Instruments, for example, has said that it will be hit by consumers buying lower-end models, which requires less expenditure on chips.AMD’s problems appear more company-specific. Last year it stung Intel into action by taking market share and causing serious damage to its larger rival’s margins. As Intel now takes advantage of a stronger product pipeline and forces down prices in some of AMD’s core markets, the upstart microprocessor company is suffering. Intel, on the other hand, is set for a rebound because its sales and margins were hit so hard by AMD’s incursions last year.SAP and Oracle, meanwhile, have released weak new licence sales figures in recent months. That does not necessarily prefigure problems elsewhere in the software sector, given the lumpiness of their business and cut-throat rivalry. But, with SAP referring to weakness in the US market, investors should keep their eyes open for more signs that US technology demand is slowing.
922;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-01-12T20:13:14Z;SAP;;For SAP, it is a case of three strikes and a rout. Weak preliminary 2006 numbers follow reduced guidance in the third quarter and missed forecasts in the quarter before that. SAP’s shares fell by as much as 9.4 per cent on Friday. Weak software licence sales were to blame, with year-on-year growth in the past three months of the year in the Americas and Asia coming in at half the rate expected.SAP’s whipping will no doubt raise some smiles at arch-rival Oracle. But Oracle’s own quarterly results, released last month, were also uninspiring. What looked like flat US database sales could feasibly be an indicator of a weaker business software environment overall. Meanwhile, France’s Dassault Systèmes has warned of slower information technology spending in the US. With economic indicators mixed, though, it is too early to say if 2007 will confirm Dassault’s view. SAP still has a difficult task with regard to the stock market, however. When it updates investors later this month, it can either reaffirm strong growth targets – risking further disappointment – or adopt a more conservative tone, implicitly acknowledging a weaker outlook.Given that, even after yesterday’s drubbing, SAP trades at a 2007 price/earnings multiple of 24 times – a 14 per cent premium to Microsoft and a 34 per cent premium to Oracle – neither stance would suggest a big rebound in the near term.
923;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-01-12T12:39:29Z;SAP slides as sales miss forecasts;;Shares in SAP dropped by nearly 9 per cent on Friday after the German business software company warned it would miss its full-year software revenue target because of weak sales in the US and a falling dollar.The warning - SAP’s second in less than a year - raised doubts about the company’s growth prospects this year and sent its shares falling sharply.In a surprise announcement late on Thursday, the company said full-year software sales rose 13.5 per cent at constant currency rates, missing its own 15-17 per cent target.It had previously said sales would come in at the low end of its forecast. Slowing growth in the US was the main reason behind the sales miss, and was of particular concern to investors, as the US has been SAP’s strongest growth market in recent quarters.SAP said software sales in the US rose just 4 per cent in the fourth quarter. The weaker dollar against the euro contributed to the decline. At constant currency rates, software revenues in the Americas rose 10 per cent in the quarter, down from 24 per cent in the first nine months of the year.“This will again raise fears that the company is facing a slowdown in its business,” said analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort in a note to clients. However, the analysts said the slowdown could be a short-term development, reflecting “the unpredictable nature of large deal timing.”“Our conversations with SAP’s partners and customers point to a robust demand environment and we see scant evidence to suggest any inflexion point in spending,” Dresdner Kleinwort said.Last month, Oracle, SAP’s US rival, reported disappointing software licence sales, which it blamed on a number of recent deals that had not been closed in the quarter and not a decline in demand or loss of business to rivals.The weak sales development had yet to impact SAP’s profitability last year. The company said full-year earnings per share would reach €1.59, above its own forecast for an EPS of €1.45-€1.5. The increase was partly due to one-time tax gains in the second and fourth quarter of the year.Shares in SAP were 8.7 per cent lower at €38.58 in afternoon trade after reaching a low of €38.27.
924;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2007-01-04T23:03:33Z;Netsuite strengthens bullpen ahead of IPO;;Netsuite, the software developer that helps companies run their businesses through a web browser, is taking the unconventional route to an expected IPO this year.It is planning a Google-style Dutch auction process for its offering and has just strengthened its bench by adding a well known baseball manager to the board of directors.Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland Athletics, is recognised for the high degree of statistical analysis he has brought to the game.“Billy’s outrageously successful approach in changing the game of baseball by …using facts to supplement instinct is very similar to the transformation our customers undergo when they move their business to Netsuite,” said Evan Goldberg, Netsuite chairman, in a somewhat unconvincing comparison.However, Billy’s maths skills do seem a natural fit with the geeks at Netsuite, whose software already runs the Oakland A’s sales and marketing operations and whose CEO Zach Nelson is a big A’s fan.As far as the IPO goes, Netsuite was completing its beauty parade of bankers last month and it seems only the Silicon Valley company’s other sporting influence – sailor, majority investor, Oracle founder and would-be San Francisco 49ers owner Larry Ellison – could delay its march to the market now.Chris Nuttall, San Francisco
925;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-12-28T20:09:31Z;Tech turnround;;This year’s technology stars are a blast from the past. Instead of further share price fireworks from Google and Apple – as they pioneer new markets in internet search and digital music – it was the old guard of Oracle, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco that led the charge among the big-name technology companies. Can they continue to shine in 2007?The three have different stories to tell. Hewlett-Packard has continued to harvest cost savings across its businesses and enjoyed a shift in PC demand towards its stronger areas – including laptops and international markets. Not only did it outpace Dell in revenues but it also increased its once almost non-existent margins to near those of its rival. The challenge now is to prove it can generate sustainably higher revenue growth across the group.Oracle has a similar story. The software group has finally convinced sceptics of the potential of its slew of deals in recent years. There were glimmers of stronger top-line growth. But both Oracle and HP have more work to do to persuade investors of their positive revenue prospects if the run-up in their share prices is to continue next year.Cisco’s tale is quite different. Buoyed by a fundamental shift towards internet-based technologies in areas such as digital media and telephony, it should continue to enjoy robust demand for its “internet plumbing” products. The impact of that shift, coupled with its moves into the fast-growing consumer segment through set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta, is already reflected in the share price, but could have more legs.The next question is whether the triumvirate of Dell, Intel and Microsoft – laggards for most of this year – can continue their recent share price bounce-backs. Dell and Intel, in particular, are potential turnround stocks. This year was painful. Margins and growth fell sharply in the face of stronger competition (from HP and AMD respectively) and some missteps in execution. There is certainly scope for them to recover. Intel especially should enjoy a better product cycle in 2007 after being outgunned by upstart rival AMD last year.With rejuvenated rivals, investors should not expect Dell or Intel to regain the dominance they once enjoyed. But they do have the potential for pleasant surprises as they try to claw back some of the margin they gave up in 2006.

That was down from $24.6m in the third quarter last year, owing to expensing of stock options, but well ahead of analyst estimates.Excluding special items, profits were $29.6m, up from $23.2m one year ago. Revenues were $105.8m, up from $73.1m in the year-ago period.Charlie Peters, Red Hat’s chief financial offer, said the performance was driven by strong demand and good execution across the company’s business lines.“Enterprise and government buyers have grown very comfortable buying open-source software,” he said.Mr Peters said the company was poised to benefit from the entry into the open source market by big competitors.Red Hat’s shares fell 24 per cent in October after Oracle, the business software company, said it would enter the Linux market. Microsoft, the world’s biggest software company, last month entered into an alliance with Novell, a rival open-source company, to improve interoperability between platforms.“There was a time when I thought we were going to be a category leader in a category of one,” said Mr Peters. “To get the huge entrants into the category validates for our customers that Linux is here to stay.”Shares of Red Hat fell 4.2 per cent to $17.96 on Thursday ahead of the company’s earnings announcement. The shares had fallen from a high of $32.37 in May.

929;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-12-18T23:30:16Z;Oracle warns on licensing;;"Oracle, the leading enterprise software company, said a number of deals to license its products were not closed in the second quarter as revenues for that business failed to reach expectations.Oracle shares fell more than 4 per cent in after-hours trading on the news, although Safra Catz, chief financial officer, said the deals had not been lost to competitors and were expected to close in the third quarter.Oracle reported profits in its November quarter rose 21 per cent on a year earlier to $967m as revenues rose 26 per cent overall to $4.2bn. They were boosted by
higher sales of programs and an acquisition spree taking place to improve growth.“We are now halfway through our five-year plan targeting [earnings per share] growth at 20 per cent per year. For the first two-and-a-half years, we are comfortably ahead of that target,” Ms Catz said.Larry Ellison, chief executive, said Oracle had a dual strategy of acquisitions and innovation.He highlighted acquisitions in retail that he said were now starting to pay off. From being on an equal footing with its German rival SAP, Oracle now had the business of eight of the top 10 retailers in the US.He said the company had not been able to recognise a $10m deal with Wal-Mart in the current quarter, but he expected retail “to move the needle” on revenues in the second half.Mr Ellison said Oracle’s most interesting new product was Secure Enterprise Search. This would allow workers to use single-word searches to find all relevant information inside and outside their company, from web pages to invoices, e-mails, diary dates,
presentations and databases.Ms Catz said Oracle was being assisted by a weak dollar against the euro, with around a third of its licence revenues coming from the Europe region.This had added four percentage points of growth in the second quarter and was likely to add four to five points in the third.She predicted new software licence revenues would rise 16 to 22 per cent in the third quarter year-on-year, total revenues would rise 23 to 25 per cent and profits would be up by 24 to 29 per cent."

Equity investors hope modest rate cuts next year will renew the economy and push share prices higher over the long haul.“The best days for the equity market will come when a Fed ease is more of a reality than a hope,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management. “The jobs report keeps the economy on track for a safe landing, though there may still be some bumps on the way.”He noted the pace of wage gains, running at an annualised rate of 4.1 per cent, “does keep open the question whether labour cost pressures develop down the road.”Deals, drug trials, and brokerage downgrades sparked bouts of activity across the broad market this week.The S&P 500 had risen 1.2 per cent over the five days to 1,413.94 at the close on Friday, up 0.2 per cent on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out the week with a gain of 1.1 per cent after a rise of 0.2 per cent to 12,307.49 on Friday.

Economists expect the report to show that 110,000 jobs were created last month.“It’s a big number and has the potential to push the market around,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “A consensus number would not spark much movement.

convertible bonds, increased to $4.5bn from $3bn. Shares in the carmaker fell 2.7 per cent to $7.16. Its shares have tumbled 10.9 per cent this week as the bonds could become equity at some stage in the future and thus dilute shareholder value.News Corp shares rose

The shares touched an intra-day low of $5.70.Shares in Novellus slid 4.8 per cent to $32.88 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the semiconductor company from “neutral” to “sell”, citing weakening fundamentals and extended valuation.Yahoo’s management shake-up failed to boost its stock price and shares were 2.1 per cent lower at $26.86.

933;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-11-28T19:44:54Z;Microsoft;;Microsoft is playing catch-up. While large technology peers Cisco and Oracle have both added about 50 per cent to their market capitalisation this year, Microsoft waited until mid-year to join the party. The current strong run started only after its shares fell off a cliff in April.Will Wednesday’s delayed launch of its Vista operating system keep the rally going?Quite possibly. Vista will not have the huge uptake enjoyed by Windows 95, which was launched into a less mature PC market and contained a bigger architectural shift. But one silver lining from Vista’s delays is that there could be some pent-up demand after five years without a significant new launch. Also, Vista is arguably a bigger improvement – in areas such as graphical interface and security – than other launches since Windows 95.So far, analysts are rightly not too aggressive about the level of extra demand Vista will create – in terms of customers accelerating their decisions to upgrade their PCs or software. Not least, corporate demand is likely to be small for at least the first six months. But Microsoft’s earnings will be sensitive to Vista’s performance. Sanford Bernstein estimates that 2 percentage points of additional Vista penetration in 2008 will boost Microsoft’s overall earnings by more than 2 per cent. It might also enjoy better pricing. That gives the potential for earnings upgrades, at a time when the group could also get a following wind from reduced Xbox losses, improvements in its internet business and other product launches such as Office 2007.Although changes to the software industry from the likes of Google pose a serious threat, their impact remains unclear and some way off. Unless Vista bombs, Microsoft should increase earnings in the mid-teens for the next few years – with the chance of more if Vista outperforms.But even with attractive short-term growth prospects, Microsoft still trades on a relatively modest 17 times next calendar year’s earnings, according to Goldman Sachs. Microsoft still has some space to continue its recent return to favour.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 158.38 points, or 1.3 per cent, to close at 12,121.79.The sell-off was not completely unexpected because many analysts had called for a period of consolidation after the substantial rally in stocks since July.Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said: “You have to remember that we have had four months of a very dramatic rally in the equity markets and it is not unusual for the market to pause and take profits, particularly after a holiday.”He added that continued concerns over the weakness of the dollar were contributing to the sell-off.The financial services sector was hit particularly hard in the sell-off.

Others, such as HG Capital, the private equity group, have been tipped to make a bid while Intec has also been linked with a management buy-out, backed by 3i, the private equity group.Last week it was forced to make its second profit warning in four months after consolidation between major US telecoms groups continued to delay the signing of new contracts. As a result, it planned to defer recognition of £5.5m of licence fees where payments had yet to be received. The shares, which began the year at 71p, rose ¾p to 34½p.

First to benefit will be gamers; mainstream business PCs are unlikely to need quad-core processors for some time. Dell and IBM have unveiled servers and workstations based on Intel’s technology.Intel is also trying to jump on the Web 2.0 bandwagon. It plans to promote a suite of web-based applications, called SuiteTwo, to small businesses. The suite comprises a variety of third-party tools for blogging, wikis and social networking. Intel’s contribution seems to be providing a single sign-on capability so you do not have to visit the sites separately.US computer maker Everex Systems has produced what it says is the world’s most energy-efficient laptop, the StepNote NC1500. The secret to its frugality lies in its C7-M processor, made by Taiwan’s Via Technologies. It uses only 12W of power, 43 per cent less than an Intel Pentium chip running at the same speed. The hard-drive also spins at 4,200 rpm against the more usual 5,400 rpm.You can’t keep an old dog down.

938;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-29T21:55:31Z;IBM executive warns over Oracle open-source impact;;Oracle’s entry into the Linux business – an open-source software system – could have a divisive and damaging effect on the market for this fast-growing product, a senior IBM software executive has warned.The comments from Kristof Kloeckner, chief technology officer and head of strategy in IBM’s software division, echo criticisms in recent days from some other open-source supporters, who have claimed that Oracle’s move could undermine one of the software industry’s biggest success stories.Oracle sent a shockwave through the open-source world last week with the announcement that it would distribute and offer support for a version of Linux that is copied directly from the one sold by Red Hat, the leading company in the field.Since open-source software is covered by licences that make it freely available, Oracle said it believed it was legally entitled to copy the Red Hat code, as long as it stripped out that company’s trademarks.IBM itself did much to promote the early use of Linux and helped to give Red Hat its lead in the business. The computer maker stood aside last week as other big technology companies lined up to support Oracle’s move, and Mr Kloeckner’s comments point to a potential struggle between the two technology groups over the future direction of Linux.“If they’re creating a major bifurcation of Linux, it would be a very slippery slope,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “That is certainly something we would have to watch very carefully.”Oracle’s move would threaten Linux if other software makers, along with the companies which use their products, feel they have to test them exhaustively first on the new Oracle Linux, said Mr Kloeckner. That would greatly add to their costs and effectively fragment the Linux business by creating different versions of the product.Software veterans fear that a fragmented Linux could face the same fate as the Unix operating system, on which it is closely based. Big computer makers like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun all released their own versions of Unix, removing the benefit that would have come from a single standardised product – and leaving the field open for Microsoft’s Windows. IBM’s early support of Linux reflected its desire to limit the spread of Windows on to servers and into corporate datacentres.Oracle executives denied last week that their version of the operating system would amount to a fragmentation of Linux.As a direct copy of the Red Hat software, though with extra “bug fixes” added by Oracle to improve the product, it would work with other software products in exactly the same way that Red Hat’s software does, they said.
939;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-25T22:58:14Z;Oracle enters the Linux arena;;Oracle on Wednesday carried through on recent intimations that it might move fully into the Linux business, a step analysts said would change the dynamics of one of the fastest-growing parts of the software world.The US company said it would make available its own version of the open-source operating system under the new “Unbreakable Linux” brand. It also said it would offer bug fixes and full support for the software at a lower price than that charged by Red Hat, the biggest Linux company.Countering warnings from some observers that its entry might fragment the fast-growing Linux world, creating multiple incompatible “distributions” of the software, Oracle promised that its version would be identical to that produced by Red Hat.Asked whether Oracle had the legal right to take its rival’s code, strip out the trademarks and redistribute the code under its own brand, Larry Ellison, chief executive, said: “It’s an open-source product, right? That is what open source means.” Software issued under an open-source licence is generally freely available, though any company that makes additions or improvements to the software has to make these available to other users as well.“Strategically, this is very important [for the way competition between the biggest software companies is developing],” said Rick Sherlund, analyst at Goldman Sachs.Oracle’s entry into the Linux business would limit the rise of Red Hat, which has emerged as the clear leader in the open-source software business, he said.While IBM and some other big technology companies tried to counter the growing power of Red Hat by encouraging another company, Novell, to enter the Linux market, that has done little to stem Red Hat’s advance.This year, Red Hat signalled its growing ambitions with the purchase of JBoss, another open-source company, moving it closer to creating a full package of software that might one day rival companies such as Oracle and Microsoft.“They have created another Microsoft in the marketplace,” Mr Sherlund said of the big technology companies that supported Red Hat in its early days. “They have wanted to clip Red Hat’s wings.”By selling a “stack” of software, from the operating system and middleware to a database and applications on top, Oracle will also open a new front in its competition with Microsoft, since it will be in a better position to sell a simple and complete solution to smaller and medium-sized companies, he said.Shares in Red Hat dropped more than 13 per cent in after-market trading on Wednesday, leaving them at roughly half the level they stood at before Mr Ellison indicated in an interview with the Financial Times in April that he was considering entering the Linux business.Mr Ellison said yesterday that Oracle’s aim was not to “kill Red Hat” but to expand the Linux business by introducing better support.
940;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-20T21:37:16Z;Executive rivalry;;When you have already beaten everyone else to the top, the only people left worth beating up are those who share your rarefied domain. Relations between Hasso Plattner, co-founder of SAP, and Larry Ellison, founder of US competitor Oracle, are said to have soured 10 years ago. The unedifying underside of their rivalry reportedly came out during (what else?) a yacht race. But there have been worse examples. In their day, animosity between Rudi and Adi Dassler – the twin brothers who founded the Puma and Adidas sportswear empires, respectively – split their small Bavarian home town into opposing camps.All those mentioned above have, of course, built world-class businesses. For shareholders, a bit of baiting might seem a small price to pay for the services of a talented figure.Investors, however, should not be distracted by verbal jousting. A quick glance at Oracle’s broadside against SAP last month, for example, might suggest the latter was on the ropes. Oracle is indeed making progress in its attempt to catch up in enterprise software applications. Yet, as SAP’s own strong results showed this week, Oracle still has some way to go.At worst, mudslinging can unhelpfully blur emotion with corporate affairs: a particular danger during takeover battles. And there is a danger of reinforcing personality cults, with unhealthy consequences. Capitalism thrives on its competitive spirit but it is, and ought to remain, just business.
941;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
942;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-19T14:08:38Z;SAP’s cautious outlook disappoints;;SAP, the world’s largest maker of business software, on Thursday beat investor expectations about its performance in the third quarter but disappointed by putting a cautious gloss on an otherwise unchanged forecast for the year.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said SAP was now “less likely” than once thought to reach the upper end of its forecast of 15 to 17 per cent growth in software licence sales, a key indicator for future maintenance revenues.Investors, spoiled by the German company beating its own forecasts in past years, reacted nervously, pushing the company’s stock price more than three per cent lower in early trading.SAP stumbled in the spring quarter, when license sales failed to grow at a – nigh on customary – double-digit rate, leading some analysts to predict competition from US rival Oracle would see SAP fall short of full-year targets.Mr Kagermann said on Thursday that SAP was sticking to its guidance. Nine months of trading now simply allowed it to put more “meat” on a projection issued early 2006, he said, refusing to comment on possible effects for 2007.Bruce Richardson, an analyst at AMR Research in Boston, said this caution was due to clients “holding back” from converting to new software. SAP needed “to do better” selling new packages, though rivals had similar problems.Shaking off this spring’s disappointment, SAP said licence sales in the three summer months rose 17 per cent compared with the third quarter last year to €691m, almost three percentage points higher than analyst forecasts.Total revenues, which include maintenance and training fees, rose 11 per cent to €2.25bn as operating earnings grew 13 per cent to €583m, SAP said. The operating margin, officially billed to hit 30 percent in 2007, hit 26 per cent.After losing market share to Oracle in the second quarter, SAP said it had again extended its lead, now holding 22.6 per cent of the market for core applications such as accounting and client management, against Oracle’s 9.9 per cent.The companies locked horns last month after Larry Ellisson, Oracle chief executive, said SAP’s disappointing results in spring presaged the loss of market share to the US group “quarter after quarter” as its organic growth slowed.In rebuttal to these claims, Mr Kagermann said SAP was now “back on track”. The company was winning 85 per cent of competitive tenders against Oracle, up from a success rate of 70 per cent earlier this year, he said.
943;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-18T10:35:26Z;SMEs: How Oracle and SAP are moving down ‘the tail’;;"Directors of small and mid-sized businesses can expect to be feted by two of the world’s largest software vendors in coming months – if they have not already received their invitations.For enterprise software giants Oracle and SAP, the mid-sized and smaller company is not just the next sales opportunity. It is set to be the greatest driver of their growth.In June, SAP booked the 10,000th customer for its Business One package for smaller companies. It says sales to small and medium companies are contributing to its double-digit growth in turnover. Oracle has set itself tough targets for increasing sales to SMEs, executives say.Both software companies want to win custom for their enterprise resource planning, financial, supply chain, customer relationship management and other business- critical software.They are hoping to draw smaller companies away from specialist local software vendors or away from business systems that might have been written in-house, in favour of highly functional software suites.To add appeal to smaller companies with specialist industry needs and limited in-house IT skills, both Oracle and SAP are investing heavily in their channel and partner networks, and in providing modules tailored for smaller companies that just want to install the software and go, without much customisation.Oracle has identified 48 industry sub-sectors for its “business accelerators” for the E-Business Suite. SAP says it has 550 “micro-vertical solutions” for its mid-market All in One software application and 300 industry-specific add-ons for its Business One offering.These, the two companies argue, remove much of the need for custom coding but also make them far more competitive against smaller software vendors that have focused on niche markets, especially in ERP.Both companies have been investing significant resources over the past few years in bolstering their products and technologies for the small and mid-sized business. So far, industry observers suggest that SAP has the edge, but it is an increasingly close-run race.“SAP has spent more time focusing on developing software for the needs of the small and mid-sized business market. They have had more of an opportunity to refine their strategy,” says Bob Anderson, Gartner’s vice- president for research covering the SME market. “The comeback from Oracle would be that they have sold successfully into that market for years and years.”SAP’s head start reflects the company’s focus on its core software product, ERP. Oracle has long sold technology, especially its database, to smaller companies. The challenge for the US software company is to persuade those customers to buy its business applications too.Oracle’s software offering is undoubtedly broader than SAP’s, following Oracle’s acquisitions of Peoplesoft, JD Edwards and Siebel. But the gap is narrowing between the two companies. Most mid-sized businesses will find most of the software they are likely to need from either supplier.This puts the head of IT or managing director of a small or mid-sized company in a stronger position than ever before. Not only are smaller companies being courted by both Oracle and SAP, allowing them to play one off against the other, but they have also attracted the attention of Microsoft.Analysts say that Microsoft has a strong proposition for small and mid-sized companies, not least because it can provide the operating system, the database and the business applications all from its own stable.Microsoft cannot, however, point to the same roster of large enterprise companies for its business applications. Microsoft is positioning itself in the mid market, whereas SAP and Oracle argue that they are providing enterprise capabilities at a small business price.“Small businesses are not necessarily less complex than larger companies; it is about the complexity of their business processes,” says Donna Troy, SAP’s executive vice-president for the global SME market.“Something as simple as a small winery – which is one of our customers – has complex processes,” she says. She argues that buying from SAP, rather than a niche vendor, also gives companies more room for growth, especially if they want to enter into export markets.“Just because a company is smaller doesn’t mean that it doesn’t need the complexity of our product. It is a question of simplifying the implementation,” says Tony Kender, Oracle’s senior vice-president for application sales support. “We allow them to have the best industry solutions.”It is a compelling argument. But in the case of both vendors, SMEs need to take two critical factors into account: the strength of the vendor’s local channel and whether they buy into Oracle and SAP’s approach of selling software as all-singing, all-dancing suites.“One of the downsides [of Oracle and SAP] is that you have to commit to the idea of a large, integrated suite,” says Jim Shepherd, senior vice-president of research and a specialist in enter-
prise applications at AMR Research. “You can no longer really buy applications such as inventory control or order management or purchasing one by one.”Although Oracle and SAP both say that they do sell applications on an individual basis, in effect they turn on or off modules in a larger suite of applications rather than licensing stand-alone code. This could make the application hard for the company to manage.Both companies are trying to address this through closer collaboration with their reseller channel. Channel partners are closer to local markets and should be better able to deal with the needs of smaller companies.The risk is that a business might find its local channel partner falls short of expectations. CIOs face a double challenge: picking the right vendor and the right reseller. This is a point smaller companies should not neglect, however appealing the software on offer, says Gartner’s Bob Anderson.“If there is a partner involved, then you should do your due diligence on them as well as on the software vendor,” he advises."

Over the next five years, Big Blue plans to spend $100m on making its mainframes easier to program and manage via a modern user interface and new tools that allow novices to program mainframes.Ease of use has never been a strong point of mainframes and the number of IT professionals skilled in traditional mainframe software is declining fast.Open source intelligenceJasperSoft, an up-and-coming vendor of open-source business intelligence software, has developed Jasper4Salesforce, a version of its software for Salesforce.com’s popular on-demand customer relationship management software.Businesses can create and access reports directly inside of Salesforce applications, instead of having to buy a stand-alone BI solution or process the data through a spreadsheet. Pricing starts at $20 a month for each user.Open source contentAnother open-source vendor, Alfresco, has unveiled a “preview release” of its enterprise content management system. Just like its proprietary counterparts, the Alfresco software offers high-end features such as collaborative document, records and image management, and web content management. Alfresco was founded by execs from Documentum, the one-time leader of the ECM industry, which was acquired by EMC, the storage giant.SOA middlewareBEA Systems has made a flurry of announcements designed to transform its existing middleware products for the brave new world of service-oriented architectures. Its new SOA 360° platform spans BEA’s exisiting Tuxedo, WebLogic and AquaLogic products and is based on a micro-Services Architecture, that BEA is “previewing”.Web-based deliveryAccenture has won a $199m contract from Calpers, California’s state pension fund, to redesign its IT systems using a service-oriented architecture.By moving to web-based delivery, Calpers hopes to streamline administrative processes and improve access to its data. Accenture plans to invest heavily over three years in developing its SOA skills and says this contract provides a big vote of confidence for SOA.Hosted PBXOracle has announced Virtual PBX, a carrier-grade software platform that telecoms operators can use to offer hosted PBX services. Oracle is not traditionally associated with telecoms software, but the worlds of IT and telecoms are converging thanks to open standards such as J2EE, SOA and web technologies.Paperless offices?Version One, whose document managing and imaging products help create paperless offices, has promised to plant a tree on behalf of every new customer. The Cheshire-based company expects this to make it “carbon neutral” within a year. Version One e-mailed me a certificate, saying it had planted a tree to make my journey to the launch party of its green initiative carbon neutral. I’ve printed it out and pinned it up. Though on second thoughts, perhaps that wasn’t quite what the paper-free champions had in mind...
945;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-18T10:32:07Z;Customer experience: Endesa has to learn how to deal with the customer;;Deregulation in Europe’s electricity sector has sparked a wave of consolidation and forced once-dowdy utilities to improve efficiency and brush up their marketing skills.To meet these challenges, Endesa, Spain’s largest electricity company, is building a new customer relationship management system to manage its 10m clients – and ensure it does not lose them to competitors.Spain’s energy sector was liberalised in 2003 and the shake-up has brought big changes. For example, Endesa can now offer gas to its electricity customers. Conversely, its rival Gas Natural now also offers electricity and has grown to be Spain’s third largest electricity supplier, despite having no distribution capacity.Endesa knows the once cosy conditions that ruled Spain’s electricity market have gone and it has seen more than 2.6m Spanish consumers – 9 per cent of the total – buy electricity in the liberalised market since 2003.The majority of electricity users might not have yet made the change, but Endesa realises it cannot depend on customer inertia to remain Spain’s leading electricity company.Its response is an ambitious CRM project that goes far beyond anything it has attempted. It started using Siebel CRM software, now owned by Oracle, in 1998, when large industrial customers could buy electricity at market prices. But a second project, covering business and residential customers, again with Siebel, was less successful.“We did not really get the benefits expected,” says Tomás Blázquez, Endesa’s director of management systems.Endesa wants to use CRM for strategic analysis – better to understand its business – rather than as a simple tool for such tasks as billing and meter reading, the traditional role of CRM in the utility sector. “People confuse analysis with operational CRM systems,” says Mr Blázquez.As well as customers who buy electricity in the liberalised markets, Endesa supplies customers who continue to buy electricity at tariffs fixed by the government. And, sometimes, “liberalised” customers opt to go back to tariff-based pricing because it works out cheaper.Mr Blázquez admits that trying to get a clear picture of these market segments is not easy, not least because the data it held on its 10m customers were spread across seven databases. Furthermore, the data were not standardised, which made it difficult to analyse in an automatic manner.Endesa’s latest CRM project, called Avanza, is designed to overcome these obstacles. “Avanza is a new way to manage customers so we can improve sales and, equally importantly, increase customer retention,” says Mr Blázquez.Endesa spent nine months evaluating various bids from CRM suppliers before again deciding on Siebel software. The Avanza project, started in January, will take four years to complete. Nevertheless, the first part of the project, which covers “customer insight and value” is deemed the most critical and is due to go live this year.Banks and telephone companies have long used CRM to identify “high-value” customers and target products and campaigns at them. But this is new territory for Endesa, and only time will tell if the new strategy pays off.

947;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-05T21:54:39Z;Oracle/Microsoft;;Who says investors hate aggressive acquirers? Since mid-2003, when Larry Ellison started betting Oracle’s cash on a series of aggressive deals, the software company’s shares have not really been punished. They have outperformed Microsoft, which used its cash more conservatively. This year, as investors have got more comfortable, Oracle’s shares have actually jumped 48 per cent compared with Microsoft’s 7 per cent.Of course, it is not all about how each has used its firepower. Oracle’s recent share price run is partly down to the performance of its core database business. The growth potential of Windows and Office remains key for Microsoft investors.But how they have used their balance sheets has been a factor. Since mid-2003, both have used cash equivalent to roughly one quarter of current market capitalisation on a mixture of shareholder payouts and acquisitions. In Oracle’s case, more than 70 per cent has gone on acquisitions. That has helped narrow rival SAP’s lead in enterprise applications – something Oracle could not have done by itself. It has left Oracle with only a small net cash position.In Microsoft’s case, virtually all the cash went to shareholders. Although Microsoft has struggled to build its internet business, particularly in search, it is trying to narrow Google’s lead through investment rather than acquisition. It retains an inefficient balance sheet, with net cash and investments above $40bn.In a world where tech companies are maturing and cash flows are more stable – hence the rash of interest from private equity – Oracle’s balance sheet looks more sensible.Microsoft should reduce its cash pile further. Acquisitions would be risky. For example, Microsoft would face anti-trust risks if it tried buying Yahoo to bolster its internet position – as Oracle did buying PeopleSoft. Yahoo would also be more expensive than PeopleSoft and a riskier bet on growth rather than cost-cutting. But it would fill a gap. Having seen how investors have treated Mr “Splash the Cash” Ellison, Microsoft might one day feel emboldened to get more aggressive itself.
948;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-05T17:35:39Z;Synergy springs from cultural revolution;;"Every merger or acquisition promises to create value from some kind of synergy. Yet statistics show that the benefits that look so good on paper often do not materialise. The failure of an M&A is frequently blamed on a clash of cultures between the merging companies that resulted in major integration problems and undermined the success of the deal. For example, an internal study conducted by Siebel Systems (which was recently acquired by Oracle) revealed that all of the company’s acquisitions had failed because of “cultural conflicts”.In other cases, deals have fallen through before they were sealed because the culture of the two companies was vastly different. When the proposed merger between Monsanto and American Home Products was called off in 1998, for example, the failure of the deal was attributed to conflicting management styles and the fact that the two CEOs could not agree on a power-sharing arrangement. A Wall Street Journal article concluded: “Another drug industry mega-merger goes bust: Clash of cultures kills Monsanto-AHP marriage.”The impact on performance of cultural differences in M&AsAs merger fiascos continue to make headlines, executives have come to believe that differences in culture between merging companies almost inevitably lead to integration problems. Cross-border M&As, in particular, are notoriously difficult to get right because, in addition to the standard integration issues, there is a plethora of cross-cultural challenges.At DaimlerChrysler, which was formed in 1998 when Germany’s Daimler-Benz purchased the US’s Chrysler, differences in compensation systems and decision-making processes caused friction between senior management, while lower-level employees fought over issues such as dress code, working hours and smoking on the job. Language also became an issue. While most managers on the Daimler side could speak some English, not all were able to do so with the ease and accuracy that is needed for effective working relationships. Among the Chrysler managers, meanwhile, few had any knowledge of German.The cultural and communication challenges are even greater when the merger is between a western company and one from an emerging market, many of which now harbour international expansion plans. For example, when Lenovo, the leading Chinese PC maker, announced in December 2004 that it was acquiring IBM’s PC business, most observers were sceptical that a company that grew in a communist system, and until recently sold exclusively in China, could succeed in managing a global business. Merging two companies with vastly different business models and cultures, while staying competitive in the fast-paced PC industry, seemed too daunting a challenge. While the jury is still out on whether the IBM deal will help Lenovo become the global market leader, the sceptics were partly vindicated when in December 2005 – less than eight months after the takeover – Lenovo replaced its American CEO, Steve Ward. Michael Dell, chairman of Lenovo’s main rival, declared: “It won’t work.”Recent research, however, has challenged the prevailing wisdom that cultural differences are unmanageable and a major cause of failure in M&As. Studies have shown that in cross-border M&As, cultural differences can enhance the combined company’s competitive advantage in a series of ways: by providing access to unique and potentially valuable capabilities that are embedded in a different cultural environment; by helping the company to develop richer knowledge structures; by overcoming rigidities and organisational inertia; and by fostering learning and innovation. Other studies indicate that cultural differences, which are more salient in cross-border M&As, lead the managers involved to pay greater attention to the less tangible, but critical, sociocultural and people factors that are often overlooked in domestic M&As.Collectively, these findings suggest that the cultural issues inherent in cross-border M&As may not represent a daunting hazard. The same applies to international alliances and joint ventures. The alliance of Renault-Nissan, which is widely considered successful, is a case in point. As Carlos Ghosn, now president and CEO of both Nissan and Renault, has pointed out, “Cultural differences can be viewed as either a handicap or a powerful seed for something new.” Indeed, in recent weeks, Mr Ghosn has spoken of a potential three-way alliance between Renault-Nissan and an American carmaker.Unravelling the mysteryHow can we make sense of these conflicting experiences, theories and research findings? In an attempt to better understand the role of culture in M&As, Andreas Voigt of London Business School and I have examined the performance implications of cultural differences in a sample of 10,387 M&As, both domestic and cross-border deals. We used meta-analytic techniques – a statistical procedure for integrating the results of a large number of studies that address the same research question. The evidence points to an interesting tendency. In M&As that require high levels of operational integration – acquisitions that promise significant economies of scale or scope – cultural differences can create obstacles by exacerbating sociocultural problems in the post-merger integration period.By contrast, in M&As that require lower levels of integration, we found that cultural differences – especially those at the national level in cross-border M&As – facilitated the realisation of synergies without leading to major problems at the sociocultural level. In these cases, acquired units are often granted a considerable degree of autonomy, which reduces post-acquisition stress and the likelihood of culture- and human resources-related problems. Thus, whether cultural differences have a positive or negative effect on the success of a merger – or any effect at all – is likely to depend on the level of integration required. As Oded Shenkar, a leading expert on cross-border M&As at the Fisher College of Business at the Ohio State University, has noted: “How different one culture is from another has little meaning until those cultures are brought into contact with one another.”Different M&As require different solutionsAccording to our research, the effect of cultural differences in M&As depends on the ability of the acquirer to manage the sociocultural integration process. What constitutes effective integration management in a particular M&A, however, depends on the strategic intent behind the deal. The thousands of transactions that are lumped together under the term “M&A” actually represent very different strategic activities, and they have very different implications for integration management.For example, companies that pursue a growth-through-acquisitions strategy, such as Cisco, General Electric or Teva, tend to “integrate” acquired units by absorbing them into existing units or establishing autonomous units. Mega-mergers such as DaimlerChrysler or AstraZeneca, on the other hand, involve two entities of relatively equal size coming together and either taking the best of each company (at least in theory) or forming a completely new organisation with significant competitive advantage.These two scenarios require different – almost opposite – approaches to cultural integration. Research carried out by Susan Cartwright of Manchester Business School and Cary Cooper of Lancaster University Management School on a wide range of industries across Europe suggests that in mergers of equals (“collaborative marriages”), the cultures of the combining organisations must be similar because the success of the merger depends on the ability to create a coherent “third culture” which combines elements of both cultures. Since organisations normally strive to retain their own culture, mergers between companies with dissimilar cultures will result in major integration problems.In cases where significant differences in power or size exist and the acquirer imposes its culture on the target, the attractiveness of the acquirer’s culture is probably a more important factor than cultural distance. If the acquired employees expect the takeover to result in increased autonomy and other benefits, they are likely to accept the acquirer’s culture and may even welcome the takeover.This is why an absorption mode of integration, in which the acquired company is expected to conform to the acquirer’s way of working, need not be a “bad” thing from the point of view of the acquired company’s employees. This is especially true when the target’s employees see the acquiring company as being a saviour or having a more enlightened culture, or when they see a variety of positive outcomes in being associated with the acquiring company (better pay, more prestige and so on). Cisco, for example, buys companies for their technology and R&D talent and then assimilates them into the Cisco culture. But it attempts to retain most of the employees, including top management, and provides strong financial incentives and a vision of the merged entity that includes an important role for the acquired company’s employees.Managing the sociocultural integration processIntegrating companies and cultures is complex and idiosyncratic. No guaranteed recipes or instant solutions exist, but a small number of companies have learned to avoid common mistakes. The following recommendations are based on academic research and on interviews with executives that piloted their companies successfully through alliances and M&As that transformed their industries. Their experiences suggest that whether differences in culture undermine the success of a deal or result in cultural synergies depends on four factors: a thorough assessment of the cultural fit; flexibility in the integration approach; the ambition to create something new and better; and opportunities for culture learning.■ Make cultural assessment part of the due diligence process In the due diligence phase, learning about the “soft” factors is just as important as considerations of financial analysis and strategic fit. Undertaking a human capital audit to ensure that the target company has the talent to execute the acquisition strategy, identifying which individuals are key to sustaining value and assessing any potential weaknesses in the management cadre is key to the long-term success of the acquisition, as is an assessment of the cultural fit between the two organisations.Sometimes, cultural due diligence is undertaken to reveal “deal killers”. Cisco, for example, avoids buying companies with cultures that are significantly different from its own, recognising that it would be difficult to achieve its aim of retaining key talent. However, in today’s global business environment, in which M&A activity is mainly driven by strategic imperatives, few companies can afford the luxury of avoiding deals on account of cultural issues. In the light of findings that cultural differences can be a source of value creation, innovation and learning, limiting acquisitions to target businesses with similar cultures may not be a winning strategy. But this does not mean that cultural differences can be ignored. On the contrary, because they are so critical, they have to be well assessed and well managed.■ Flexibility in the integration approach For companies such as Cisco, GE and Teva, growth through acquisitions has become a central part of their business strategies. These serial acquirers try to learn from mistakes and accumulate experience, putting in place processes that enable them to execute deals more effectively. For example, GE Capital, the financial services arm of GE, has developed a set of guidelines and process tools for integrating acquired companies which has been applied successfully in many transactions. This systematic approach to implementing acquisitions, however, does not prevent the managers involved in M&A deals from finding the right answers for themselves. GE recognises that there are aspects of every acquisition integration process that are unique, so managers will have to improvise.Similarly, Teva, the world’s largest generic drug manufacturer, has made flexibility an integral part of the acquisition implementation process. According to Haim Benjamini, former vice-president of human resources, Teva’s guiding principle in integrating acquisitions is that each deal is different and, therefore, flexibility in arriving at solutions is important. When Teva encountered resistance after acquiring Abic, then the second largest pharmaceutical company in Israel, its executives realised that a culturally sensitive integration approach was needed. Although the anticipated synergies were high, Teva decided to approach integration slowly and to run the acquired company as an independent business unit until employees had overcome the initial culture shock.In another case, Teva’s acquisition of the Hungarian drug manufacturer Biogal, the integration team worked closely with local management to determine the best way to deal with cultural issues and the necessary redundancies. Those people who were negatively affected were given retraining and loans that allowed them to start their own businesses. This helped build trust and set the stage for a successful integration.■ Don’t miss the opportunity to create a new culture A window of opportunity exists during the short time after an acquisition when the organisation is “unfrozen” and employees expect change and are malleable to new ways of doing things. This is the time to make painful decisions and create something new and better. As one AstraZeneca executive interviewed by Peter Killing, professor of strategy at IMD, noted: “A merger is like an erupting volcano. Everything turns to lava, and lava is fluid. You can mould it and shape it and turn it into new things, but eventually it solidifies. In the period when the lava is molten you have an incredible opportunity to do things differently – take advantage of that situation.”While it is clear that this process has to be driven from the top, it is essential to get the buy-in and ideas from employees at all levels of the organisation. Soon after the IBM-Lenovo deal was closed, for example, call centre employees at IBM’s operations centre in Raleigh, North Carolina thought up the idea of videotaping each other throwing their IBM badges away, and sending this video greeting to their counterparts at Lenovo. To stimulate creative thinking, Fran O’Sullivan, chief operating officer of Lenovo International (the former IBM parts of the business), started a programme called the Trash Bin Project. This encourages staff to submit examples of things that they did as part of IBM but don’t want to do anymore.What is even more important than leaving the past behind, however, is to create something new. In a transformational merger, this means that you have to create an organisation that is better than either of the two companies coming together. When pharmaceuticals company Novartis was formed with the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz in 1996, the proposed management style for the new company reflected the desired transformation: “We listen more than Sandoz, but decide more than Ciba.” CEO Daniel Vasella led the change process by communicating the new set of core values in numerous workshops with key employees and visits to Novartis’s operations around the world. These interventions, supported by a new performance management system and investment in training and development, helped Mr Vasella and his team to build the desired “high-performance” culture.Create opportunities for culture learningAccording to Mr Benjamini, who oversaw the integration of many of Teva’s acquisitions, the best way to integrate acquired units is to get people working together quickly to leverage each other’s expertise and solve business problems that could not have been solved before the merger. There are a number of activities and integration mechanisms that can be used to ensure that people are aligned around the same objectives and to create a co-operative context that facilitates the transfer of capabilities. Cisco, for example, routinely uses a one-on-one partner system (called the buddy system) in the integration of acquired companies. Cross-company teams are another powerful tool for getting employees to think in new ways, challenge existing practices and eliminate us-versus-them thinking – as evidenced by the important role that these teams played in the successful turnaround of Nissan.However, as new units are created with people from different cultures, who may even have been competitors, the opportunities for misunderstandings and conflict abound. Rather than wait for a culture clash, there are approaches that executives can employ to ensure cultural learning. Recent research in a Fortune 500 company conducted by David Schweiger and Philip Goulet of the Moore School of Business suggests that deep-level cultural learning interventions can facilitate synergies by altering negative stereotypes, developing constructive employee attitudes and enhancing communication between the combining organisations.The process begins with a managed flow of information between acquiring and acquired employees to provide a constructive forum whereby the parties get accurate information about each other. Through such information, inaccurate perceptions are eliminated and real differences are brought to light. Rather than differences being seen as a problem, cross-fertilisation is encouraged and the best features of both cultures are highlighted.ConclusionRecent research suggests that differences in culture between merging companies present a doubled-edged sword: they may enhance the potential for synergies and learning, but can undermine the success of a merger by exacerbating sociocultural problems. Yet, few companies seem to devote significant attention and resources to the management of the elusive “cultural issues” inherent in the M&A integration process.One thing is for sure: cultural synergy is not for free – it requires sound leadership, the right integration approach and mindset, and culturally sensitive integration management.Günter K.

949;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-10-04T10:51:49Z;The perfect CIO;;The experts are unanimous. The “perfect” chief information officer combines a profound understanding of technology and the benefits it can bring to an enterprise with a deep knowledge of his or her company, its industry and its customers.Mark Iwanowski, formerly CIO of software group Oracle and now leading a venture of his own, identifies a sea change in corporate behaviour in the past few years which is aligning business and IT issues more tightly.He notes that an understanding of IT and business experience is a rare combination. “But the top companies, Wal-Mart, General Electric, Federal Express, have best of breed IT systems, giving real competitive advantage.”Rae Sedel, main board director with Russell Reynolds Associates, the international executive search group, and leader of its global technology practice, agrees: “Enough knowledge of IT, business in general and a specific industry – that is a precious combination.”She says chief executives have to ask themselves a basic question in their search for a good – let alone great – CIO: Is information technology strategic to my business?“If it’s a matter of getting the same thing done more quickly and more cheaply, you need somebody who knows the technology, is hands-on, knows what new stuff is coming along and gets things done on time and to budget.“But in some cases, technology is the future of the business. If you’re changing the way you communicate with customers, then you need a different kind of CIO: one who understands where the technology is going, has an excellent feel for the customers and communicates in non-technical language.”Russell Reynolds uses the time-honoured methods of executive search in selecting the second kind of CIO: extensive soundings among industry experts followed by careful questioning.“‘Where have you driven business transformation? How long did it take? What was the outcome? What went wrong and what did you learn?’,” Ms Sedel says.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Micro Focus – a company whose raison d’être is translating old technology into new (75 per cent of large business applications are still running in the 50-year-old Cobol language) – thinks 1990 represented the final fling of the old style CIO, presiding over bigger budgets every year and an endless stream of shiny new technology. CIOs were able to sign off significant capital expenditure on their own.Today, a counter-signature from a business manager is mandatory, he says.In fact, faced with CIO calls for greater status, Mr Kelly says that CEOs are setting their would-be board partners a stiff agenda: do more with less and embed key technologies that are aligned with the business.“The perfect CIO today is a very different beast from his predecessor of 15 years ago. It is someone who is strategy-savvy but also an operator with a powerful awareness of the capabilities of the technology and a healthy degree of cynicism about big projects: someone who is keen to avoid the graveyard of ‘big bangs’.”Mr Kelly believes, nevertheless, that to be a CIO today is to have one of the best jobs in the corporation: “You get involved in a multiplicity of disciplines and conversations with people from the CEO downwards. You can be perceived as a catalyst for change and a positive force.”How to achieve this, however, is another question. Tod Nielsen, chief executive of Borland Software, says the CIO has to become more integrated into the management structure: “Too often,” he says, “CIOs are seen as a peripheral part of the team, treated less as a partner and more as a cost centre.“This has to change if CEOs want more confidence in their IT resources and to know that their IT invesments are providing value to the business. Often CEOs are happy to let CIOs get on with their job with minimum integration within the business and CIOs often don’t push the issue themselves. However, both parties are waking up to the fact that successful, high value IT projects can only be delivered if IT leaders know what is happening across the entire organisation.“The need for IT to align more closely with the business is recognised as the biggest challenge facing IT.”Echoing Mark Iwanowski, he concludes: “If you look at today’s leading companies, they typically have a tight, progressive relationship between CEO and CIO.”In a recent article in CIO Insight, a US magazine, John Parkinson, the columnist, asked why business schools were failing to turn out good CIO candidates, pointing to the trend for CIOs to be business managers who happen to manage IT rather than career technologists rising through the ranks.He pointed to shortcomings in curriculum design which fail to give enough importance to technology: “After all, technology, particularly information and communications technology, is so central to a successful global business that it’s arguable that all managers should have a thorough grounding in what’s possible, what’s reasonable and where the trends in business technology are taking us. At the very least, this would make them better buyers of technology-based solutions and less susceptible to vendor hype.”Martin Warner, a practice director at the consultancy Bearing Point, agrees that management skills are crucial: “We hear phrases such as ‘run IT more like a business’. At the heart of this is a set of problems that focus on the CIO getting the internal management of IT right.“The word ‘management’ in IT is still relatively new in the enterprise and there is an opportunity for CIOs to manage IT better through integrated process innovation in the areas of demand, service and portfolio management.” But he warns: “CIOs’ tenure will continue to shorten while IT maintains a reactive position.”Mr Warner argues for a number of measures of business value in assessing a CIO’s performance against the telling metric – according to him – that the average tenure of a CIO in the UK is 2.6 years and declining.“The first is day-to-day value which equates to customer experience. If we fail on customer experience, that tends to shorten the tenure of the CIO. The second is successful project delivery: it can immediately be translated into the fact that 51 per cent of projects are ‘embattled’ – that immediately affects the business.“Another area is lower IT pricing – this is cycle driven because you tend to set prices and recover your investment or you absorb them in the way that IT costs are absorbed by businesses. And finally, the ability to do things out-of-cycle which I call business-ready innovation.”He says the most obvious indication that a CIO is not up to the job is excessive system downtime: “The issue is not that the systems go down, it’s how you manage the situation when they’re down.“Most CIOs live in an ivory tower: they understand the metrics but they don’t understand or quantify why it’s important to be on top of downtime. A business outage really costs money.”

Yahoo slumped 13 per cent over the five days to $25.52, wiping out the previous eight weeks of gains. The company said third-quarter results would be at the bottom end of their previously forecast range due to slowing advertising revenue.Oracle provided a counterweight to Yahoo’s slump, climbing 7.4 per cent to $17.54. On Wednesday, the software maker reported a 29 per cent increase in first quarter profits, as its chief executive said the company was gaining market share from German rival SAP.Hewlett-Packard shed 3 per cent to $35.11 over the week as its controversial investigation into boardroom leaks to the media began to unnerve investors. News reports said that chief executive Mark Hurd may have had a greater role in the investigation than had previously been thought.Microsoft dipped 0.7 per cent to $26.66. However, the stock has now gained 25 per cent since the middle of June and is back in positive territory for the year.Media group Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times, surged 9.8 per cent to $33.99, its best week in more than two years, after it appointed a special committee to oversee a business review that might lead to a sale of some assets or a leveraged buyout of the group.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent for the week at 1,314.78, a loss on the day of 0.3 per cent, or 3.25 points. On Wednesday, the index briefly hit its highest level in more than five years. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower on the week, losing 0.8 per cent, or 18.82 points, on the day to 2,218.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week down 0.5 per cent, a loss of 0.2 per cent, or 25.13 points, on the day at 11,508.10.Stocks made a brief rally on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent. However, on Thursday the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index fell sharply, increasing investor unease that economic growth was slowing faster than had been thought.“The run-up to this point has been driven by an expectation that the Fed will stop raising rates and get the cooling in the economy they’re looking for,” said Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck.“The price you’re paying for that is uncertainty about how much softening there will be in the economy. A soft landing is something that the Fed cannot engineer. It’s out of their hands.”Fears of a slowdown in manufacturing affected Caterpillar, which sank 4.1 per cent to $62.77 – the week’s worst performance in the Dow. United Technologies, also suffered, losing 3.6 per cent to $62.30.General Motors tumbled 3.3 per cent to $30.62 on reports that talks on a possible alliance with Nissan and Renault had made little progress.Symbol Technologies, a maker of barcode scanners and mobile computers, surged 15.2 per cent to $14.64 after Motorola agreed to buy the company for $3.9bn.Darden Restaurants leapt 9.3 per cent to $42.38 after its first quarter profits beat analyst estimates and it raised earnings guidance for 2006 on bullish forecasts for revenue from its Olive Garden chain of Italian-themed restaurants.Home improvement retailer Home Depot suffered from the slowing housing market, sinking 3.4 per cent to $35.96. The stock has fallen 11 per cent since the beginning of the year.Medical device maker Boston Scientific reported preliminary sales and earnings figures for the third quarter that came in below analyst estimates.

The statement accompanying the decision contained few changes from the August meeting statement.The Fed said the moderation in economic growth appeared to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. In a departure from the August statement, that cooling was no longer described as being gradual.The FOMC added readings of core inflation had been elevated, and high levels of resource utilisation and commodity prices had the potential to sustain inflation pressures. Still, the Fed said inflation pressures seemed likely to moderate over time, thanks in part to lower energy prices.Barclays Capital noted ‘’the statement highlighted more prominently the inflation-reducing benefit of declining energy prices than it did the positive effects of lower energy prices on growth.’’ That leads the bank to think ‘’the Fed may have become more comfortable with its view that inflation will moderate.’’The statement appeared to slightly disappoint those investors hoping for a statement that actively downplayed inflation risk. Treasuries pared early gains and the 10-year yield settled steady around 4.73 per cent. The five-year note remains the richest maturity on the curve versus the funds rate, at a yield of 4.70%. With the two-year note rising a basis point to yield 4.82 per cent, the inversion of the yield curve increased slightly.‘’The Fed has paused, but I think the lack of major changes in today’s communique is a gentle reminder to the markets that expectations of an early-2007 ease are aggressive relative to Fed officials’ outlook,’’ said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich Conn. He expects one more rate hike this year, likely in October, and said ‘’a surge in real consumer spending is probable in light of the energy price drop.’’Eurodollar interest rate futures contracts were little changed after the Fed meeting concluded and continue pricing a rate cut to 5 per cent during the first half of next year. It’s an outlook some bond investors caution is overly aggressive given the tone from the Fed.‘’The bond market is overly optimistic about inflation expectations and are talking about rate cuts within six months but that is not what the Fed is saying,’’ said Anton Pil, head of fixed income at JP Morgan Private Bank in New York.The dollar remained lower for the session against its rivals, as a knee-jerk rally after the Fed meeting subsided.Late on Wednesday afternoon in New York, the greenback was weaker against the yen at Y117.44 and the euro was trading higher on the day at $1.2691.‘’The Fed on hold keeps the carry trade in currencies alive for a couple more months, and the major currency pairs should remain range bound,’’ said Pil.Equities settled near their session highs. After reaching an intra-day peak of 1,328, its highest level since February 12, the S&P 500 index settled at 1,325.18, marking an 0.5 per cent gain.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 11,613.43 while the Nasdaq Composite firmed up 1.4 per cent to 2,252.89.Investors largely shrugged off the Thai and Hungarian tumults, with the Thai stock market closed while the Budapest stockmarket fell 2.2 per cent.

Sacyr shares rose 2 per cent to €31.42.There was a late surge in Vivendi shares as rumours swept through the market that private equity firms KKR and Permira might be looking at the French media and telecommunications group. Vivendi shares settled 3 per cent higher at €27.71.Continental climbed 2.3 per cent to €90.40 amid hopes that the German tyre and car parts maker could be a takeover target after it admitted on Tuesday it had been contacted by a buyer, believed to be private equity firm Bain Capital.Although Conti said the talks had been terminated by mutual consent, many market-watchers believe it could receive further approaches.“Conti has many characteristics which make it an LBO candidate: strong free cashflow; break-up potential; and low debt,” said Thomas Aney, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort.Noting a deal to buy out Conti would be the largest leveraged buyout in German history, Mr Aney pointed out that the company clearly wanted to remain independent: “We believe management has a strong business strategy going forward and does not want to see any outside influence in matters such as acquisitions and corporate structure.”Mr Aney added that the approach would put pressure on management to address the under-leveraged balance sheet with further large acquisitions, special dividends and a share buy-back programme.Rival tyremaker Michelin rose 1.2 per cent to €55.35.Dutch retailer Ahold was the subject of rumours that it was talking about the sale of its US operations to Belgian rival Delhaize.Private equity group Blackstone was also cited as an interested party.Ahold has recently come under pressure from activist hedge funds Paulson & Co and Centaurus Capital – which together own 6.4 per cent of the company – to sell its US arm, which accounts for 75 per cent of group sales.Ahold shares gained 1.4 per cent to €8.08, while Delhaize added 1.8 per cent to €62.20.SAP, the German software group, added 2.4 per cent to €154.78 following a positive set of results from its closest rival, Oracle of the US. French IT services group Atos Origin rose 1.4 per cent to €43.08.“Oracle’s results show there is no slowdown in software demand currently, which was the main concern after SAP’s second-quarter results,” said Ariel Bauer, software analyst at ABN Amro.“The 13 per cent database growth at Oracle is a very good advanced indicator for future software demand, as clients tend to buy databases before they buy software to sit on them.”But Inditex shares continued their recent decline amid concerns about margin pressures at the Spanish clothing retailer.The owner of the Zara chain of shops said first-half gross margins fell to 54.9 per cent of sales from 56.2 per cent in the same period last year.The stock fell 1.6 per cent to €34.11, down 5 per cent from a recent high of €36.Telecommunications stocks attracted fresh demand as investors scrambled to buy into the underperforming sector. Analysts have recently highlighted the improved prospects for the industry.Deutsche Telekom rose 3.1 per cent to €12.07, taking its rise since a mid-August profits warning to more than 13 per cent, while France Telecom gained 2.2 per cent to €17.40.EADS reversed an early decline to finish 0.4 per cent higher at €22.80 despite reports of delays to deliveries of its A380 superjumbo."
955;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Oracle’s resurgence boosts shares;;Oracle’s shares soared more than 11 per cent in early trading in New York on Wednesday after the US business software company continued to show a resurgence of growth in its core database business and a recovery in applications software.Larry Ellison, chief executive, used the company’s latest earnings news on Tuesday to take direct aim at German rival SAP, which until recently had eaten into Oracle’s market in the US. Claiming big gains in market share against SAP, Mr Ellison said Oracle had a good chance to make further advances with the planned 2008 launch of the next generation of its software applications, known as Project Fusion.“We’re going to be out in the marketplace for a full two years,” before SAP’s next new applications, he said. “It’s a tremendous opportunity for us to get way ahead of them.”News of the latest earnings, for the first quarter of Oracle’s fiscal year, added to other signs in recent months that Oracle is starting to reap the gains from its acquisition binge of the past few years, which included the purchase of application software companies PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems.Application sales were weak following those deals, allowing SAP to gain ground, as corporate customers delayed purchases of new software until they had a clearer idea of Oracle’s future technology direction.A recovery in recent months, along with the rebound in database sales, has contributed to a 32 per cent jump in the company’s shares this year.“We believe that our application strategy is working,” Mr Ellison said.Oracle reported a 15 per cent growth in new licence sales in its core database business, to $576m, echoing the solid growth rate seen in the preceding three months. Database sales growth had slowed to the mid-single digits in previous quarters. The database numbers also include results of the faster-growing middleware business, though Oracle does not provide further details.New licence sales of applications software, at $228m, were 80 per cent higher than a year before, thanks in part to the inclusion of results from Siebel, which was acquired earlier this year. Even without that, Wall Street had expected growth of around 40 per cent.Overall, Oracle’s revenues rose 30 per cent to $3.6bn, while net income climbed 29 per cent to $670m, or 13 cents a share. On the pro-forma basis on which Wall Street judges the company, earnings rose by 26 per cent to 18 cents a share, higher than the 16 cents most analysts had expected.
956;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-09-20T13:01:16Z;Oracle/SAP;;"Don King, the uniquely coiffured boxing promoter, may want to consider turning his skills to an area he has previously overlooked: enterprise software. An industry more famed for its jargon is letting rip with the rhetoric. Oracle’s latest quarterly results announcement came with a pointed attack on arch-rival SAP’s performance and strategy. Shai Agassi, SAP’s president of products and technology, was quoted in Forbes recently comparing software acquisitions, Oracle’s strategic hallmark in recent years, to tying a dying horse to another dead horse to “see if it’ll go anywhere”.These are Oracle’s best set of first-quarter results in four years.
But the headline figure of 80 per cent growth year-on-year in new licence sales in applications, where Oracle competes head-on with SAP, should be treated with caution. Sanford Bernstein, adjusting the data for acquisitions, puts pro forma organic growth at 16.4 per cent. That is welcome but not suggestive of market share gains at SAP’s expense on an organic basis. Of more relevance, and indisputably good news, was a jump in database sales: still the biggest part of Oracle’s business. Cross-selling on the back of its database market share remains, sensibly, the core of Oracle’s strategy. And as an early-stage software purchase, healthy database sales provide a shot in the arm for industry sentiment as US economic growth appears to be slowing.In applications, SAP remains Goliath to Oracle’s David – although these latest numbers suggest that Oracle is making progress on integration. Both companies are touting their next-generation development projects, hence the braggadocio, but it is too early to say whose horse will win in the long-term. And this is not a zero-sum game: globally, the top 10 software companies account for less than half of total sales. Quite rightly, the share prices of both companies have risen since Oracle reported."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 4.73 points at 11,396.84.The presidents of the Boston and St. Louis Federal Reserves both said the US economy was continuing to grow robustly, but warned that inflation was above the central bank’s comfort level. Markets were mostly unmoved by the comments.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, said investors were largely trading in a vacuum until the consumer price index data is released on Friday.“We don’t have much to trade off for these first few days of the week,” he said. “You’re not going to be able to make much progress until the end of the week.”Broader fears of a slowdown in global economic growth depressed other commodity prices, especially copper. Phelps Dodge dipped 7.7 per cent to $84.05 and Freeport McMoran declined 7.5 per cent to $53.95.Steelmakers were bruised, with Nucor losing 6.6 per cent to a three-month low of $46.37 and US Steel off 3.5 per cent at $57.93.Dell Computer lost 2.1 per cent to $21.19 after it said it would suspend its share buyback programme and delay filing its quarterly report due to a probe by financial regulators.However, other technology stocks ticked higher.

959;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-09-07T14:01:54Z;Case study: Her Majesty’s Prison Service;;Running a jail poses a particular set of management challenges. For that reason, prison governors have traditionally enjoyed a high degree of autonomy in how their prison is run.But prisons are not islands, and in the UK they are being encouraged to embrace standardised service delivery, key performance indicators and all the other ideas held dear by consultants and mandarins.As well as swallowing the new jargon, prisons are adopting best practices from the broader public sector, including the shared service centre.Newport in Wales is home to the new shared services centre for Her Majesty’s Prison Service (HMPS), which is responsible for the custody of 77,000 prisoners in 128 prisons in England and Wales.The centre went live in May 2006 using Oracle software. The project is being implemented gradually but when fully operational, in April 2008, all the back-office functions for these jails will be performed by a team of 500 people in Newport.In the past, each jail traditionally had its own human resources department, procurement manager and accounts payable clerks. Now, they are no longer needed. The shared service centre approach thus represents a huge and potentially traumatic change, both technologically and culturally.“It’s not just a new IT system,” says Steve Hodgson, head of shared services at HMPS. “There is a whole new process and that has a big impact on the roles of people.”Not least, the role of prison governor. “If you are a prison governor, you are used to having line managers in control of all your resources, so there is an issue about this perceived loss of control,” he says.The big attraction of the shared service centre concept is, of course, economies of scale. By centralising back-office functions, HMPS hopes to reduce the cost of processing transactions by £17m a year. In addition, back office staff are no longer needed in the prisons, so HMPS is looking to slash its salary bill. Overall, HMPS hopes to achieve annual savings of £32m through reduced transaction costs, lower headcount and greater overall efficiency.That is the theory, but how is the project working out in practice? Surprisingly well, according to Mr Hodgson. The potentially traumatic issue of headcount savings has been achieved through natural wastage rather than more “aggressive” polices.“Most public sector organisations are quite paternalistic so three years ago we simply stopped recruiting admin people in the prisons,” he says. Prior to opting for a shared services centre, HMPS had already decided to upgrade its IT systems in three separate projects covering human resources, financials and procurement systems.It made sense to combine these projects and consolidate the IT systems into a single data centre at Newport instead of running separate “instances” of the software in each prison, as was previously the case.The first function to go live on the new system was financial management. “Finance is easier because there are fewer people involved and, besides, people who work in finance are used to doing things in a standardised way,” says Mr Hodgson.Next, the procurement function was brought online. The idea is to encourage “self-service” procurement. This means procurement managers in the prisons would order standard items from an electronic catalogue of preferred suppliers.Again, this represents a big cultural change for the prisons that were used to buying goods independently, typically from local suppliers they could call up on the phone.Mr Hodgson argues these manual requisitions are not only inefficient to process but costly to the public purse because HMPS can negotiate better discounts through centralised buying. “The prison service buys some interesting items, such as security systems, which you cannot put into an electronic catalogue, but other things you can,” he says.During the test phase of the procurement project, HMPS identified potential savings of £53,000 just on buying milk. Put in perspective, the savings on milk could pay the salaries of two prison officers.Nevertheless, some prisons have struggled with the brave new world of e-procurement, which is less tolerant of errors than the previous system of manual requisitions.“Our experience is patchy. Some jails are good at it, but others have yet to get the hang of it,” says Mr Hodgson.Next October, the project will enter a new and delicate stage in which the shared service centre will take over human resource functions, such as payroll, that were previously handled locally. The aim is to halve the HR staff-to-employee ratio but at the same time improve the service delivered to the 48,000 prison staff.The transition is being managed gradually so some staff already have their payroll handled centrally. So far, there have been no complaints about missing paycheques and Mr Hodgson says the step-by-step implementation that HMPS has adopted is designed to minimise the risks.“If we have a problem, it will be a little problem and can be contained,” he says.
960;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-09-07T14:01:54Z;Technology;;Shared services would not be possible without recent advances in IT. The shift to standardised hardware and software coupled with the emergence of the internet has enabled levels of integration and communication that were unthinkable a decade ago.But perhaps the biggest revolution, and one that has only just begun, is the advent of a new way of thinking about IT, dubbed service-oriented architecture (SOA). This promises to finally eliminate the “information silos” that so often frustrate business transformation.The term might seem arcane, but experts believe that only SOA can unlock the full potential of the shared services model. Put simply, a SOA allows an organisation to think of its business processes – and, thus, its IT systems – in terms of a few generic “actions” which need coding only once and can then be re-used many times.That represents a real revolution over the way IT systems have been built in the past. It means IT departments do not have to re-invent the wheel each time a business process is changed or a new application is needed.“SOA is the best opportunity for making software re-use work and it has arrived just as the idea of shared services is starting to take off,” says Alan Hartwell, vice president for technology solutions at Oracle.Yet SOA is an idea that has had to wait its time. Only with the widespread use of internet technologies has it been possible to recast the IT function as a loosely-coupled collection of business services rather than as a set of hard-wired applications, each designed for a specific purpose – the conventional view.“The fundamental difference between traditional IT and the new web-based world is that previously an application was designed to be used by specified people for a specific purpose,” says Carl Bate, chief technology officer at Capgemini. “Now, using a web browser, anyone can connect to any service, but the big challenge this creates is one of managing complexity.”Another challenge is deciding who is in charge. “A lot of IT shared services initiatives are driven from the centre not by the users,” says Mr Bate. “That can create conflicts as the line-of-business units have their own perspectives about delivering new services.”This issue particularly affects the growing number of shared service initiatives in the local government sector and it was highlighted in a recent discussion paper, Transformational Local Government, published by the Chief Information Officers Council.While accepting that shared services offer many benefits, the paper warns that shared services initiatives, if implemented poorly, can conflict with many of the other objectives of local government transformation, such as devolving power to communities or delivering more responsive local services.Nevertheless, the public sector offers some of the best examples of how IT has been used to successfully transform organisations to a shared services culture. Many local authorities have already put in place telephone and web contact handling processes that span different departments, letting customers resolve multiple enquiries at one point of contact.CRM technology is helping overcome the “silos” problem by joining up the disparate bits of information about customer contacts and service requests. Just as important, workflow systems are helping public bodies join up their internal processes.Web portals are helping to join up access to services across a range of government departments, while growing numbers of local authority contact centres and “one-stop shops” include representatives of other public or voluntary sector organisations, so allowing the handling of enquiries that cross traditional organisational boundaries.Massimiliano Claps, IDC’s programme manager for European vertical markets, says the way IT is used in the public sector has matured significantly in recent years. Modernisation initiatives increasingly look beyond the publication of information on the web or the deployment of interactive services. He says the focus now is on using IT to boost efficiency, by re-engineering processes so as to create “joined-up” services across authorities and by sharing common functions.The changing IT needs of public-sector customers have not gone unnoticed by the vendors, which now realise that they must offer solutions that stress the ability to join up processes across various departments and support the deployment of shared services.The big problem, however, is that existing IT platforms are not geared to achieving this joined-up government effect. To achieve it with current practices and traditional IT architectures requires significant capital outlay, which is typically spent on integration and replacing existing systems. That means little funding remains to extend functionality or incorporate new organisations into the shared services culture.SOA promises a better solution. By turning applications into services and sharing data across different platforms, it is no longer necessary to replace “legacy” IT systems to add new functions or perform costly “point-to-point” integration work each time an organisation running a different set of applications joins the shared service centre.“With SOA, you only have to make the business processes work together, not the applications,” says Oracle’s Mr Hartwell.As any IT manager knows, it is easier to standardise business processes rather than applications or IT systems. For example, if a “procure to pay” process is defined and implemented using SOA, then councils can share procurement and achieve potential savings, while continuing to use different IT systems.SOA also enables a wider range of shared services models and delivery approaches. The traditional model is to consolidate into a single physical operation or physical shared service centre. But the new approach focuses on service networks, enabling efficiencies and benefits to be gained without the need for co-locating staff and resources, creating what Capgemini’s Mr Bate calls “virtual shared services”. He gives the example of the Criminal Justice IT (CJIT) information network, which Capgemini has helped develop.“It’s very customer-centric and it’s totally distributed, just like the way the web works. That means it can share of information with other agencies,” says Mr Bate.While it started as a traditional IT integration project, the CJIT network is now starting to take the web approach, meaning that anyone can use it and anyone can publish information to it.“It’s like being able to Google the criminal justice system,” concludes Mr Bate.
961;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-09-07T14:01:53Z;Private sector;;"If 50 people working in a shared service centre based in India can do the work of 100 or more scattered across Europe, what chief executive could resist demanding the change? Pressed by the stock market and global competitors, and vaguely aware that his company’s legacy computer systems cannot provide the support his managers need, he will be impatient for results from shared service developments and all that goes with them.Patience in liberal quantities is usually required, however. Transferring accounting processes from a number of different offices to one or two major centres does not sound too difficult. But the further you delve into the process, the more fundamental the changes to the entire organisation are required.If the management style is essentially decentralised, for example, accounting and IT systems will almost certainly vary even if the basic architecture is the same. A bigger obstacle is likely to be the territorial managers who jealously guard their autonomy from head office and/or other colleagues. Removing their accounting support to some remote location under central control leaves them feeling disempowered.The deeper you dig, the more problems are likely to surface. At software company Oracle, for example, Chris Baker, UK vice president of technology, recalls that when it took the first steps towards its own shared services project in the late 1990s, “we really didn’t know in detail what they (the business units) did, and so we didn’t know what we expected to happen. Lots of things look the same, but in reality, they’re all different.”Even if they start the same, they quickly diverge. Peter Moller, shared services specialist at Deloitte, the consultant, is only semi-joking when he says that “the half-life of a standard process is six months”. Reversing the urge to diverge requires more discipline than many companies can handle.This is especially true of companies that have a long decentralised history such as Unilever. The consumer products group is currently making major efforts to tackle its underlying performance problems as well as rationalising its business services. Its Anglo-Dutch structure, stretched over more than 100 countries, long impeded moves towards unification. But investors demands for faster growth two years ago prompted the selection of a single CEO for the first time, Patrick Cescau, with a centralising remit.His “One Unilever Programme” has simplified the structure into three main lines of business: foods; detergents; and personal care. One of the many benefits is that business services, simplified and standardised, can now be shared across the organisation.For example, a central purchasing and supply chain company catering for all Unilever’s European operations has been established in Schaffhausen in Switzerland. However, for basic financial, HR and IT services, the group has gone one step further by outsourcing them to IBM and Accenture. A €1bn (£680m) savings target has been set for the end of 2007.For most companies, the promise of shared services is wrapped up with enterprise resource planning systems, which process all the business transactions and perform other major clerical tasks such as payroll, time recording and so on. No two companies are alike, of course, and much of the corporate trauma that ERP has caused in the past has been due to the attempt to squeeze their operations into standardised products that don’t fit the complexities of individual businesses.Improvements in ERP and the hardware that enables them, have cut the rate of failure but heightened the need for standardisation. That is as common to shared services as it is to ERP, and in practice the two support each other.Which should come first? Carole Murphy, Capgemini’s vice president for finance and shared services, thinks it all depends on a company’s style and history. Only the bravest and most agile attempt both at once.One example is the car hire company Avis Europe. Three years ago it decided on a radical reform of its back office and IT functions to improve its performance in a cut-throat market. A shared service centre would be set up in Budapest, a new ERP system would be installed and the IT function restructured.A year later, the SSC was up and running and the first of the transfers of administrative processes had been completed successfully. The ERP system hit big obstacles, however, and the official Avis communique tersely blamed “a number of fundamental problems with its design and implementation. A decision has been taken to terminate the development of the new system as quickly as practicable to avoid further cost.” That year, the company announced a loss of €20m before tax.Today, however, its Budapest SSC caters for 11 European countries, and by the end of this year will have hit 80 per cent of the original target. Nigel Carrigan, its managing director, says that “it was a difficult journey, but a year or two on, the services offer better quality and more control to the line managers because of better transparency.” Unsurprisingly, that has gone a long way to convincing them of the centre’s value and in 2005, profits bounced back to nearly €30m.Telecoms company Ericsson was in a similar fix in the first few years of this century, as it struggled to keep up with the pace of change in the telecoms industry. It had made a few desultory efforts towards regional and local shared services in the late 1990s, and by 2003 had cut its finance staff by 50 per cent, but there were still over 100 different local units with their own accounting conventions.Like Avis Europe, it installed a common IT platform for the group, and introduced a global standard ERP system. Unlike Avis Europe, these have worked well, so the SSCs had a firm base on which to build. The first steps were to set up 12 regional SSCs under unified management to separate them from operating units and insist on adherence to global standards. Some of the processes are now being transferred to the group’s global SSC in Manila.“It’s a process that will never be completed,” reflects Stig Christensen, head of global finance and accounting operations and shared services at Ericsson. “It’s a constant journey, and we’re already planning the next step towards further integration.”In the modern globalised economy, nothing less will suffice."

compensation committee believed “there is benefit” in ensuring executives comply with reporting requirements.While many companies, from Amgen to Bank of America, already have compliance policies in place to handle political donations, legal experts in Washington say corporate requests for advice on political giving and lobbying have markedly increased in recent months, partly because companies realise that deficiencies in their compliance programmes represent a potential liability in a town that is tightly regulated by rules governing how companies may interact with elected officials.Kenneth Gross, a partner at Skadden Arps in Washington who specialises in advising corporate clients on campaign finance rules, says that, given increased scrutiny of companies’ activities in Washington by regulators, prosecutors, and the press, it is no longer good enough for executives to simply believe they know what the rules are.“People are confused about where you draw the line between a political contribution, illegal gratuity [involving entertainment of public officials] and a bribe,” Mr Gross says. “Companies ask us to draw the line, and then we take three steps back from that line, to the point where I’m not even close enough to the foul line to get chalk on my shoes.”He and other experts cite Altria, the tobacco group, as one company that has developed a good model for its compliance programme, including the use of elaborate role-playing exercises for senior executives that address some of the ambiguities of what is, and is not, permissible when it comes to dealing with current or former public officials.While Mr Gross says he believes companies are generally sensitive to rules involving their political action committees, or PACs – highly-regulated funds companies set up to donate to candidates or causes – compliance sometimes falls short when it comes to fund- raisers for candidates that are organised by executives and corporate lobbying disclosures.If, for example, a chief executive seeks to raise $100,000 (£52,500) for a candidate, he or she can only seek the help of a company secretary if the activity is limited to other corporate employees.“If the CEO goes to the country club to fundraise, you can’t use your own secretary,” Mr Gross says, citing a record fine brought by the Federal Election Commission against Freddie Mac.The federal home mortgage company was forced to pay a $3.8m penalty in April because it used corporate resources to facilitate 85 fundraisers.In another example, involving lobbying, Mr Gross says companies do not always realise that the resources spent by a company lobbying public officials – even by employees who are not technically lobbyists – must be recorded in disclosure forms.“Let’s say you are an engineer accompanying your in-house counsel to [discuss pollution standards with a member of Congress]. Just because you are wearing a plastic pocket protector doesn’t mean you aren’t lobbying. His time and expenses has to be included in lobbying forms,” he says.Another expert, Jan Baran of Wiley Rein & Fielding, says that while companies most frequently make administrative errors in connection to their political giving, there has also been a recent uptick in the number of instances where corporate officials are found siphoning funds for themselves.In one case this month, Lockheed Martin’s political action committee agreed to pay $27,000 to the Federal Election Commission after it emerged the the committee’s former treasurer had allegedly embezzled tens of thousands of dollars from the committee.Keith Darcy, executive director of the Ethics and Compliance Officers Association, says that while companies have in recent years devoted much attention to compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance legislation, that the scandal surrounding Jack Abramoff, the former Republican super lobbyist who has pleaded guilty to corruption charges, has forced members of his organisation to pay closer attention to the complexities of lobbying and campaign finance rules."
963;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-08-15T18:10:28Z;Tech cash piles;;Is Carl Icahn ready to take a pop at Silicon Valley’s flabby balance sheets? The veteran shareholder activist’s $110m stake in Symantec could simply reflect a view that the shares are undervalued. But, even after its recent buy-back plans, the cash generative software group would have room to return more to shareholders.Either way, pressure is likely to keep building for technology companies to answer the question of how to structure balance sheets in today’s slower growth environment.Until now, most have been loath to return their cash mountains to shareholders. Given the rapid technology shifts that can occur, executives have enjoyed the security of big cash cushions. Strong balance sheets also provide flexibility to invest in new opportunities.But as many areas have matured, profits have become somewhat more predictable and the number of new high-return investment opportunities has diminished. The excuses for hanging on to cash have started to wear thin, especially for companies that can easily fund research and development needs out of cash flows.Things are beginning to change. Microsoft paid a special dividend – although this hardly dented its formidable balance sheet. Others, such as Oracle and Cisco, made big acquisitions for cash instead of paper.However, Goldman Sachs estimates that the technology sector could still return $118bn if major companies restructured their balance sheets. This would enhance stated returns. After all net cash, offering puny returns, represents more than 10 per cent of sector market capitalisation.The challenge for many will be how to rejig their balance sheets without worrying the market they have run out of ideas.Some should simply accept reality, and focus on returns because their market segment has gone ex-growth. An efficient capital structure and emphasis on cost control could make a big difference.But there is a risk that a number will make questionable acquisitions to prove they have a healthy future and to help get rid of the cash burning a hole in their pockets.
964;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-08-14T20:43:34Z;Wall St up despite late decline;;Wall Street pared gains on Monday after a strong morning rally driven by lower oil prices and more positive news from the Middle East fizzled out.All the major indices had been up by at least 1 per cent on the day but began trading lower in mid-afternoon to finish only modestly higher.Ceasefire news dragged crude prices and energy sector stocks lower. Of the 10 worst performing stocks in the S&P 500, six were in the sector. ConocoPhillips sank 2.3 per cent to $66.82, while Valero Energy lost 2.4 per cent to $63.24.Airline stocks, however, were among the beneficiaries. JetBlue Airways added 2.3 per cent to $10.06 and American Airlines’ parent AMR gained 2.3 per cent to $19.26.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.47 points, at 1,268.21. The Nasdaq Composite had gained 0.6 per cent, or 11.33 points, at 2,069.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 9.84 points at 11,097.87.Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said the afternoon fall was caused by traders closing positions ahead of the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Tuesday.“What we’re seeing is traders taking any opportunity to bag a profit, even if it’s on a one-day move, especially if it’s in front of a PPI number,” he said.Caterpillar was one of the most whipsawed stocks of the day. It climbed as high as 2.4 per cent, only to turn lower, and close down 1.6 per cent to $65.96.Technology stocks staged a rally. Intel ticked up 2.6 per cent to $17.87. Software-maker Oracle rose 2 per cent to $15.29 after it said it was increasing its stake in Indian software company I-flex.Networking equipment maker Cisco Systems gained following bullish comments in Barron’s, the weekly investment magazine, which said the company would benefit from telecommunications companies upgrading their networks. Its shares added 2.8 per cent to $20.09. Juniper Networks also gained, adding 2 per cent to $12.44.Ford Motor gained 6.2 per cent to $7.83 after the stock was upgraded from “underperform” to “outperform” by Bear Stearns. Ford has gained 25 per cent in the past three weeks.SunTrust Banks tumbled 3.8 per cent to $76.55, its worst single-day loss since May 2004. The fall came after it lowered its full-year forecast for net interest income growth due to rising competition and interest rate pressures. The bank said credit losses could rise due to a $200m non-performing loan.Dillard’s, the department store, jumped 5.6 per cent to $33.08 after it swung to a $15.7m profit in the second quarter from a loss in the same period last year. Nordstrom, which reports earnings on Thursday, gained 1.5 per cent to $34.81, while Federated Department Stores gained 2.7 per cent to $36.90.
965;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-08-14T18:18:27Z;Oracle increases role in I-flex growth;;Oracle could raise its stake in I-flex, Indian software group, by as much as $610m, boosting its involvement in banking industry software through an unusual arrangement under which it has left local managers in control.The US company said on Monday that it would inject $125m into I-flex to help back an acquisition by the company, along with other growth plans.It added that the purchase triggers a provision of Indian law requiring it to offer to buy up to 20 per cent more of the company’s outstanding shares, a stake that would be worth $485m.Oracle took a majority stake in I-flex last year as part of its broader push into applications software.While that strategy has involved the outright acquisition of other, bigger applications companies such as PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems, the US company has left I-flex under the control of its existing managers.Chuck Phillips, Oracle co-president, has joined the I-flex board, though the US company took a decision at the outset to leave the company’s founders and long-time management team in charge, according to the Indian company.Oracle refused to comment on its plans for the Indian group.Rajesh Hukku and R Ravisankar, former Citibank software engineers, started I-flex in 1992 with the help of a $400,000 investment from the bank’s venture capital arm.That stake, representing about 42 per cent of the company, was eventually sold to Oracle a year ago for $593m.In all, the US software company has already invested $1bn in the Indian company, which makes applications software used by many of the world’s biggest banks, according to I-flex.The latest investment will enable I-flex to mount its biggest international venture to date, with its purchase of Mantas, US software company, for $123m. Mantas specialises in software to detect money-laundering.Oracle said that the cash it had injected to back the Mantas stake would lift its stake in I-flex to 55.1 per cent. It said its offer for a further 20 per cent of the company would be made at Rs 1,475 ($31.77) a share, a price that values the company at about $2.4bn, or 70 per cent more than the valuation implied by its initial investment.I-flex said its revenues had risen 15 per cent in the year to the end of March, to $333m.Oracle’s shares climbed by nearly 2.5 per cent early Monday afternoon in New York to $15.37.
966;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
967;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-08-10T17:55:38Z;IBM buys FileNet for $1.6bn;;IBM threw down a challenge to database rival Oracle on Thursday with a $1.6bn acquisition that marks its biggest software purchase in three years.The acquisition of FileNet, a company that sells the content management systems that companies use to capture and manage many different types of digital documents, will also push IBM deeper into the software business at a time when its bigger hardware and services divisions have been struggling to grow.The deal is set to double IBM’s share of the content management business and put it ahead of current industry leader Documentum, which was bought three years ago by storage company EMC.Between them, IBM and FileNet accounted for about 18 per cent of the $3.2bn content management business last year, compared with 11 per cent for EMC, according to figures compiled by IDC.That will put further pressure on Oracle to respond with an acquisition of its own, said Jim Murphy, a research director at AMR Research.By helping to organise the many different types of “unstructured” data that companies amass, companies such as FileNet have become a critical part of the broader information management software that companies like IBM and Oracle are looking to sell. Shares in Open Text, the largest remaining independent company in the sector, climbed 3 per cent on news of the FileNet acquisition.While FileNet “does not have any capabilities they don’t already have themselves,” the purchase of a company that last year had total revenues of $423m and net income of $40m will bulk up IBM’s presence in a corner of the software business that is likely to continue to see solid growth, said Mr Murphy.The acquisition comes at a time when Oracle threatens to overtake IBM as the world’s second-largest software company, thanks to faster growth in its core database business and a string of big acquisitions of its own.Last year Oracle’s revenues jumped to $14.4bn, while IBM’s revenues from software edged up by 4.4 per cent, to $15.7bn.Sam Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive, has recently accelerated its push into the infrastructure software and middleware on which large corporate IT systems are built. IBM has made more than 50 software acquisitions in the past 10 years.By comparison other big hardware companies, moving later than IBM into a business with greater profit and growth potential than their traditional businesses, have responded with more sizeable deals.HP’s planned acquisition of Mercury Interactive, announced last month, will double its software revenues to around $2bn, putting it among the top dozen software companies, alongside EMC, which has also mounted a series of big purchases.In the most recent quarter, IBM’s software division accounted for 19 per cent of the group’s overall revenues but 40 per cent of its gross profits.
968;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-07-30T18:37:04Z;How to hit outsized jackpots in private equity;;And it is not by doing multi-billion buy-outsIn private equity, buy-outs attract the big money and most of the big headlines, as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts demonstrated once again last week with its $33bn (£17.7bn) proposed mega deal for HCA, the US hospital operator.Yet it is venture capital that produces the real jackpots. For proof, look at the latest biannual report of the Yale Endowment. This reveals that the university’s initial $300,000 investment in Google generated an incredible $75m gain when the company went public in 2004. This was no flash in the pan.In the 1970s and 1980s, Yale invested in many of the start-ups that defined the technology industry, including Compaq Computer, Oracle, Genentech, Dell Computer and Amgen.In the 1990s, it backed Amazon.com, Yahoo, Cisco Systems, Red Hat and Juniper Networks. Quite a bag.Since the university started investing in private equity in 1973, the asset class has generated an average annual return of 31 per cent. Over the past 10 years, the average return has been a phenomenal 39.5 per cent.As the fund has long been overweight in private equity, this has made a significant contribution to the endowment’s outstanding average annual return over two decades of 16 per cent, which has raised the value more than tenfold to $15bn.The key to the endowment’s success in private equity has been the choice of managers, along with a carefully judged alignment of interests. In venture capital, it has invested with Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and Sutter Hill. Its buy-out partners include Bain Capital (which is a partner with KKR and Merrill Lynch in the HCA deal), Berkshire Partners, Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Madison Dearborn Partners.What a shame that European universities have done nothing to compare with the likes of Yale, Harvard or Princeton, all of which have profited handsomely from a strong portfolio bias towards alternative assets such as private equity, real assets and absolute return investments.The sad fact is that Europe lacks the innovative capability in technology to provide potential investment jackpots. Indeed, Yale regards Europe as fruitful buy-out territory but looks to Asia for foreign venture capital opportunities.The architect of Yale’s stupendous performance over the past 20 years is David Swensen, the endowment’s chief investment officer. Unlike that other noted guru Warren Buffett, he attracts few headlines and writes investment books that contain much more wisdom than wit.Also unlike Warren Buffett, he has managed to maintain the outperformance momentum – though, in fairness to Mr Buffett, Yale does have the advantage of managing a much smaller pot of money.Sniping at MynersPaul Myners was forced from the chairmanship of Marks and Spencer by Kevin Lomax, the senior independent director, on the basis that his relationship with Stuart Rose, chief executive, was too close.Now people are raising eyebrows because Stuart Rose is on the nomination committee that last week appointed Mr Myners to the chairmanship of Land Securities.This looks to me a classic example of putting corporate governance form before substance. Paul Myners did an outstanding job at Marks and Spencer in fighting off a potential bid from Philip Green and appointing a chief executive who is putting the retailer back on track.He has the energy, credentials and integrity to do an equally good job at Britain’s largest property company.The notion that he lacked the independence and objectivity to run the M&S board is frankly bizarre, as is the idea that he might not bring these qualities to Land Securities.What surprises me is that other members of the M&S board were persuaded to shed their chairman by a man who had been criticised on governance grounds at software group Misys for combining the roles of chairman and chief executive.Limits of disclosureGiven the egregious nature of so many compensation packages in the US boardroom, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s new rules to force more disclosure of pay, perquisites and the timing of stock option grants looks overdue.Whether they will be enough is another matter.Under the US’s Soviet-style plurality voting system, shareholders cannot respond to inappropriate pay by ousting directors through voting against their re-election. Nor, in the absence of a meaningful vote, will it be possible to address the problem of big rewards for failure, which provide such a dangerous incentive for chief executive officers to bet the company.As Stephen Davis of the Global Proxy Watch newsletter points out, the SEC has missed an opportunity to extract disclosure about compensation consultants’ conflicts of interest. No doubt consultants will earn yet more fees for advising on the new rules.john.plender@ft.comwww.ft.com/plender
969;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Microsoft absorbs units into overall results;;Microsoft said it would stop reporting separate results for its mobile and business applications software divisions – loss-making units that have been slow to fulfil the company’s hopes for long-term growth.The software company said the changes reflected the completion of an internal reorganisation that has seen its business consolidated into three main operating arms, and echoed the way that the businesses were now managed internally.Microsoft Business Solutions, which sells software applications for small and medium-sized businesses in competition with companies such as SAP and Oracle, has lost $185m on sales of $1.4bn over the past seven quarters and has already been through a management shake-up.Starting with the fiscal year that began this month, the company said its results would be combined with the far larger Information Worker unit, which is based on the Office suite of desktop applications.By also adding in the results of the Exchange e-mail server business, which had previously been reported as part of the server operations, the new combined unit, to be called Microsoft Business Division, will become the company’s largest single segment, eclipsing the Windows client business.Meanwhile, results of the Mobile and Embedded Devices division, which has struggled to gain a foothold in the mobile handset business, will be absorbed into the home and entertainment division, which is based on the Xbox games console.
970;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-07-16T17:02:52Z;SAP’s quiet achiever makes a big noise;;"Henning Kagermann talks softly and talks well. He can deftly translate the forest of acronyms that makes SAP’s business of making and selling business software such an impenetrable affair for those who can’t tell their CRM from their ERP.“We are the engine, if you like. You need a strong engine to power everything else,” he says, describing new software – ESA (enterprise systems architecture) to those in the know – that allows accounts, inventory or customer management programs made by SAP or its rivals to communicate with each other.Without fanfare Mr Kagermann has spent the past three years steering the world’s biggest business software maker through the wreckage of the technology boom. He pumped money into research, making a push to come up with more user-friendly, web browser-based software.“Organic growth” has been his clarion call. He believes it will allow him to put more distance between SAP and its arch-rival Oracle, whose market share
is still less than half that
of the German company.With the launch of the new ESA, the software supplier to many of the world’s biggest corporations hopes to win new customers in small and medium-sized companies. The target is for sales of €8.5bn ($10.8bn) to double by 2010. This represents a genuine departure. Instead of striving to offer a computer program for every niche of business life, Mr Kagermann wants to make SAP the platform for other providers.“There are some important companies that are strong in [sections of] the market – and we want to earn a bit of money with them,” he says, pointing to deals with Microsoft (to hook “Office” into SAP software) or IBM (to do the same for databases).This flow of clear and quiet logic is interrupted if he is asked anything personal. His crisp blue gaze lowers, as if to avoid the embarrassment of any trivial personal revelation.Mr Kagermann does talk about the fact that he joined the company in 1982 as “something like the 86th employee” and that “everybody played some kind of ball game”, in the spirit of the sports-mad founding trio, Hasso Plattner, Klaus Tschira and Dietmar Hopp. But he interrupts the reverie. “I organised a volleyball team, but it didn’t last long,” he says, before switching back to business: “In sporting terms, I’m not going to leave SAP a great legacy.”Is he looking ahead to life at Europe’s largest software company after Henning Kagermann? For months he has refused to say whether he will renew his contract before it runs out next year.“It’s not a question that will affect our success or our strategy,” he says. “A decision hasn’t been made yet. The time isn’t ripe.”Investors might disagree on both counts. Since taking over as sole chief executive of the world’s number three software house in 2003, the
cerebral Mr Kagermann has more than filled the mantle of his brilliant and sometimes rowdy predecessor, Mr Plattner.Since Mr Plattner ceded control to his co-chief, Mr Kagermann has increased SAP’s share of the market for enterprise resource planning (ERP) programs with more than one function from 35 per cent to 43 per cent, according to AMR Research.Even though the US group spent about $19bn buying up rivals, Oracle has 19 per cent of the ERP market. In 2003, it and Peoplesoft, now part of Oracle, held 25 per cent.Double-digit growth in annual sales and profits has become the hallmark of the Kagermann era – and hints of less-than-stellar performance rattle investors. Last week, SAP said sales of software licences grew only 8 per cent in the second quarter as big orders were held up, and its shares dropped 5 per cent. But even quarterly blips cannot hide Mr Kagermann’s success. Operating profit margin rose from 22 per cent in 2002 to almost 28 per cent last year, raising group valuation by half to €70bn. In Germany, only Deutsche Telekom and Eon are worth more.Of course, Mr Kagermann stresses this isn’t only his doing. “We’re a team,” he says. “That means someone can always take over when someone else goes . . . It gets really dangerous when things . . . get attached too much to one individual.”The former Brunswick University professor of physics appears to place more trust in systems than in personalities. After all, he abandoned that career to become a developer for a company that was committed to banishing the unreliable, human aspect from business.In SAP Mr Kagermann seems to have found a company in which good organisation is more important than the one leading light. Alluding to his own career, he says it is “statistically proven” that new bosses from within a company do better than those drafted in.This suggests his choice of successor would, if one were needed, fall on one of his six board colleagues. The wily marketing head Léo Apotheker and the enthusiastic, young development boss Shai Agassi are seen as front-runners.But Mr Kagermann’s love of systems glosses over how important his personality has become to a company that is suffering as much as it is celebrating. German workers have become restive about the pace of jobs growth overseas; union influence has risen.The majority of the 5,000 people SAP took on last year joined foreign operations. Only 40 per cent of the 34,000 employees are now based in Germany, a quotient that will drop further as more research and development goes to the US or India.With swept-back grey hair and raked eyebrows, Mr Kagermann carries a hint of the mad professor. But to many German employees, he is a consoling figure – more so than Mr Apotheker, a German based in Paris, or Mr Agassi, an Israeli based in Palo Alto.That is quite a feat. Mr Plattner had for decades been a gregarious and out-spoken ambassador for the company. He was famous for public spats about strategy with Oracle’s founder Larry Ellison and for playing the guitar at SAP’s big customer schmoozes.His chosen successor, by contrast, was the quiet man nobody really knew. Many industry observers wondered whether Mr Kagermann, who started at SAP as a developer for cost-control software, was the right man for a big job in a sector full of big egos.Mr Kagermann’s refusal to join the dotcom personality parade was based on the conviction that actions speak louder than words. “You influence people less by talking to them,” he says of running SAP, “than through what you do.”His approach had an effect. Andrew Nelson, founder of Tomorrow Now, a small support firm SAP bought last year, says of Mr Kagermann: “He keeps it simple. He keeps the client in mind. Way too often in this industry, egos and vanity get in the way.”Ironically, the resulting anti-persona has become Mr Kagermann’s distinguishing feature. He has spread a quiet confidence that has even helped calm the worst fears of German staff. The public discussion about foreign influence on SAP has died down.Clients like this assurance – though it can exasperate. Mr Kagermann tells of a visit to a sceptical Japanese executive, who listed his needs to explain why he was not running SAP. Mr Kagermann recalls interrupting: “But we can do that . . . and we can do that . . . and we can do that.”He smiles. “I’ve only once seen a Japanese person get angry. They’re usually such a polite people,” he adds with a glimmer of mischief.No wonder he has been able to rile Oracle executives just as effectively as the more vociferous Mr Plattner once did.WARY RECRUIT TO THE INTERNET WARNS OF HYPEAs chief executive of the world’s third-biggest software company after Microsoft and Oracle, Henning Kagermann is a key player when it comes to the development of information technology. But he is still a wary recruit to the internet.He says his internet habits are “pretty conservative” and praises Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia based on contributions from its users. “But some of the other things you can do smack of Big Brother – in the Orwellian sense,” Mr Kagermann complains.“What is the point of taking photos of some star and putting them on the web and telling everyone to come and have a look – it’s voyeurism,” he says, a remark that speaks volumes about his own reticence.Mr Kagermann notes that as a maker of business rather than consumer software, he can afford to keep his distance for now. Free-mail may be a threat to Microsoft’s Outlook e-mail program. “But it will take a while for people to offer free accounting on the web.”Mr Kagermann admits that if consumers like the features now being dreamt up by platforms such as Google, “they will want to use it at the workplace, too”, but he stresses he is still not totally certain that this will be the case.With the likes of Google making money for the first time, a “new chapter” does appear to be opening, he says. But he warns of taking “all the hype” at face value and reminds that consumers in the end may determine a course no one yet sees.“Remember online banking? When it started, everyone said that was the end of high-street banking. But now we have both,” he says.The internet “revolution” might in a similar way evolve into a “mixed landscape” of new and old services – and software – suppliers."
971;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-07-13T19:18:14Z;SAP;;Being priced for perfection is always a bit of a mixed blessing. That is especially so for a company that has a proud record of under-promising and over-delivering – making any stumble all the more painful. Take SAP, whose sales shortfall for the second quarter sent its shares down by more than 6 per cent.That looks a little harsh. SAP’s explanation sounds credible, that the gap of about $55m between recorded licence revenues and consensus expectations reflects delays rather than cancellations. Given the lumpy nature of large enterprise software contracts, such timing issues are not unusual and were one reason for SAP’s solid first quarter. It certainly appears premature to see its second quarter slip as evidence of either a looming slowdown in IT spending or the ability of rival Oracle to claw back market share after digesting recent acquisitions.But investors are edgy, following recent warnings from other software makers, such as Business Objects. Moreover, the fact that licence sales appear to have fallen short of expectations throughout much of the world does not square well with SAP pinning the blame on just a handful of European markets. It still has a bit of explaining to do when it announces its actual results in a week and might also need to tweak the full-year guidance it has just reiterated.The idea of disclosing price sensitive information is laudable. But the episode is a reminder of how the vagaries in German securities law can force companies to share selected highlights before they are ready to explain them properly. Beyond that, it is worth keeping in mind that SAP has retained a sizeable valuation premium compared to rivals through-out pockets of turbulence. At 25 times this year’s earnings, its shares look cheap by historic standards and might offer some trading opportunities. With global economic uncertainties on the rise, however, their longer-term appeal looks limited.
972;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-07-13T17:33:26Z;SAP tumbles on weak licence growth;;SAP, the world’s largest business software group, worried investors on Thursday as it warned that growth in sales of new software licences were well below market expectations for the second quarter.Shares in the German company fell 6 per cent lower to just below €150 ($190), having tumbled as much as 10 per cent after the announcement. SAP said licensing revenues grew just 8 per cent to €621m in the three months to the end of June. Following a 22 per cent rise in software revenues in the first quarter, analysts had expected 17 per cent growth in the second to about €675m.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, admitted that, following a long run of increasing market share, SAP had lost ground to its closest rivals, Oracle and Microsoft, by 1 or 2 percentage points. He added that in the wider market, SAP continued to make gains.Mr Kagermann dismissed talk of a software market slowdown, blaming a failure to close some large European deals and added that he expected them to be booked in the second half.Observers had been upbeat on SAP’s prospects for the quarter after its rival, Oracle, reported a robust performance in its final quarter, which covered the same three-month period, although the last three months of the financial year are always the strongest for software companies.Oracle has spent $20bn expanding through acquisitions, in contrast to SAP’s organic approach to growth. Oracle’s sales jumped 25 per cent in its final three months, while Larry Ellison, chief executive, claimed it was gaining market share across all its product lines.SAP reported a rise in total sales of 9 per cent to €2.2bn – also lower than expected – with product revenues up 9 per cent at €1.48bn and net income 38 per cent higher at €432m.The company reaffirmed its outlook for the full year, saying that product revenues would grow 13-15 per cent compared with 2005, with software revenue growth up 15-17 per cent.With the company needing to earn €2bn of revenues in the second half to meet targets, some analysts said SAP might have an uphill struggle.Additional reporting by Martin Ottomeier in Hamburg
973;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-07-11T14:34:37Z;PeopleSoft product line updated;;Oracle has come good on its promise to update the product line of PeopleSoft, the former rival it acquired in 2004.The first product in the new PeopleSoft Enterprise Release 9 suite is for enterprise learning and Oracle promises further enhancements in areas such as CRM, corporate governance and enterprise performance management.Oracle had to backtrack on its original plan to force PeopleSoft users to migrate to its new Fusion suite after seeing them being wooed by rival vendors.Tagging improvedRFID (radio frequency identification) is here to stay, according to Microsoft, and the next release of its BizTalk Server software will support the electronic tagging technology. The BizTalk Server 2006 R2 has improved supply chain capabilities designed to improve links between a business and its external supply chains. As well as RFID and XML-based business processes, the new release supports legacy EDI-based trading networks, still widely used.Compliance helpAvaska is the latest start-up working in the compliance field. Many regulations require businesses to know who has access to what and who did what and when. Those that do not, face regulatory repercussions and run business risks, argues Avaska. Its Compliance Manager software helps businesses automate the labour-intensive tasks associated with controlling and monitoring IT users, without them having to re-invent the compliance wheel each time a new regulation is introduced.Help to sellSalesforce.com wants to help businesses create a single sales force straddling direct and indirect channels. Partnerforce, its new partnership relationship management service, allows businesses to share information not just from their own direct salespeople but from partners as well.One of the problems with PRM to date is that indirect sales channels fear the vendor’s direct sales force will steal their leads. Salesforce.com argues that the problem can be minimised by using PRM to generate sales leads for partners as well as direct sales teams.Saas for salesNetsuite, a rival to Salesforce.com in hosted software, hopes to popularise the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model through a deal with CompUSA, the US chain of computer stores.The initiative is aimed at smaller companies that feel more comfortable talking to a salesperson rather than viewing Salesforce.com’s SaaS offerings online. CompUSA’s in-store business centres will provide a single point of contact for Netsuite’s products, plus training and implementation services.Linking made easyMiddleware has long been a bastion of proprietary technologies but now an open-source technology, called Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP), promises to reduce the cost of linking applications together. One of the biggest beneficiaries is likely to be the financial services industry and much of the impetus for the fledgling standard has come from banks tired of paying licence fees to proprietary middleware vendors such as IBM and Tibco. JPMorgan Chase is already using AMQP for a real-world trading system.
974;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-07-11T14:27:14Z;Chris Nuttall: To boldly go beyond search;;What has Google done for the enterprise lately?Sadly, not a lot – its mission seems more aligned with the Starship Enterprise than business needs. It is interested in space – Google Mars for instance – the final frontier of capturing all the world’s information and boldly going where no search engine company has gone before.Providing service and support for a relational database, entering into a service level agreement for a suite of office productivity tools or installing servers to run an IT infrastructure sound altogether too mundane for the innovative Mountain View company.That should be a mighty relief to the likes of Microsoft, Oracle and Hewlett Packard, who may justifiably feel they have little to fear from Google in their core competencies.Google does not have to serve the enterprise, of course, when 99 per cent of its revenues come from advertising and are showing spectacular growth.“But there will come a day when those revenues are flat and at that point the enterprise software and services market is going to seem very exciting and they are going to want to talk about that to Wall Street,” Whit Andrews, a Gartner analyst, told me last week.Gartner has been looking at Google’s enterprise intentions and wondering where they may lead.Google’s regular tactic of throwing different jellies at a wall of users and seeing which sticks does not constitute a strategy for success in the enterprise, which insists on products that are ready for primetime, 99.9 per cent reliability and someone there to fix things when they go wrong.Google’s most serious effort in the enterprise to date has been the Google search appliance, although the bright yellow box with holes in it resembles more a slice of Swiss cheese than a blade server. But, from $30,000, the server will index and search half a million documents and, with the smaller Google Mini box, it has won 4,000 customers for the company.“I’ve spoken to about 20 to 25 of these and they tell me that when they want support, Google says: ‘Yes, we know there’s a problem, we’ll get to it’,” says Mr Andrews.“That’s something they have to change – they need a clear vision they can tell enterprises about. Enterprises know what Microsoft is doing, they have a road map, they have manuals, training, you get a sense of what they are going to do for you.”But Google’s Enterprise division is still tiny – made up of only 200 employees from its 6,000 strong workforce. Dave Girouard, its general manager, represents it as a semi-autonomous start-up within the company.He foresees a day when search will become so vital to enterprise employees for accessing the information they need that Google could become central to the workplace.First though, it will have to match the skills of bigger enterprise search companies such as Autonomy in dealing with legacy systems, unstructured data and security issues such as restricting company data sets only to those who have privileges.The Enterprise team is also hard at work trying to adapt for business use Google products originally aimed at consumers and in beta, that are now becoming fully developed.Google Maps for Enterprise was launched last month. This offers full enterprise licensing and support for its Maps service, meaning businesses can “map customer locations, track shipments, manage facilities” etc and publish these on their websites or intranets.It is also at the early stages of testing its Gmail e-mail service with universities and small businesses. The thinking seems to be that e-mail is very much tied up with search and company information and Gmail is a natural complement to its search appliance.Beyond that, Google has introduced an online calendar in beta recently and a spreadsheet application. It has acquired Writely, a word processor inside a web browser, and all it needs to complete a Microsoft Office-type basic suite of applications is a Powerpoint alternative.In addition, services such as Google Video, Picasa photo editing software and its Blogger tool for creating web logs could all find uses in the enterprise.The problem for Google is integrating them into a clearly defined product set and developing a licensing or subscription model very different from its current advertising one.Google’s products and their constant updates lend themselves very much to the software-as-a-service online model, enabling workers to collaborate in an ad hoc way over the web.This sounds like the future, but the Starship Google needs to engage a different warp factor to achieve it.As it stands, the state of its enterprise solutions is more akin to a frantic Scottie in the engine room shouting “She canna take much more captain,” up to the bridge.
975;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-06-28T00:07:06Z;Ellison rescinds $115m Harvard gift;;Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, the business software group, has decided against a promised $115m donation to establish a centre for the study of health care projects at Harvard University.The decision marks the first concrete fallout from the resignation earlier this year of Larry Summers, Harvard’s president, following a faculty revolt.An Oracle spokesman said on Tuesday that Mr Ellison’s decision to withdraw his pledge was “directly related” to the departure of Mr Summers, the controversial former US treasury secretary, whose brusque management style frequently clashed with members of the Harvard faculty.“Larry Summers was the brainchild of this initiative. He and Larry Ellison had several dicussions about it. His last day at Harvard is this week, and his departure from Harvard is really the reason that Larry decided to reconsider the decision,” the spokesman said.He said Mr Ellison planned to announce a donation to another organisation within “several weeks.”Concerns about the pledge first emerged last week, after Christopher Murray, head of Harvard’s Global Health Initiative, who had been tapped to run the institute, said last week that the promised millions of dollars from Mr Ellison never materialised.The planned Ellison Institute for World Health was to have studied ways to assess health policies around the world. Mr Ellison, whose wealth is estimated by Forbes at $16bn, had originally pledged the funds in a meeting with Mr Summers last year.During his five year tenure as Harvard president, Mr Summers helped cement the university’s position as the world’s wealthiest institution of higher learning. However, his management style led to clashes with several prominent faculty members.His plans to reinvigorate the Harvard undergraduate curriculum by increasing students’ exposure to the hard sciences, and his plans for an ambitious expansion of Harvard’s campus also attracted criticism from members of the university’s influential Faculty of Arts and Sciences.Tensions boiled over early last year when Mr Summers suggested at a conference that academics should study whether “intrinsic aptitudes” could account for differences in test scores and the preponderance of men in mathematically intensive disciplines such as engineering and the sciences.In February, he announced his decision to step down as the university’s 27th president. He will step down on June 30.Mr Ellison’s decision to withdraw his $115m pledge followed news earlier this week that Warren Buffett, the world’s second-richest man, planned to give away 85 per cent of his $40bn fortune through the foundation established by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.

Kerr McGee, based in Houston, soared 33.7 per cent to $68.61, and Western Gas Resources jumped 41.5 per cent to $59.67 after Anadarko Petroleum announced it was buying the two companies for a combined total of $21.1bn. Anadarko fell
6.9 per cent to $44.90.The exchanges sector remained active. NYSE Group gained 11.6 per cent to $61.45, its best performance since the week the stock began trading in March. On Tuesday, Euronext said a slightly modified offer from Deutsche Börse gave nothing that was substantially new and still recommended NYSE’s offer to its shareholders.Qualcomm fell following Nokia’s announcement that it was pulling out of a joint venture with Sanyo for handsets based on the CDMA standard. Qualcomm owns many of the patents related to CDMA. Shares finished the week down 10.1 per cent at $39.50.General Motors had another good week, buoyed by news that its largest parts supplier, Delphi, had reached a deal with one of its unions for employee buyouts. GM gained 5.4 per cent to $26.97 for the week.Shares in software maker Novell rose 13.1 per cent to $6.66 after it announced the departure of two of its top executives. Analysts largely welcomed the management shake-up, interpreting it as a sign of aggressiveness on the part of the company to reverse losses that had dragged shares down more than 25 per cent since May.Investment banks gained, with the S&P investment banking index up 2.5 per cent, having fallen the previous week.Morgan Stanley led, adding 4.8 per cent to $59.70 for the week, after it reported a doubling in second quarter profits.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was flat, down 1.10 points, at 1,244.50 and 0.6 per cent lower for the week. The Nasdaq was also flat, down 1.51 points, leaving it down 0.4 per cent for the week at 2,121.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent, or 30.02 points, at 10,989.09, a loss of 0.2 per cent for the week.The Vix, a measure of stock market volatility, dropped this week but remained at its highest levels of the past three years.The Index of Leading Economic Indicators and figures for durable goods orders both fell in May – further evidence that economic growth in the US is slowing.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, attributes the market’s dip to fears of an economic slowdown.The Dow is up 2.5 per cent for the year, ahead of the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which is up only 2.4 per cent.“In the last six weeks we have definitely seen a flight to safety, in the blue chips and more specifically in the defensive members of the Dow,” said Mr Pado.Univision, the Spanish language broadcaster, slid 7.8 per cent to $32.95. Two consortia had been squaring off to bid for the network, but during the week, private equity groups Blackstone, Carlyle and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts dropped out of the consortium led by Mexico’s Televisa.Boston Scientific fell 9.1 per cent to $18.26 after reports suggested that hospitals were reducing the use of its stents, devices inserted into arteries to keep them open.Construction and chemicals group Ashland leapt 8.4 per cent to $66.95 after Irish construction group CRH said it was in talks to buy the company’s asphalt and construction units.Oracle gained 5 per cent to $14.90 after reporting a 27 per cent rise in fiscal fourth quarter profit, just ahead of analyst expectations. The software maker also ann-ounced plans to expand its share buyback programme.The ongoing fallout from stock options investigations pushed Jabil Circuit down
4.8 per cent to $25.00 after it said it had received a subpoena in connection with its stock option granting practices. It has fallen more than 40 per cent since the beginning of April."
977;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-06-23T17:29:52Z;‘Philanthropy economy’ in US resilient;;In the middle of the night, Larry Ellison’s sailing team negotiated the streets of New York to deliver the 25-metre BMW Oracle yacht to its pedestal at the base of Rockefeller Center. There, the challenger of record for the 2007 America’s Cup is on display through next week, a gleaming tribute to the Oracle founder’s nautical aspirations.The yacht, one of two in the syndicate, had been racing at Valencia, in Spain, but made the 4,000-mile journey without much difficulty. The same cannot be said for Mr Ellison’s promised $115m (€91m, £65m) donation to Harvard University, which has yet to make the slightly shorter 3,000-mile trip from Palo Alto, California, to Cambridge, Massachusetts. This week, the head of the university’s Global Health Initiative – which had expected the money 10 months ago – said he had been forced to delay senior hires and lay off support staff.Whether this declaration speeds or scuppers Mr Ellison’s largess remains to be seen. But the tempest between the world’s 15th richest man and the world’s richest university – his net worth is about two-thirds the size of Harvard’s $26bn endowment – belies the robustness of philanthropy in America.“It’s an event, but it’s an aberration,” says Hank Goldstein, president and chief executive of the Oram Group, a philanthropic adviser. “The philanthropic economy is quite strong and very resilient.”According to Giving USA’s annual survey, released this week, Americans approached a record level of generosity last year. Of the $260.28bn given to charity in 2005, 76.5 per cent of it came from individual donors. These people gave across the range of non-profit bodies, from museums to hospitals to religious organisations, with a heavy emphasis on disaster relief after the Asian tsunami and US hurricanes. In total, Americans gave away 2.2 per cent of their household income in 2005, slightly above the 40-year average of 2.1 per cent.At the highest level of philanthropy is Bill Gates, who announced last week he would leave Microsoft in two years to devote himself fulltime to his foundation. Gordon Moore, the Intel founder, and Home Depot founder Bernie Marcus have used a good portion of their post-corporate lives giving away their money. And Sandy Weill, recently retired from Citigroup, has pledged to give away his $1bn fortune during his lifetime.But the delay, at the very least, of Mr Ellison’s donation raises questions about the nature of the search for funds. Is the headline-grabbing donation still better than the thousands of more modest gifts, or is fitting in with a donor’s whims too much of a hassle?“A headline gift stimulates other big gifts,” says Mr Goldstein. “It has a lot of influence and it motivates others.”But megagifts are consistently bestowed on the same types of beneficiary. In 2005, the top 10 gifts by size – ranging from $400m to $100m – went to universities, museums and foundations. (This includes Mr Ellison’s gift at number eight, wedged between Josephine Ford’s estate giving $147m to the Detroit Museum of Fine Art and Jan Vilcek’s $105m gift to the New York University School of Medicine.)This week’s Merrill Lynch report on the world’s wealthiest people showed that the rich give more in percentage terms to charity. Globally, people with more than $1m in liquid assets give 7 per cent of their net worth to charity, while those with more than $30m give 12 per cent.“Ultra-high-net-worth individuals want to leave a legacy behind them,” says Benjamin Beauvalot at Cap Gemini, which compiled the data.He adds that the percentages are probably higher for Americans, who give more to charity than other nationalities. “We’ve never seen such a trend in Europe or other countries. It’s just cultural,” he says.A separate study by Giving USA found that the average American also gives steadily. Households with incomes below $100,000 a year – 90 per cent of the US – accounted for 60 per cent of all charitable dollars. Their gifts averaged $2,500 a year.“Smaller, more modest donors, we see time and time again, are potentially very large donors at some point in the future,” says Richard Jolly, chairman of the Giving USA. “Organisations that are sensitive to that are paying attention to the more mid-level donor.”
978;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle revenues soar on buying spree;;Oracle executives on Thursday claimed vindication for their company’s aggressive spate of acquisitions as the US software maker reported a 25 per cent increase in revenues in the final three months of its latest fiscal year.The jump in revenues was partly the result of acquisitions but also reflected both strong performance by Oracle and a more robust market for corporate software sales, according to analysts. “Oracle is executing better than it has for some years, but more than anything else we are in a hot IT market,” said Jim Shepherd, an analyst at AMR Research.“We’re gaining share in all our product lines,” said Larry Ellison, chief executive, pointing to what he called “extraordinary growth in the fourth quarter” that had seen Oracle add nearly $1bn in revenues, to $4.9bn.Safra Catz, president and chief financial officer, said the growth had come on the back of broad demand from big customers in all markets around the world.“We can’t split out if it’s the IT spending environment entirely. It doesn’t seem it is,” she said.Referring to the fiscal period that ended in May “a very critical year for Oracle to show our strategy is taking hold,” Ms Catz added that the latest results demonstrated it was starting to have an impact.While sales in the company’s core database and middleware business grew by 18 per cent from a year before, sales of applications software climbed by 83 per cent, to $641m. Leaving aside the impact of acquisitions such as Siebel Systems, applications revenue grew by 56 per cent, Oracle added.The company’s disclosure last week that its earnings would top forecasts had already led to a 10 per cent bounce in its stock price, though the shares have moved only marginally higher since Oracle embarked on its acquisitions spree three years ago. “I actually do think it’s getting noticed,” Ms Catz said of the company’s improving corporate performance.Oracle said its net income had risen 27 per cent to $1.3bn, or 24 cents a share. On the pro forma basis on which most analysts judge its performance, net income rose 13 per cent while earnings per share climbed 11 per cent to 29 cents, one cent ahead of estimates despite a higher tax rate.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent, or 198.27 points, at 11,015.19.Bear Stearns rose 5.9 per cent to $131.56 after reporting a rise of 81 per cent in second-quarter profit, ahead of expectations. Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers fell earlier in the week after telling investors they feared a difficult environment in the coming months. Goldman shares on Thursday added 4.1 per cent to $144.12, and Lehman Brothers rose 4.6 per cent to $63.72.Discount brokerages fared even better. Ameritrade added 8.8 per cent to 15.58, and E*Trade soared 11.3 per cent to $21.57.Exchanges followed the investment banks higher. NYSE Group jumped 7.1 per cent to $54.50, while Nasdaq added 8.1 per cent to $27.16.?I think the correction is over,? said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards and Sons, who believes the market is fully prepared for another interest rate rise. ?If you can find anyone who thinks the Fed is not going to raise rates, check their pulse.?Caterpillar rose 5 per cent to $70.85 after Wednesday?s news of a 20 per cent rise in its quarterly dividend.Brokerage upgrades boosted consumer cyclicals. Black & Decker jumped 4.1 per cent to $84.00 after an upgrade from Citigroup, while Staples was upped from ?market perform? to ?outperform? by Sanford Bernstein, sending shares up 5.3 per cent to $24.87.Chipmakers were also helped by brokerage upgrades, making semiconductors the best performing sector in the S&P 500. Nvidia jumped 8.8 per cent to $22.23 and Sandisk added 5.7 per cent to $54.45 after both stocks were raised from ?neutral? to ?buy?.Other technology stocks bounced, with enterprise software groups to the fore. Oracle rose 3.9 per cent to $13.70, while Salesforce.com leapt 7.7 per cent to $27.32.Crude prices pushed higher, helping energy stocks. ConocoPhilips added 3.9 per cent to $61.75, and Anadarko Petroleum gained 5.3 per cent to $48.49.Resurgent copper prices helped Phelps Dodge add 5.5 per cent to $80.64, while Freeport McMoran rose 7.3 per cent to $49.04.Steel also ticked higher. Nucor jumped 6.6 per cent to $50.94, while US Steel gained 7.6 per cent to $64.00.Verasun Energy, the ethanol producer that rose 30 per cent on its Wednesday market debut, fell 9.5 per cent to $27.15, the worst drop on the NYSE.
980;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-06-05T21:07:41Z;SAP plans to remain independent, says chief;;Henning Kagermann, chief executive of SAP, a German business software maker, believes consolidation in the sector has peaked and that big IT groups from the US are not planning to buy the market leader.In an interview with the FT and sister paper FT Deutschland, Mr Kagermann tried to quell the excitement caused by Hasso Plattner, SAP chairman, who said recently a takeover of the company was always possible.“I think we’ve seen the main thrust of consolidation. The next steps are going to be marginal,” Mr Kagermann said. The sector has recently seen Oracle, the number two, shell out billions for rivals such as PeopleSoft and Siebel.The Californian company last year trounced SAP in a brief bidding war for Retek, a US maker of software for retailers, which would have marked the biggest transaction for SAP, a company otherwise focused on organic growth.Instead of trying to buy big chunks of market share, SAP is betting on a new generation of software, launched last year, which is meant to give customers the flexibility to combine programs made by other companies.“Our strategy of growing organically has proved successful even as other big players have gone together,” Mr Kagermann said.“It’ll be enough for us to enrich our current portfolio with one or two smaller acquisitions.”SAP has bought small companies including Tomorrow Now, which services Oracle products. But it has not been drawn into making significant further acquisitions, in spite of recent strong profits and a doubling of market capitalisation to more than €50bn ($65bn) in the past three years.In spite of record growth since Mr Kagermann steered SAP from the wreckage of the technology bubble in 2003, Mr Plattner, a member of the company’s founding trio, said last month that a purchase by Microsoft, Google or IBM was possible. The remarks led to a rally in SAP stock as investors speculated about takeover premiums.But Mr Kagermann said Mr Plattner’s remarks had been misunderstood and that the company would remain independent.“These were single remarks made by someone who was in a good mood,” Mr Kagermann said. Mr Plattner was “constantly under observation” by a media ready to interpret every remark for “the last little bit of news”, he said.Asked if he thought recent speculation that rivals could bid for his company in the foreseeable future was overdone, he said: “Yes, of course – not least because our customers want a strong, independent SAP.”Such confidence is at least in part based on a notion that Oracle’s spending spree will cause it problems. Oracle recently revealed plans to overhaul its business offerings in the next few years.“I thought they were going to announce that they’d put all their products together,” Mr Kagermann said.“Instead, they’ve told their clients they’re going to rewrite all programs from scratch. That’s a hell of a task.”
981;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-05-30T17:40:02Z;Ways to deliver the best training;;"When rolling out a new enterprise-wide system or simply updating staff on changes, one question companies face is whether to use internal resources or hand over training to an outside provider.Marc Brawner, information security officer for Kroll, is clear about the importance of IT training for corporations. With software becoming more and more complex, he says, “you want to send staff to get trained because otherwise your business may be missing out on an opportunity”.Unsurprisingly, most IT training companies recommend the external option. But hybrid solutions, whereby both internal and external resources work together, are becoming increasingly popular.Even companies such as UK-based QA, known for its portfolio of public training courses, have noticed the shift in emphasis.“We’re seeing more clients wanting to focus it, and
tailor it to a specific angle,” says Richard Hordern, managing consultant at QA. “And often, we’re doing some form of needs assessment beforehand.”This approach, he says, is how companies can “get the best of both worlds – making it fit the organisation as well as getting best practice and input from specialist trainers.”However, with a range of tools and service providers to choose from, finding the right mix of customised training, external instructors, e-learning and use of internal resources, companies need to identify the skills with which they want to equip their staff.When it comes to the technicians themselves, the external solution is often the most suitable.“The real techie specialists are always likely to go on some kind of public course because it doesn’t matter whether it’s culturally fitted,” says Jon Buttriss, a director at Computeach, the UK specialist training company.“And that way, they are also learning from their peers, which is crucial,” he adds.This approach does not work so well for end-users, who are going to be operating the software and systems rather than improving or fixing them.Because they need to know how the software is used in their particular role, they need something more tailored, rather than a deep knowledge of the technology.And because of the different ways in which companies operate functions such as HR or finance, sending employees from these departments on public classes can be ineffective.iTrain Education, a UK-based independent Oracle, Java and SAP training company, found this out the hard way.“Our history is as a technical training company and, as Oracle moved further into the applications space, that became an area we needed to support,” explains Duncan Brown of iTrain Education.“So we looked at the product, put a few public dates up and had a range of people from different companies come on a single course – and it was an unmitigated failure.”The trouble was, says Mr Brown, that HR people from different companies had ways of conducting their business that were specific to the culture and processes of their organisation.“So we realised very early on in servicing that part of the market that you can only sensibly do that as tailored training – because you’re not really teaching them the application, you’re teaching them how to use it in their business.”Increasingly, tools available on the market are giving companies greater flexibility when it comes to decisions on how to deliver their IT training. One example is OnDemand Software, a division of US-based Global Knowledge. The software includes functions such as the ability to record actions relating to, say, an HR transaction, and create instant content with which to teach that process to others.“It’s a tool that the customer can use themselves,” explains Chris Pickett, chief strategy officer at On-Demand Software. “So if they have the wherewithal, they buy it and roll it out themselves but if they want help, they can talk to us, or to systems integrators such as Accenture, CapGemini or Deloitte, that have built practices around the technology.”It is not only systems integrators that are incorporating training products such as OnDemand into their offerings. Software manufacturers themselves are incorporating them.In the past, software companies might have stressed the ease of use of their products; today they are as aggressive as training companies in promoting training – because it is in their interest to do so.“If it doesn’t go well, it’s not good for the [client] company but it’s also not a good thing for the software company because clients are less likely to pay maintenance or come back and buy additional modules,” says Mr Pickett.“Trained users are successful users,” he adds. “And successful users buy more software.”"
982;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-05-18T20:15:33Z;SAP boss names three potential US buyers;;SAP, the world’s biggest business software group, is open to an acquisition by US technology groups, according to its chairman.Hasso Plattner, supervisory board chief at the German group, said in an interview with FT Deutschland, the FT’s sister paper: “There are only three potential buyers: IBM, Microsoft and Google. I don’t see anyone else. If shareholders think that a combination, and not independence, is better, then it will happen.”Mr Plattner, who holds 12 per cent of the company, said he would have to act in the interest of all shareholders, not just himself.He is the only one of the four SAP co-founders still holding a position within the group.“You have to be emotionless,” Mr Plattner said.Asked about the widely speculated merger scenario involving IBM, Plattner said: “I do not want to invent rumours because there are no talks. However, I do not want to say that I dislike IBM so much that I could not imagine such a scenario at all.”But he could not imagine talks with Oracle, SAP’s arch rival.A takeover of SAP would be a stretch for most companies, given its market capitalisation of more than €50bn ($64bn) and the fact that it is in the middle of a period of immense organic growth.Two years ago, observers were surprised when Microsoft approached SAP with a bid and worries of long-winded EU competition probes brought talks to an early end.Mr Plattner said many European IT companies had been unable to compete with American rivals in the past because they were too nationally minded and had focused on small markets.Bull in France and Olivetti in Italy were number ones in their domestic markets until being overrun by US groups.“We would long have needed an ‘IT-Airbus’,” Plattner said in analogy with the construction of aircraft where Germany, France, Spain and the UK had bundled their forces to compete with Boeing.Last week, SAP gave Henning Kagermann, its chief executive, an incentive to renew his contract as chief executive next year by flagging unprecedented bonuses for senior staff.The supervisory board plans to pay out €300m to hundreds of employees if SAP’s share price doubles by 2010, with one-third of the sum reserved for the chief executive and the six other executive directors.Mr Kagermann took over in the aftermath of the tech-bubble bursting and has led SAP to stellar sales and profit growth. He has yet to say whether he will renew a contract that ends in 2007.A vital part of his success is melding technology and marketing expertise, throwing up the question of whether SAP would be able to find a replacement with a similar balancing influence on the executive board.A decision could come as late as next spring, with Mr Kagermann’s deliberations coinciding with a debate in Germany on whether executives should sign three-year rather than five-year contracts.Mr Plattner told shareholders at last week’s annual meeting the bonuses would help SAP realise “very ambitious” goals to double sales in the next five years.
983;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-05-08T16:55:32Z;Iraq to take on running of USAid projects;;USAid, one of the biggest development agencies operating in Iraq, plans to turn over the running of its reconstruction projects, funded to the tune of $5.1bn since 2003, to the Iraqi government by the end of 2007, Dawn Liberi, the outgoing mission director, said on Monday.Ms Liberi, who has been nominated as the next US ambassador in Mauritania, said she believed a majority of Iraqis would support a national unity government, which is expected to be announced within the next few days.She was speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Amman aimed at increasing private sector participation in Iraq, at the launch of an Iraq Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Alliance.“There are 1,000 companies being represented at this entire conference so clearly there is a desire both on the part of the Iraqis to invite international business and also on the part of multinational companies to actually get more firmly ensconced in doing business in Iraq,” she said.US-led reconstruction efforts in Iraq, worth of total of some $21bn (€16.5bn, £11.3bn) have come under repeated criticism in recent months. A report by the US special inspector-general for Iraq reconstruction last week said there was a gap between promised projects and those likely to be completed before US funds are exhausted.Ms Liberi acknowledged that mistakes had been made after the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. “When the US came into Iraq, no one realised just how much the infrastructure itself had deteriorated over the last 30 years,” she said.“The job of reconstruction was actually much larger than anyone thought because we weren’t starting at ground zero, but minus 25 or minus 30, and working up to ground zero.”Companies such as Microsoft, Motorola and Oracle attended the launch of the ITC Alliance, intended to implement information systems and improve technical skills in Iraq.Company representatives spoke of the difficulties of doing business in Iraq, particularly the insurgency-hit centre and south, but said local partnerships had enabled some progress to be made.
984;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-27T19:18:03Z;Observer - Europe & Asia;;Western governments are not the only ones having difficulty in their dealings with Iran. Members of the European parliament’s cross-party delegation for relations with Iran tried on Thursday to have its name changed to please Tehran.The delegation wanted to refer to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Chairwoman Angelika Beer, a Green, cited China, which is termed “the People’s Republic” by parliament.She added in a letter to colleagues: “A recent parliament resolution was sent back by the embassy to the parliament for not having quoted the official name of Iran.”Perhaps more crucially, for MEPs who like to add up their air miles, “several members of our delegation requested that we intensify our relations with our homologues in Iran and visit Iran...Iranian officials made clear that we first have to change the name”.Cancel the flights. MEPs voted against her plan yesterday.Is Klaus Kleinfeld, Siemens’ combative chief executive, his own worst enemy? Only this week he complained to Observer that while the German conglomerate had 12 divisions the media only focused on its two troubled ones – telecommunications and IT services.What about power generation, automotive and medicine technology, he wailed, which all took plenty of his time and were world-leading, rather than loss-making like the two bad sheep of the group.Releasing results in Munich on Thursday, Kleinfeld also unveiled the $1.9bn acquisition of a US medical company. Then he swiftly glossed over this, choosing to talk at great length about, erm, telecoms.Timing is everything in comedy and central banking. After Thursday unexpected rise in Chinese interest rates, financial markets might hang even more closely on the words of Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Italian European Central Bank executive board member.Just as the Beijing monetary authority acted he was speaking in Florence...about why Chinese interest rates were too low.Did he have advance knowledge? Bini Smaghi is well plugged into the international banking circuit. But Observer’s best guess is that it was a lucky coincidence.Old banknotes are increasingly valuable collectables but on Thursday the auctioneer Spink had a sale with a difference: material produced by the Free French in London during the second world war.The collection included printing plates to produce forged German prisoner of war “camp money” and espionage equipment for use by the French resistance. Valued at £800 to £1,200, the lot went to a private European buyer for £3,105.Being the French, the documents recall a time when even Resistance had a culinary flavour. Women used to sit in a house in Hampstead over a bathtub filled with dried prunes. As the prunes swelled, they carefully removed the stones and filled the cavities with carefully rolled up maps of Europe covered in waxed paper. The prunes were then dried out and sent in parcels to POWs.The maps detailed the railway lines that criss-crossed Europe, giving prisoners with the detail they needed to plan their escape.
985;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Microsoft court appeal begins in Luxembourg;;Microsoft and the European Commission will on Monday square off before Europe’s second-highest court as their battle over the landmark antitrust ruling issued by the regulator two years ago reaches its decisive stage.The world’s largest software company has called on the European Court of First Instance to overturn the Commission ruling, which found Microsoft guilty of abusing its dominant market position and imposed a record €497m ($613m) fine.The Luxembourg court will conduct a week-long hearing to examine the appeal, but is not expected to give its verdict before next year.Microsoft’s lawyers will argue that the Commission’s decision contained fundamental flaws in its economic and legal analysis and wrongly impinged on the group’s intellectual property.“This case raises important questions not only for Microsoft, but for companies across the technology sector and beyond. At issue is whether companies can improve their products by developing new features, and whether a successful company must hand over its valuable intellectual property to competitors,” the group said.But the Commission is certain to launch a vigorous defence of its decision, which it is keen to use as a precedent for further investigations against the US software group.The Ecis industry association, one of the Commission’s supporters that represents IBM, Oracle, Nokia and others, said the stakes were high. “This case is about establishing rules of the road for a company that has massive market power in a critical market,” said Thomas Vinje, a partner at Clifford Chance who represents Ecis. He added that without the precedent there would be an “elimination of competition in a whole range of markets”.At the heart of the dispute lies the Commission ruling of March 2004 that found Microsoft had illegally used its monopoly in desktop operating systems to shut out competition in adjacent markets such as media players and server software.Microsoft’s lawyers are expected to argue this week that the regulator’s analysis was flawed and that the market reality at the time – and the way the market has developed since – contradict the Commission’s findings.The group is expected to point to the runaway success of Apple Computer’s iTunes as evidence that Microsoft’s practices did not foreclose competition in the market for internet-based music sales.
986;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-23T18:18:21Z;John Gapper: A threat to the fragile Linux ecosystem;;"Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle, is a past master of spreading fear and uncertainty across the computing world. Last week, he was at it again in an interview with the Financial Times as he mused menacingly about the weakness of companies that distribute Linux, the open-source operating software.Oracle had thought about buying companies such as Red Hat and Novell, he said, but concluded that it was not worth it. The trouble was that they owned no intellectual property and so anybody could take their main product – Linux – and produce a version of it themselves. In fact, Oracle might cease to endorse Red Hat’s version of Linux and distribute its own variant.At one level, his remarks were simply retaliation at Red Hat for having the temerity to buy JBoss, an open-source software company whose products compete with Oracle’s. They duly stung Matthew Szulik, Red Hat’s chief executive, into responding in a pained open letter to the FT. Just another day’s work for Mr Ellison, who does not like to be challenged.But this was more than just a flurry of backbiting among corporate software companies. At stake is one of the quandaries of open-source software – the degree to which companies such as Oracle, which depend on Linux to compete effectively against Microsoft, should co-opt it for their own ends.
Mr Ellison is in danger of taking a step too far in this direction.The open-source software movement sprung up as a grassroots response to proprietary development of software by companies such as Microsoft. Linux, an operating system that runs on cheap Intel-based servers, competes head on with Windows and does so very successfully. Many companies have adopted it as the foundation on which to run their database and applications software.Linux is distributed under open-source terms, which means that any contributor’s work can be used free by anyone else. But while thousands of volunteers work on Linux, it is not merely a matter of “people hanging out and singing ‘Kumbaya’”, as one executive puts it. Some of the biggest contributors are companies: IBM has 300 developers working full-time on Linux projects.Then there are Red Hat and Novell, which distribute versions of Linux. They cannot charge for the software itself but they make their money by providing support and upgrades to make sure it works stably with other corporate software. Linux has become an ecosystem comprising not only open-source volunteers but also software companies and distributors.The benefit of being part of this ecosystem is that Linux is a cheap and open operating platform. Corporate customers know they can choose between many different applications written to the standard and will not become locked in. That gives IBM, for example, the chance to market its Linux-based middleware (software that sits between the operating system and applications) very widely.But ecosystems are delicate: they rely on all participants gaining something and not feeling that others are taking out more than they put in. The open-source ecosystem is particularly so because, as Mr Ellison says, no one holds intellectual property rights over Linux software or can charge for it per se, which curtails the profits that Linux distributors can make.Given this, it is not obvious why Mr Ellison is tempted to enter the game. Oracle already provides some free support for Red Hat Linux because its support technicians try to fix customers’ problems no matter where the glitches lie. But Oracle would not be able to charge a lot to support its own Linux variant, so the rewards from it would be limited.In contrast, there would be real risks in cutting off Red Hat and going its own way. If Oracle were an island, these would not exist. It could develop its brand of Linux, just as Red Hat and Novell do, since Linux is freely available. It could also tailor its Linux to work with its applications and then have a complete “stack” of software from an operating system through to middleware and applications.But the nature of open source means that Oracle cannot think about its actions in isolation: it has also to consider their effects on the ecology of open source. That matters because something that damages Linux would also hurt Oracle. The company gains a great deal from the commitment of others to developing Linux and the faith customers have it in.Of course, Oracle could not hijack Linux by producing its own variant. It would stick to open-source principles and allow its development work to be shared by others. But it would inevitably weaken Red Hat by no longer boosting the latter’s version of the code. At worst, the open-source world could lose one of its two big independent Linux distributors.Anything that makes companies less confident about Linux would provide a reason to buy Microsoft software instead, which is why IBM makes a point of supporting both Novell and Red Hat. “An unintended consequence might be an implosion in the Linux market that takes Oracle’s business model with it,” says George Weiss, a Gartner software analyst.That is the apocalyptic view but does Mr Ellison want to mess with a Linux ecosystem that works well and, as he says, “saved us” from Microsoft’s incursions into the database market? No matter how much of an irritant an independent, acquisitive Red Hat may be, it might be better for Oracle to leave well enough alone."
987;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-21T12:14:18Z;The Week in Technology: Oracle vs Red Hat;;"Comments by Oracle’s flamboyant chief Larry Ellison in the Financial Times about wanting to acquire or develop its own version of Linux led to suggestions that he was stirring up Red Hat, the biggest distributor of the open source operating system.Ellison said he had considered buying Novell, the second-biggest Linux distributor, or developing its own version to add to Oracle’s software offerings. The move was seen as a shot across the bows of Red Hat, which has tripled in value over the past year and has just agreed to buy JBoss, the open source middleware company that Oracle itself had been interested in acquiring. Ellison said Oracle wants Red Hat to be successful because they provided competition to Microsoft, but added: “But they’re a small company and they’re not supporting the customers very well.”The comments sparked a letter to the FT from Matthew Szulik, Red Hat chief executive, who wondered whether Oracle itself felt under pressure after the JBoss acquisition. He noted that Red Hat’s revenue less than Oracle’s income from interest, and added rather dashingly that his company represents “a value that is not for sale – the freedom to choose”.Results seasonQuarterly earnings were a mixed bag for some of the biggest internet companies. For eBay, there were more signs that growth at its core auction business is slowing. On the good side for eBay, growth in Skype revenues ran at 40 per cent, faster than expected.Yahoo!’s earnings were hit by employee stock options and Apple’s by the lack of a new iPod model during its first quarter. iPod revenues declined sequentially despite being 60 per cent higher than the same period in 2005. Apple executives argued that the previous quarter had been distorted by changes to inventory and being 14 weeks long,It was a return to the good days at Google, however, as it continued to shake off some of the gloom its previous results had generated in January. Revenue growth returned with a vengeance, including a doubling of sales in Europe, and margin growth also beat expectations.Meanwhile Google’s Base - the service that lets you list and sell just about anything - apparently has eBay worried enough to be talking to Microsoft and Yahoo! about possible alliances, according to the Wall St Journal. With signs that Google are integrating their Base results into their normal search results (a screenshot here gives an example of a search for “ford escape” providing an option to “search vehicles” by make, model and location).The Google Calendar API was also released this week, barely a fortnight after Google Calendar itself. Even blogging Google engineer Matt Cutts was surprised. “I love that they got it out so soon; it seems like the whole calendar launch was really tight, and I can’t wait to see what people do with an API.” So don’t just sit there, get coding."
988;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Strong growth in the US boosts SAP;;SAP, the world’s biggest maker of business software, on Thursday said software sales rose 22 per cent in the first quarter, thanks to strong growth in the US and a solid performance in Germany.However, shares in the German group dropped 2.3 per cent to €178.91 in early trade as profits disappointed investors.SAP said software sales - a leading indicator for maintenance revenues - rose to €528m ($651m) from €434m a year earlier, driven by a 25 per cent increase in the US and an 8 per cent rise in its domestic market.“We are pleased to say that we are off to a good start in 2006 with continued strong growth in software and product revenues for the first quarter,” said Henning Kagermann, chief executive.SAP increased software sales in the Americas to 47 per cent as it won customers from US rival Oracle, which has been reorganising after embarking on a series of high-profile acquisitions last year.SAP provides software that allows companies to manage payroll and inventory, while Oracle’s focus is mainly on databases.Oracle last month reported only a moderate recovery in its core database software business in the latest quarter. However, sales of new applications software were stronger than expected.SAP said total sales for the quarter, which includes maintenance and service revenue, rose 18 per cent to €2.04bn. Net income rose 11 per cent for the quarter to €282m from €254m a year before, but below analysts’ expectations.SAP said it expected product sales to rise 13 to 15 per cent in 2006, based on 2006 software revenue growth of 15 to 17 per cent. The company expects its pro-forma operating margin to rise by 0.5 to 1.0 percentage points in 2006.In the quarter the German group said it had won major contract deals from leading companies such as Honeywell International, Dow Chemical, Eon, the German utility, and Matsushita Electric, the electronics company.
989;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-19T22:00:10Z;Google makes enterprise search push;;Google on Wednesday unveiled a series of partnerships with enterprise software companies such as Oracle, Salesforce.com and Cisco Systems, which it hopes will help push its search software further into the business market.Google is hoping to become the preferred technology for searching for documents and information within company computer systems, in the same way it dominates search on the internet.It launched its first enterprise search product in 2002, and has since won more than 3,500 customers.However, Google’s enterprise search software has been criticised for lacking the security features required by businesses and for being ill-suited to searching through the patchwork of applications and data sources that make up corporate networks.Google is now hoping to address these issues by launching a new version of the search product with increased security, and by working more closely with business software application vendors.Oracle and Google’s other business software partners are building new features into their software, which will make them easier to search with Google’s technology.Specialist search software companies, such as Autonomy and Fast Search and Transfer, said they were not concerned about Google’s redoubled efforts to penetrate the market, arguing that Google was still competing at the lower end of the market for very basic keyword search technology.“We don’t compete in that space,” said Mike Lynch, chief executive of Autonomy. “We did a hundred deals last quarter and didn’t come up against Google in any of them.”Mr Lynch estimates that Google’s enterprise search threatened only the company’s basic Ultraseek keyword business, which accounts for about 2 per cent of revenues.The simpler end of enterprise search is seeing increased competition, as a number of companies – including Microsoft, Oracle and IBM – have all recently introduced basic keyword search products.“It is a bloodbath down there. Simple keyword search technology will probably be free by the end of the year,” Mr Lynch said.John Lervik, chief executive of Fast, suggested that Google’s move was less about taking market share from search companies, than it was about challenging Microsoft for dominance of the computer desktop.
990;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-19T17:28:51Z;Tech industry’s new era with customer at its core;;Letter to the EditorFrom Matthew Szulik, chief executive, Red HatSir, Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, has communicated publicly that his company is considering entering the Linux operating system marketplace (“The prophet of Oracle’s future”, April 17). To which, I respond, congratulations. The open source community welcomes more public contribution from the large proprietary software industry.However, the timing of the announcement is curious. Is it possible that the dominant provider of databases feels pressure from its long-time partner, Red Hat, because of our recent purchase of an open source middleware company, JBOSS? Some reporting would set up a showdown between Red Hat and Oracle. This seems like a stretch to me.Oracle generates more in interest income than Red Hat generates in annual revenues and Red Hat’s planned acquisition has little to do with future strategies to enter an already commoditised database market. Instead, through the planned acquisition of JBOSS, Red Hat sees an opportunity to continue to grow through independence, clearly focused on creating value through the collaborative process of open source software development. I would suggest that what is happening here is the evolution of software development and testing that tries the very core of proprietary ways.I believe the technology industry has entered an era where the customer, an asset taken for granted by many technology companies during the past 30 years, has moved front and centre in the internet. The absence of lock-in due to open source software has created a new competitive period where innovation and value added replaces the lack of alternative created by the proprietary walled gardens of software vendors.The collaborative process of open source software development has produced the world-leading web server (Apache), the world’s leading application server (Tomcat) and the world’s fastest-growing operating system, Linux. Customers have recognised the value added delivered by Red Hat’s leadership in open source computing by rating Red Hat as the number one source of value in an independent survey of 1,000 chief information officers, in competition with industry’s largest software and computer manufacturers.I have a much better appreciation of the challenges the Japanese carmakers faced when attempting to break into the domestic US market while competing against historical industry practices and the personal networks that stood in the way of customers having access to a lower-cost, higher-value alternative. Open source software and Red Hat continue to face similar challenges. But in the end, through innovation and a commitment to the customer, the Japanese automakers delivered choice to the customer. The US automotive industry is a good case study, in comparison to the state of the domestic US software industry.Open versus closed. Collaborative versus proprietary. Independent versus exclusive. The customer wants to pay for value delivered. Red Hat represents, to a worldwide network of software developers, a value that is not for sale – the freedom to choose.Matthew Szulik,Chief Executive,Red Hat,Raleigh, NC 27606, US
991;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-18T21:59:54Z;Oracle fires a shot across Red Hat’s bows;;"For long-time watchers of Larry Ellison, the revelation that Oracle is looking at launching its own version of the Linux open source operating system has aroused a suspicion: is the software industry’s most acquisitive CEO stalking his next
target?Mr Ellison made the comments in an interview with the Financial Times this week, laying out strong reasons why the database software company should embed a version of Linux into its existing software.Such a move would make life far harder for Red Hat, which has emerged as the leading Linux company so far – particularly if, as Mr Ellison suggested, IBM decided to follow suit.As a shot across Red Hat’s bows, the comments have had an immediate impact. The Linux company’s shares have dropped 8 per cent this week – although at $5bn, the company is still worth around three times what it was a year ago. “We want them to be successful, because Red Hat is to some degree our way of competing with Microsoft down at the core level,” the Oracle chief executive officer said. “But they’re a small company and they’re not supporting the customers very well.”One answer, he suggested, was to launch a new version of Linux, or simply embed the Red Hat version in Oracle’s products and offer support from its own service organisation.Simply offering the Red Hat version of Linux to its own customers could create a legal dispute, according to Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Goldman Sachs.But Oracle would still be free to create its own version from the free component programs available over the internet.For now, Mr Ellison has advanced two reasons for not buying Red Hat or Novell, which became the second biggest distributor of Linux after its acquisition of the German company SuSe two years ago. One is price. Open source companies have started to attract fancy valuations, as evidenced by Red Hat’s purchase last week of JBoss – a company that Oracle had itself tried to buy. Without control of their own intellectual property, these companies are not as valuable as Wall Street thinks, according to Mr Ellison.“If an open source product gets good enough, we’ll simply take it,” he said. “We can do that, IBM can do that, HP can do that – anyone with a large support organisation is free to take that intellectual property and embed it in their own products.“I believe JBoss is a $16m company breaking even, MySQL is a $30m company breaking even,” said Mr Ellison.“You can build a sustainable business [in open source], you just can’t charge a lot for it. There’s brand value – there’s real brand – there’s people, and that’s it.”The second reason for not buying a Linux company, according to Mr Ellison, is the risk that other big technology companies would abandon it.“I don’t see how we could possibly buy Red Hat – IBM would just say, ‘Larry, congratulations, we’re going our own way’,” he said.Despite that, Red Hat’s growing dominance of the Linux business, and its decision to acquire JBoss and start building out a fuller “stack” of software that competes with companies like Oracle and IBM, could alter the balance of partnerships in the software world and prompt a more drastic response."
992;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
993;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-18T04:01:48Z;Transcript: FT interview with Larry Ellison (Part two);;Richard Waters of the Financial Times interviewed Larry Ellison, the chief executive officer of Oracle. Here is part two of the transcript - excerpts of the interview.[Click here for part one of the transcript]FT: Will Red Hat build a “stack” of open source software?That’s what I would do if I were running Red Hat – the first thing I’d do is bring in MySQL [an open source database company.] This is a two-edged sword – you further alienate IBM, you further alienate Oracle by doing all of this, but then you get your stack.I like IBM’s ability to play that trump card more than ours. We looked at buying Novell, for instance – we look at everything, play this thing out. IBM is Novell’s biggest customer. We buy Novell, IBM says thanks very much, takes the source code and boom, there goes all our money down the drain on day one.FT: Are open source databases a threat to your core business?The web server is a very small product. Linux is a good deal more complicated, but it has had a lot of help from IBM. If you look at the Oracle relational database we are so far ahead, MySQL are so far behind. It doesn’t mean you can’t use it for certain applications – but they are so far behind us, more than a decade to make all of this stuff up, it’s a tiny company.These companies don’t make much money. I believe JBoss is a $16m company breaking even, MySQL is a $30m company breaking even. Microsoft is a $30bn company, and I think they’re doing better than break-even. They’ve been able to make huge investments [in database software] and they still haven’t caught us. If Microsoft can’t catch us, I just don’t think the guys in Scandinavia are going to catch up to us. Microsoft has been at it a long time, with very smart people with lots of money.FT: Do you want to build an open source stack?I’d like to have a complete stack. We’re missing an operating system. You could argue that it makes a lot of sense for us to look at distributing and supporting Linux, it makes a lot of sense. That’s the one area where Oracle isn’t a player.We would be able to test all the components together and do a better job of service. Most of our big customers would rather have one phone number to call – the classic “one neck to choke”. At least from the operating system on up to the application we’re completely responsible. We test everything together, we have one set of management tools — when we ship patches, its one system that upgrades it all together so you’re not out of synch. It’s all synchronized, that’s the Microsoft approach – that was historically the IBM approach, for a very long time.I don’t think we’ll make a lot of money in the Linux operating system business, I don’t think its going to be a hugely profitable business for us. But it will allow us to deliver a higher quality of service to our customers because we’ve tested the whole stack, we know it works. One set of management tools, one set of patching tools, one set of upgrade tools.FT: Should customers worry that the new integrated “stacks” of software being created by companies like Oracle and SAP create “lock-in” and lead to less choice?With standards-based software, you can to some degree switch out Oracle components. Customers want choice, but they also want everything integrated and one central support centre. Insofar as companies adhere to standards we should have these pluggable components so you can unplug this and plug in that. If you choose an all-Oracle stack, we think it might work a little bit better.Customers historically have gone with complete stack suppliers. That’s why they liked Microsoft, that’s why they liked IBM in the old days.The more of the footprint we have, the happier customers are, up to the point where they say, “Gee Oracle, you’re all over the place.” As long as we do a good job and we don’t price gouge them - that would be self-defeating. We make plenty of money now, we don’t need to gouge people on prices. In fact, the bigger we become, the more we can lower our prices. With volume comes the ability to lower price.Microsoft doesn’t adhere to standards. This is an Achilles heel – IBM in the early days wasn’t standards-based, Microsoft isn’t standards-based. The biggest companies, the leaders – IBM in the old days, Microsoft now, SAP now – think they can set their own standards. It’s really an interesting element of hubris. Being number one, you think the rules don’t quite apply to you. We became number one in database, but always based on standards. We don’t think we can compete outside of the area of standards.FT: Why have companies in many cases got less benefit from their information systems than they expected during the period of big technology spending in the 1990s?Companies are still using information in a siloed away. The information inside companies is fragmented in so many separate databases, so many separate systems.The trouble is, large organisations are themselves divisionalised and fragmented. If you look at some of these large companies that grew as a result of acquisition, they never threw away the old systems, they never really integrated the businesses. When a company like Citibank wants to ask, who are my customers, that’s really in lots and lots of systems. Each one of those businesses is run by a different general manager. Each of those people makes a decision about what sort of systems he or she wants in the division.It’s really astounding, the organisational complexity of these big companies, which devolves into systems complexity. To unify all this is not really a technology issue, it’s an organisational issue. How much do you want to unify your organisation? There are very few companies with very strong centralised leadership that will mandate these things. Most large companies are highly decentralised. A conspicuous counter-example is General Electric [but] most big organisations just don’t operate that way.FT: Did you expect more companies to adopt single integrated “suites” of software applications like those sold by Oracle?Absolutely. I thought it was a technological issue. I thought that if we built the system, that people would immediately say, clearly, I get such huge economies of scale, such big efficiency advantages. And some have – we have sold quite a few of them.I think the companies that have unified systems have significant competitive advantage. GE is an interesting model. They just keep buying weaker companies. These problems tend to be self-correcting – the inefficient operators tend to disappear. But it’s not merely a systems issue, it’s a corporate culture issue, its an organisational operations issue. But gradually we’re going to move towards these modern information systems – it’s just going to take a whole lot longer than I ever imagined.FT: When will companies get more radical in overhauling their systems?It’s going to happen when the risks of not doing something are greater than the risks of doing something. In a lot of industries, it’s too risky to do nothing. Telecoms, for instance, is changing so much – the wireline business is declining so rapidly – if you’re not moving aggressively into wireless, you’re putting your business at risk. They’ve got to be in those businesses, it’s too risky not too.Industries that are under pressure are the first to go. That’s why we’re moving aggressively into telecom – they’re under financial stress. In the US, Walmart is putting all of the retail businesses under tremendous pressure. Automobile companies are also going to have to take risks. We’ve been very targeted at looking at industries that are under stress and have to become more efficient to survive.FT: People say you are spending less time at Oracle now, and that Safra Catz is running things day to day. Have things at the company changed?In some ways, nothing has changed. I’ve always been head of engineering at Oracle, I’m still head of engineering. Safra is COO, Charles Philips runs the field operations.My work week is down to 50 hours – I work less. In the beginning it was insane, I would leave the office at [1am]. I’m too old to do that.I still sail competitively – I’m not too old to sail. I like to spend time with my family, I read I lot, I sail and play tennis and play basketball. I spend a lot of time at Oracle thinking about things. Thinking through all the open source stuff is something we’ve done relatively recently – making sure we understand what all the implications are. Is it disruptive, is it a risk, how do we respond to it, can it hurt us, how can we take advantage of it?The biggest risk to us was always Microsoft and windows becoming so dominant in the datacentre that we could be in a lot of trouble, because in the end Microsoft is going to do well with SQL Server [its database] on Windows. But, along came Linux – open source, you could argue, saved us. Open source is much better for us, because we are a standards-based company. We can take advantage of open source and Microsoft can’t.FT: So have you thought about retiring?I love my job. I don’t need the money.
994;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-18T04:01:27Z;Transcript: FT interview with Larry Ellison;;Richard Waters of the Financial Times interviewed Larry Ellison, the chief executive officer of Oracle. The following are excerpts from the interview:FT: In an interview with the FT four years ago, you predicted an end to the period of disruptive innovation from small technology companies and said that, in a maturing industry, there would be slower growth and a consolidation of power in the hands of the market leaders. However, the software world seems to be awash with disruptive innovation again, in the form of open source software, software-as-a-service, and the Web 2.0 movement. What has changed?LE: I still think that to tackle the big jobs, the consolidation will continue. Take software-as-a-service. [The stand-alone software-as-a-service ventures] are tiny companies. I do believe in it, Oracle has offered software-as-a-service for some time. I own 5 per cent of Salesforce.com, I was a founding investor. It’s a delivery mechanism for software. I believe, over time, more and more software will be delivered as a service – I totally believe that. I would argue I started the first big software-as-a-service company, [Netsuite]. I think you’ll see SAP and Oracle simply adapting to that.FT: Mark Benioff of Salesforce.com would say, though, that the multi-tenanted architecture of a true software-as-a-service company is a very different business to the kind of hosted software Oracle sells.LE: It wasn’t his idea. And it’s sheer nonsense: most companies don’t want multi-tenant. It’s a convenience for a supplier. Most companies don’t want their data co-mingled with other customers. Small companies will tolerate it.We make more money selling software-as-a-service than we make just selling software. I’d much rather be in the monthly service charge business, I’ve said this repeatedly. [At present] a huge percentage of our sales are done in the last week of the quarter: all of that goes away, it’s a much better business model.FT: But would Wall Street appreciate it? The stock market doesn’t seem to value Oracle’s recurring maintenance revenues as highly as your new licence sales.LE: I guess they don’t think recurring revenue at 90 per cent margins is very valuable. But then, Wall Street thought that Ariba was worth more than Daimler Benz [during the dotcom bubble.] All I can say is, our profit margins are now north of 40 per cent and will continue to grow past 50 [per cent] because more and more of our business will be in this recurring form, the form of subscription renewals rather than software sales.FT: But won’t your profit margins fall?LE: We make more margin dollars. In the end, the only thing that really matters is how many billions we make this year. I’d much rather make $10bn at 40 per cent margins than $8bn at 50 per cent margins. I want to make $10bn. Our margin dollars will increase at a higher rate with software-as-a-service. Plus there’s no piracy, and no need to maintain old versions. There are huge advantages to the model.FT: Will there be a difficult transition from new licence sales to regular recurring subscriptions?LE: If all people measure is our licence sales, they’re going to be really disappointed in our open source acquisitions, because I can tell them exactly what the open source new licence sales will be next year - it will be zero. On the one hand, people say open source and software-as-a-service are really hot – on the other hand, all they look at is our new licence sales. It’s the kind of absurdity that you find in the world at times.All I care about is that we keep growing our profits every year. We have a five-year plan to grow our profits at 20 per cent a year. Last year we overshot, we grew at 28 per cent. This year we will grow at 20. We’re growing our profits very, very rapidly.FT: Is open source going to be disruptive to Oracle?LE: No. If an open source product gets good enough, we’ll simply take it. Take [the web server software] Apache: once Apache got better than our own web server, we threw it away and took Apache. So the great thing about open source is nobody owns it – a company like Oracle is free to take it for nothing, include it in our products and charge for support, and that’s what we’ll do. So it is not disruptive at all – you have to find places to add value. Once open source gets good enough, competing with it would be insane. Keep in mind it’s not that good in most places yet. We’re a big supporter of Linux. At some point we may embed Linux in all of our products and provide support.Just like software-as-a-service, we have to be good at it. We don’t have to fight open source, we have to exploit open source. At some point we could very well choose to have Linux as part of the Oracle database server. We certify it, we test it. We could have JBoss as part of our middleware. It costs us nothing. We can do that, IBM can do that, HP can do that – anyone with a large support organisation is free to take that intellectual property and embed it in their own products.I’ve had this discussion with the CEOs of open source companies. We’ve looked at buying some, some with very high price tags – but since we already have access to all the intellectual property, why wouldn’t we just embed this technology in our technology and provide support.FT: Yet you have bought an open source database company – what did you buy it for?LE: The people. If the price is reasonable, and you’re getting a high quality development team – we love the Berkeley DB guys. It’s a great team.The way open source companies are valued now is interesting. Wall Street looks back at the historic growth rate and extrapolates it out forever, that’s the way it works. It’s kind of funny.What if IBM were to decide to support Red Hat Linux – what does that do to Red Hat? One of the big problems we have with Red Hat today is, they’re not very good at supporting the customers, so we help them a lot – we want them to be successful, because Red Hat is to some degree our way of competing with Microsoft down at the core level. But they’re a small company and they’re not supporting the customers very well.FT: What are the arguments against Oracle distributing its own Linux version?LE: They’re not very strong – now that Red Hat has bought JBoss and competes with us in middleware, we have to relook at the relationship – so does IBM. If Oracle were to have its own Linux distribution, or just provide paid support for Red Hat, that’s one thing – if Oracle and IBM both did it, it’s a whole new world. I don’t think Oracle and IBM want to create a second Microsoft in Red Hat. But you can’t – because Red Hat doesn’t own anything, they own nothing. They couldn’t [become the next Microsoft], they own nothing.FT: How well has Novell done in becoming a viable competitor to Red Hat? [Encouraged by large technology companies like Oracle and IBM, Novell bought German Linux company SuSe two years ago.]LE:I would say, not very well. Several of our big customers have switched to Novell because they get better service from Novell. But still, Red Hat competing with a Novell is one thing – Red Hat competing with IBM or Oracle is quite different.FT: Why didn’t you buy JBoss?LE: JBoss wanted to sell the company to us. Clearly if we wanted to buy JBoss we’d have bought JBoss. Why didn’t we buy JBoss? Because we don’t have to – if it ever got good enough we’d just take the intellectual property – just like Apache – embed it in our fusion middleware suite, and we’re done. We always have that option available to us – IBM always has that option available to them.The reason I have a hard time writing checks for billions or hundreds of millions of dollars for things that are open source is that if we could do this, other people could do this too. I don’t see how we could possibly buy Red Hat – IBM would just say, Larry, congratulations, we’re going our own way. They could hire Red Hat people and they’d be in business straight away. So I don’t see how anyone can buy Red Hat, not at anything near these prices, because anyone who feels like taking the code – they have no intellectual property.We see in China and India, all that stuff is freely available and Red Hat is just cut completely out of the market. I’m not gong to spend $5bn, or $6bn, for something that can just be so completely wiped off the map. They take all the Red Hat code, have their own equivalent of the Red Hat network, and Red Hat gets zero.So its all very interesting. You can build a sustainable business [in open source], you just can’t charge a lot for it. There’s brand value – there’s real brand – there’s people, and that’s it.[Click here for part two of the transcript]
995;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-16T21:35:36Z;Oracle considers venturing into Linux;;Oracle is studying whether to launch its own version of the Linux operating system and has looked at buying one of the two companies currently dominating the Linux world, according to Larry Ellison, the software company’s chief executive officer.Such a move would redraw the software landscape and open a new front in Oracle’s long rivalry with US rival Microsoft.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Ellison said that Oracle wanted to sell a full “stack” of software that, like Microsoft, included both operating system and applications.“I’d like to have a complete stack,” he said. “We’re missing an operating system. You could argue that it makes a lot of sense for us to look at distributing and supporting Linux.”Like IBM, Oracle has counted on Linux – an open source system whose code is open to anyone to view and adapt – to act as a counterweight to Microsoft’s Windows, which has expanded rapidly from desktop PCs into corporate IT systems.As part of a recent study of the open source software market, Mr Ellison said that Oracle had considered buying Novell, which after Red Hat is the biggest distributor of Linux. “We look at everything, play this thing out,” he added.Red Hat’s own acquisition last week of JBoss – another open source company whose products compete with Oracle and IBM – could shake up alliances in the Linux world and provide another reason to act, said Mr Ellison.“Now that Red Hat . . . competes with us in middleware, we have to re-look at the relationship – so does IBM,” he said.On Red Hat’s growing influence and its ambitions to reach beyond the Linux operating system, he added: “I don’t think Oracle and IBM want another Microsoft in Red Hat.”Mr Ellison also said he was pushing Oracle further into hosting software on behalf of customers, relying on regular subscription payments rather than upfront revenue. But he feels Wall Street has not given the company enough credit for this kind of move to alternative revenue streams.
996;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-16T20:54:34Z;Prophet of Oracle’s evolving future;;"Sitting in a sparse Japanese pavilion beside a private lake hidden among the wooded hills of northern California, the software industry's second-richest man seems fully in command of his domain.This is Larry Ellison's personal Xanadu. Designed, he says, to resemble a Japanese village with structures from different parts of the country's history, it has taken five years to plan and 10 to build.""There's a primal connection to running water, and cut, unfinished wood,"" says Mr Ellison, as he tries to explain why, since he was a young man, he has felt most at home in Japanese gardens.Watching shrouds of cherry blossom blow from trees across the lake, he seems momentarily entranced. ""It's a wonderful counterpoint to the rest of my life, which is not calm. I'm very intense."" With a laugh, he recalls the ironic nickname given to him by one of the first programmers at Oracle, the database software company he founded in 1977: ""Captain Mellow.""Yet, at 62, Mr Ellison admits that lately he has been slowing down. ""My work week is down to 50 hours - I work less,"" he says. Safra Catz, a former investment banker who has become Mr Ellison's second-in-command, has taken on most of the day-to-day tasks at Oracle, leaving Mr Ellison freer to concentrate on engineering, which he says has always been his main focus.Among other things, it has also left him a little more time to think. Recently, he says, he has been dwelling a lot on the potential - and the threat - of open-source software. He recites the questions he has been addressing: ""Is it disruptive, is it a risk, how do we respond to it, can it hurt us, how can we take advantage of it?""This sounds very different from the Larry Ellison of four years ago, when the technology industry was still in free-fall after the boom of the 1990s. In an interview then with the Financial Times, he argued that the early era of innovation in technology was over and that making software was becoming as boring, and mature, as any traditional metal-bashing industry. He also predicted a wave of mergers, as software companies came to realise that the go-go days were over.Within months, Oracle had embarked on a round of acquisitions that shook the software world. They included a bruising hostile bid for PeopleSoft, which led Mr Ellison to fight and win a court battle against the Department of Justice's trust-busters, and the purchase of Siebel Systems.Innovation in the software world, however, has not come to an end. The rise of the Linux operating system and other open-source software is just one of the new forces that threaten to shake software giants such as Oracle. Others include ""software as a service"" - the practice of running software on behalf of a customer and selling access to it under a monthly subscription fee.Meanwhile, Silicon Valley is also buzzing again over a new style of lightweight software development, dubbed ""Web 2.0"", that lets small groups of developers conjure up the sort of products that were once within the reach only of big software companies.Faced with this new upheaval in an industry that dates back barely three decades, Mr Ellison takes it in his stride. The demands of the big corporate systems built by companies such as Oracle will still force more mergers, he says. ""To tackle the big jobs, consolidation will continue.""In fact, Mr Ellison has shown himself adept at anticipating some of these new forces. He is the largest shareholder in Netsuite, one of the biggest software-as-a-service companies, which is expected to seek a Wall Street listing later this year. He was also an early backer of another, Salesforce.com, that was set up by Mark Benioff, a flamboyant former Oracle executive.Mention of Mr Benioff's success draws a sideswipe from Mr Ellison, who becomes characteristically abrasive in the face of former lieutenants who turn into rivals, including the former heads of PeopleSoft and Siebel Systems. ""It wasn't his idea,"" he says tartly. ""I would argue I started the first big software-as-a-service company.""Mr Ellison's answer to the new disruptive forces in software - embrace them - has been most apparent in his recent conversion to open source. By allowing anyone to use and adapt their code free of charge, and generally charging only for maintenance, open-source companies benefit from a low-cost approach to developing and distributing software that threatens to disrupt established software empires.""We don't have to fight open source, we have to exploit open source,"" says Mr Ellison.Last week, it looked as though his plans had suffered a setback. Oracle had been trying to buy JBoss, one of the most prominent of the new breed of open source companies: instead, it was bought by the leading Linux company Red Hat.The disagreement, says Mr Ellison, was all about price. ""JBoss wanted to sell the company to us. Clearly, if we wanted to buy JBoss, we’d have bought JBoss.""Without control of their own intellectual property, open-source companies are vulnerable to seeing their products simply absorbed by companies such as Oracle, says Mr Ellison. ""The reason I have a hard time writing cheques for billions or hundreds of millions of dollars for things that are open source is that if we could do this, other people could do this too.""Those considerations seem also to have dissuaded Oracle from trying to buy one of the big Linux companies, at least for now. ""I don't see how we could possibly buy Red Hat . . . I'm not going to spend $5bn, or $6bn, for something that can just be so completely wiped off the map,"" he says. Oracle looked at buying Novell, owner of SuSe, Europe's biggest Linux company, but would have faced the same risk, he adds.Along with open source, Mr Ellison says he has been pushing Oracle further into software as a service by hosting software on behalf of customers. Indeed, mention of the new business model around these types of software, which rely on regular subscription payments rather than the upfront revenue associated with traditional software sales, touches a nerve: Mr Ellison has complained for some time that Wall Street has failed to give his company credit as it shifted towards a greater reliance on regular maintenance payments.""On the one hand, people say open source and software as a service are really hot - on the other hand, all they look at is our new licence sales,"" he says. ""It's the kind of absurdity you find in the world sometimes.""While some of the forces that have hit the industry may have been far more disruptive than Mr Ellison himself seemed to expect four years ago, other trends look like a return to software's roots. Oracle, like its arch-rival SAP, has been intent on building a complete ""stack"" of software, ranging from the database software on which its business was founded to the ""middleware"" that acts as the glue holding internet-based systems together and the applications that run on top.Tying all the parts of the software stack together makes information systems more manageable, according to Mr Ellison. ""It's all synchronised - that's the Microsoft approach, and that was historically the IBM approach for a very long time,"" he says.The prospect of software once more coalescing into monolithic blocks sold by single companies is likely to leave customers feeling decidedly ambivalent. But buying from a single supplier would make life easier.""Most of our big customers would rather have one phone number to call - the classic 'one throat to choke',"" says Mr Ellison. If Oracle also sold a Linux system, ""from the operating system up to the application, we're completely responsible. We test everything together, have one set of management tools.""Yet stacks of software like this make it harder for companies to choose between components from different suppliers, potentially reducing competition.""Customers want integration, and they want choice. To some extent those things are at odds,"" says Mr Ellison. Oracle will be able to ease the concerns, he predicts, ""as long as we do a good job and we don't price-gouge them. That would be self-defeating - we make plenty of money now.""Gazing out at the peaceful lake, with the clean smell of Douglas fir and cedar seeping from the rafters and walls of the Japanese pavilion, the scale of the riches at stake are readily apparent.In spite of his air of perfect calm, though, Mr Ellison seems far too restless to think of retirement yet. ""I love my job - I don't need the money,"" he says."
997;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-11T12:42:06Z;Red Hat agrees to buy open-source upstart;;The fast-growing open-source software industry took a big step towards the mainstream on Monday as Red Hat, the biggest distributor of the Linux computer operating system, agreed to buy upstart JBoss for up to $420m.The acquisition creates the first open-source company able to offer a broad array of the so-called “infrastructure” software on which corporate IT systems are based. As such, it could pose a long-term challenge to companies like Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, all of which sell traditional commercial alternatives, said Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Goldman Sachs.The new threat from open-source companies, which are founded on a low-cost approach to developing and distributing software, has drawn some of the technology industry’s biggest names into a flurry of acquisitions in recent months.Oracle itself tried to buy JBoss earlier this year as part of an attempt to build an open-source “stack”, or package, of software that would act as a low-priced alternative to its existing products. IBM last year bought Gluecode, a rival to JBoss.Open-source companies allow others to view and rewrite their software and usually distribute their code free over the internet, greatly reducing their development and distribution costs. Most charge fees for packaging open-source programs into reliable commercial-grade products, and for support.While still small, open-source has become one of the fastest-growing corners of the software industry. JBoss had revenues of $16.2m over the last 12 months and is expected to have sales of $48m this year, said Charlie Peters, Red Hat’s chief financial officer.Until now, companies like IBM and Oracle have used Linux, the best-established open-source product, as a way to fight back against Microsoft’s Windows operating system. That has made them important allies of Red Hat.However, other companies that have sprung up in Red Hat’s wake have become more direct rivals. They include JBoss and MySQL. The former makes application server software and other “middleware” that lets companies run their applications over the internet, directly rivalling IBM and Microsoft. MySQL’s database is an alternative to products sold by Oracle, IBM and Microsoft.Matthew Szulik, Red Hat chief executive, on Monday played down the suggestion that Red Hat was seeking to build a full stack of software to compete with the established software giants. He hinted, however, that the company would also now look to expand into database software, the biggest area of infrastructure software where it is not yet represented.“We’re going to sit down…and think about that,” he said. “Already, customers are asking what to do with their unstructured data.”News of the cash-and-stock acquisition, for an initial $350m with a further $70m based on future performance, pushed Red Hat’s shares up by nearly 9 per cent in early New York trading, valuing it at $5.3bn.
998;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-04-06T21:49:28Z;New issues: ConocoPhilips in $3bn deal;;ConocoPhillips, the US oil and gas group, sold $3bn of bonds on Thursday, replacing part of the bridge finance raised for its $36bn purchase of Burlington Resources, which closed last week.The issue comprised $1bn of one-year floating rate notes at three-month Libor, $1.25bn of three-year floaters at Libor plus 10 basis points, and another $750m in seven-year fixed-rate paper yielding 63bp over Treasuries.Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s assigned A- ratings, while Moody’s rated the issue A1. ConocoPhillips said it would have about $28bn of debt outstanding following the close of the Burlington deal.Citigroup, RBS Greenwich, Bank of America and Barclays Capital were joint bookrunners.Strong investor interest saw Viacom, the US media and entertainment group, sell $4.75bn of debt late on Wednesday. The issue was the third biggest in the US this year after offerings by technology groups Cisco Systems and Oracle.Viacom sold $1.5bn each in five and 10-year notes and $1.75bn in 30-year paper, with the issue increased in size from an expected $4bn. The extra bonds were all in the 30-year tranche, underscoring investor demand for long-dated assets.The three tranches, rated towards the low end of investment grade, were priced to yield 110 basis points, 147bp and 195bp respectively over Treasuries.Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan lead-managed the sale.In Europe Adecco, the Swiss recruitment group, set price guidance for its twin bond issue yesterday that aims to raise €700m to fund its acquisition of German rival Dis.The issue is split into a €150m-€200m two-year floating rate note, which is expected to price at 23-25 basis points over three-month Euribor, and a seven-year benchmark bond, worth €500m, which is expected to price at 67-70bp over mid-swaps.Final pricing for the issue is expected on Friday.The bonds, being sold by Goldman Sachs, SG CIB and UBS, will have a change of control clause allowing investors to sell them back to Adecco if its ratings are cut below investment grade due to a takeover.Adecco is currently rated at the lowest investment grade rung of Baa3/BBB-.
999;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;The Week in Technology: Foes reunited;;The long-running dispute between the EU and Microsoft fired up once again this week, with Neelie Kroes, Competition Commissioner, warning the software giant that features planned for inclusion in its long-delayed Vista operating system might fall foul of anti-trust rules. Meanwhile a two-day hearing began on Thursday morning in which Microsoft defended itself against the commission’s belief that it has not complied with requirements from the landmark 2004 decision found Windows violated anti-trust rules.On Friday IBM, Novell and Oracle were preparing to tell regulators that they too believed Microsoft had not complied with the ruling. More than a few of Microsoft’s rivals have been involved with the EU’s actions over the years and in February a group called the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, whose members include IBM, Oracle, Nokia and Sun Microsystems, also lodged a separate, new complaint with the EU Competition Commission about Vista several days after details of the operating system were revealed.Apple v. Apple back in courtApple Computer and The Beatles’ record label, Apple Corp, have a history of legal tussles dating back 25 years, and is far longer and stranger than that of Microsoft and the EU. Their last legal case was settled in 1991 with an agreement that Apple Corp’s lawyer summarised this week in London’s High Court as: “We do music, you do computer delivery systems”. Since then, the success of Apple’s iTunes music store prompted the record label to take them back to court. Geoffrey Vos, QC, also revealed that Steve Jobs had phoned Neil Aspinall, The Beatles’ former road manager who is now managing director of Apple Corp, to ask if his company could buy the “Apple Records” mark for $1m about a month before the launch of the online music store.Rumours of an Apple iPhone coming any time soon were comprehensively quashed by ThinkSecret, which outlined various problems the company is believed to be having with building its phone from the ground up. Om Malik scoffed at MacRumours’ use of a picture of an imagined iPhone snaffled from the April 2005 edition of Business 2.0.Ever more ways to Google bombOn a happier and more web 2.0-friendly note, Philipp Lenssen at Google Blogoscoped pondered Seth Finkelstein’s discovery of a way to Google-bomb the blog rankings within Google’s new finance page, but concluded that focusing on content was a better strategy at the end of the day, as it would avoid falling prey to algorithm changes. “After all, whatever the search engines change it won’t pay out for them if they make relevant good content disappear from the top results,” Lenssen wrote, shortly before making the serendipitous discovery that his own posting had made it to #2 on Google Finance’s page on Google.Meanwhile the wild but very believable rumours of a Google plan to take its advertising model into IP-based TV gained traction with reports of an advertisement for an interactive TV product manager.
1000;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-30T20:58:19Z;US rivals gang up on Microsoft;;IBM, Novell and Oracle, the software and technology groups, will tell European Union regulators on Friday that Microsoft has not done enough to comply with a 2004 antitrust ruling.Software experts from the three companies will testify at a European Commission hearing in Brussels to examine whether Microsoft should be punished for failing to abide by the Commission’s landmark ruling.They will take the stand a day after Microsoft had a last chance to demonstrate it has complied with a key part of that decision – the order to license technical information about the Windows operating system to rivals.Brussels says the information is needed by other companies to develop server software compatible with the Windows system.Both the Commission and Microsoft’s rivals say it has so far failed to draw up “complete and accurate” documentation to that effect, and the regulator is now threatening to impose fines of up €2m ($2.4m) a day. IBM, Novell and Oracle are expected to say that they have twice reviewed Microsoft’s documentation and found it inadequate. Their views are set to clash with assurances by Microsoft yesterday that its technical documentation exceeds industry standards.The group sought to back up that claim by submitting statements from six technology companies including EMC, the data storage company. They have licensed Microsoft interoperability information similar to that mandated by the Commission ruling and said the documentation was “useful and helpful”.Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, said: “We are in compliance with the Commission decision and we are committed to doing everything in our power to find a solution to this impasse.”But a Commission spokesman dismissed Microsoft’s claims, saying: “Many companies have told us that the information provided by Microsoft is not useful.”Microsoft yesterday played down its recent sharp criticism of the Commission’s procedures, though it emerged that the State Department had intervened to raise similar concerns.A Brussels-based US official said the State Department letter to the Commission and EU member says: “Microsoft’s allegations that [the Commission’s] procedures have lacked transparency and fairness, if accurate, are of substantial concern to the US”.
1001;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-21T21:35:16Z;Lex: Oracle;;Nice headlines, shame about the detail. A glance at Oracle’s third quarter results paints a beguiling picture. Revenues rose by 18 per cent year-on-year. Net income jumped 42 per cent. The applications software business had a strong quarter.A closer look leaves investors with a different image. First, the numbers are flattered by the company’s acquisition spree. The inclusion of PeopleSoft for a full quarter and weeks of Siebel Systems helped boost the top line. Cost savings turbo-charged profits.Second, Oracle’s database business, which accounts for the bulk of the group’s value, failed to live up to expectations on new licence sales. High-margin revenues from maintenance and upgrades provide a solid base for Oracle’s cash flow but strong licence sales are the spice that is needed to make the group look like a growth stock again.The same fuzzy picture applies for Oracle’s valuation. On the face of it, the software group looks cheap. On consensus estimates, following Monday’s 3.7 per cent after-market fall, the shares trade on about 16 times calendar 2006 earnings. That is roughly in line with the broader market, in spite of the fact that Oracle’s earnings should grow faster.However, for consensus numbers, analysts exclude charges for amortising intangible assets and stock-option expensing. Once they are included as expenses, the multiple rises to more than 19-times, according to Sanford Bernstein. There is also the risk of further aggressive acquisitions under Larry Ellison’s leadership and the challenge Oracle faces to integrate the applications software from acquisitions into a single platform. On that basis, Oracle does not look so cheap.
1002;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-21T21:29:09Z;Rate fears weigh on Wall Street;;Shares on Wall Street lost ground on Tuesday amid renewed concerns over the prospect of further interest rate rises.Stocks came under pressure as investors mulled over a speech from Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, that seemed to quell hopes for a quick end to the current US rate-increasing cycle.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent lower at 1,297.23, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,294.23, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.4 per cent to 11,235.47.Shares in GM continued their recent roller-coaster ride, up 5.5 per cent to $22.00 after falling more than 6 per cent over the last two sessions.Reports that the ailing vehicle maker was closing in on a deal with the United Auto Workers union and car parts supplier Delphi appeared to have triggered the latest rally.Analysts remained downbeat on the stock, with Citigroup reiterating its “sell” rating, saying that GM faced an estimated $4.7bn in idle hourly labour costs over the next two years.Dell Computer limited losses on the Nasdaq. Its shares rose 1.7 per cent to $30.27 after the world’s largest maker of personal computers said it expected sales growth to outpace the broader industry in 2006, thanks to rapid expansion in Asia.Shares in Oracle fell 0.7 per cent to $13.62 as the world’s third largest software maker reported disappointing third-quarter profits late on Monday.Apple Computer lost 3.4 per cent to $61.81 as France’s lower house of parliament passed a law that could challenge the company’s dominance of the online digital music market.Elsewhere in the technology sector, chipmaker Nvidia made progress, rising 4.9 per cent to $50.79 to reach a four-year high after an upgrade from Lehman Brothers.Video game maker Electronic Arts gained 2 per cent to $53.72 after Merrill Lynch upped its rating and price target on the stock. The broker said a “compelling” line-up of games should help boost EA’s earnings growth.News that Jones Apparel, owner of Nine West label and Barneys department stores, was considering putting itself up for sale drove its shares up 13 per cent to $34.84.The shares had been struggling in recent months as a result of weak demand in its wholesale footwear and accessories businesses.Elsewhere, rumours that Sir Richard Branson might be looking to buy out Bally Total Fitness sent shares in the health club chain up 14.7 per cent to $8.99.Healthways climbed 19.3 per cent to $47.14 after the healthcare company lifted its earnings guidance for the fiscal year 2006. Jefferies & Co raised its rating on the stock from “hold” to “buy”.Barr Pharmaceuticals rose 3.2 per cent to $65.59 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock, citing the growth potential of generic-drug sales.
1003;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Market Overview: Bernanke boosts dollar but leaves equities subdued;;"Global equity markets produced subdued performances on Tuesday weighed down
by statements from Ben
Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, that
were perceived to be mildly hawkish.The optimism that prevailed among equity and bond investors last week that the Fed might be nearing the end of its current cycle of monetary policy tightening waned a little after Mr Bernanke’s speech on Monday night to the Economic Club of New York.Mr Bernanke was seen to be positive on the economic outlook and gave little hint that the central bank would soon stop raising rates.He said he did not interpret the narrowing gap between short and long-term rates as “indicating a significant economic slowdown to come,’’ saying it might instead reflect investors’ confidence in the economy.A more hawkish view of the rate outlook was given modest reinforcement by news of a rise in core US wholesale prices in February. Producer prices, excluding food and energy prices, grew 0.3 per cent last month, above the 0.1 per cent expected by economists.In reaction, the dollar gained about 0.8 per cent against the euro while treasuries declined. Yields on 10-year treasuries rose 5.9 basis points to 4.721 per cent.However, US shares rallied from early lows. By midday, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,309.33, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.4 per cent to 11,320.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,331.57, lifted by a recovery in software maker Oracle after disappointing third-quarter results late on Monday.Perhaps as significant as the content of Mr Bernanke’s speech was the style. Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist with Miller Tabak, said Mr Bernanke chose a delivery that was very different from Mr Greenspan, which may not necessarily yield the clarity that market participants were expecting from the Fed under the new chairman.He said that at the outset of the speech, Mr Bernanke added a qualifier that would never have been found in a Greenspan speech: “The views I will express are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.“By adding the qualifier, Bernanke made it clear that he would be a chairman that would seek to ignite an open debate and that a consensus on the FOMC would be formed around that debate. This is a big change from Greenspan’s tenure, where the chairman would lay out his views and seek to build a consensus from there,” Mr Crescenzi argued.“These differences could actually result in less transparency under Bernanke because market participants would have to interpret for themselves which way the debate might swing.”In Europe, shares just managed to extend its winning streak to nine sessions. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,373.56, despite declines in oil stocks.Attention turned once again to Iceland after an eye-catching report by Danske Bank warned the country’s economy was heading for a recession tha might push the krona 25 per cent lower in the next year.The krona fell 2.8 per cent while the country’s share benchmark the ICEX 15 Index declined 2.3 per cent.In Asia, Mumbai crossed a key index threshold before slipping. The BSE 30 index hit an intra-day record high of 11,017 before closing at 10,905.20, down 0.3 per cent. In Sydney, shares continued to retreat. The S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 4,991.3. The Tokyo market was closed."
1004;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-20T21:20:36Z;Tech stocks climb but Wall Street marks time;;Shares on Wall Street paused for breath on Monday following last week’s strong run and as investors kept their powder dry ahead of a keynote speech from Ben Bernanke, federal Reserve chairman.Investors were looking to Mr Bernanke to offer clues to the future of US interest rate policy in an address at the Economic Club of New York after the market close.“It’s all about Bernanke,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach. “If he elaborates on the decline in the housing market, we could see the Fed surprise the market by stopping the current rate hiking cycle sooner than expected and set the stage for another equity bull run.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1 per cent to 11,274.53. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index put on 0.3 per cent to 2,314.11, while the S&P 500, which last week hit its highest level since May 2001, slipped 0.2 per cent to 1,305.08.Technology stocks rallied ahead of Oracle’s earnings results, due after the close. Shares in the software maker rose 0.9 per cent to $13.72, while rival Adobe, which is scheduled to report its figures on Wednesday, gained 1.6 per cent to $36.55.The Nasdaq was also supported by Dell Computer’s 2.3 per cent advance. Shares in the computer maker climbed to $29.76 after it said it would double its workforce in India to 20,000 over the next three years.Other sector movers included Microsoft, up 1.4 per cent at $27.89, and Google, 2.5 per cent higher at $348.19.Shares in Wal-Mart hit their highest level this year, rising 2.3 per cent to $47.76 amid reports that the world’s largest retailer was set to announce a large expansion of its Chinese operations. A Wal-Mart executive said the company could hire 150,000 people in China over the next five years and open 20 stores in the country in 2006.Drugmaker Schering-Plough gained 4.6 per cent to $19.33 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock from “underperform” to “inline” citing earnings leverage from the company’s cholesterol drug Vytorin.Boeing edged 0.4 per cent higher to $78.18 after Prudential raised its price target on the company’s shares to $83. The broker said the new price estimate was based on higher than expected 777 aircraft deliveriesShares in Michael Stores rose 12.9 per cent to $38.35 after the largest arts and crafts retailer in the US said it was exploring strategic options, which might include putting itself up for sale.Bid hopes also boosted St Paul Travelers, up 0.8 per cent to $41.90, despite a denial from the insurer that it was in merger talks with Switzerland’s Zurich Financial Services.Sirius Satellite Radio rose 4.5 per cent to $5.11 after the US radio service said it had signed up 4m customers and forecast more than 6m by the end of this year.
1005;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-19T20:52:28Z;Oracle points to change in fortunes;;"Oracle is expected to show a return to underlying growth in its applications software business when it reports its earnings on Monday, ending a troubled period that followed its contested takeover of PeopleSoft.However, concern among customers about its future product plans following the acquisitions of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and other companies has prevented Oracle from reaping the benefits of the deals.The company’s shares ended last week virtually unchanged from their level of June 2003, when the company announced its hostile bid for PeopleSoft, while rival SAP has seen its shares jump by 75 per cent.“We’re still waiting to see the growth story from buying all these applications, and so far we haven’t seen it,” said Bruce Richardson, an analyst at AMR Research.While Oracle has reported growth from application software sales in the past year, that has come from its acquisitions rather than organic growth.“SAP has definitely benefited from what happened with the PeopleSoft merger, especially the uncertainty around that,” John Wookey, the executive in charge of Oracle’s applications business, said in an interview with the Financial Times. “There was an 18-month discombobulation in the marketplace. It hurt PeopleSoft; it hurt us.”That has helped SAP gain ground in Oracle’s home market, with the German company’s sales in the US rising at an average annualised rate of 30 per cent since late 2002, said Bill McDermott, head of SAP Americas. “[Oracle’s] loss is directly comparable to our gains,” he added. Mr Wookey blamed Oracle’s problems in applications partly on its failure to convince customers at the time of the PeopleSoft acquisition about the effectiveness of Project Fusion, its plan to merge the companies’ products.“The uncertainty which I think SAP really capitalised [on] over the past year in terms of exactly what is the plan for Fusion, is starting to go away,” he said."
1006;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Get it now from Ebay, hostage to the patent trolls;;Every now and then, a lawsuit comes along that speaks volumes about the political, economic and social choices of the culture that spawned it. The legal battle over the ubiquitous BlackBerry was like that: a case that captured, in one courtroom, the storm of forces buffeting the US innovation economy.Yet, with that suit settled this month and BlackBerry users blissfully thumbing their way back to connectivity, the tempest has not abated. In less than two weeks the same types of character that peopled the BlackBerry saga – the technology titans and “patent trolls” of the digital age – will assemble for another battle over the rules of innovation. They will appear before the US Supreme Court for what could prove a landmark fight over the ownership of ideas, in a world where ideas increasingly determine prosperity.The case involves Ebay, the online auction giant – in particular, the patent for the fixed-price “buy it now” transactions that form the faint-hearted version of the site’s frenetic bidding wars. It poses many of the same dilemmas as the lawsuit that nearly darkened all those hand-held screens.Is US patent law stifling innovation? Are low-quality patents compromising American competitiveness? What is the right balance of power between those who own intellectual property and those who want to produce goods in the digital marketplace without constantly being sued for trespassing on someone else’s ideas?“This case has profound implications for technological innovation,” says Ted Olson, former US solicitor-general, in a brief filed on behalf of Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and other high-tech companies, one of a raft of high-profile submissions by industry groups to lobby the court with their different visions of the new economy.“The patent system is the foundation for the United States’ global leadership position in technological development,” says Mr Olson, but he argues that over-broad patent rights are reducing incentives to invest in manufacturing, research and development. He says it is time to “restore the balance” between the rights of patent holders and the broader social good of encouraging innovation.Every technological leap forward brings its own legal crisis: now the Supreme Court is being asked to figure out how ancient patent laws should be reinterpreted to cope with the digital economy. High-tech companies say things are different now: each of their products may be based on thousands of pieces of technology and it is simply impossible to know whether any bit might have independently been imagined by someone else.Anyone who gets a patent on that bit of the invention – not difficult in a world of overworked and under-resourced patent examiners – can hold the whole product hostage, to extract a settlement far more valuable than the worth of the original idea, they say.The key to all this power is that federal courts will almost always grant an injunction in cases where infringement has already been proved – stopping people who make things from continuing to do so, even if the patent they have breached is only a tiny fraction of the total. That is the issue before the Supreme Court on March 29 in Ebay v MercExchange: should courts have discretion to consider the big picture or just grant, in almost every instance, an injunction that can shut down popular products such as the BlackBerry? Does the availability of injunctions give patent owners a weapon to hold legitimate companies hostage for, sometimes unwittingly, infringing their patents?Ebay lost a lawsuit brought by MercExchange, a company based in the Washington suburbs, which claimed that electronic fixed-price sales had previously been patented by Thomas Woolston, its founder. The issue before the Supreme Court is not whether Ebay infringed Mr Woolston’s patent but whether that infringement obliges a court to stop Ebay from conducting “buy it now” deals until the company has designed around the offended patent. The district court judge denied an injunction, largely because Mr Woolston’s company does not make anything: he drew a distinction between companies that exist only to sue and those that produce nifty gadgets. The federal appeals court for patents reversed that decision, ruling that injunctions should be issued in all but “exceptional circumstances”.Companies that use patents as a “litigation opportunity” have got a bad name recently, especially after the BlackBerry case, where a patent troll – a company that owns patents and sues to defend them but does not make anything related to the patent – threatened a pillar of the digital economy.But one such company has filed a brief in the Ebay case, arguing for the social utility of trolls. Patents create a property right that can function properly only if such rights are tradeable, says Rembrandt IP Management, a company that self-confessedly “invests in patents but does not practise them”. Such operators act as intermediaries between those who create and those who commercialise their creations, adds the company, which describes its role as a “market-maker” to innovation.“The injunction is a critical part of the balance of power between competition and innovation,” says Stephen Maebius, a patent expert at Foley & Lardner, the law firm. “Even a slight alteration in the power of the injunction could dramatically alter that balance of power,” he adds, noting that the Supreme Court must choose in the case between two segments of American industry – high-tech companies that want to weaken the injunction power and pharmaceutical producers that say they need injunctions to defend their huge investment in drug development.The justices seem likely to steer a middle path, reminding the lower courts that such injunctions should be granted only where doing so would balance the hardships to both parties and the public interest. That alone would not solve the larger American crisis of confidence about patents but it would help restore the balance of power between those who make and those who sue.
1007;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Observer - US;;"The very rich (mostly) get richerBill Gates is still the world’s biggest billionaire and Warren Buffett is number two. But Forbes says the big news is membership in the 10-digit club is has increased to 723 this year, up by 102 from last year.What caused the surge? The magazine says strong stock markets around the world lifted some out of the millionaire ghetto. And the weakness of the dollar has also given the non-US wealthy a boost.The survey noted that the total net worth of the group was up 18 per cent to $2,600bn, in spite of Gates’s losing ground. The Microsoft founder saw his net worth drop (but not exactly plummet) to $46.5bn from $46.6bn in 2004.Just under half the billionaires come from the US – and have $1,100bn of the list’s net worth – but 49 countries were represented. New York is still the place to be for the über-rich, with 40 residents on the list. Moscow is second with 25 and London is third with 23 (one of whom is James Dyson, who debuted this year at 746, thanks to his fancy vacuum). India added the most new billionaires this year, with 10 more.The top 10 is geographically diverse. Coming in at numbers three to six are: Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel magnate; Carlos Slim Helu, the Mexican telecommunications mogul; Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Saudi investor; and Ingvar Kamprad, the Swede who gave the world Ikea.Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, is number seven, followed by Karl Albrecht, who made his fortune in German supermarkets, and Larry Ellison, the Oracle founder and sailing boat racer.This means only one of the five descendants of the Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton is in the top 10. His eldest son, S. Robson Walton, with $18.3bn, edged out his youngest, Jim Walton, by $100m. Mother Helen, 85, is bested by all her children and is getting by on $18bn.All of whom did better than the list’s biggest loser: Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the jailed former head of Yukos, whose net worth went from $12.8bn to $2.2bn.Rudy Giuliani has never quite fitted the national profile of a Republican politician. The former New York mayor’s stance on social issues
such as gay rights and abortion give the party’s right wing a case of the willies.But Giuliani, who is widely believed to be considering a run for president in 2008, is making headlines this week as the Southern Republican Leadership Conference opens in Memphis. Not because he is giving a big speech – John McCain, a likely contender for the 2008 Republican nomination, is doing that – but because he has chosen to skip the event.The SRL conference, held at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis, is generally thought of as a must-attend event for Republicans with presidential ambitions. So does this mean Rudy’s not running?Not quite. Giuliani, who campaigned relentlessly for George W. Bush’s re-election in 2004, is still working the national circuit. And, as Newsweek points out, he was recently a “surprise guest” at the annual convention of the Global Pastors Network, where he was well
received.He may be skipping Memphis but it looks as if Rudy is preparing the ground for a run.While mighty board battles continue to shake Vodafone, the UK telecoms group, Observer wonders what to make of developments in a far-flung part of its empire, Greece.Many expected George Koronias, its boss there, to lose his job after the Athens government revealed last month that the mobile phones of more than 100 prominent customers, including Costas Karamanlis, the prime minister, and most of his cabinet, had been tapped for eight months in 2004 and 2005.Bizarrely, the opposite has happened.On Wednesday – the day before Koronias testified at a parliamentary committee hearing on the phone-tapping scandal – he was promoted. Koronias’s turf has been expanded to include not just Greece but the group’s business development in east Europe and the Balkans.In his testimony on Thursday Koronias tried to shift responsibility for the illegal wiretapping by claiming that technicians from Ericsson, one of Vodafone’s main equipment suppliers in Greece, had installed the surveillance software and hadn’t made codes available to their Vodafone colleagues. Ericsson in turn said it had been co-operating with the authorities since the spying was discovered a year ago.The government clearly found Koronias’s defence hard to swallow. When the scandal broke last month, officials praised him for uncovering a threat to national security.On Thursday, the line changed dramatically.Koronias, the government said, failed to provide “basic details” about the wire-tapping. With the trail gone cold, it’s unlikely the police will ever discover just who was listening in on the PM’s calls.The German public will soon be able to enjoy the presence of British bobbies on their local Hauptstrasse. Under UK government plans to crack down on troublemakers at this year’s World Cup, uniformed British police will accompany plain-clothes officers to Germany.The move is meant to prevent the traditional rivalry between the two nations turning violent as more than 100,000 British fans are expected to travel to the competition.Given the tough handling some British thugs have received in the past from foreign police when
they have been out of order, some louts might at least appreciate a
more familiar face when it comes to facing up to the forces of law and order."
1008;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-07T16:41:51Z;New architecture or just new hype?;;"Depending on whom you listen to, it could be the most important shift in corporate computing since the advent of the internet – or it could be just the latest excuse for technology companies to hype their products in a dismal market.“We believe it’s the Next Big Thing,” says Henning Kagermann, chairman of SAP, Europe’s biggest software company.“It’s the new fashion statement,” counters Mark Barrenechea, chief technology officer of Computer Associates. “I’m sceptical.”The “it” in question goes by the ungainly name of “service-oriented architecture”, or SOA for short. According to the big software companies, its impact on computing will be as big as the client-server revolution of the early 1990s, or the arrival of web-based applications with the internet.“Every five or 10 years, we see this in the industry,” says John Wookey, the executive in charge of Oracle’s Project Fusion, the giant effort to re-engineer all of the software applications inherited as a result of that company’s various acquisitions.For those with ambitions to dominate the next phase of corporate software – SAP, Oracle, IBM and Microsoft – it represents an important turning-point. “When these transitions occur you have your best opportunity to change the competitive landscape,” adds Mr Wookey.Yet for customers, the benefits and costs of this next transformation in the underlying computing architecture are still hard to ascertain.Bruce Richardson, chief research officer at AMR Research, draws attention to the unexpected costs that came with the rise of client-server computing: the soaring hardware and software expenses, the difficulty of supporting such a wide array of machines, and the cost of dealing with security flaws.“That ended up being a huge bill,” he notes.It is hardly surprising that enterprise software companies – those that create the heavy-duty software that big corporations and governments use to run their operations – are so eager to latch on to the next big thing.An industry still in its infancy is facing potential disruptive upheaval (see other articles on Pages 6-8 of this section). New licensing models and ways of delivering software, along with open-source approaches to development and distribution, are turning the young software industry on its head.At the same time, the maturity of existing applications and the technology platform on which they run has left the best-established enterprise software companies stuck in a period of slow growth.That is fertile soil for extravagant marketing claims to take root in1`.Even if SOA risks being over-hyped, however, it still seems likely to represent an important step forward for today’s often monolithic corporate IT systems.By harnessing industry-wide tech-nology standards that have been in development since the late 1990s, it promises at least a partial answer to one of the biggest drawbacks of the current computing base: a lack of flexibility that has driven up the cost of software development and forced companies to design their business pro-cesses around the needs of their IT systems, rather than the other way around.Software executives say that the inability to redesign IT systems rapidly to support new business processes, and to link those systems to customers and suppliers, was one of the main reasons for the failure of one of the great early promises of the internet – seamless “B2B”, or business-to-business, commerce.“It’s what killed the original [B2B] marketplaces,” says Shai Agassi, who heads SAP’s product and technology development.SAP is certainly further ahead than others in the race to build a more flexible computing platform. While Oracle and Microsoft are busy trying to create coherent packages of software applications from the corporate acquisitions they have made, SAP is halfway through a revamp of its technology that could give it a lead of two years or more.“If they’re right, it will be a huge thing for them,” says Charles Di Bona, software analyst at Sanford C Bernstein.Underlying the arrival of SOA has been the spread of so-called web services standards – such as the mark-up language XML and communications protocol SOAP – that make it easier for machines to exchange data automatically.This holds the promise of automating business processes that run across different IT systems, whether inside a single company or spanning several business partners: a customer placing an order in one system could automatically trigger production requests in another and an invoice in a third.Breaking down the different steps in a business process in this way, and making them available to be recombined quickly to suit particular business needs, is the ultimate goal of SOA. Each step in the process becomes a service, a single reusable component that is “exposed” through a standard interface.The smaller each of these software components, the more flexibility users will have to build IT systems that fit their particular needs.SAP has created 300 services so far; that number will rise to 3,000 by the end of this year, says Mr Agassi. Through NetWeaver, the set of “middleware” tools that provide the glue, it has also finalised much of the platform to deliver this new set of services. The full “business process platform” will be complete by the end of next year, SAP says.“The factory is running – we have all the tools ready now,” says Peter Graf, head of solution marketing at SAP. To get customers to start experimenting with the new technology, he adds, “we need to come up with killer apps”.The first full-scale demonstration will come from a project known as Mendecino, under which SAP and Microsoft have been working to integrate their “back-end” and “front-end” systems and which is due to be released in the middle of this year.By linking them to the widely used components of Microsoft’s Office desktop software, SAP’s corporate applications will become easier to use, says Mr Graf: for instance, when a worker enters a holiday in his or her Outlook calendar, it could automatically trigger an approval request to a manager and cross-check with a system that records holiday entitlements.While such demonstrations may start to show the potential of SOA, however, the real power of this architectural shift is likely to depend on a much broader ecosystem of software developers and corporate users.“People want to extend their business processes to get closer to customers,” says Mr Richardson at AMR. To do that through the “loosely coupled” IT systems promised by SOA will require wider adoption of the new technology architecture.A number of potential drawbacks stand in the way.Along with uncertainty about the ultimate cost, points out Mr Richardson, is concern about security: what safeguards will companies need before they are willing to let valuable corporate data travel outside their own IT systems, or before they open up their own networks to code developed elsewhere?A further question is whether SOA can fulfil one of its most important promises: that the technology platforms being created by SAP and others will stimulate a wave of innovation in the software industry, as developers rush to create new and better applications, many of them suited to the specific needs of particular industries or small groups of companies.That depends partly on whether companies such as SAP can create true technology “ecosystems” around their platforms, much as Microsoft’s success in desktop software depended on its ability to draw developers to its desktop software platform.“We were told three years ago that we didn’t know how to partner,” says Mr Agassi at SAP, before dismissing such criticism as “quite funny”, given what he says was the success of its earlier software applications in attracting developers. “We are more open than we have ever been, we are more standards-based than we have ever been,” he adds – a claim that is contested by Oracle, which has tried to make capital from the fact that its German rival’s underlying technology still depends on a proprietary computing language, ABAP.However, even if the future SOA-enabled platforms succeed in stimulating a new generation of more flexible corporate software, one other overriding issue remains: rivals such as SAP and Oracle will see little to gain from linking their rival platforms to each other. Full inter-operability will remain just a dream.“To make SOA real, you have to have a process start in one system and end in another, with no testing or certification needed,” says Mr Barrenechea at Computer Associates – even if those systems are rivals ones from SAP and Oracle.The software giants, he says, “have to be motivated to make it work”.According to Mr Agassi, companies will eventually “have to choose” which of the platforms they want to use as the backbone for their businesses.The web services standards maycreate a level of inter-operability between these different backbones, but each will still use its own “semantics”, or way of defining business information, to make it comprehensible to other, connected systems.Like a common telephone network, the standards should make it easier to create connections, but they can do nothing if the people on either end of the line are talking a different language.If different companies in the same industry, or different business partners, adopt different software platforms, there will still be a need for the expensive manual work to link the systems together.“You will have to spend the same amount of money on systems integrators that you spend today,” says Mr Graf.Despite that, the new service-oriented technology should still represent a leap forward from today’s monolithic IT systems. Even the sceptics concede that the gains could be substantial. It should lead to “better [software] components and better interfaces – which equals better inter-operability”, says Mr Barrenechea.As with any sales pitch from the technology industry, however, it is as well to be wary of the hype."
1009;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-07T16:38:52Z;Power shift to users liberated from infrastructure;;"Web 2.0 applications have been capturing the imagination of internet users with word processors and e-mail services that update dynamically in a browser.Businesses, however, have been enjoying for much longer the benefits of web applications that behave just like programs running on their local networks.“We’re working on Web 3.0,” jokes Zach Nelson, chief executive of NetSuite, which, as its name suggests, offers a suite of applications over the internet.Salesforce.com, with a flamboyant chief executive, thousands of converts and rocketing revenues, has created the biggest buzz for on-demand software available through a browser.Its offering, centred on customer relationship management, is just one of a wide range of web applications from internet security to human resources now available.Jeff Kaplan of ThinkStrategies has seen the number of software-as-a-service companies listed on his consultancy’s online directory grow to more than 100 since he launched it two months ago.“What’s amazing is how many of them are not new companies; they’ve been out there for some time,” he says. Some companies have changed to offer web services, some have emerged recently and others have survived the hype cycle of the Application Service Provider [ASP] model.”ASPs offered companies the chance to have best-of-breed enterprise software applications hosted for them remotely in data centres – removing the burden of maintaining complex IT systems.But they suffered from a lack of integration of the different products, slow response times, as applications were accessed through a browser, and difficulties in achieving economies of scale to make services profitable.The latest wave of online applications benefits from pure web front ends, improved browser performance and a single version of the software offered by providers that is shared by all customers.“You need to have one software code base that services a lot of customers rather than an individual company and have everyone working on the same version,” says Robert De Sisto, analyst with the Gartner research company. “Without that, it’s very difficult to scale, the economics don’t work and that’s why earlier attempts didn’t take off.”The efficiencies extend to “multi-tenancy” of the database that stores companies’ information. One Oracle database can be securely partitioned to host all of the providers’ customers, providing major cost savings.Customers usually pay monthly subscriptions to use the web applications rather than the upfront fees for enterprise software in on-premises PCs.In January, Salesforce.com took its model a stage further, announcing App-Exchange, a marketplace for online software. “We’re trying to provide a platform for applications, we think that’s the next level. We are trying to become the Windows of the internet,” says Marc Benioff, chief executive.But competitors argue that a perceived weakness of the Salesforce model is a lack of integration, with sales leads from customer relationship management applications, for example, not able to be tracked through accounting applications to compare them with actual orders.NetSuite, which began as an accounting application and has grown to include enterprise resource planning and e-commerce applications, says that it can offer different views of a company’s performance to the various department workers through a single data set that provides true integration.Mr Nelson says: “It’s coming back to the same battle that happened in the client-server market of who’s going to win? Is it going to be best-of-breed composite applications or is it going to be a suite? We’ll have to see how it plays out.”Privately held NetSuite has Oracle chief Larry Ellison as its main shareholder.While CRM is seen as the “sweet spot” for web applications, helped by the high profile of Salesforce and rivals such as RightNow, perhaps surprisingly it does not hold the number-one position for implementations.Instead, more mature web conferencing dominates software as a service at present, with the provider WebEx the leading on-demand vendor overall, according to a report by JMP Securities.JMP says that web conferencing constitutes 24 per cent of the market, followed by human capital management with 19 per cent, CRM at 16 per cent and web analytics at 10 per cent. However, web conferencing is expected to grow at only 16 per cent a year compared with 48 per cent for ERP, which currently has only 3 per cent of the market.JMP estimates the market for on-demand software will expand from $1.6bn in 2004 to $5.1bn in 2009.“All the different sectors are showing really terrific growth,” says Patrick Walravens, co-author of the report.“There’s room for a lot of vendors, with a lot of greenfield opportunity in the small and medium-sized business market,” adds Liz Herbert of Forrester Research.But vendors will have to be “very customer-centric” as competition increases, says Philippe Courtot, chief executive of Qualys, which provides computer security software remotely.He adds: “With the software as a service model, the cost of switching to a competitor is nil. You’re not a prisoner of any infrastructure installed on your premises any more, so the power of the on-demand model is definitely more with the users.”"
1010;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-07T16:38:52Z;Defragmenting of the industry gathers pace;;The wave of industry consolidation that has been a feature of enterprise software has begun to reach the mid market.Time was when small and mid-sized companies wanting enterprise resource planning software would have rarely looked beyond a mid-sized software company.While there is a global market for ERP in the enterprise, the mid-market remains highly fragmented. No vendor has more than 10 per cent, even when such large ones as Oracle, SAP and Microsoft are factored in.That is changing, however, as the wave of industry consolidation that has been a feature of enterprise software starts to reach the mid-market.JD Edwards, regarded by analysts as one of the few mid-market ERP vendors with a global reach, has been swallowed by PeopleSoft, only to see its new owner bought by Oracle.Microsoft’s mid-market strategy is largely based on acquired technology, in particular Navision and Great Plains. SAP, for its part, has said that it sees small and mid-sized companies as its main source of growth.Consolidation is also being driven by activity within the mid-market itself. US ERP vendor Lawson is in the process of buying Sweden’s Intentia.SSA Global has grown through a series of acquisitions. Sage, currently ranked as the third-largest ERP software company, has also built its international presence through acquisitions, especially in the Americas.“There is not currently a global market for ERP in the mid-range,” says Yvonne Genovese, a research vice-president at industry analysts Gartner. “JD Edwards was the closest but it covered only a limited range of industries.“The best-placed company to fill that space is Microsoft, but it has not done so yet. The market will remain fragmented until someone such as Microsoft steps up to the plate.”The large ERP vendors have used acquisitions to build bridgeheads into the mid-market, where IT buyers have also changed their buying behaviour, showing a greater willingness to buy from the largest vendors. The security of dealing with a large company is one reason.Jim Shepherd, an analyst at AMR Research, says: “Mid-market buyers have changed their outlook. They are much more concerned with the viability of their software supplier. Businesses might keep an ERP system for 10, 15 or 20 years, so they don’t want to deal with someone who could be gone in two years.”For CIOs, choosing the right ERP vendor means striking a balance, between features and performance, and long-term stability. Although very large companies can afford to customise their enterprise applications, smaller comapnies are less able to influence design of software.The large ERP vendors have also gained a reputation for arrogance in the mid market, adopting a take-it-or-leave-it approach to some customers.Smaller ERP vendors may be more open to making changes or additions to their software to meet a customer’s requirements.By focusing on the needs of a particular niche or geography, the hope is that customers will be able to use more of the software “as is”. Smaller companies do not have the time to embark on lengthy software projects.“Price and the speed of implementation are key factors in the mid market,” says Bettina Pickering, an ERP specialist at PA Consulting. “Smaller software vendors are more likely to work with their clients to try to understand their requirements and are prepared to do more work on integrating the technology.”Extensive use of custom code makes software expensive to support and to upgrade, regardless of the size of the customer. Vendors are aiming to make their software easier to deploy by building common components, and using local or industry-specific partners to manage customisation.Customers are realising that more business processes can be made to work with standard software modules and that the high cost of customisation often outweighs the benefits.Vendors such as Sage, which develops for the Microsoft Windows platform, also leverages off Microsoft core technologies to cut implementation costs.“In the mid-market, companies think in terms of integrating modular solutions,” says Klaus-Micheal Vogelberg, group CTO of Sage. “In tier one companies, solutions are customised to meet business requirements but often that is far more expensive than the software itself.”And CIOs with experience of previous ERP projects are more likely to want to deploy software off the shelf.“It is more common for companies to say ‘This is what I need, and I expect it to work out of the box’,” says Melvin James, ERP practice director at Diagonal Consulting, a systems integration firm and SAP partner. “A few years ago, everybody wanted something different.”This suggests the gap between ERP vendors and those specialising in the mid market will narrow, at least in terms of the functionality they offer.SAP, Oracle and Microsoft will continue to acquire to build their markets. Mid-tier vendors are likely to seek their own deals to build scale, and to provide a bulwark against acquisition.Mid-market buyers might move even further from the monolithic, heavily customised software model in favour of more standardised technology delivered over the internet.“It is always easier to add the functionality demanded by enterprises to software designed for smaller companies than to redesign enterprise software for smaller businesses,” says Zach Nelson, chief executive of online software company Netsuite.“Above all, software for the smaller company has a vital characteristic: ease of use.”
1011;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-03-07T16:38:52Z;Serving up the right blend for retailers;;Between them SAP and Oracle have spent in excess of $1.3bn in the past year buying specialist retail IT companies – but is that what the customers want? And does it worry the competition?A year ago, the two were hitting the retail IT headlines in their very public battle over who would buy Retek, a specialist US IT vendor with a highly regarded product and a customer base of blue chip retailers.SAP had started with $8 a share but Oracle ultimately claimed the prize at $11.25 – a total of $670m – not a bad result for shareholders when the share price before the SAP bid had been $6 and Retek’s turnover was $174m. So what did Oracle hope to gain? The answer lies as much in the retail sector itself as in SAP’s and Oracle’s ambitions.Enterprise resource planning started life as a manufacturing concept – one which many retailers still consider irrelevant to them.Top retailers tend to believe they know best when it comes to running their businesses and most took to IT early.They have developed bespoke applications that most believe provide them with solutions uniquely tailored to their particular business. As a result ERP penetration in the sector is particularly low.Analysts agree that ERP spending in retailing is low but growing. AMR Research suggests it will reach $9.3bn by 2009. “Retail is furthest behind in ERP,” says Scott Langdoc, vice-president at AMR responsible for the retail industry. “Both SAP and Oracle want to be the primary choice.”He adds: “A concern is that in their frenzy to acquire more companies, both will become preoccupied with integration rather than innovation.“In the past, retailers have proved resistant to buying commercial packages. As a result they’re sitting on a lot of bespoke applications. The better ones realise they can blend these with commercial projects to gain competitive advantage.”Peter Kabuth, head of SAP’s international business unit for retail and wholesale, is dismissive of the integration issue: “Because of our NetWeaver development platform, it will not be a big job to integrate them.”He says: “There is no overlap with our existing solutions and integration is progressing on a stepwise basis. We will have the end-to-end solution this year.”While Retek’s suite would certainly have duplicated some SAP offerings, Mr Kabuth believes the Triversity and KhiMetrics acquisitions have successfully filled gaps. The emphasis is now on in-house development work.A growing number of partners are providing specialist products to meet the more eclectic retail needs.Mr Kabuth says: “About 80 to 85 per cent of retail processes do not deliver competitive advantage. I don’t agree that standard software will not support special processes.“Solutions can be flexible and by working with many partners we can meet these various needs. SAP used only to deliver its full suite, but now we will offer stand-alone projects with quick and flexible integration.”SAP, with 3,000 retail customers worldwide, launched its first retail applications in 1997 and has been targeting the sector with varying degrees of success since.By contrast, prior to the Retek acquisition, Oracle had no specific retail applications of its own: “Oracle has a corporate strategy of going after vertical industry applications,” says Duncan Angove, ex-Retek and now general manager for Oracle’s global retail business unit.He adds: “Many retailers choose point solutions or build their own applications, but that is high-risk and difficult to maintain, so it was an obvious target market for Oracle.”Retek never had a back office system, so had tended to work closely with Oracle on joint projects, explains Mr Angove, and many of these joint customers had also opted for Profitlogic or 360Commerce applications as well.“Essentially, Oracle has bought the IT footprint that many of its key customers had already chosen,” he says.He too makes light of the integration issues, this time citing “Fusion”, Oracle’s middleware, and points to a burgeoning order book. “Demand has already outstripped what the individual companies would have done in the same period,” he says.“We are seeing uptake on a global scale from com-panies such as Circuit City, Galeries Lafayette and Carrefour and we feel we have a very complete solution. Customers like to see Oracle do it all, including the integration piece.”Current integration work is described as “opportunist”, with “holistic” integration between the assortment of acquired applications expected to be completed in 2007.Others are not convinced. JDA, a leading retail IT company, began acquiring niche vendors seven years ago. “Integration takes a long time,” says chief executive Hamish Brewer, “and we certainly had to sacrifice innovation: connecting things together is a distraction.”He continues: “Oracle and SAP appear to have quite different strategies. SAP is buying niche applications that add key capabilities to its core system, while Oracle seems to be buying the market, trying to build a suite.“However, retailers don’t like to be dependent on one supplier. We now have 1,300 retail customers worldwide and we did 100 deals last quarter, so we’re busy.”Chris Moore, chief executive of Torex Retail, which has also been highly acquisitive in the past year, was equally bullish when reporting record sales in January.“If retailers wanted an end-to-end solution, they probably wouldn’t come to us,” he says. “But the ones we see don’t want to be sucked into buying the whole package from SAP or Oracle.“Retailers like to be boss – and they like to deal with companies smaller than they are, so they feel in control. We’re also benefiting, as Triversity and 360Commerce have been taken out of the independent vendor market and are no longer competitors.”Retail customers, too, are concerned at the vendor consolidation. “The feedback I get from retailers is a level of concern at the narrowing of vendor choice,” says Dilip Popat, managing director of Microsoft’s EMEA retail industry unit – itself an SAP partner and now active in retail applications thanks to a series of acquisitions.“The consolidation is encouraging us to continue with the partnership model – JDA is also a global alliance for us. These partnerships are not just at a marketing level but involve deeper integration to develop a rich ecosystem.”Some retailers may choose to buy into the partnership/ecosystem model, others may opt for Oracle’s one-stop-shop. However, as other vendors are finding, retailers can be a recalcitrant bunch: just as in their dealings with product suppliers, they like to have the upper hand.The band of independent smaller vendors may be dwindling, but they’ll probably have no shortage of customers in coming months.
1012;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Microsoft accuses Brussels of collusion;;Microsoft was warned on Thursday that its behaviour was leading inexorably towards large fines from the European Commission after the US software giant accused the competition body of colluding with the company’s rivals.Neelie Kroes, European Union competition commissioner, said: “If we pursue the line we are following now, there will be fines and they won’t be small fines.”The Commission was accused by Microsoft of “secret collaboration” with the group’s rivals and violating its rights of defence.The allegations formed part of the group’s response to Commission charges that Microsoft had failed to comply with Brussels’ landmark antitrust ruling of March 2004. The group faces penalties of up to €2m (£1.36m) a day unless it can show it implemented properly a key provision of the ruling that Microsoft share more technical information with rivals.Brussels’ latest charges are based on the advice of the Commission’s technical experts – primarily Professor Neil Barrett, a British computer scientist, but also a consultancy called OTR.In a 14-page filing to the Commission on Thursday, Microsoft alleges that their advice may have been affected by undue influence from the group’s rivals. It says: “The Commission facilitated and, at times initiated, contacts between the adversaries and the trustee . . . Indeed, the documents released on 13 February show that the Commission actively encouraged Microsoft’s adversaries to ‘educate’ the Trustee [Prof Barrett] in a manner detrimental to Microsoft.”Microsoft originally proposed Prof Barrett for the trustee post.The filing does not reveal which rivals Microsoft refers to, but the only companies familiar with the group’s compliance efforts are IBM, Oracle, Novell and Sun Microsystems.
1013;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-02-22T23:24:17Z;Lex: Microsoft;;Microsoft’s European headache could yet get more acute. The software giant is already fighting a 2004 ruling from the European Commission that forced it to sell a version of Windows without Media Player and to share more protocols with competitors in the server market.Microsoft now faces a further complaint from rivals hoping to kick it while it is down.The group of rivals, including IBM and Oracle, is hoping to take advantage of the precedents set by the 2004 ruling. If they are upheld in the courts this year, the precedents will provide a firm foundation on which to pursue Microsoft further on both the interoperability of its products with those of its competitors and the bundling of new functions into its operating system.Wednesday’s complaint aims for both. On interoperability, the claim is that Office – a vital pillar of Microsoft’s business – is not sufficiently compatible with rival software products, making it hard for them to gain any traction.Microsoft argues that it has already agreed to create standards to help Office compatibility. Potentially more threatening is the aim to target Vista, the new operating system Microsoft will launch later in the year.It appears likely that the Commission will look closely at Vista if its ruling on Media Player is upheld – given that the new operating system should bundle in some new functions. On previous form that is unlikely to be a disaster for Microsoft. Any rulings will take time and it is hard to judge what remedies there might be. However, Vista is vital to Microsoft’s growth. And Office remains a crucial source of cash flow. Having the Commission go after its two most important products would be a serious irritant for Microsoft.
1014;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-02-22T20:17:12Z;Microsoft rivals file new antitrust complaint;;A group of leading technology companies on Wednesday dashed Microsoft?s hopes of a swift end to its regulatory woes in Europe with a new antitrust complaint against the US software company.The complaint ? filed by IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Nokia and other technology groups known as the European Committee for Interoperable Systems ? is likely to spark a fresh probe by the European Union?s competition regulator and prolong a regulatory battle between Microsoft and Brussels that has lasted more than six years.Ecis said it was concerned about ?a range of Microsoft business practices that threaten to deny enterprises and individual consumers real choice among competing software products?.It added: ?Strong antitrust law enforcement appears to be the only way to stop the sustained anti-competitive behaviour of Microsoft.?The complaint is the first since the European Commission?s ruling against the software group in March 2004, and is certain to come as a severe blow to Microsoft. It threatens to put under the regulatory spotlight an entire new set of Microsoft products and applications, targeting in particular the group?s new Vista operating system, which is due to be launched later this year.The Commission said it had received the complaint and would ?study it carefully?. Should Brussels find Ecis?s allegations merited, it will have to open a new antitrust investigation against Microsoft. Ecis? main concern is that Microsoft is seeking to create an environment where a growing number of web-based applications functions only with computers and servers driven by Windows.This would mean that internet-based applications ? from search sites to online retailers ? could no longer work on computers using operating systems such as Apple?s OS or Linux.Ecis also alleges that Microsoft is abusing its dominant position in the market for products and applications such as Windows Word, Excel and PowerPoint.Microsoft said it would act ?quickly and comprehensively? should the Commission ask it to respond to the new complaint, although it dismissed Ecis as ?a front for IBM and a few other competitors who constantly seek to use the regulatory process to their business advantage?.It added: ?We have come to expect that as we introduce new products that benefit consumers?.?.?.?a few competitors will complain.?Set up in 1988, Ecis also includes RealNetworks, Red Hat, Opera, Linspire and Corel.Microsoft is currently trying to fend off the threat of fresh financial penalties from the Commission in connection with the 2004 decision. Brussels believes the US group has not complied with key elements of its ruling, and has warned that it will impose fines of up to ?2m a day unless Microsoft addresses its concerns quickly.
1015;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-02-22T19:15:46Z;Microsoft seeks to shrug off new complaint;;Microsoft put on a brave face on Wednesday as it sought to shrug off the latest twist in its six-year antitrust battle with the European Commission.The US software group airily dismissed the new antitrust complaint by a powerful alliance of technology groups as a move it had “come to expect”. A spokesman added: “When faced with innovation, they [the complainants] choose litigation.”The group has, however, every reason to fear the consequences of yesterday’s move by IBM, Oracle, Nokia and its allies.Above all, the new complaint has the potential to subject whole new swathes of Microsoft’s operations and products to regulatory scrutiny.Its clear intention is to use the precedent created by the Commission’s March 2004 decision on Microsoft and apply it both to current and future Microsoft products – including the Vista operating system that is expected to be launched later this year.“Today’s complaint brings to the European Commission’s attention anti-competitive Microsoft practices in a growing number of areas. These include bundling and interface non-disclosure practices similar to those the Commission declared illegal in its 2004 decision,” according to a statement by the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, the organisation that filed the complaint on behalf of Microsoft’s rivals.According to people familiar with the Ecis complaint, the document alleges a whole series of violations.■ Microsoft, according to the complaint, is trying to “proprietise the internet” by effectively forcing developers of web-based applications to use a programming language for web applications that will work only in a Windows environment.The language - known as XAML - will be bundled with and used extensively in the new Vista operating system. This, the complaint alleges, will create a situation in which a growing number of web-based applications will only work in connection with Windows-driven computers and servers.■ Microsoft is also allegedly abusing its dominant position in the market for Office applications and products such as Windows Word, Excel and PowerPoint.The complaint says Microsoft has refused to supply rival companies with the technical information they need to design comparable products that function smoothly with Microsoft’s Office applications.It claims that, owing to the lack of interoperability information, users of rival office products regularly experience problems in handling and opening documents created by users of Microsoft’s Office products.■ Microsoft, it is claimed, intends to bundle its digital rights management technology (DRM) with Vista - a move that is likely to further undermine the interoperability between Windows and non-Windows software products. DRM technologies allow users to attach protection to documents they send and share with others.The complainants fear that this will increase the pressure on consumers and companies to rely entirely on Office and Windows products.Thomas Vinje, a Brussels-based partner at Clifford Chance and one of the lawyers working for Ecis, said on Wednesday: “After eliminating the threat to its monopoly posed by Netscape’s internet browser and Sun’s Java programming language in the mid-1990s, Microsoft is again trying to protect its monopoly in the desktop market and its emerging dominance in the server market. It is now trying to proprietise the internet and eliminate the potential competitive threat from cross-platform applications running on it.”The new complaint will be scrutinised by the Commission, which is under an obligation to pursue the allegations if they appear merited.If it does so, Brussels is certain to find comfort in the fact that it has by its side a broad alliance that combines many of the biggest names in the global technology and software industry.The prospect of facing not just the Commission’s vast regulatory powers but also the combined financial muscle and technological expertise of the companies behind Ecis is one that should give the world’s biggest software group cause for alarm.
1016;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Techs turn to bonds to raise funds;;US technology companies appear to be moving away from their historic reliance on the stock markets to raise funds and are increasingly turning to the bond markets.They have issued more bonds already this year than in any year since 2002, when they were struggling through the aftermath of the tech bubble bursting.Oracle, the software group, sold $5.75bn in January in its first debt sale in nine years. Systems provider Cisco topped that and created a record for the biggest-ever debut bond issue with a $6.5bn sale last week. The two deals, at more than $12bn combined, are already close to the annual $14bn or so that was issued between 2000 and 2002, according to Dealogic.The flurry of activity partly reflects the attractiveness of market conditions for all borrowers. But it also has something to do with the increasing size and slowing, if still healthy, growth of some technology companies.“Historically the tech sector has relied on the equity markets,” says Raj Dhanda, head of debt capital markets at Morgan Stanley. “But the sector has matured to the point where there are some large-cap tech companies that look more similar to other traditional corporate borrowers.”Tech stock growth, and therefore the value of equity as an acquisition currency, is also still far from what it was in the heady days of the dotcom boom, making the bond market a more attractive option for fund raising.Both Oracle’s and Cisco’s deals were issued to fund the acquisitions of Siebel Systems and Scientific Atlanta, respectively, and more could be on their way.“Now that you have these two, there can’t be a medium or large tech company that won’t ask the question,” says Mr Dhanda, although he added some caveats.“There needs to be a use of proceeds that excites them, an obvious acquisition that is strategic and makes sense.” Leon Burger, credit analyst at Principal Global Investors, adds: “It is probably going to depend on acquisition activity and how big some of those are.”Currently, investor appetite seems strong. The “book” – where bankers record potential investors’ bids – built for Cisco’s offering was about $20bn and the biggest seen in recent years according to market sources.More than 400 different investors bid for the paper. Part of the demand for both came from the chance for investors to diversify.“There really wasn’t much in the software space,” says Mr Burger.“They’re looking for a new corporate borrower and a large cap company,” says Mr Dhanda.“These will be the among the most liquid benchmark bonds to trade for the next six to 12 months.”Both Cisco and Oracle were able to increase the size of their deals due to the strong demand. Cisco had originally planned to issue $5.5bn and despite the $1bn increase, still priced the deal at the better end of market expectations.Its bonds have since performed strongly in the secondary market with the “spread” over comparable Treasury yields narrowing since they were issued.However, Oracle’s have done less well amid market chatter that many of the bonds went to “fast money investors” who sold it on quickly, potentially weakening the market. “The biggest difference is that Cisco is rated two notches higher by the agencies yet the pricing was 5 basis points wider than the Oracle deal,” says Dave Novosel at Gimme Credit, a research group, which rated Cisco’s bonds a “buy”.Investors also seemed to warm to the size of both companies, which suggests they will be free from the risk of leveraged buyouts, which can weaken credit quality.“These two names have market caps so huge you don’t have to worry about LBO risk,” says Mr Burger.But should investors be worrying instead about the chances of further acquisitions in-stead? “The biggest risk with Cisco is that it undertakes a large acquisition,” says Mr Novosel, who nonetheless thinks any likely purchase would be too small to materially affect the company’s credit profile. “There are not many logical candidates available,” he adds.

It had never before issued a corporate bond, making the deal the biggest ever bond market debut by any company.Verizon borrowed $4bn, in part to help fund its MCI acquisition of last year and last month Oracle sold $5.75bn of bonds towards financing its $5.85bn acquisition of Siebel Systems.Michael Mutti, credit strategist at Bear Stearns, said: “Companies are also being pressured by shareholders to lever up and that could also lead to more borrowing.”Companies have been using up cash piles for new investment and to raise dividends to shareholders. The trend began in 2004, but accelerated last year. It has eaten into remaining cash balances. According to Fitch Ratings, the gap between the cash on companies’ balance sheets compared with their capital expenditures and cash dividends narrowed by about 50 per cent last year.“As long as the economy remains firm, industrial companies will need to go back to the bond market this year,” said Mariarosa Verde, head of credit market research at Fitch. “Since long-term rates are still low, it is not a bad time to go to the market now, which is likely contributing to the surge early in the year.”“These are the biggest jumbo multi-tranche transactions we’ve seen for several years,” added Mr Turner.Cisco’s bond issue was split into several slices to attract different investors, with $500m of three-year floating-rate notes, $3bn of fixed-rate five-year notes and $3bn in 10-year paper.Total investment-grade borrowing last year reached $603.8bn and is expected to be about the same this year.
1019;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-02-15T21:10:37Z;Open source writers wary of Oracle’s real intentions;;Larry Ellison has just sent a ripple of excitement and fear through the open source software world. The chief executive of Oracle staked out a position in one of the fastest-growing corners of the tech industry on Tuesday with the acquisition of Sleepycat Software, which makes database software, and is understood to be negotiating to buy JBoss, a leading maker of “middleware” used to run applications over the internet.Part of the aim, say Oracle executives, is to take on a wider role in the open source movement. Sleepycat’s code, for instance, is often bundled with other widely used products such as the Linux operating system and Apache web server.“This gives us more of a seat at the table with these other open source projects,” says Robert Shimp, vice-president of technology marketing at Oracle.For many open source executives, though, the prospect of sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with Mr Ellison seems to invoke unease.“There’s a fair amount of nervousness,” says David Dargo, chief technology officer of Ingres, another open source database company, of the mood this week at a leading open source conference in San Francisco.The concerns spring partly from suspicion at Oracle’s motives. Sceptics claim that the software giant, whose fortunes are founded on its commercial database products, is really only interested in insulating itself from attack by a wave of new rivals whose cheaper products and different sales approach pose a long-term threat to its business. “I think Oracle is digging the moat a little deeper around the fortress of software and maintenance revenue,” says Mr Dargo. There are fears that rather than trying to co-opt open source, Mr Ellison is bent on subverting it.Oracle’s acquisition late last year of InnoDB, a small Finnish open source company, has added to these suspicions. The five-person company produces the storage “engine” that sits at the heart of MySQL, the database produced by Europe’s biggest open source software company. By seizing the core technology of a rival, goes the reasoning, Mr Ellison could disrupt its product development – or at least spread doubts among potential MySQL customers.Critics also fear that the intrusion of software giants such as Oracle will disrupt a development approach that has proved successful at creating big and complex pieces of corporate software. Often based on broad online groups of volunteer programmers, open source companies must master delicate community dynamics to drive their projects.“I’m not convinced any corporate entity can own an open source project,” says Mark de Visser, chief marketing officer of Zend, another open source company Oracle is understood to have had acquisition discussions with.If Mr Ellison’s motives are viewed with suspicion, however, his cash has had an altogether more welcome effect. The sight of Oracle and IBM buying companies generated a new level of excitement among the venture capitalists who have crowded back to the market in the past three years. “It’s good for open source – it validates the value that open source provides,” says Marten Mickos, chief executive of MySQL, which has emerged, along with Jboss, as the leader of the second generation of open source companies that have sprung up behind Red Hat, one of the companies behind the Linux operating system. MySQL nearly doubled in size last year and had revenues of about €30m ($36m).Oracle says its purchase of Sleepycat signals its belief that open source products are part of the mainstream.“We have definitely seen that our customers are adopting a combination of open source and closed source products,” says Mr Shimp. Being able to sell both types of software would make Oracle “a much more strategic partner”. The test for Oracle will be whether it can absorb Sleepycat and others without disrupting their approach to software development and business models.“Their DNA is not one of commodity software, where prices are low and volumes are high,” says Mr Mickos. “It’s about their culture and tradition. It’s a mindset question.”
1020;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-02-10T17:24:01Z;Decent earnings help to shrug off commodities dip;;Wall Street put in a resilient performance this week as a number of impressive earnings offset the impact of falling commodity prices which hit energy and mining stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to hold on to gains, adding 1.2 per cent over the week to 10,919.05 with the broader S&P 500 edging up 0.2 per cent to 1,266.99 while the Nasdaq eased back a fraction of a point to 2,261.88.Energy stocks slumped along with crude prices after an increase in US stockpiles offset supply concerns from key producers Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela.The S&P energy index was the worst performing industry group, down 4.5 per cent. EGO Resources, the oil and gas exploration company, led the decline, dropping 12.3 per cent over the five sessions to $69.37, while oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron fell 3.2 per cent to $59.43 and 1.5 per cent to $56.27 respectively.Metal producers and gold miners were not immune to falling commodity prices. With both gold and base metal prices heading south this week, US Steel saw its shares give up 2.8 per cent to $54.80 and gold miner Newmont Mining shed 8.1 per cent to $54.80.Woes were further compounded by losses in the housing sector, following a bearish forecast from luxury housebuilder Toll Brothers.In the latest sign that the US housing market – a principal driver of the US economy in the past couple of years – may have peaked, the company said first quarter sales fell 29 per cent and cut its sales guidance for the full year.Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, while Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, called the housebuilder’s performance a “seriously startling plunge in activity”.Toll Brothers’ shares fell 7.3 per cent on the week to $29.82, taking their slide since the start of the year to 18.2 per cent.Although not a particularly good week for techs, Cisco Systems, the world’s biggest maker of networking equipment, was a strong performer in the second half of the week after the company’s chief executive delivered an upbeat outlook statement to complement fiscal second-quarter profits which avoided any shocks. Cisco shares were up 8.9 per cent on the week to $19.76.Electronic Data Systems, the computer services company, unveiled fourth-quarter net profit which more than doubled that of the previous year. The company picked up some positive broker comment in spite of falling revenues from General Motors, its biggest customer. EDS shares were up 1.3 per cent on the week to $25.72.Completing a trio of technology movers, software maker Oracle offered guidance on Friday that met with modest approval. The company said that following its merger with Siebel Systems it planned 2,000 job cuts across the combined company. Its shares were little changed on Friday, but rose 3.9 per cent to $12.69 on the week.The Dow was propped up by Walt Disney, which gained after the media conglomerate delivered an unexpected gain in first-quarter profit. News that it had sold off its radio assets to Citadel Broadcasting for $2.7bn further boosted sentiment for the stock, helping it finish the week up 6.7 per cent at $26.68.The blue chip index also found support in Pfizer. Shares in the drugmaker peaked on Wednesday after it said it was considering the sale of its consumer products division, home to well known brands like Listerine and Sudafed. Analysts said the unit might be worth more than $10bn, enabling the company to concentrate more of its energies on pharmaceuticals development and a return to earnings growth in 2006.The company disappointed on Friday however, when it said sales and adjusted earnings for 2006 would only be in line with those of last year as patents expired and generic competition bit. The shares slid 2.5 per cent on Friday, but were up 1.6 per cent on the week to $25.68.General Motors, the troubled carmaker, was once again the worst performer on the Dow this week. Promises of dividend cuts and slashing executive salaries failed to convince investors that unionised workers would accept cuts in wages, benefits and jobs. “There appears to be an ever increasing probability of confrontation with unions,” said Deutsche Bank, which downgraded GM to “sell” from “hold”. The shares fell 5.5 per cent to $21.87.Aon, the world’s second- biggest insurance broker and Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications were the top gainers this week on the S&P.Aon jumped 13.1 per cent to $38.11 after it reported that fourth-quarter net income almost tripled while Univision surged 11.1 percent to $34.70 after the company said it was considering a possible sale. CBS and News Corp both expressed interest while Time Warner and Walt Disney were also cited as possible bidders.
1021;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-02-02T23:43:16Z;SAP ventures into on-demand software field;;SAP announced its long-awaited move into the on-demand software business on Thursday, which analysts and competitors said could raise questions about the software company’s business model.The German software group unveiled a limited version of its customer relationship management software that will be “hosted” on IBM computers and sold on a subscription basis.Under an on-demand contract, customers use applications that run on centrally managed servers, rather than installing and running them on their own machines.They pay a simple monthly subscription rather than up-front licence fees and regular annual maintenance contracts.SAP’s move echoes initiatives announced by Siebel Systems, which has been overtaken by SAP as the leading supplier of CRM software, and Microsoft. Oracle completed its purchase of Siebel this week, setting up a new area of conflict with arch-rival SAP.The push into selling an on-demand version of CRM reflects the fact that this has become the first corner of the business software market where the new approach has worked on a broad scale.According to AMR Research, the on-demand CRM market, though worth only $596m last year, is set to grow at a compound rate of 29 per cent between 2004-2009. Sales of traditional software licences, worth $4.2bn, are set to grow at only 6 per cent.SAP expects many of the customers for the new service to be large companies adopting CRM for the first time, but which eventually switch to running the software in-house instead.Persuading customers to make that transition could be important to SAP’s long-term revenues, said Rob Bois, an analyst at AMR. “Ultimately, SAP would prefer to move [on-demand] customers over to the licensed model.”Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, which has emerged as the leading stand-alone seller of on-demand software, said traditional software companies faced difficulties in changing their business approach.“SAP, like Oracle and Microsoft, now risks cannibalising its existing customer base,” he wrote in an e-mail to employees.
1022;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;SAP expects to double revenues in four years;;SAP, the world’s largest business software maker, expects products scheduled for launch in the next two years to more than double core revenues from software sales and maintenance contracts by 2010.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said expansion from business management software into middleware, which connects existing programs such as databases, would enlarge the market open to SAP from €30bn to €70bn ($37bn-$86bn).At the same time, the company wanted to bolster its position in this larger arena from a share of “around 21 per cent”, or €6bn today, he said at a presentation of preliminary financial results for 2005.SAP said software sales – a leading indicator for maintenance revenues – would rise by 17 per cent this year, putting more ground between it and rival Oracle of the US.“We have products which can be tried and tested while our competitors only have blueprints,” Mr Kagermann said of efforts by Oracle to merge the companies and blend the products it bought in a $17bn spending spree last year.This helped lift SAP software and maintenance revenues by 15 per cent to €5.96bn and overall sales by 13 per cent to €8.51bn. Operating income before acquisition and other costs rose 16 per cent to €2.41bn, giving a sales margin of 28.3 per cent.Earnings per share before special costs would rise from €5.01 in 2005 to between €5.80 and €6.00 in the current year, SAP said, projecting an acceleration of annual EPS-growth from 14 per cent in 2005 to between 16 per cent and 20 per cent.Investors were delighted by the better-than-expected performance and the bullish forecast for 2006. SAP shares closed 10.3 per cent higher at €162.02.Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said SAP’s targets would be “seen as achievable” especially as the company “outperformed against [its] initial targets over two years”.
1023;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-01-19T20:03:14Z;Notebook;;How many perverts can get away with teaching in English schools? That question is of some interest if you have children of school age. It is certainly more important than whether Ruth Kelly keeps her job as education minister.The Department for Education should distribute a pocket ready reckoner of the kind ministries responsible for frontline services are so good at. Ms Kelly’s Commons statement yesterday contained the relevant figures. Since 1997, 56 sex offenders have been permitted to teach without restrictions. Anything from a handful to more than 100 can teach with restrictions. One man, for example, was judged only to fancy little boys in white pants. That made him safe to teach little girls in blue pants, apparently. The education authorities had failed to spot another 32 people cautioned or convicted since 1997. A big question mark would represent the number of sex offenders nobbled by the police before 1997 that are free to teach. There could be three. Or 300. Or 3,000.Not very reassuring, is it? When Mum and Dad meet class teacher Mr Humbert at the parents’ evening and note his cold, damp handshake, they may struggle to dispel uncharitable suspicions. This is why one council is checking whether any of its teachers have any sex-related cautions or convictions. It will presumably dismiss those it finds. Too bad. There are other, less sensitive, jobs.Ms Kelly is likely to keep her own post. She has had some rough luck. Not just in sharing her initial and surname with an R&B singer facing child sex charges, but also in inheriting a long-standing system of giving second chances to sex offenders. Its exposure has outraged a public that hates paedophiles so viscerally it harasses paediatricians too, just to be on the safe side.In future, education ministers will not be required to assess the erotic effect children’s pants might have on deviant pedagogues. Anyone cautioned or convicted of a child sex offence will be banned from school employment. An expert panel will rule on cases that are less clear-cut. For ministers, setting up such bodies has always been a pleasingly magisterial way to shed blame. If the experts then make unpopular decisions, ministers can dump them without ceremony.Plutocratic profsForget Einstein with his fiddle. Forget the nerd on the Yakult ad, gibbering about friendly bacteria. Scientists can now pick millionaire role models from a rich list of researchers from the TES. They include Professor Brian Bellhouse, inventor of a needle-free injection system, and Sir Greg Winter, founder of Astex, which fights cancer.It is pleasing to picture boffins sitting in a City restaurant, filling the ice buckets with upended champagne bottles at £200 a pop. Hard cash is a promising stimulus for commercialism in UK scientists, who have lagged behind US counterparts in transmuting brainpower into gold.But running experiments does not qualify you to run companies. And much nitty-gritty support for university spin-outs is dispensed by regional development agencies whose own funding reflects local deprivation. Better, surely, to award all spin-out grants centrally, according to the strength of each application, as research funding bodies do. Even if nasty, elitist Oxbridge does get a bigger slice than Swindon U.Flat-screen futureIt is 322 BC.

1024;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-01-13T13:19:57Z;Bond investors retain risk appetite;;Strong demand for new corporate bond issues this week showed that investors had retained an appetite for risk in the new year.Oracle, the US software company, took full advantage of the conditions and issued $5.75bn of bonds in three tranches, more than the $5bn it initially sought, to fund its takeover of Siebel Systems.The increased size showed that investor demand remained strong, despite concerns that the credit cycle is turning and default rates are expected to rise.The sterling market also made a busy start to the year, with companies including Hammerson, the UK property group, GE Capital, a unit of General Electric of the US, and Network Rail, the UK railway operator, all printing new issues.Meanwhile, in the euro market, investor appetite has yet to be tested thoroughly, but that is set to change next week, when Telefónica, the Spanish telecommunications operator, launches a multi-billion deal.The company plans to issue €4bn of bonds with maturities of five and 10 years, as well as £1bn split into maturities of more than 12 and 20 years.Proceeds from the sale will be used to refinance part of the £18.5bn Telefónica borrowed from banks to buy O2 of the UK last year.In the high-yield market, Fresenius Medical Care, the German healthcare group, sold €1bn of bonds yesterday. The company priced €500m of seven-year bonds with a 5 per cent coupon and the same amount of a 10-year tranche with a coupon of 5.5 per cent.The yield on the bonds came down from initial guidance, which is often a sign of strong demand.Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley were the bookrunners.In the US, NRG Energy was preparing a $3.6bn offering, which would be the second biggest high-yield issue in the market on record.Outside the European and US markets, one of the landmark issues of the week was DP Ports’ $3.5bn Islamic bond issue, the biggest of its kind to date.The Dubai-based company, which is involved in a takeover battle for P&O, the UK container ports and ferries operator, increased the amount of funds raised by $700m from the $2.8bn it originally planned to issue.The proceeds could give DP Ports added firepower in its efforts to buy P&O.The company’s £3.33bn offer for P&O was trumped this week by a conditional £3.53bn approach by PSA of Singapore, owned by Temasek, the state investment vehicle.After leaving rates unchanged on Thursday at 2.25 per cent, Mr Trichet sounded an optimistic note about the health of the eurozone economy. These and other comments led investors to think that an interest rate rise was unlikely in February, and sparked a wave of buying.But as they started locking in profits on Friday, bond yields pushed higher. In afternoon trading, the yield on the two-year Schatz rose 0.6 basis points to 2.847 per cent and the 10-year Bund yield added 3.3bp to 3.285 per cent.In the UK, however, yields continued to fall as investors took heart in expectations that interest rates are headed for a cut by the end of the year. The yield on the two-year gilt lost 1.8bp to 4.232 per cent while the 10-year gilt yield fell 1bp to 4.070 per cent.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose 0.5bp to 1.445 per cent on Friday. The yield curve steepened, reversing Thursday’s flattening, as investors took profits on longer-dated 20 and 30-year bonds. The 20-year yield reached a six-month low on Thursday.
1025;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Siebel records strong rebound;;Siebel Systems marked what is likely to be its last quarter before being acquired by Oracle with its strongest financial performance in almost four years, though analysts warned that the performance might reflect one-off effects.The maker of customer relationship management software, whose $5.9bn purchase by Oracle is expected to be completed within weeks, attributed the rebound to greater customer confidence thanks to the pending deal, as well as an expansion into analytics software.However, Rob Bois, an analyst at AMR Research, said the bounce in sales might have had much to do with a rush by Siebel sales representatives to close deals before the merger, a move that would leave a weaker pipeline of sales prospects for Oracle.A similar effect was evident at PeopleSoft, the applications software company bought by Oracle last year, he added. The PeopleSoft deal has been followed by a steady erosion of market share for Oracle’s applications software, as the combined company has continued to lose ground to SAP, the market leader.SAP said earlier this week that its software licence revenue had risen by 18 per cent in the fourth quarter, with sales in the US jumping by 35 per cent.By contrast, Oracle’s application licence sales in the quarter to the end of November dropped more than 40 per cent, after adjusting for the effects of the PeopleSoft acquisition.Siebel said it expected to report revenues of $469m for the final three months of last year, up from $392m a year before. Sales of new software licences – seen as the most important indicator of future performance, since they lead to recurring maintenance revenues – jumped to $214m from $161m. The quarterly new licence sales are the strongest since the first quarter of 2002. However, at $479m, annual licence sales were still slightly below each of the previous two years.George Shaheen, chief executive officer, said Siebel’s pending acquisition by Oracle had “removed a certain amount of uncertainty about the future”.The company had succeeded in closing a number of large deals that it had been working on throughout last year, he added.Mr Bois said Siebel’s customers, as well as its sales force, had an incentive to bring transactions forward into the most recent quarter, since they would be in a stronger position to negotiate better terms.In New York, Siebel shares closed 1 cent higher at $10.61. Oracle shares ended 12 cents off at $12.52.The scale of Siebel’s rebound in the latest quarter is roughly the same as that recorded by PeopleSoft in its final three months as an independent company, said Charles di Bona, a software analyst at Sanford C Bernstein. Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, attributed the PeopleSoft performance to its salesforce’s “draining” its pipeline of future business in the run-up to the acquisition, he added.
1026;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Treasuries weaker as supply talk dominates;;US Treasuries fell and yields rose on Tuesday as the market tracked movements in Europe and participants eyed a slew of corporate bond issuance.Traders said corporate deal-related hedging could move the market. Oracle sold $5.75bn of bonds on Tuesday, and other large issues were in the pipeline, including $3.6bn from NRG. Issuers often hedge with Treasuries ahead of the deal pricing.Market strategists continued to debate the outlook for interest rates, but admitted there was little rate-related trading going on at the moment. “This week is more about the deals and a lack of critical data,” said David Ader at RBS Greenwich Capital.The market was also watching for Wednesday’s $13bn five-year Treasury note sale which kicks off a heavy month of government bond issuance. By late afternoon in New York, yields on two-year notes were up 4.6 basis points at 4.399 per cent while ten-year notes yielded 4.428 per cent, up 5.3bp.Eurozone government bond prices fell for a second day as a survey showing that investor confidence in Germany had risen to its highest level in two years raised fears of further monetary tightening. The ZEW research institute said its German economic expectations index rose to 71 in January, above expectations, from 61.6 in December.In late trade, the yield on the two-year Schatz was 15.2bp higher at 2.846 per cent and the 10-year Bund yield was up 4.8bp to 3.285 per cent.The European Central Bank is widely expected to decide to leave rates on hold tomorrow. However, David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns, said the data would “give the ECB much better leverage for higher rates ahead”.Gilts also succumbed to selling pressure after the British Retail Consortium reported overnight that sales last month rose at the strongest monthly pace since May 2004. The two-year gilt was yielding 4.285 per cent, up 2.8bp and the 10-year gilt yield added 3.3bp to 4.136 per cent.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond hit a new three-month low of 1.425 per cent, after falling 1.5bp as prices rose in response to the sharp fall in the Japanese stock market. In recent days, JGB prices have been buoyed by growing expectations that the US Federal Reserve may stop raising interest rates soon.
1027;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-01-10T19:29:51Z;New issues: US corporate avalanche continues;;The flood of investment grade corporate bond issuance in the US since the new year continued on Tuesday, with Oracle, the software supplier, selling $5.75bn of bonds.The deal, increased from the $5bn announced last week, included $1.5bn in three-year floating rate notes priced to yield 23 basis points over three-month Libor, $2.25bn of five-year fixed rate paper at 73bp over Treasuries, and $2bn with a 10-year maturity yielding 90bp over Treasuries.The proceeds would be used to fund Oracle’s $5.85bn purchase of Siebel Systems and for share buybacks and other acquisitions, the company said last week.Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wachovia jointly led the deal.In the high-yield market, NRG Energy, the power generator, was preparing what could be the second-largest junk bond offering in history, at $3.6bn.NRG plans to use the proceeds of the issue to help fund its $8.3bn acquisition of Texas Genco from a consortium including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts – the private equity group whose leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1989 included the largest junk offering ever.Morgan Stanley and Citigroup are leading the three-tranche deal.In Europe, BMW sold $300m of five-year bonds in the German carmaker’s first dollar-denominated issue since 2001.The 2011 issue, which will pay a coupon of 5 per cent, was targeted at European and Asian retail investors.Rising US interest rates and a flat Treasury yield curve are making short-dated dollar deals attractive to investors.Credit Suisse First Boston, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and Morgan Stanley lead-managed the sale.The European Investment Bank took advantage of strong demand for short-dated dollar paper as the European Union’s financing vehicle kicked off its benchmark funding programme for 2006 with a $3bn, three-year transaction.Once again, Asian central banks dominated the order book. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Nomura were the lead managers.In the euro market, KfW found strong demand at the opposite end of the yield curve, as the German development bank issued its first bond with a 15-year maturity.The €5bn issue attracted orders of about €10bn from 230 accounts across Europe.Frank Czichowski, KfW treasurer, said: “Due to regulatory changes for pension funds and insurance companies, especially in Europe, the demand for bonds with longer maturities has increased. We reacted just on time to this demand.”The absence of any outstanding Bund with a 15-year maturity also made the issue attractive, as investors see AAA-rated KfW as a surrogate German government borrower.Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch were lead managers.
1028;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2006-01-08T20:55:17Z;Low rates promise bumper month for bonds;;"US companies could issue a record amount of bonds this month as they refinance old debt and borrow to pay for acquisitions, using low interest rates and a strong demand to maximise the deals.January is typically a big issuance month but this year as much as $90bn of high grade bonds could be offered, according to Bank of America projections – outstripping January 2001’s record $76bn.About $18bn in high grade debt has been sold this month, says JPMorgan. Issuers use the new year to begin their annual funding needs and catch investors’ interest as they make asset allocations.Peter O’Malley, head of US debt capital markets for ABN Amro, said: “We had been talking about issuance of $60bn-$65bn for this month and that was big. Now there are rumours percolating that issuance could be gargantuan, given refinancing and M&A-related needs.”Oracle, the software maker, this week aims to sell $5bn worth of notes – its biggest offering – to fund its takeover of Siebel Systems.Last week, Fortune Brands, the drinks group; Wells Fargo, the bank; HSBC Finance; and Wellpoint, the health insurer; raised more than $2bn each.Edward Marrinan, head of high-grade corporate credit strategy at JPMorgan, said: “This was a unique week. Issuance volumes were astronomical”.Old debt from 2001 could also underpin this month’s bumper issuance. Much of it had been borrowed for five years, meaning borrowers must now either repay or refinance it with new bonds.Michael Cloherty at Bank of America said: “There is a very heavy roll-over need in the first three months, which is why we have such high first-quarter issuance projections”.Companies are expected to use the flat yield curve to extend the maturity of their borrowings, since it currently costs little more to borrow for 10 years than two, and only slightly more than that to raise 30-year debt.In spite of the wave of supply, demand is expected to be relatively strong because last year’s borrowing was dominated by financial groups that issued shorter-term floating-rate bonds, leaving investors hungry for the sort of longer-dated fixed-rate industrial paper on offer.In spite of the wave of supply, demand is expected to be relatively strong because as last year’s borrowing was dominated by financial groups that issued shorter-term floating-rate bonds, leaving investors hungry for the sort of longer-dated fixed-rate industrial paper that is currently on offer.But there are still signs of the traditional tussle between borrowers and lenders.Mr Marrinan said: “The challenge is still how much the issuer has to give up to get the investor to bite. Issuers are thinking about extending maturity beyond 10 years, but by and large they are reluctant to pay more to do it”.Mr O’Malley added: “Investors want the stuff but they’re not going to be fools; they’re still demanding a reasonable premium”."
1029;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Oracle revamps its software pricing;;Oracle has switched to a new method of charging for its software, responding to growing criticism from customers that the sector has been slow to adapt to technologies that are changing the face of corporate computing.The US software maker has announced a new price list for customers that run its database software on computers using multi-core processors – chips that combine a number of separate processing units, or “brains”. All the big chipmakers either produce or are planning to make such chips, reflecting a shift away from the race for ever-faster computer processors towards more flexible machines that combine multiple processors to handle a number of tasks simultaneously.“The pace of change in [software] pricing models is accelerating,” said Dave Edwards, chief information officer of UPS, the US logistics group. “A lot of software companies are still trying to figure out how to do multi-core processors . . . and still get the same level of profitability they had before.”Oracle has drawn criticism in recent months for continuing to base its software pricing on the number of processing cores used by a computer. That has pushed up software costs for companies that buy the newer machines.“Technology is going to shift – the megahertz war is over with,” said Mr Edwards. “It’s shifting towards other technology and part of it is cores on chip – and it’s not just two, it’s multiple cores. If software companies do not change their pricing structures, the software cost rises faster than the hardware [cost and] defeats the concept.”Oracle said that, under its new plan, it would continue to charge by the core – but that it would give discounts for computers using multi-core processors. Sun Microsystems’ new eight-core chip, for instance, will attract a discount of 75 per cent, meaning that customers will need to buy only two Oracle software licences for each processor.Sun welcomed the new Oracle pricing approach, which it predicted would also be adopted by other companies. “They tend to set the trend” for other software companies, said Larry Singer, Sun senior vice-president.Software companies are also struggling with how to set the balance between fees for new licences – their traditional source of revenue – and maintenance and support, which have grown to represent the majority of income at most companies.
1030;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Oracle reports 2% fall in net earnings;;Oracle on Thursday blamed costs linked to its acquisition of PeopleSoft this year for a 2 per cent fall in net earnings in its latest quarter, to $798m, or 15 cents a share.The US software maker was also held back by a slower rebound than Wall Street had expected in sales of its core database products, though it still managed to meet market expectations for pro-forma earnings once the PeopleSoft acquisition costs were excluded.Larry Ellison, chief executive officer, said the pipeline of orders for the current quarter was stronger than it had been in the latest three months, though a rising dollar would continue to weigh on the results.Oracle shares slid 4.6 per cent in early trading in New York to $12.24.Sales of new licences for Oracle’s database and middleware products climbed 5 per cent in the quarter to $785m, an acceleration from the 1 per cent seen in the preceding three months, but still below the 8 per cent or so most analysts had expected. Oracle had blamed the weakness in its core business on price competition from Microsoft, which has launched a new version of its own database software.A combination of slow economic growth and the effects of the rising dollar had hurt European earnings, Mr Ellison said. “Europe is in a bit of a funk,” he added. “It’s really hard to fight both of these headwinds.”Overall, Oracle said currency movements had wiped 3 per cent from its latest reported earnings. But Mr Ellison said that, while currency movements were likely to hit European sales again this quarter, “the underlying business looks pretty strong”.In applications software, Oracle’s latest reported results were lifted by the purchase of PeopleSoft, though its sales of new software licences were down from the combined sales of both companies a year ago.In the latest period, Oracle said application licence sales had risen 24 per cent to $266m – a bigger increase then most analysts had expected – with part of the growth coming from a number of big contracts that had slipped from the end of the preceding quarter.A year before, Oracle on its own generated sales of $215m, while PeopleSoft reported new licence sales of $185m for the three months to the end of December 2004 – a combined total of $400m, pointing to a fall of around a third in the combined business since then.The percentage of former PeopleSoft customers renewing their support contracts had risen since the acquisition, according to Mr Ellison, who pointed to this as evidence that Oracle had kept its promise to maintain or improve customer service levels over the deal.
1031;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-12-16T15:28:02Z;Wall Street higher on lower crude;;Stocks rose in early trading on Friday after crude futures eased back below $60 a barrel. The market was knocked back on Thursday amid renewed fears of inflationary pressures, but Wall Street bulls will be looking for a positive finish for the week with strong corporate earnings and a slew of deal activity possibly giving stocks a lift.Half-way through the morning session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent, or 31.54 points at 10,913.21, while the broader S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent, or 2.57 points to 1,273.51. The Nasdaq Composite index struggled to make headway and was down less than 1 point at 2,258.67.Among early movers, design software maker Adobe Systems surged 9.6 per cent to $38.28 after it announced after the close on Thursday a 38 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating market expectations.Fellow software maker Oracle fell however, losing 3.2 per cent to $12.42 after reporting lower quarterly profits.General Motors’ announcement that revenue may climb for fiscal 2006 failed to impress Wall Street cynics as the shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $22.04.Consumer electronics retailer Radioshack slumped 4.3 per cent to $22.70 after it said it was unlikely to meet its earnings target for fiscal 2005 because of weaker than expected sales of wireless products and high-margin items such as batteries and accessories.On the deals front, Albertson’s climbed 1.5 per cent to $24.35 on talks that the supermarket chain was set to be sold in a leveraged buyout valued at almost $10bn. An investment group of Cerberus Capital, Kimco Realty and grocery chain Supervalu was reportedly poised to win the auction for Albertson’s for about $9.6bn, or $26 a share.
1032;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-12-06T16:55:00Z;Microsoft looks to reinvigorate business unit;;"Microsoft will on Tuesday make another effort to reinvigorate its slow-growing business applications division, Microsoft Business Solutions, with the launch of a new version of its customer relationship management software.By tying the software closely to Outlook, the e-mail and calendar software included in Office, the launch also marks a new attempt by Microsoft to win over more users by drawing on the broad use of its desktop software.However, the factors that have held back Microsoft’s growth so far in the applications business, where it competes with giants such as SAP and Oracle, could continue to hamper it, according to observers“Microsoft’s biggest problem is its [sales] channel,” said Bruce Richardson, chief research officer at AMR Research.Since it sells mainly through partners, the company does not have the close links with customers that rivals enjoy, he said, adding: “The good news is, it has a lot of people selling software; the bad news is, it loses its relationship with the customer.”Revenues at Microsoft Business Solutions, one of the company’s seven business divisions, grew by only 5 per cent last year, to $793m, or 2 per cent of the company’s total revenues.The former head of the unit, Doug Burgum, was moved to a new position as chairman of the division last week, and Microsoft said it was searching for a new executive to run the business.The new CRM software – used by companies to manage their sales and marketing functions – has been closely linked to Office, which has 400m users around the world, said Brad Wilson, the Microsoft general manager responsible for the product. “All CRM users spend half their day in Office and Outlook,” he said“It will appeal to anyone who wants to use CRM software but doesn’t want to learn anything beyond Outlook,” said Mr Richardson."
1033;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-11-29T21:34:38Z;Wall St loses gains as rate fears re-emerge;;Wall Street failed to muster a convincing rally on Tuesday despite lower crude prices and a raft of positive economic data.In the end, news of stronger-than-expected consumer confidence, a jump in demand for durable goods and record new home sales served mainly to raise fears of inflation. After making sharp gains in morning trading, the main indices pulled back on concerns that the Fed would continue its interest rate hikes in face an overly robust economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually flat, down 2.40 points at 10,888.32, as was the broader S&P 500, up .05 points at 1,257.51. The Nasdaq Composite index, dragged down by losses in Google, fell 0.3 per cent, or 6.66 points to 2,232.71.“Modest is best for the market at the moment,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist, AG Edwards and Sons. “The market is at the point where economic data that is good makes the bond and equities market nervous about what the Fed is going to do to interest rates. You want growth but modest non-inflationary growth.”Google was back in focus, albeit for a different reason. After soaring past $427 a share earlier in the week, its shares fell 4.7 per cent, or almost $20, to $403.54. The retreat came after an analyst did the unthinkable and downgraded the stock.Apple Computer, another stock which has seen intense demand this year, also went into reverse. The company, which has been bid up by investors in recent days on expectations of strong sales for its iPod nano music player, drop 2.2 per cent to $68.10.Dell and Oracle, both of which have been struggling in recent weeks, saw a reversal of fortunes. The former rose 0.7 per cent to $30.42 while the latter gained 1.5 per cent to $12.73.On the corporate front, Calpine plunged 56.8 per cent to $0.54 after the troubled power producer announced the departures of Peter Cartwright, its founder, and chief financial officer Robert Kelly. The fall came amid rumours that Mr Cartwright would not have left unless Calpine was preparing to file for bankruptcy.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia lost 6.3 per cent to $35.48 after both Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan cut their ratings on the stock, with the latter citing valuation concerns.“We believe that Nvidia stock, which has doubled over the past year and trades near its 52-week high of approximately $38, is fairly valued,” the broker said in a research note.Merck staged a modest recovery, rising 1.6 per cent to $30.02 after its shares lost more than $3bn of its market value in the previous session.News of record new homes sales failed to lift the housing sector. The Philadelphia Housing Index finished almost unchanged, up 0.04 per cent, after falling 2.8 per cent the day before. Pultes Homes rose 0.7 per cent to $41.85 while Toll Brothers lost another 1.6 per cent at $34.44.US Steel, once a Dow component, gained 7.7 per cent to $45.78 following news that it had appointed a new chairman.
1034;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-11-14T23:20:42Z;Split Liberty to focus on debt markets;;John Malone is splitting up his Liberty Media group with a view to being ready to invest in the corporate debt markets, where he expects values to collapse at some point under the weight of the highly-leveraged acquisitions being made by private equity investors.Mr Malone said on Monday his plan for separating Liberty Media’s interactive assets from its financial investments was aimed at giving Greg Maffei, the new chief executive, more scope to pounce on future opportunities, such as potential ones in the debt markets.Mr Maffei, who left Oracle abruptly this month after only four months as the software developer’s chief financial officer, was appointed by Mr Malone last week. The two men have known each other since the early 1990s, when Mr Maffei, as Microsoft’s chief financial officer, struck cable sector deals with Liberty Media.“Greg’s experience will be helpful in figuring out how to grow the interactive assets,” said Mr Malone in a joint telephone interview with Mr Maffei. “But the real home run is in the capital company,” he said.“We don’t know what (the opportunities) will be. However, when you leverage businesses as highly as the private equity guys are doing, combined with (higher interest rates), I have got to believe pressure is going to be felt by operating businesses as they struggle to service the rising cost of debt,” Mr Malone said.Mr Malone, one of the founders of the US cable business, will remain chairman of Liberty Media. Last year, Mr Malone hit the headlines after Liberty Media increased its voting stake in Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp to 19 per cent, prompting Mr Murdoch to adopt poison pill measures to prevent a further build-up.Mr Malone took over as interim chief executive of Liberty Media this summer and decided to create tracker shares for QVC, its home shopping business, and other “interactive” assets such as stakes in IAC and Expedia. The shares are a likely precursor to a full spin-off.Mr Maffei was Mr Malone’s top choice as chief executive due to his experience in media businesses and in finance, and approached him to ask if he knew anyone suitable for the job. “I had a modest hope (when I contacted him) that things had not worked out and that Greg was looking for somewhere more entrepreneurial than Oracle,” Mr Malone said.In the last years, Mr Malone has spun off a number of Liberty Media’s divisions in an effort to simplify the company and remove the discount at which it trades in the stock market.Liberty Global, now the biggest cable operator outside the US, was spun off last year. The group was built up with investments in the distressed debt of cable companies bought in the early 1990s after frenzied over-investment in the sector.Mr Malone said on Monday he hoped to build on the experience of last year’s spin-off of Liberty Global, now the biggest cable operator outside the US, and, with hindsight, wished he had made many more similar investments after the bursting of the internet and technology bubble.
1035;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-11-10T00:17:35Z;Liberty names ex-Oracle CFO as new chief;;Greg Maffei, selected by John Malone as the new chief executive of Liberty Media, will immediately start work on the media mogul's latest plan to boost the group's share price, including the creation of tracker shares.The trackers which will include Liberty's QVC home shopping business and account for up to 80 per cent of Liberty's equity value could be a precursor to a full spin-off of Liberty's interactive businesses in two to three years, Mr Malone said.Tracker shares are rarely used by companies these days because they are not a real separation of businesses, often leading investors to discount their value.Mr Malone said on Wednesday that they were the best intermediate step because of the complications of a full spin-off, including the need to restructure debt, adding that the interactive group might make further acquisitions.The remaining assets of Liberty Media which include a 19 per cent voting stake in News Corp, as well as numerous derivative and other financial investments will be “simplified” by Mr Maffei. These assets could eventually be bought by News Corp, and the voting shares replaced by non-voting ones, Mr Malone indicated.Mr Maffei, who left Oracle abruptly last week after only four months as chief financial officer, was praised by Mr Malone on Wednesday as “one of the most astute financial thinkers I have met”.His background in technology and telecoms companies he was chief financial officer at Microsoft and chief executive of telecoms group 360networks before his move to Oracle ties in with Mr Malone's vision of where the media industry is heading.Mr Malone has said media groups have to reinvent themselves amid the widespread use of the internet and search engines. Liberty Media, which reported a third-quarter loss yesterday of $94m, or 3 cents per share, down from a $372m profit last time on investment losses, said revenues had risen by 13 per cent on the back of improvements at the QVC channel. Its shares were largely unchanged.Mr Maffei joined Oracle, the second-biggest independent software company, in June as CFO and one of three co-presidents.Infighting amongst Oracle's senior management, as three executives positioned themselves to take over from Larry Ellison, the company's chief executive, was said to have contributed Mr Maffei's his departure.Mr Maffei has a reputation as a dealmaker and is best known for investments at Microsoft in the 1990s in the cable and telecoms sector, although most of these led to write-downs. Mr Malone first met him during that time.
1036;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-10-21T12:52:32Z;The week in technology: The results are in;;It was a week of third quarter reports and most big technology companies had reason to celebrate. Google, which went beyond everyone’s wildest expectations, especially with forecasts of seasonal slowness, knocked the others into a cocked hat with its shares shooting up 9 per cent, adding a mere $7bn to the value of the internet giant. It made Google’s decision earlier in the week to change the name of its email service from Gmail to Googlemail in the UK after a small financial research company claimed it had the name first seemed as significant as a gnat bite to an elephant.In other developments Google “maps mash-ups” are beginning to proliferate, according to an NYT article about websites developed with Google Maps’ technology. GoogleMapsMania is a blog on the newcomers.And still on Google - always on Google - we’re not sure which is most disturbing about this item - the fact that a Swedish couple named their baby ‘Google’, or that there is a website in existence called “bloggingbaby”.SAP’s ‘steady’ approach pays offSAP, the world’s biggest enterprise software provider, demonstrated it is successfully fending off the threat from Oracle, which has become SAP’s number one rival after an acquisition spree. On announcing its third quarter earnings Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said SAP’s organic growth provided more stability for customers who were worried about Oracle’s roadmap.SAP and Oracle are playing hardball by trying to lure customers from each other with large discounts. Both have claimed a few dozen wins since the beginning of the year , but SAP’s strong showing in the US and unexpectedly good performance in Germany, its home market, suggest it is not feeling any pressure.Meanwhile Intel reported a record quarter with $10bn in sales, but warned that the fourth quarter would see a drop as customers had been building their inventory.Expectations grow for telecoms companiesEarly in the week, Motorola’s third-quarter results were boosted by its very successful Razr phone, while Sony Ericsson also saw good sales from its phones with camera and Walkman technology. Unfortunately these two sets of results created high expectations on Nokia and Ericsson, both of whom saw their share prices dip slightly despite reporting largely positive results.Firefox’s triumphs and trialsFirefox was downloaded for the 100 millionth time. Tech Review are converts to the open source browser, but we notice that this story seemed to receive a lot more coverage than figures showing Firefox’s market share had fallen twice in three months, suggesting that its mission to take on Internet Explorer might be stalling.But the open source movement is fighting back - this time with Flock, a “Super Firefox”, reviewed here by The Inquirer. Flock has a built-in blog editor, RSS reader, and its own privacy-aware, open source, search engine. We hear it’s also a strict vegetarian and supports fair trade, too.New video iPods reviewedSome reviewers looked at Apple’s new video-capable iPod, and most were impressed with the picture sharpness but questioned the usefulness of the feature and content offerings. It was at least a better reception than that given to the widely-criticised Motorola ROKR phones with iTunes in September.BSkyB to buy EasynetIn the UK, BSkyB, the biggest subscription television provider, made a bid for broadband company Easynet. Sky’s chief executive James Murdoch’s plans for the acquisition include both the V-word and the T-word - ‘triple-play’ or TV/internet/telephony. Of course James’ dad, Rupert, has been on the internet bandwagon since the beginning of the year, and has so far spent about $1.5bn on internet content acquisitions and is prepared to spend another $500m.Email us: technology@ft.com
1037;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-10-20T16:46:52Z;Stability gives SAP the edge over Oracle;;SAP, the world’s largest business software maker, is profiting from acquisitions by Oracle, its US rival, as customers appear to be banking on the stability of the German company rather than committing to its fast-expanding competitor.Contracts signed between the start of July and the end of September with companies such as Applied Materials in the US and Allianz in Germany boosted SAP’s software sales. Revenues in the third quarter were €590m ($707m), 20 per cent higher than the same period in 2004. Analysts had predicted a 12 per cent rise.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said SAP was outbidding Oracle because “there is uncertainty about what our competitor is doing in the future and [whether it] can deliver”. While Oracle was “stitching together companies”, SAP’s “organic growth” gave stability. This was driving sales.SAP this year aims to hire 4,500 staff and launch products for smaller firms. Oracle, by contrast, has spent billions buying competitors such as PeopleSoft to rival SAP in the business management market. SAP said its market share had still grown by two points to 60 per cent worldwide since June – and by three points to 44 per cent in the US.“We are putting more distance between ourselves and the competition,” Mr Kagermann said.“It looks as though SAP is expanding its roots in sectors in which it was already the dominant vendor,” said Adam Shepherd at Dresdner Kleinwort Wassserstein. “It is raising sales as these clients favour the known quantity SAP over Oracle – though it is not carving chunks out of Oracle’s strong business with financial institutions.”SAP said software licence sales would rise 12-14 per cent in 2005, up from a mid-year forecast of 10-12 per cent. Total revenue in the quarter rose 13 per cent to €2.01bn, and pro-forma operating income, which excludes stock-options, increased 9 per cent to €520m.Sergio Giacoletto, Oracle’s vice president for Europe, said the US company stood by its goal to become the number one in business management. SAP “was very proud to have poached some of our clients but it was only a few of a whole host,” he told FTDeutschland, the FT’s sister paper. “Customers usually don’t switch that easily.”Additional reporting by Thomas Fromm in Munich
1038;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Lex: SAP;;"Enterprise management software is expensive but hard to do without if you do not want to be left behind. The same goes for shares in SAP, which leads the industry.Third-quarter results predictably beat expectations and how. Data out of the US were particularly strong, where software revenues jumped 34 per cent year-on-year. SAP has almost doubled its US market share over the past three years. The contrast with arch-rival Oracle, where underlying licence sales fell by almost half in the last quarter compared with a year earlier, could not be starker.One fly in the ointment was an unexpected 90 basis point fall in the operating profit margin to 25.8 per cent. Marketing costs have risen ahead of the shift to SAP's new software architecture by 2007. This transition presents SAP and its competitors with the danger of customer defections and technology hiccups.SAP, however, faces this challenge with a more organically developed suite of products while Oracle is busy integrating $18bn of acquisitions and their associated applications. Moreover, CSFB reckons that sales of mySAP the older platform should more than cover expected licence revenues to the end of 2007. Revenue per head is rising, even while the sales force expands.At 26 times expected 2006 earnings, SAP is not cheap. But then cornering a sub-sector of the software industry is often a licence to print money. The management expects an operating margin of 30 per cent by 2007. Given SAP's growing dominance in its own field, it should be able to beat that.- Click here to add your comments

Kamprad started in business as a child, selling matches, before diversifying into fish and pencils.At the age of 17, he used a gift from his father to found the company that would become IKEA; furniture was introduced in 1953 and, in 1955, it began to sell its own designs. His simple, affordable and egalitarian products have a huge appeal: at the time of going to press the company has 222 stores and a turnover of more than €14.5bn. Few in the west have not had their houses touched by the Swedish giant. The company is ultimately owned by a Dutch trust in an unusual and complicated structure. There have been claims that Kamprad effectively still owns it - and that this would make him the world’s richest man.He says: (on his legendary frugality) “I seldom wash disposable plastic glasses any more.”They say: “In Sweden, going to IKEA is like going to the supermarket to buy paper towels in bulk. But in America, IKEA is a wonder of super design.” - Barbro Osher, Swedish consul general in San Francisco.………………………………………………………………………………………………………………23: Lee Kun-heeChairman, Samsung GroupAge: 63Worth: $4.3bn (family fortune)Big idea: Understanding the importance of branding.Best known for: Transforming Samsung Electronics from a low-quality mass producer into Asia’s most valuable technology company. Instead of making televisions and video players under licence to Japanese companies, Lee promoted Samsung as a brand with its own reputation and cachet.Samsung is now a global electronics brand synonymous with cutting edge technology and cool design. In 1987 Lee inherited the ship-building, chemical-producing, apartment-building and handset-making chaebol (conglomerate) founded by his father 20 years before. Lee’s willingness to restructure the chaebol after the 1997 financial crisis is credited with saving it and with laying the groundwork for Samsung’s global success. Samsung went from a company unknown outside Korea to a highly valued international name. It is the world’s leading producer of liquid crystal displays and memory chips, and one of the top three mobile phone producers, famous for its whizzy handsets incorporating televisions and MP3 players.He says: “One genius can feed millions of others. For the upcoming era where creativity will be the most important driver of business success, we need to hire the best. The economic value of one genius is more than $1bn.”They say: “Learn Samsung.” - Nobuyuki Idei, former chairman of Sony.………………………………………………………………………………………………………………24: Hasso PlattnerCo-founder and chairman, SAPAge: 61Worth: $5bnBig idea:Technology that lets companies manage their back office functions in a way that helps executives speed up decisions and cut costs.Best known for:Being the Bill Gates of the management information systems software industry.In many ways, Plattner has had as much influence on that industry as Gates had on the PC sector. He had the vision to see a gap in the market to help companies manage processes such as payrolls, supplies, inventories and customer relations. SAP, the German software giant that he founded with four former IBM colleagues, is now Europe’s biggest software company, and the fourth largest in the world after Microsoft, IBM and Oracle.Under his leadership, SAP became the only European company able to stand up to the American heavyweights. He stepped down as chief executive in 2003 to become non-executive chairman, but he still helps develop software products in the company’s Silicon Valley research labs. His colourful style of management was illustrated when he pulled his trousers down as an Oracle crew support boat sailed by during a yacht race.He says: “We grew from a shooting star of the 1990s into a world-class global enterprise that plays in the same league as IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.”They say: “He’s a seminal figure in the development of the modern software industry.” - Bruce Richardson, analyst at AMR Research.………………………………………………………………………………………………………………25: Li Ka-shingChairman, Hutchison WhampoaAge: 77Worth: $13bnBig idea:Always expand.Best known for: Being one of the most powerful men in Asia (in one poll he was rated higher than his friend, China’s former president Jiang Zemin).Since last year, Li’s ranking has fallen from 17 to last on the list. This is largely because of his problems with mobile phone investment: he has spent $25bn and, thus far, has had losses in the billions to show for it. Indeed, for all his triumphs in real estate, ports and oil, success in high speed telecoms eludes him. Nonetheless he remains one of the richest businessmen in Asia and is widely regarded as a bellwether for business sentiment. He set up the Li Ka-shing Foundation in 1980 to channel money to medical, educational and cultural charities. In early 2005 he sold his $1bn stake in the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, giving all the proceeds to charity.He says: “In the Chinese way, I must say that I’m lucky. But I would also say that before making a final decision I study everything very carefully - from supply and demand to the political situation. Once I make my decision, I go quite fast to catch the market at the right time.”They say: “Hong Kong is the private kingdom of Li Ka-shing.” - Hong Kong saying."
1040;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-10-06T19:09:32Z;Observer - US;;"There is already a lot of speculation about how Alan Greenspan might spend his time once he leaves the Federal Reserve next year.Some think he might write a book about his economic philosophy. And there would be plenty of companies willing to kill to get the 79-year-old Greenspan on their board.He could spend more of his time playing tennis, a game he plays with gusto. Observer hears he has slowed down a bit but compensates by hitting the ball with plenty of spin.But Greenspan could be on the
road too much to devote much time
to any of these pursuits in his post-Fed years.Earlier this week, Greenspan and his wife, Andrea Mitchell, attended a charity roast held by Barbara Walters on Wednesday night. As luck had it, Greenspan and Mitchell were the winners of the big charity raffle, The Washington Post reported. The prize: a silver Porsche Boxster.Observer wonders whether the idea of cruising the back roads of Virginia would be more appealing than sitting down to write a book about, say, the importance of economic flexibility.When David Duffield, founder of PeopleSoft, was trying to fend off Oracle’s bid for his company, he played the local angle hard.Hoping to rally his workers and community behind him, Duffield suggested Oracle and Larry Ellison would axe workers in the East Bay area and damage the local economy in the process.Alas, that line ultimately didn’t help much, since Ellison won the day. But Duffield is doing his part to fill the tax coffers anyway.Duffield is planning to build a 72,000sq ft home, plus 25,000sq ft of outbuildings that include a stable, pool and underground garage, according to The Contra Costa Times.He has secured a 22-acre lot in Contra Costa, though neighbours have already suggested that the planned home’s hulking size might disrupt the rural charm of the area, once home to little more than orchards.If Duffield succeeds in building his dream home, it will be far larger than the Washington home of Bill and Melinda Gates, or the even the
White House.President George W. Bush was full of good will on Thursday when he helped William F. Buckley Jr celebrate 50 years of National Review.Bush quoted Buckley as once saying: “The job of conservatives was to stand athwart history, yelling ‘stop’.” Noting that he had followed Buckley at Yale, Bush added: “That’s the approach I took to most of my classes.”Buckley, he said, had helped “move conservatism from the margins of American society into the Oval Office”.But what happens once a conservative gets to the Oval Office appears to be another matter. As Bush spoke, National Review online was attacking the president’s
decision to name Harriet Miers to
the Supreme Court.It quoted the Chronicle of Higher Education, which reported that, as a member of the advisory board for Southern Methodist University’s law school in the late 1990s, Miers backed a lecture series in women’s studies.Gloria Steinem gave the first lecture of the series, in 1998; followed by Pat Schroeder, the former Democratic congresswoman; Susan Faludi, the author of Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women, and – could it get any worse? – Ann Richards, the Texas Democrat who Bush ousted in 1994.Jay Fielden, editor of Men’s Vogue, thinks American men are likely to have more respect for English tailoring once they peruse his new magazine, which is scheduled to be published regularly by Conde Nast, beginning in April.“The British are pioneers in making a great, high-quality suit and the American man wants a suit that doesn’t go out of style,” Fielden says.“I don’t think you’ll start pretending you’re an Englishman in New York – or, God forbid, Texas – after reading Men’s Vogue. But the magazine incorporates the greatest of British traditions.”Conde Naste has deemed Men’s Vogue’s trial run on New York City’s news stands a success (in spite of a hostile review of it in the Washington Post) and reportedly plans to publish up to 10 issues, all geared towards male fashionistas, within two years.Fielden believes his magazine supports a worthy cause, in spite of some cries that another men’s magazine is the last thing the world needs.“At a certain point, whether they are Saul Bellow or Ernest Hemingway or Evelyn Waugh, all men realise that to reach a certain level of success in life you have to dress well, and I think we’ll help them do that.”It is Thanksgiving in Canada this weekend and the town of Windsor, Nova Scotia, is holding its annual pumpkin regatta.Normally, few outsiders would pay much attention to the local bigwigs paddling across Lake Pesaquid in giant, hollowed-out pumpkins.This year is different. Spotting the perfect setting for pumpkin pie recipes and autumn decorations, Martha Stewart’s handlers suggested that she would love to paddle a pumpkin.A small problem has surfaced. Convicted criminals require a temporary residence permit to enter Canada, normally a time-consuming process.Stewart says the document cannot be arranged in time to make the trip. Politicians and bureaucrats in Ottawa were scrambling yesterday to cut away the red tape.“The pumpkin race – oh, she’s got to be there,” said Paul Martin, the prime minister. Some convicted criminals are clearly more welcome than others."
1041;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-10-04T17:46:01Z;Boardroom IT clinic: Ensure it’s all right on the night;;How do I future-proof my major IT investment?Cast your mind back to the early 1980s, when arcades provided what turned out to be the most successful coin operated game in history: Pac-Man.Who would have thought that this game would guide the behaviours of many of today’s technology market leaders? But hey, as a technology buyer, you get to participate as well – as Pac-Man feed.Anybody who has a substantial investment in technology from a single vendor will know the feeling.The vendors are in a Pac-Man-like rush to consume the market, and, to accelerate the process, consume each other.Notable moves include PeopleSoft’s acquisition of JD Edwards, Oracle’s acquisition of PeopleSoft and, most recently, Siebel.These are characteristic of the pubescent IT industry gravitating towards maturity. The acquirer is purely interested in the customer base of the acquired, and will jettison its product portfolio at the first legal opportunity. How many CRM solutions does Oracle need to offer?Who will be left is the key question? Knowing the answer will minimise the chances of your IT investment being on the road kill side of the scoreboard. But the answer is far from clear.The examples above relate to Oracle’s endeavours to remain a contender in the enterprise applications market. SAP is the number-one player, and one would think in an unassailable position. However some time back it transpired that Microsoft had its eye on the German software giant. So nothing is certain.So how do you minimise the impact of investing heavily in technologies that may well become obliterated by the acquisition of your supplier?The first thing to keep in mind is that being an investor in IT, you are by default in the IT risk management business. So all endeavours to minimise victimhood should be underpinned by a risk mitigation philosophy.Recommendation 1.Treat your technology investment like a portfolio. Having all your eggs in one basket is to be avoided. Study your assets in terms of their business impact and vendor control (or “lock-in”). The extent to which the vendor controls the relationship will have a direct impact on your ability to migrate to a rival product if needs be.Assets that have a high impact on the business, but place you at the mercy of the vendor will require your immediate attention.In enterprise applications, consider using modules from more than one vendor, rather than being seduced into a tailored end-to-end solution, which sounds good, but is the equivalent of giving someone else control over your central nervous system.Recommendation 2.When specifying technology requirements, minimise references to product names, but maximise references to open standards.If you use providers that base their offerings on standards not under their control,such as Unix or SQL, you have a greater chance of migrating to another vendor, if necessary. Be wary of proprietary standards created by the vendor. Focus on those controlled by independent standard bodies.Recommendation 3.Insist your provider “insures” you against the possibility of an aggressive takeover.Recommendation 4.Establish whether there is a thriving market for support services relating to the technology in question.Should the technology be facing a dead end, then these companies, and particularly those that deal solely in the technology facing obsolescence, are in a tricky situation as well. Their offering is in danger of being market-irrelevant.Such companies are likely to offer migration services, if only to keep their business “above water” until they come up with their own plan B. Steer clear where the product supplier is the only supplier of related services.Recommendation 5.Join the user group or form a user group and take an active approach to ensuring that your needs are not overlooked.Making big ticket technology purchases is a risky business. Portfolio management is a better option.Portfolio management will require better technology,and vendor and people management within your organization.But the overhead will more than pay for itself, if it means one less item on the executive committee’s business-critical risk register.Ade McCormack (ade@auridian.com) is founder of Auridian (www.auridian.com), which focuses on helping business professionals get to grips with IT.He is author of IT Demystified - The IT handbook for business professionals (www.auridian.com/book).
1042;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-10-04T16:50:37Z;Ian Campbell of Nucleus Research;;One might expect Ian Campbell to be gleeful at last month’s $5.85bn takeover of Siebel Systems by Oracle, its enterprise IT rival.Three years ago last month, Mr Campbell’s company, Massachusetts-based Nucleus Research, published a highly critical study of the use of Siebel software.It found more than 61 per cent of “reference customers” it interviewed had not achieved a positive return on investment after more than two years, even though they were being promoted as success stories on Siebel’s website.This, it said, contradicted the company’s claims about the positive ROI average customers were achieving.Tom Siebel [the founder] was apoplectic. “It made for some good phone calls,” says Mr Campbell.In fact Mr Campbell owes Mr Siebel a debt of gratitude. The latter’s angry public reaction and a similar response at Germany’s SAP following another study of March 2003 helped put Nucleus on the technology consultancy map.Mr Campbell, a former research manager at IDC, the IT analysts, founded Nucleus in 2000, convinced of the need for quantitative assessment of investments, to complement the prevalent opinion-based approach.“Everything we do has some sort of number at its core,” he says. Its main tool, the ROI assessment, is a “great, impartial measuring tool, if done correctly.”In an IT context, the rigour and consistency of an ROI assessment has a particular resonance. “Some people will write whatever you want,” says Mr Campbell. And an inaccurate case study could result in a vendor losing its credibility with customers.Also, he says, the strategic and market-related analysis from the main IT research companies such as Gartner and Forrester Research tends to be general, but ROI assessments have to be done on an individual basis to have any value.Three years after the spats with Siebel and SAP, relationships have improved, he says. “Everyone now understands that we’re not out to get them, and we’re not going to lie to them.”In a sign the industry accepts the need for impartial ROI studies, Nucleus works not only for customers but also for vendors, including Microsoft, Siebel and Oracle.The respect Nucleus has won reflects the “rules of engagement” it established when it took on Siebel. “We follow a certain path. No vendor can say ‘Make sure the ROI is 200 per cent’,” says Mr Campbell.Even so, Nucleus’s work can still give customers and vendors pause for thought. Its study of customers of Salesforce.com, the fast-growing customer relationship management (CRM) service, supplied on demand over the internet, showed that a third would switch if they could find a better and cheaper alternative.“We quoted one customer who said it would take 30 minutes to switch to another provider. It’s not that Salesforce.com are doing poorly, but it needs to realise its tenuous hold on customers.”In general, Nucleus’s ROI studies suggest hosted CRM services such as Salesforce.com work better for smaller customers. As companies get bigger, and want to build on top of their CRM and integrate it with other systems, they should be thinking whether to bring CRM in-house.Nucleus has also looked at the ROI case for Venda, the hosted e-commerce service founded by UK serial entrepreneur Dan Wagner. “Does it make sense for anybody to create their own e-commerce system and support it, when they can outsource to Dan and pay a few thousand a month?” he asks.He is much less enthusiastic about the ROI case for two of the most-hyped fads: radio frequency identification, and Voiceover Internet Protocol.“I don’t think [tagging items with] RFID is a compelling ROI story for people other than a Wal-Mart,” he says. “When Wal-Mart [the world’s biggest retailer] moves from barcodes to tags it has positive ROI because of the high volumes, but very few companies fall into that category. Does Prada want an RFID tag on every one of its shoes?”VoIP is “wonderful”, he says, but questions whether there is an ROI case for it. “Yes, if you don’t have anything right now, you’d buy VoIP. But if you already have something, does it make sense to yank it out? Not yet.”Meanwhile, Mr Campbell refuses to gloat over Siebel’s takeover. “After our report there was a strong change in the way the company interacted with analysts, the press and customers,” he says. “I think they took what we said to heart.”
1043;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-10-04T16:39:28Z;Escalating demands call for fancy footwork;;"The concerted efforts of information technology vendors, combined with highly publicised accounting scandals in companies such as WorldCom and Enron, have pushed compliance high up the agenda for many chief information officers.Compliance projects are absorbing a growing proportion of IT budgets, as companies struggle to bring their systems in line with the requirements of laws such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.But as in the run-up to the year 2000 – when resources had to be diverted to ensure that IT systems were Y2K compliant – CIOs are finding there are fewer resources available for projects outside compliance.Innovative programmes that could support top-line growth, but which cannot promise immediate returns, are being particularly hard-hit as businesses grapple with tougher regulatory requirements.Businesses have little choice but to upgrade their systems to keep up with the demands of compliance legislation.“The risks to a business associated with providing poor information have increased. Sarbanes-Oxley has reminded people of that, and a number of companies are having to catch up and tidy up their information systems,” says David Elton, a compliance expert in the technology practice at PA Consulting.Building compliance best practice into new IT projects is less of an issue, Mr Elton says, than adding compliance features to existing infrastructure.Companies may need to graft a range of controls and information quality checks on to systems. Many of these systems will be mission-critical; some will be old and difficult to adapt.Some companies have released additional funds in order to accommodate compliance work. IT vendors noted a spike in spending on compliance last year.According to Chris Leone, a vice-president of product strategy at Oracle, companies increased their spending by as much as 30 per cent last year in order to absorb compliance projects, especially around Sarbanes-Oxley.The additional spending, however, has not led to a sustained upturn in investment in IT. “The last 18 months have been an anomaly,” says Mr Leone. “This year, budgets have been set and compliance is coming out of wider IT spending.”This, in turn, is putting pressure on other areas. Not only is there less money available, as funds are switched to compliance work, but management and staff resources are also stretched.Although managers in some lines of business might feel that IT people are using compliance work as an excuse to delay projects, the truth is that compliance is becoming a real burden and a significant barrier to further IT innovation.“It is legitimate for IT departments to say that they can’t take on innovative projects because of compliance,” says Mr Elton of PA Consulting.But some companies are succeeding in limiting the burden of compliance work. Companies in sectors such as financial services and petrochemicals are accustomed to working within tight regulatory frameworks.These industries tend to have IT systems best able to accommodate compliance requirements. They are also further advanced in automating compliance, a critical requirement if companies are to control costs and free resources for other projects.At Oracle, Chris Leone suggests that the first phase of compliance work was largely a manual process, with analysis carried out in spreadsheets and reports created using a word processor.Such measures are time-consuming, expensive and prone to error. “Phase two of compliance is to automate a lot of those processes,” he says.Automation, however, has to be combined with best practice if companies are to manage the compliance burden successfully. A box-ticking approach is neither completely effective, nor the best way to control costs.In some areas, such as IT security, an overemphasis on filling in checklists can even be damaging. This is particularly the case in the area of information security.A report by research company Gartner this year noted that “most regulations lead to increased reporting, rather than increased levels of security”.Lawrence Orans, co-author of the report, cautions that focusing on the letter of compliance law, rather than building software and systems that are less vulnerable, will not increase security for companies.The answer could be for companies to stress best practice, both in corporate governance and IT administration, and then ensure they meet specific compliance requirements.This approach will ultimately be more effective, more flexible and cheaper than much of the current work large businesses are carrying out in the field."
1044;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-10-04T16:35:36Z;Marc Benioff of salesforce.com;;Marc Benioff is an ebullient character, a worthy heir to a long line of noisy, passionate and opinionated West Coast technology executives.But even judged by those standards, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com, the software rental group, was in particularly bombastic mood late last month as he reflected on a momentous week.“This is the most exciting week of my career,” he says. “Not only have we introduced our most important product, but our top competitor just disappeared.”The “most important” product is Salesforce.com’s AppExchange, of which more later, while the competitor is Siebel Systems, which had just been swallowed whole by Oracle.Siebel employees and customers are doubtless waiting to discover what is in store for the once high-flying customer relationship management software provider. But Mr Benioff is already certain of what the future holds.“There is no future for Siebel customers. We’re now in a situation where Oracle now has seven CRM applications, so which will they continue and which will they kill? And what happens to the customers and what’s the plan? The reality is they have one product, Oracle Fusion. and they say it’s not ready for 2009,” he says.Mr Benioff, whose “on- demand” model has been eating away at the traditional software licence business model that was the bedrock of Siebel, does not mourn the demise of his closest rival.He says: “For the industry it was a good day, as the company that has given us the worse software with the poorest success rate is gone. Siebel’s epitaph will read: ‘They invented CRM, but the customers didn’t like the product’.” All of which begs the question of why Oracle paid billions for this unpopular software.With his 13-year experience of working for Oracle, where he was once regarded as Larry Ellison’s protégé, Mr Benioff has some insight: “Larry has SAP envy. He wants to do everything he can to become SAP. He dominates database but that can’t be said about the applications business.“Larry never cared about it until the past year or two but he wants to be king of applications and the only way is to buy market share.”Keen as Mr Benioff is to discuss other people’s businesses, he only really gets going when talking about Salesforce.The demise of Siebel as an independent business, is merely confirmation, he says, of the arrival of the business model that has made Salesforce one of the decade’s technology growth stories.What’s more, he says, he is not alone in appreciating this shift. “In 1999 he [Mr Ellison] spent $2m on 4 per cent [of Salesforce] because he believed that the future of industry is the internet and delivering software as a service,” he says.The change, he says, has been prompted by the experience of many customers in the late 1990s, when they paid huge licence fees for huge systems that failed to deliver satisfaction.“A lot of customers spent a lot of money for no return. They are now very cautious and that’s why buying patterns have changed. Companies that were buying multi-million dollar packages are now buying smaller things, or piloting them and buying later,” he says.And herein lies the strength of the business model. Customers try a product, like it and roll it out further and further across their organisations.“We have better products that users love. We turn our users into our salespeople, and they love us,” he says.Among those romantically linked with Salesforce at the moment are Deutsche Post, ADP and Merrill Lynch, big names that serve to emphasise Mr Benioff’s point that the Salesforce model is about providing companies of all sizes with usability, functionality and flexibility.The AppExchange will add to those qualities, allowing Salesforce users to create their own customised applications on the group’s architecture and sell them on.“Someone in Bangalore might go home one evening and develop an application on our service. They save it to a directory and charge others. Once we had two on-demand applications and now we have 70 and soon we will have thousands,” he says.And adding new and better services for customers, Mr Benioff believes, is the key to growth. “We’re hiring developers not lawyers and investment bankers. We think it’s a good idea and will benefit customers.”
1045;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-09-22T22:45:47Z;Oracle shares slip on flat results;;Oracle shares fell nearly 5 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday after it announced new-licence revenues for its key database and middleware products were relatively flat in its first quarter.Oracle said these revenues were up just 1 per cent to $492m to August 31, from $486m a year earlier. It blamed economic weakness in Europe along with its US market not performing as strongly as expected, with two major deals slipping into the second quarter.Larry Ellison, chief executive, said there was also a tough comparison with a year ago, when database revenues grew 20 per cent. He insisted that the database business, responsible for around 80 per cent of Oracle’s earnings, was still growing at around 10 per cent, based on results from the past four quarters.Oracle shares were trading 4.8 per cent lower at $12.87 after the market closed, in response to the announcement.The company declared a profit of $738m or 14 cents a share, in line with the expectations of analysts polled by Thomson First Call and up 38 per cent on a year ago. The figure excluded acquisition expenses and other charges. Non-GAAP total sales of $2.91bn were below analyst forecasts of $2.94bn.Oracle acquired PeopleSoft late last year, bought Retek, which specialises in the retail market, this year and announced the purchase of Siebel Systems this month for nearly $6bn.PeopleSoft and Retek helped lift revenues in its business applications division by 84 per cent to $127m.“This quarter delivered exceptionally strong applications performance driven by the successful integration of PeopleSoft,” said Greg Maffei, chief financial officer. “Cash flow and margins also reached record levels.”Oracle said new-licence sales for its Fusion middleware grew 33 per cent in the quarter compared to 2 per cent growth for its main rival there, BEA.“We think we will move ahead of BEA and challenge IBM for the number-one spot in middleware,” said Mr Ellison.Services revenues were up 34 per cent at $637m.Oracle said it was still on track to deliver earnings of 78 to 81 cents per share for the fiscal year but Mr Maffei declined to give a revenue forecast.For the current quarter, he expected the Silicon Valley company to earn 19 cents per share on sales of $3.37bn to $3.46bn, representing growth of 22 to 26 per cent.
1046;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-09-20T15:42:11Z;Technology establishment offers home to Linux;;"An observer of the software industry once remarked that Linux is free, as long as your time has no value. Although this might be a harsh assessment of the open source world, it contains a grain of truth.The traditional model for Linux software involved enthusiasts making the code available, free of charge, to the wider community. But turning that code into part of a working computer system involved skill, and often a considerable amount of time. For this reason, some of the most promising early work on open source took place in universities: places with an abundance of skilled, and often cheap, labour.Commercial operations, however, do not have the time to “roll their own” open source technologies. Nor do they want to do deals with hobbyists and enthusiasts, however great the technology. Large companies tend to prefer to deal with other large companies.For their part, many of the coders and developers who were involved in the early stages of open source are looking for ways to earn a living out of the technology. Some have joined large technology companies that make extensive use of Linux, such as IBM and Oracle. But others are looking for more direct ways to monetise “free” software.“You have 18 to 25 year old supporters of Linux, with low overheads, who can be philanthropic,” says Clive Longbottom of industry analysts Quocirca. “But they come to the point where they can’t write code for free, and need to make money.”For those who have stayed with open source, this is usually goal achieved around integration and maintenance services. Most open source software is distributed under a general public licence (GPL), which does not allow companies to sell licences to software and stay within the boundaries of open source. But there is nothing to stop companies selling services such as support or maintenance around an open source operating system or application.This is the business model followed by most Linux distributors, most notably Red Hat and SuSe Linux (the latter is now owned by Novell). It has also been followed by software companies such as MySQL, and Sun Microsystems with its version of OpenOffice, StarOffice.Other businesses have opted to use open source technologies as part of a wider suite of products, or have exported their existing, paid-for software to run on open source. Apple Computer incorporates a wide range of open source technologies in the server version of its OSX operating system, including e-mail (Postfix) and web server software (Apache).Oracle and SAP, the great rivals in enterprise software, have both ported their products to work with open source operating systems. Even Microsoft has embraced some elements of open source: it recently released a software installer tool under an open source licence. “With an open source licence, the software community can modify and redistribute the installer,” says Bill Hilf, who heads Microsoft’s Linux and open source software technology group. “There is a community of developers that really wants to be able to do that.”Microsoft does not make money from the installer; potentially the company could even lose out on revenues from selling the tool kit commercially. But the software giant finds open source to be a useful way of distributing specialist tools to developers. The company also benefits indirectly from being seen as a contributor to open source.For other large software companies, moving their applications to open source is a way of increasing their overall share of a customer’s IT spend. Both Oracle and SAP have used Linux as a way to grow their share of computing projects.Working with a cheaper operating system, running on increasingly commoditised hardware, frees CIOs to spend more money on software licences. But it also makes it easier for the large independent software vendors to gain sales for their middleware and other utilities. “Oracle doesn’t need a big operating system such as Solaris or AIX,” explains Phil Dawson, an enterprise IT analyst at Gartner. “There is more and more in their system that used to be in the OS. Oracle benefits from Linux because it reduces the overall cost of the system, but the Oracle proportion becomes bigger.”Vendors of complex, vertically-integrated software systems can turn a small and light operating system to their advantage, because it avoids the need to cede control of functions to the operating system vendor. It can also make it easier to add technologies such as grid processing.Controlling the operating system is also important in some vertical markets, such as banking, finance and retailing. Here, IBM has found Linux to be a profitable option, because it allows the company to develop systems for markets where less, not more functionality is an advantage.IBM’s retail platform is based around Linux, with a Linux system for point of sale applications. IBM has used similar technology to build applications for banking and e-government, says Scott Handy, the company’s vice president of worldwide Linux. He also sees potential for Linux on the desktop, but expects to see thin client applications rather than the wholesale replacement of existing systems. “Just rolling out Linux will not bring down your total cost of ownership,” he cautions. “Thin clients are a big part of that.”IBM, of course, has a key advantage over pure play Linux companies: it can use Linux to drive hardware sales. Thin clients need to connect to powerful servers, and there is money to be made in services to make sure it all runs well.For software companies, and the Linux distributors in particular, profits will grow by developing distributions for specialist markets, and by growing the total take up of Linux. This will bring scale economies to support and services operations. But commercial customers need to understand that commercial grade support is not free.“If someone wants free software, they can download Fedora,” says Red Hat chief finance officer, Charlie Peters. “But if a CIO wants to run a data centre, he will want a greater level of confidence [in the software]. “We offer the comfort that a build of Linux will work with 2,100 applications, and that the CIO will receive updates every quarter.”"
1047;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-09-20T15:30:09Z;Consolidation gathers pace;;After a lean few years, new research shows, the customer relationship management market is finally on the mend. But the frenetic pace of consolidation in the sector recently has done little to relieve the turmoil facing CRM buyers.Oracle’s $5.8bn acquisition of Siebel last week confirmed a trend in the market: that traditional standalone CRM vendors are struggling.The CRM market has recovered from the dotcom hangover with sales of CRM software growing 8 per cent to $8.8bn in 2004, according to IDC. The growth is coming not from established vendors but upstart hosted providers such as salesforce.com and RightNow Technologies, which offer CRM over the internet.Using hosted CRM is not necessarily cheaper than traditional CRM software, analysts warn, but it can reduce the headaches associated with installing software on site.“The hosted category has changed the whole perception of customer management with faster implementations, quicker time to value, and easy customisation,” says Rob Bois, senior research analyst at AMR Research. Nor is it necessarily a technological panacea. Stories of companies struggling to integrate a hosted solution with existing technology are plentiful.“Hosted CRM has yet to prove that it can be part of an integrated environment,” says Nick Hewson, managing director of Hewson Group, a UK-based CRM analyst company.But he says that hosted CRM makes sense for smaller enterprises or those new to CRM, but less so for many big businesses.“If you have a lot of infrastructure and are already running Siebel, you aren’t going to rip it out,” says Mr Hewson.Siebel, once the undisputed industry leader, had been going through a decidedly rough patch before Oracle – which has been consolidating across the software sector with great energy – emerged as a predictable white knight.Siebel had been slow to launch its own hosted CRM offering and “the rest of Siebel’s business is in the doldrums,” says Mr Hewson.The problem facing Siebel and others in this fragmented industry is that the market has changed since its 1990s heyday. “People are looking for a more pragmatic approach,” says Mr Hewson.As well as hosted CRM, businesses are now taking a close interest in the CRM offerings of mainstream software vendors such as SAP, which have improved markedly.These companies bundle CRM in a suite of other software – often at negligible extra cost. This suite-based approach promises to ease the integration headaches associated with standalone CRM products from “best-of-breed” vendors such as Siebel.SAP increased its CRM revenues 30 per cent in 2004, forcing Siebel into number two spot, according to AMR’s figures.PeopleSoft’s CRM offering is also well respected, although Oracle’s hostile takeover of PeopleSoft has put a question mark over the PeopleSoft product line. Microsoft also has a fledgling CRM software product aimed at SMEs.SSA Global, a fast-growing challenger to SAP and Oracle, is the latest mainstream vendor to jump on the CRM bandwagon. Last month, it acquired Epiphany, a fallen star of the CRM industry.
1048;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-09-18T17:13:17Z;BEST OF LEX: Week 19-24 September Lex: Oracle/SAP;;The fun part is largely over. Oracle has sensibly fleshed out its applications business through a series of high-profile acquisitions over the past year. Absorbing new software and customers from PeopleSoft, JD Edwards, Siebel Systems and Retek provides a stronger base from which to attack market leader SAP.Oracle will now have 33 per cent of the US enterprise applications market and 22 per cent globally, compared with SAP's 41 per cent and 58 per cent. It will also enjoy a flow of savings from cutting duplicate costs.But Oracle has few obvious big targets left in the applications market. Once the dust settles after its recent whirl of dealmaking, the US group will have to prove it can develop its enlarged business organically. On that score, it is likely to remain at a disadvantage to its German rival. SAP has grown without significant acquisitions. As a result its products are designed to work closely together and customers have a clear view of how they will develop over the coming years. Oracle customers, meanwhile, will have to wait for it to knit together the software applications it has snapped up and to lay out as clear a map as its rival for how products will mesh and develop in the future.That does not mean Oracle will lose customers to SAP. It should be able to promise enough to stop defections, especially since switching software across a whole company incurs heavy costs. Oracle also has certain advantages. For example, its market-leading database product gives it a strong card with existing and potential clients.Oracle is now far better positioned than it was. But SAP should retain the upper hand for the next year or two as Oracle focuses on bringing together all of its new applications. Assuming the US group's acquisitions spree is largely over, the German group should grow faster.

1050;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-09-13T12:41:01Z;Lex: Misys;;Traditionally it is heavy manufacturers that make a mess of big contracts - just think of ABB, Alstom or the old British Aerospace. However, Misys shows that software can prove as indigestable as hardware.The UK group’s shares dropped about 15 per cent on Tuesday after it admitted to problems with a handful of large deals for its core banking software.The nub of the problem is timing. Large banks increasingly demand enterprise-wide software systems from their suppliers and more help with implementation. Misys, accordingly, has beefed up product development and recruited a swathe of consultants and project managers from the likes of PeopleSoft and Oracle. Unfortunately, three or four of the €10-20m software contracts it has won as a result have been delayed, forcing the group’s new and highly-paid consultants to sit around and twiddle their thumbs. These sales will still come through and their ultimate profitability should be unaffected. But the short term mismatch between revenues and costs is expected to knock around a fifth off this year’s earnings.The group’s strategy of moving up the value chain by bidding for bigger, more complex deals is surely correct - and should result in higher margins. Yet this disappointment shows that Misys has a learning curve to climb, which is unsettling given an upcoming change in top management. It also suggests that these larger contracts are simply riskier. This could raise the risk profile of the entire company, particularly if the trend spreads to healthcare software, the other big division. Fundamentally, Misys is winning share in growing markets. But until the group can demonstrate that it has eliminated its operational bugs, the stock will deservedly remain under a cloud.
1051;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-09-12T20:19:01Z;M&A news dominates Wall Street;;Mergers and acquisitions news dominated action on Wall Street on Monday as investors digested three multi-billion dollar deals, including Ebay’s $2.6bn acquisition of Skype, the internet telephone service.The leading US indices struggled to find momentum, however, as investors marked the beginning of a return to business as usual after two weeks assessing Hurricane Katrina’s likely impact on stocks.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally to 10,682.94. The S&P 500 slipped a fraction of a point to 1,240.57, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 7.3 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,182.83.The flat performance followed a strong gains last week as investors expressed optimism that Hurricane Katrina could spark a construction boom.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said investors were already beginning to look beyond the storm’s immediate impact and to refocus on fundamentals.“The stock market has been going slowly higher, but profits have been going up much faster,” leaving stocks looking relatively undervalued even though they are up sharply from cycle lows, Mr Paulsen said. “It says something about the strength of the undertow in this market that we could have Katrina and it barely made a dent.”Three new multi-billion dollar deals set the early tone. Ebay announced a deal to buy Skype, the European internet telephony group, for $2.6bn in cash and stock. Shares in the online auction site rose 0.8 per cent to $38.94.Siebel Systems, the business software group, jumped 12.7 per cent to $10.29 after a $10.66 per share offer from Oracle, a rival. The $5.9bn deal would create the world’s biggest customer relations management software company. Oracle rose 1.6 per cent to $13.49.Elsewhere, Wachovia, the banking and brokerage group, fell 1.6 per cent to $49.57 after it announced a $3.9bn decision to buy WFS Financial, an auto lending business. Westcorp, the bank that owns 84 per cent of WFS, rose 0.4 per cent to $61.58, while shares in WFS jumped 8 per cent o $70.15.Dynegy, the natural gas producer, fell 1.9 per cent to $4.66. The company had warned that two of its natural gas facilities were damaged by Katrina.Oil groups fell as crude prices continued to retreat from record highs. Sunoco, the oil refiner, fell 4.5 per cent to $76.09. Exxon Mobil fell 1.1 per cent to $62.52.Shares in Delta Air Lines fell 22.7 per cent to 85 cents amid reports that a bankruptcy filing may be imminent. Northwest Airlines, a rival that is also struggling to avoid bankruptcy, fell 3.3 per cent to $3.31 after talks with its striking mechanics collapsed.Ford Motorrose 0.2 per cent after the automaker struck a tentative labour deal with the Canadian Auto Workers union. Home Depot, the building supply store, rose 0.3 per cent to $41.33. Halliburton, the contractor, fell 3.8 per cent to $63.60.
1052;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-09-12T20:09:03Z;Oracle snaps up rival Siebel for $5.8bn;;Oracle, the US technology group, on Monday agreed to buy Siebel Systems for $5.85bn in cash and stock, sealing its second large acquisition in less than a year. The purchase will establish Oracle as the world's largest provider of customer relationship management (CRM) software and reunite two of Silicon Valley's most well-known executives.Thomas Siebel, who established Siebel in 1993 after a career at Oracle, will return to his former employer to help execute the merger.For Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, the acquisition will cement his reputation as a prolific dealmaker. In December, Oracle agreed to buy PeopleSoft for about $10.5bn, after winning an 18-month takeover battle, seeing off a high-profile, antitrust suit brought by the US Department of Justice.Mr Ellison on Monday suggested the company's attention would now be focused on integration. “I don't think you'll see another major acquisition any time soon,” he said. The purchase of Siebel will give Oracle access to 3.4m users and 4,000 corporate customers of its CRM software, which helps companies track sales, marketing and customer service.Both Oracle and Siebel said the tie-up was encouraged by a number of key customers, including General Electric. “There was a shift in market dynamics,” said Mr Siebel, who added that customers now preferred an “integrated family of applications that minimises their cost structure”. Although CRM is one of the fastest growing segments of the software business, Siebel had been struggling to compete, leading to lower profits and prompting a group of investors mostly hedge funds to press management into pursuing a sale.Mr Ellison shrugged off comments from one analyst who said Siebel was suffering from poor customer satisfaction. In Oracle's due diligence, Mr Ellison said: “Siebel customers seem to be quite happy with the product.”Siebel shareholders will receive $10.66 a share in cash for each Siebel share, unless they elect to receive Oracle stock. That price represents a 17 per cent premium to Siebel share price on Friday, which had already moved higher as investors bet that a takeover was near.Wall Street investors appeared to offer timid approval, sending Oracle shares 1.43 per cent higher closing Monday’s trading day at $13.47. The final price of the deal will be reduced by $2.2bn, the value of Siebel's cash.Oracle said the deal would enhance earnings in 2007 and contribute to its stated goal of lifting profits by 20 per cent per year. The acquisition would be funded using a combination of Siebel's cash, Oracle's cash, and borrowing of up to $3bn.Morgan Stanley advised Oracle, and Goldman Sachs advised Siebel.
1053;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-09-12T19:23:03Z;Marriage of former foes;;"For a merger that was all about managing relationships, Larry Ellison and Tom Siebel were putting their best face on getting along on Monday.The chief executives of Oracle and Siebel have been savage competitors over the years. Industry observers recounted on Monday how Tom Siebel once turned up with cuts and bruises on his face and joked that he had run into Larry Ellison in a bar.Then there was the time Larry Ellison summoned his rival to his office and ripped up in front of him a contract scheduled to be signed by the two companies, the Siebel Observer newsletter recalled.Many of Siebel’s employees including its founder are former Oracle workers and, although a major rationalisation of its corporate centre is certain, most should be returning to the fold.There had been a growing inevitability about the reunification.“This discussion has been going on between Siebel and Oracle for years,” said Mr Siebel. “Larry and I know each other very well. We started working together 23 years ago and so this is kind of a natural business combination that really is a
customer-driven event.”“Thanks to Tom Siebel for putting this deal together . . . I hope Tom is going to be working with us . . . for some number of years,” said Mr Ellison in a rare show of bonhomie.The timing of the deal, according to Oracle, had been set by its need to digest its acquisition of PeopleSoft – a $10.5bn deal finalised this year. But it has also picked off Siebel at a low point for the company – it lost its number one spot in business applications to larger German rival SAP last year and has seen its position eroded by a young upstart, Salesforce.com, in serving applications on-demand over the internet.“The same thing that happened to PeopleSoft will happen to Siebel, it will die,” predicted Marc Benioff, Salesforce chief executive, yesterday. “Siebel on Demand, a joint venture between Siebel and IBM, will be the first to be buried.”But Paul Hamerman, Forrester Research analyst, said the ability to earn regular payments for hosting customers’ software so they could run it remotely over the internet was a key attraction for Oracle.“Oracle needs an on-demand offering. It has had on-demand services but not really an on-demand application offering.“We are seeing a lot of acceptance of the subscription model, particularly in the mid-market,” he said.Oracle might have completed its major acquisitions in CRM (customer relationship management) to shore up its position against SAP and Microsoft, but it could still be looking for smaller deals in certain industries.“They want to go deeper into service-oriented industries, where they could establish leadership over SAP,” said Mr Hamerman, citing the banking, retail and telecoms sectors.While Mr Ellison may feel he has done enough dealing to strengthen business applications, he might want to expand into infrastructure software, application servers and business intelligence in the future, where SAP is still dominant.In the meantime, he has the job of integrating Siebel and selling CRM solutions to customers jaded by the lacklustre results achieved from older systems.“Oracle risks trying to integrate too many pieces at once,” said Octavio Marenzi of research company Celent.“At the same time, the CRM market has lost its bloom, with many large firms reluctant to engage in big CRM projects.”"
1054;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Wall St holds gains as Katrina fears ease;;"US equities on Wednesday held on to the gains posted in Tuesday’s rally as Wall Street increasingly took the view that the devastation from Hurricane Katrina might have a positive fall-out for the markets and the economy.US Treasury Secretary John Snow said late on Tuesday that Katrina could trim economic growth this year by half a percentage point. Meanwhile, a Labor Department report showed that productivity rose at a revised 1.8 per cent during the second quarter, down from the 2.2 per cent initially reported. Nonetheless, investors’ enthusiasm kept stocks steady.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 was up 2.97 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,236.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 44.26 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 10,633.50 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 5.2 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,172.03. On Tuesday, all three measures tacked on more than 1 per cent; the S&P 500 is up 2.4 per cent since August 26, the Friday before the hurricane.“It sounds perverse, but Katrina is going to be a boon for the economy,” said Bob Howard, who writes the Positive Patterns newsletter. “These people that are holding on to their Cisco, Oracle and Dell may have it wrong, but what is this going to do for cement, lumber and other building materials?”The morning’s heaviest loser was Altera. The semiconductor company’s stock fell 7.8 per cent to $20.11 after it warned that next year’s margins will be hurt by slowing sales of key products.Meanwhile, fast-food restaurant stocks posted strong gains after upgrades from analysts and bullish comments from Yum Brands about rising energy prices having a negligible effect on their sales. Shares of Yum, which operates KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell stores, added 6.1 per cent to $50.66. McDonald’s stock added 3.2 per cent to $33.70 and Wendy’s rose 3.1 per cent to $48.55.Hotel and casino operators were notching up a recovery after falling sharply last week. Harrah’s Entertainment added 5.4 per cent to $72.21, Starwood added 2.3 per cent to $59.80 and Hilton Hotels rose 2.7 per cent to $23.61.Buoyed by gains in restaurants and hotels, the S&P 500 consumer services index added 1.3 per cent.Hewlett-Packard rose after an analyst at UBS upgraded its shares to “buy” from “neutral”. The stock was up 0.7 per cent to $27.46.While the upgrade comes after the stock has already rallied 56 per cent from its 52-week low, UBS believes it has more room to run. Rival Dell eased 1.2 per cent to $35.12.Steelmakers, beaten down over the past few months amid falling steel prices, continued to rise on expectations that demand for steel in the US after Katrina would revive the group.US Steel added 2.2 per cent to $44.71, while Nucor added 1.6 per cent to $58.55.James Paulsen, the bullish strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, suggested the market’s resilience in the face of Katrina may “actually suggest how undervalued the equity market truly is”. But there are still many bears who believe the market is being overly calm about Katrina and equity valuations in general."
1055;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-08-23T18:32:57Z;Small players oil cogs of big search engines;;"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle was launched on Tuesday. Since Yahoo came up with its acronym in 1994, dozens of internet search services have been whittled down to a big five – Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, AOL and Ask Jeeves – supported by a cast of minor players.Those minor players bolstered their number on Tuiesday when Jeteye.com became the latest would-be Google.Smaller search engines remain a source of innovation and a target for companies seeking to enter the search and directory web services stage. Ask Jeeves was a distant fifth, but its purchase by Barry Diller’s IAC/InterActiveCorp for $1.85bn in March has extended its reach across IAC’s CitySearch local listings and travel websites.Blinkx, which is understood to be attracting the attention of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, boasts a number of consumer firsts in areas such as searching hard drives, video and podcasts – web-based audio file feeds.“We are small, but we were first with desktop search – that’s become a commodity technology and, in that area, all we can do is keep ahead for a while. But with audio and video it’s different, it’s a very special science,” said Suranga Chandratillake, chief technology officer and co-founderof Blinkx.The company uses technology from Autonomy, an enterprise search company that understands the context of what is being sought. Its multimedia abilities make it a good fit for a company such as News Corp with its extensive television and newspaper interests.Newcomer Jeteye is the brainchild of David Hayden, who was behind Magellan, a popular search engine sold to Excite in 1996. Jeteye sits on top of other search engines such as Google, and allows users to compile and share “jetpaks” of information and images they have found on subjects of interest. Jeteye is part search, part blog, part social network. part Wikipedia – an online encyclopaedia made up of contributions by its users.""I don't think [search companies] have been able to bring people into search,"" “A new infrastructure and new thinking about these 12bn-15bn pages out there and what we do with them is what is needed,” said Mr Hayden.His “shared search” concept allows users to e-mail jetpaks they have constructed to other users and invite additions, creating something of more value than a page of search results.collated reviews and adiscographyAdvertisers will be offered the opportunity to sponsor individual jetpaks, such as information about a rock band’s U2s latest tour, with “The idea of a mutually agreed, open means of sharing unstructured metadata is very appealing,” said Whit Andrews, analyst with Gartner, a research firm. “The question is whether Jeteye can generate the necessary user mass to make a successful business out of it.”Other recently launched search engines gaining ground with users that have been identified as possible acquisition targets include Icerocket.com, which specialises in blog searches, and Gigablast.com, a one-man assault on Google’s territory. The smaller players signal future directions in search.“We view the vertical players like Jeteye and Blinkx as a way of forecasting what the big players will do next,” said Su Li Walker, Yankee Group analyst. “Personalisation should come up in six to eight months, but mass market consumers are still going to turn to mass market players.”She argues that smaller search companies constantly have to innovate to survive and, in many cases, hope to be bought by a bigger player.But Mr Andrews says there is always the possibility of another Google emerging, as the internet evolves with multimedia and greater input from users.“The landscape will never be set on search. We thought it was done with [the 1995 search engine] AltaVista, but through a lot of mistakes it allowed Google to emerge and better it. Even now, there is no substantial barrier to switching from Google,” he said."
1056;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-08-05T12:32:48Z;The week in technology: Grabbing the tiger tails;;Grabbing the tiger tailsThe IT industry’s affair with India deepened as Oracle took control of I-Flex Solutions, the Mumbai-based developer of the world’s most popular bank software, for almost $1bn in the largest foreign takeover of an Indian technology company. Oracle spent $593m to acquire Citigroup’s 41 per cent stake in the company and a further $316m to buy another 20 per cent of I-Flex.India’s Business Standard said the deal would help take I-Flex to new heights, as Oracle already had relationships with most of the world’s biggest banks, while its new acquisition had been limited by its relationship with Citigroup.At the same time PC maker Dell also was also focusing on one of the new tiger economies - but as a market rather than a producer. Dell said it wants to double its market share in China to take 20 per cent of sales in the booming economy’s computer market.While it is already gaining market share there, Dell is third-ranked behind Lenovo, which has 25 per cent of the market after buying IBM’s PC business early this year, and fellow Chinese PC company Founder. In addition IDC analyst Brian Ma pointed out that consolidation in the Chinese PC market is bringing increasing pressure on margins and computer prices fell by 12 per cent last year.Microsoft appoints third-in-commandMicrosoft appointed a new chief operating officer to take what will effectively be the third-most senior role at the company, behind chairman Bill Gates and chief executive Steve Ballmer.Forty-year-old Kevin Turner, who had previously run the Sam’s Club division at retailer Wal-Mart, is the second high-level appointment by Microsoft this year from outside the technology industry. Earlier this year Chris Liddell was recruited from International Paper to be Microsoft’s chief financial officer.It is the first time in almost three years that Microsoft has had a chief operating officer after the last person in the job, Rick Belluzzo, left less than a year into the role. Belluzzo admitted to having other aspirations and told Computerworld at the time of his departure that the re-organization of the business indicated that he simply wasn’t needed. But Microsoft watchers at the time voiced a belief that there “wasn’t room for a number three” at the company, as Directions on Microsoft analyst Matt Rosoff told CNET back in 2002.Mozilla’s Firefox sparks Browser War memoriesAugust 9 marks the 10th anniversary of Netscape’s IPO, which many consider to be the launch date of the dotcom era of countless optimistic listings and rollercoaster technology stocks. While the stockmarket bubble it created is just a sad memory for those who were burnt, the growth of internet use continues apace, with the one-billionth user predicted to log onto the internet for the first time around mid-August.Ironically, the Netscape anniversary almost coincided with an announcement from Mozilla, the non-profit organisation behind the web browser Firefox, that it would set up a commercial unit to boost partnerships and marketing of the software.Firefox’s success in recent months has seen Microsoft’s market share begin to fall for the first time since it beat Netscape into submission several years ago. “Hippie” Mozilla, as The Register called it, was going back to work for the Man, and the consensus was that the legendary ‘Browser Wars’ of the late 1990s were set to begin all over again.Search industry ups the paceMeanwhile movement in the web search industry continued at the breakneck pace reminiscent of the heady dotcom days. The activity is mostly around search marketing - the text-only advertisements that are placed alongside relevant search results and have quickly snowballed into a sizeable industry.First AskJeeves, the search challenger that was recently bought by Barry Diller’s InterActiveCorp (IAC), decided to ditch Google and go it alone on contextual advertising. Then in another swipe at search king Google, Yahoo said it would launch an advertising network for the blogosphere, CNet reported. Yahoo already owns Overture, the pioneer of placing text-based advertisements next to relevant search results. Search marketing, as it is known, has become a huge industry and is the main revenue earner for web search leader Google.Not content to rest on its laurels, Yahoo a few days later launched a beta version of Audio Search, a website which it said would search some 50 million files on the internet.technology@ft.com
1057;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-08-02T19:56:34Z;Oracle to take control of India's I-Flex;;Oracle is to invest nearly $1bn to gain control of I-Flex Solutions, the Mumbai-based manufacturer of the world's best-selling software for banks, in the largest cross-border takeover of an Indian technology company.Oracle will acquire Citigroup's 41 per cent stake in I-Flex for $593m and invest $316m in a mandatory open offer to gain up to 20 per cent more of the equity of the company, which was set up by the US bank nearly two decades ago.The transaction is the latest in a trend that has seen global technology companies, such as IBM, or US private equity funds gain control of growing Indian companies in the services, product or call-centre segments.Oracle's first big acquisition in a country where it has a large and expanding software development centre, is designed to boost the US technology company's applications business by adding industry specific expertise.I-Flex, which will continue to operate as a stand-alone, listed entity, designs, produces and services software used across a bank's operations.Citigroup accounts for 40 per cent of I-Flex's revenues, and that relationship will be unaffected by the changed ownership, says I-Flex.The share price of I-Flex, which went public in Mumbai in 2002, closed 8.24 per cent higher at Rs896.15. The transaction was announced after Indian markets closed.Charles Phillips, Oracle president, said that although I-Flex had been the foremost global supplier of application software for banks since 2002, large “banks were not prepared to take a bet on a smaller company - now we've got a powerful combination”.He said the US giant would continue to look for more “domain expertise that allows us to get beyond the back office and deeper into industries”.Mr Rajesh Hukku, chairman and managing director of I-Flex, which earned net income of $46m on sales that climbed 42 per cent to $261m in the fiscal year ending in March, said the Oracle relationship would give I-Flex access to the world's biggest banks.FINANCIAL TIMESEND
1058;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-07-27T10:08:23Z;Packing in processing power;;Size matters in computing and doubling the size of the underlying architecture of microprocessors from 32 bit to 64 bit inevitably means bigger and faster computers. But do we need them?In terms of raw technology, 64 bit computers can address far more direct memory and process much larger instructions than the current 32 bit systems. A computer based on a 32 bit architecture can address up to four gigabytes of memory – while a 64 bit system can, theoretically, address about 18m gigabytes.Back-end server computers have increasingly used an expensive version 64 bit technology for the past decade. But the 64 bit revolution is now making inroads into the mass market. Earlier this year, Microsoft released the first 64 bit version of its Windows XP desktop operating system and Intel announced a 64 bit microprocessor – the EM64T. Rival AMD also has low cost 64 bit Opteron microprocessors in production.These advances lower the entry barrier for 64 bit computing. The end result for computer users is the possibility of high powered computing at mass market prices. Applications that benefit from the extra power include large database applications, multimedia, modelling, simulation and complex risk calculations.“It means smaller companies can get large, expensive applications they could not afford before. Large database products such as Oracle and IBM’s DB2 are 64 bit compatible and with the new low cost 64 bit technology they can get mainframe levels of performance,” says Michael Hjalsted, server marketing director for Europe at server-builder Unisys.He goes on to say, however, that software – particularly application software is still catching up with the hardware advances: “Just running a 64 bit computer is not enough. The operating system and the application software need to be changed to gain the full benefit.”Unisys, like its rivals in the server market, has spotted the potential for low cost 64 bit computing and begun to build a range of server products based on the technology. Other manufacturers such as IBM and Hewlett Packard are also offering server systems based on low-cost 64 bit technology from Intel and AMD, alongside their proprietary 64 bit systems.The change to 64 bit could be tricky. When the world moved from 16 bit to 32 bit systems in the mid 1990s, it took a few years for applications software to take advantage of the new hardware. Software developers including Microsoft and Oracle had to maintain compatibility across both architectures. The same problem will probably delay development of 64 bit applications.The transition is further complicated by two streams of 64 bit technology emerging from Intel. It launched its high end Itanium 64 bit processor in the early 1990s and still continues to develop this product. The Itanium is not backwards compatible with 32 bit systems. The EM64T is a development of Intel’s 32 bit Pentium processor technology and can operate in both 32 bit and 64 bit modes – but it is not compatible with the Itanium.“Software developers will have to make a conscious decision to go to Itanium. Some specialised applications will be able to take advantage of the performance. Database systems using SQL server, for example. But Intel is saddling itself with a positioning challenge and could find it difficult to maintain interest in Itanium,” says Andy Butler, a server group vice-president at researcher Gartner.“The Unix migration market will also stimulate 64 bit development but that is more likely to be based on Linux than on Windows,” he adds.The open source Linux operating system is increasingly being seen as a way forward for organisations currently using the ageing Unix operating system.[Unisys notes that a growing number of its customers are taking this path:”About five per cent of our customers are using Linux and 10-15 per cent of those are now on 64-bit systems. We expect this to keep rising,” says Mr Hjalsted of Unisys.A 64-bit version of Linux was released at the end of 2004 and it is widely expected that this will appeal to a growing number of Unix users looking for a way forward. The combination of lower software costs and lower processor costs will be hard to resist.Linux will also have an impact on the desktop market - although it is unlikely to eclipse Microsoft’s continuing dominance. ]Software applications are the key to progress for 64 bit on the desktop, however. The demand for smooth graphical user interfaces, for example, helped the push from 16 bit to 32 bit. A comparable “killer application” will force the pace to move to 64 bit – eventually.Meanwhile, businesses will need to start planning for the transition. Researcher Gartner sees this beginning at the end of 2005 and expects 64 bit computing to be mainstream by 2007.“The new 64 bit chips enable customers to move from 32 bit computing at their own pace. IT departments do not want two different populations of users – one on 32 bit and the other on 64 bit,” explains Tikiri Wandragalla, a server consultant at IBM.He sees the first wave of 64 bit applications emanating from specialist developers: “It is about finding the sweet spot for application programming – those tasks that stretch 32 bit hardware. The software stack is moving to lower cost computers and niche players in areas such as multimedia will see the opportunities of the increased power.”Mainstream software developers are also taking up the 64 bit cause. Martin Tenk head of technology at SAP UK sees scope to use 64 bit power to improve applications software: “We think 64 bit technology is great because of the performance advantages. In analytical applications and large complex queries it really makes a difference.”He adds that the main advantages are likely to be in server computers: “Microsoft’s 64 bit XP operating system is good for the user – but the real power is in analysing large queries and high performance business analytics. You can look at vast amounts of data.”Later this year, Microsoft is expected to release a 64 bit version of its Visual Studio – the main development tool for Windows applications. This will stimulate migration of applications to 64 bit and create opportunities for new products which can use the extra power.
1059;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-07-21T19:51:58Z;Lex: SAP;;If form follows function, SAP is in top shape. True to form, it has once again beaten forecasts. That increases comfort that it can further strengthen its position as enterprise software moves towards a more service-based architecture.Unlike arch-rival Oracle, SAP already offers a compelling vision of how to get there. It argues that the challenge is to help companies adapt and innovate business processes, rather than just trying to put all data on the same databases.SAP is also starting to reap the benefits from embracing web services fairly early on. The weakness in Germany mainly appears to reflect uncertainty ahead of the looming elections, especially among public sector and financial clients. That augurs well for the second half. The rest of Europe already seems to be experiencing a long-awaited recovery, reducing SAP's dependence on growth in the US. Not that it is running out of steam across the Atlantic. Despite aggressive discounting by several rivals, SAP's claims that it has continued to gain market share are credible. Oracle will no doubt fight back as it digests recent acquisitions, but could face an uphill struggle.The snag is that SAP's shares will need more than just another round of forecast-beating to regain momentum. To be sure, SAP's guidance looks even more cautious than usual. But, with the shares already trading at 30 times this year's earnings, it is hard to see them extending their premium to peers further, let alone generating any absolute returns.
1060;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-07-21T17:14:30Z;SAP plans to ramp up its aggressive hiring;;SAP, the German software group, said on Thursday it would expand its already aggressive hiring plans for this year, as it beat analysts' expectations with strong second-quarter results.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said SAP would add up to 4,500 people to its workforce, rather than the previously announced 3,000, to increase product development. It plans to expand its recruitment activities to low-income countries such as India.SAP's “year of investments” comes as its battle with Oracle of the US for the corporate software market intensifies. Both companies have launched incentive programmes recently which are designed to lure their rival's customers.Mr Kagermann said he was “very happy” with SAP's Safe Passage plan which is aimed at PeopleSoft and Retek customers unsettled by Oracle's acquisitions of those companies.SAP said it signed 21 more deals under the programme during the first half and it added that the pipeline was “doubling every month”.The company, which is Europe's largest software provider, topped expectations with 16 per cent growth in pro forma operating profit to €496m ($603m) for the three months to June 30. Software licence sales, a key indicator of future growth prospects, came in at €576m, also up 16 per cent and well above the 10-12 per cent growth SAP predicted for the full year.SAP's decision to raise neither this forecast nor the guidance for margin growth of up to 0.5 percentage points disappointed analysts. SAP's shares fell 1.4 per cent in Frankfurt to €145.5.Mr Kagermann cited uncertainties over the euro/dollar exchange rate and said pricing remained “extremely tough”.However, many analysts felt the company was being overly cautious. “[SAP] is being deliberately conservative to avoid the kind of ramping up of licence sales expectations we have seen in the past,” said Adam Shepherd, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. The figures also showed an unexpected weakness in Germany where licence sales collapsed by 13 per cent as customers in the public sector and the financial services industry deferred spending decisions.
1061;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-07-21T07:51:10Z;SAP gains share in crucial US market;;SAP, the business software group, on Thursday reported strong growth for the second quarter this year, driven by gains in the crucial US market, but did not raise its outlook for the rest of the year.The US, where SAP competes with Oracle, was the software maker’s fastest growing market, where it continued to gain market share from its rival.“Due to strong software revenue results in each region, we continued to gain share against our peer group and extend our lead in the US market,” said Henning Kagermann, chief executive.But hopes the group would raise its forecast for the full year, based on the 16 per cent growth in software revenues, were dashed when SAP said it was sticking to its earlier forecasts for annual growth in software revenues of 10-12 per cent.SAP said its forecasts were based on a euro-dollar exchange rate of $1.30 to €1, the same rate used at the end of the first quarter. The dollar has strengthened against the euro since then and there were hopes this would help lift SAP’s earnings. The shares reacted with a 2.2 per cent fall at the open in Frankfurt to €144.31.Second quarter software revenues, which are used as an indicator of future profitability, rose to €576m from €497m. An average of 21 analysts polled by Reuters forecast software revenues of €562m.Group second quarter revenue growth accelerated to 13 per cent from 11 per cent in the first quarter to €2.02bn.Pro-forma operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges, rose 16 per cent to €496m euros, exceeding the average forecast of €468m.
1062;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-07-01T16:28:05Z;Europe higher after good week for telecoms;;"European stocks started the new quarter on a positive note as investors shrugged off Thursday’s US interest rate rise and indications from the Federal Reserve that further tightenings were in the pipeline.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed yesterday at 1,149.75, up 0.7 per cent on the day and 0.7 per cent higher over the week.The benchmark rose 5 per cent in the second quarter of the year and 9.6 per cent in the first half of 2005.Altana, the German drugs group, stood out on Friday with a drop of nearly 16 per cent to €39.90 after Pfizer of the US terminated a collaboration between the two on the respiratory drug Daxas.Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein downgraded Altana from “hold” to “sell”.“We estimate Daxas is worth up to €15 per share - although the product is still in development, the fact that Pfizer doesn’t want it should be viewed extremely negatively,” said analyst Melissa Hartley.Telecoms stocks were among the week’s best performers after France Telecom unveiled plans to more than double its dividend this year while reducing debt.FT shares ended Friday at €24.27, up 7.1 per cent on the week.“Despite its recent rally, valuation remains very attractive and some important uncertainties have been removed or clarified; we reiterate our outperform rating,” said Goldman Sachs.Elsewhere in the sector, Deutsche Telekom rose 4.7 per cent to €15.42 while Telecom Italia added 3.2 per cent to €2.60.Dutch operator KPN gained 4.5 per cent to €6.80 after it agreed to buy mobile operato Telfort in a deal worth up to €1.12bn.There were contrasting fortunes for technology stocks. SAP, Europe’s biggest business software group, rose 3.1 per cent to €145.05 after US rival Oracle reported strong quarterly results.But ASML, the chipmaking equipment manufacturer, fell 2.7 per cent to €13.12 after Credit Suisse First Boston cut its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “underperform”.The week’s best individual performance came from Opap, the Greek gaming group, despite confirmation yesterday that the government would sell down its stake in the company.Earlier in the week, Deutsche Bank raised its target price for the lottery operator from €23 to €24.2, and reiterated its “buy” recommendation. Opap shares rose 9.3 per cent to €23.26.ABB was the biggest blue-chip faller over the week. The Zurich-listed engineering group cut its margin targets for 2005 and warned that second-quarter net profits would be “significantly” lower than in the first quarter.The shares ended the week at SFr8.28, down 6.7 per cent.ASF, the French toll road operator, climbed 7.9 per cent to €47.58 after the French government said it was planning to sell its remaining shares in the group.Construction group Vinci, which owns 23 per cent of ASF, rose 6.1 per cent to €70.10 on rumours that it might be interested in acquiring the rest of the company."
1063;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-06-29T20:47:51Z;PeopleSoft boosts Oracle sales;;Oracle's acquisition of rival PeopleSoft and strong demand for business and database software helped the world's second-largest software maker report better than expected fourth-quarter net profits and revenues.The California-based software group said results were driven by strong sales of its flagship database products and better than expected sales of enterprise applications software, including PeopleSoft products.The results, coupled with bullish comments about the outlook, helped Oracle's shares close up 74 cents almost 6 per cent to $13.57 in New York on Wednesday.“We are very optimistic about [the outlook],” said Safra Catz, co-president, who noted the US market was particularly strong.Net income for the three months ended May 31, the first full quarter since Oracle completed the $10.6bn (€8.8bn) PeopleSoft deal in January, increased by 3.2 per cent to $1.02bn, or 20 cents a share. Excluding one-off items, Oracle reported earnings of 26 cents per share. Revenue for the quarter increased by 26 per cent to $3.88bn from $3.08bn a year ago.New licence sales for Oracle's core database and middleware products a closely watched indicator of future earnings potential increased by 16 per cent to $1.26bn, while new licence revenues for enterprise applications increased by 52 per cent to $350m. Service revenues climbed 35 per cent to $755m.Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, has spent $11.2bn on four purchases this year, mostly designed to boost the company's position in the enterprise applications market. The results on Wednesday were seen by analysts as evidence that the strategy is paying off.After buying PeopleSoft, Oracle made several other smaller acquisitions, including spending $670m in April on Retek, a retail software maker. Mr Ellison said Oracle would continue to look for acquisitions, but only if companies contributed to higher operating margins.In the meantime, Ms Catz said the integration of PeopleSoft was going smoothly. “The rapid integration of PeopleSoft into our business contributed to the strong growth in both applications sales and profits that we saw in the quarter,” she said.The PeopleSoft deal vaulted Oracle to second place in the $23.6bn enterprise applications market behind Germany's SAP, which has about 43 per cent of the global market.Oracle's core database business, which accounts for the bulk of its revenues and profits, also performed well. Mr Ellison claimed Oracle was closing the gap with IBM, the market leader. Oracle said it expected full-year 2006 earnings of 78-81 cents a share on revenue of $14.2bn-$14.4bn, slightly higher than analysts had been forecasting.
1064;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-06-29T20:37:20Z;Oracle fails to lift to Wall Street techs;;Strong quarterly results from Oracle failed to give technology stocks a lift on Wednesday as the broader market eased back, awaiting the outcome of Thursday’s Federal Reserve interest rate meeting and ignoring a further decline in crude oil prices.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 10,374.48, while the S&P 500 index retreated 0.1 per cent to 1,199.85. The Nasdaq Composite was less than 0.1 per cent lower at 2,068.89.Oracle, the software company, saw its shares add 5.8 per cent to $13.57 after it reported a 3.2 per cent rise in net profits, thanks to the effects of its takeover of rival PeopleSoft.There was less good news for Sigmatel, a maker of components for the ubiquitous iPod music player made by Apple. Sigmatel shares edged off 0.8 per cent to $17.60 in spite of news that it had cut its second quarter earnings earnings and revenue outlook. Lower forecasts hurt Symbol Technologies shares, which gave up 7.2 per cent to $9.72 as the barcode scanner and handheld device maker announced a restructuring.Shares in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose 12.9 per cent to $305.95 after reports that the futures exchange had made a bid for its cross-town rival the Chicago Board of Trade.Research in Motion, meanwhile, was 0.9 per cent off at $75.91 ahead of its quarterly earnings announcement after the close.Among insurers, American International Group shares gained 6 per cent to $58.48 after the world’s largest insurer by capitalisation reported a sharp increase in quarterly profits.But AIG’s gain failed to pull the Dow industrials higher. Many of the average’s 30 components were in the red, led by ExxonMobil, which fell 1.1 per cent to $58.44, and Walt Disney, down 1.7 per cent to $25.43.General Mills, a cereal maker, reported increased net profits, but its earnings missed analysts’ expectations. Its shares gave up 6.7 per cent to $47.21. The company was cited, alongside Kraft Foods and France’s Groupe Danone, in a lawsuit alleging dairy makers engaged in false advertising by telling customers that milk helps with weight loss.Kraft shares eased 0.7 per cent to $31.71 while Danone’s US-listed shares were 0.6 per cent lower at $17.61.Great Lakes Chemical lost 0.9 per cent to $31.55, while Constellation Brands eased 1 per cent to $30.52 following news of changes to the S&P 500 index. Great Lakes faces eviction from the index that has billions in mutual fund capital benchmarked against it, while Constellation stock is expected to see buying by managers forced to add it to their portfolio as it joins the benchmark.Shares in TheStreet.com gained 7.9 per cent to $3.40 after the online business media group decided to shut down its investment research unit.Monsanto lost 7.1 per cent to $63 after the agricultural products company announced an 81 per cent decline in profits due to a charge, while its earnings forecasts fell short of analysts’ estimates.Johnson & Johnson stock eased 0.9 per cent to $65.46 on talk regulators would warn of dangerous side-effects for one of its drugs.Away from corporate news, stocks appeared to have entered the two-day ‘pre-Fed vigil’ during which activity slows down before the US central bank anounces the outcome of a monetary-policy meeting. Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and colleagues are widely expected to decide a new quarter-point increase in benchmark interest rates.In other economic news, the US government announced the final reading of first-quarter gross domestic product growth, which came at 3.8 per cent. The data included a downward revision of an inflation indicator watched by the Fed, which could fan hopes that the US central bank was approaching the end of its cycle of monetary policy tightening.The pre-Fed vigil was also evident in the lack of reaction to weekly data on petroleum inventories in the US. Rising stockpiles of crude and fuels sent futures lower on the Nymex but stocks opted to switch obsession from oil to the Fed.
1065;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-06-29T10:28:19Z;Rudder steers a new course for Microsoft;;"There is something new in the air at Microsoft; a different methodology in a company renowned for its market dominance and belief in its own way of doing things.For corporate whizzkid Eric Rudder the way ahead is all about discovering what customers want and creating the right partnerships to provide solutions which meet universal needs to reduce costs and increase efficiency.Yet some rivalries run deep – discussions about working with others and reaching communities through partners is hardly likely to include old rival Oracle or the competing open source architecture from Linux.As Microsoft’s senior vice president for Server and Tools, Mr Rudder based himself in Paris last August and has spent nearly a year travelling around Europe and beyond.Quite why Microsoft would send so senior a member of its hierarchy abroad for so long was a question Mr Rudder explained away by emphasising the need to reach out.The rationale was apparently to discover how the company works with partners and in the community.“There is a lot we can do with partners to enable and invest in their development,” he says.“Partners are very important especially at the high end. We co-operate with Sun and have close relationships with SAP and Siebel – our customers decided they wanted to use Office as the front end to SAP products.“The future is to unlock the value of data, the information is there but may not be accessible when and where it is wanted. The challenge is to get the best end user and front end software integrated to the back end systems,” he says.“Interoperability is essential and the key to integration is to embrace web services standards. The task is to merge the best of Windows with the best of the web to create a ‘click once to play’.”That merger is enabled by creating a link between developers and IT professionals and making it easier for them to create business applications. Systems need to be simplified suggests Mr Rudder, and the computing environment made more open to give users the freedom to play without putting PCs at risk.In the high end server market, few want to be locked into one supplier; they want a quick, demonstrable return on investment and clear business benefits.In the digital world, downward pressure on margins is forcing customers to reduce costs by integrating and rationalising their systems to create single platforms.Denying he might be in line for a step up in the company or a move into a policy-making role, Mr Rudder confesses to loving the power of software and the technical side of the enterprise.Under his leadership Microsoft’s server unit has grown between 15 and 20 per cent each year and records annual sales of $10bn – third quarter revenue growth was up 12 per cent over the same period last year.His ambition is to solve the long term problems of handling and storing digital data and to cut costs without compromising performance; to develop products at low entry barriers which are easy to get up and running and to deploy. Mr Rudder describes Microsoft as a ‘low priced high volume’, customer centric company which delivers enterprise computing needs at 50 per cent less than competitors and which is already able to reduce the number of enterprise servers by 30 per cent or more.Microsoft has what it describes as a vision for empowering information workers in what it calls ‘The New World of Work’.The programme aims to change the ways in which IT professionals define and implement infrastructure and give them the tools to deliver the applications needed by their business.This is about freeing up the time of chief information officers and IT staff, 70 per cent of which is spent on maintaining existing systems rather than creating new ones.Systems should support the way business and its people work, where decisions are made on logical policy grounds rather than being circumscribed by the physical limitations of the computing platform, he says Completely secure access anywhere and at anytime is a given. Automating routine task management functions takes some of the costs out of the department.Creating systems to make it easier for desktop users to solve routine problems eliminates 50 per cent of requests into the help desk thereby freeing staff to handle more complex issues.Included in the new systems are Longhorn – the next version of Windows, a new Office 12 and Exchange Server together with multiple systems to support mobile devices, security, and integration.Recognising demand for integrated security, Microsoft is in the final stages of buying American software developer Sybari which has created a system to protect messaging and collaboration servers. The Antigen software uses eight different anti-virus agents to identify and isolate viruses, worms and spam, 90 per cent of which are estimated to be delivered by email. Although the plans are not yet final, the goal is to integrate Sybari software into servers and deliver it to customers as fast as possible.The ultimate message from Mr Rudder is one based on the business imperative to deliver solutions which can be integrated into legacy systems and which bring developers and IT professionals together to create innovative business applications."
1066;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-06-22T20:57:16Z;Microsoft licence fees attacked;;Technology groups have attacked Microsoft for demanding excessive licensing fees from companies that wish to make their products work more smoothly with computers and servers driven by Windows, the US software group's operating system.In an antitrust ruling by the European Commission last year, Microsoft was forced to license sensitive information about Windows to its rivals. The regulator hoped that by forcing Microsoft to disclose a string of so-called communication protocols, it would enable rival companies better to compete.However, opponents of the group now say Microsoft's proposed terms are unfair, claiming they would have to pay Microsoft up to 8.5 per cent of the revenues they make on the products they developed.Thomas Vinje, a Brussels-based lawyer for Clifford Chance who represents a business association that includes IBM, Nokia and Oracle, said the royalties demanded by the group were untenable. He said they would destroy the desired effect of the Commission's antitrust sanction, and could constitute a new breach of EU antitrust law.He said “The royalties demanded by Microsoft thus are clearly not at a commercial rate, let alone fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory”. Microsoft strongly denied this, arguing that the protocols contained “some of Microsoft's most valuable server technology innovations”. There was no danger of excessive fees, because an independent monitor would guarantee that prices remained “commercially practicable.”An official said: “There is a price list, and if people feel it doesn't work, then we can sit down and talk and if that doesn't work they can turn to the monitoring trustee.”Details of the draft licensing agreement were published on Microsoft's website on Monday, and in spite of the hostile reception, represent an improvement on terms outlined earlier. According to the group's “pricing summary”, companies wishing to license all protocols would have to give 8.5 per cent of their revenues on a new product to Microsoft. That drops to 7.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent if companies chose to license only some of the protocols. In any case, Microsoft's royalties will not exceed $950 for an individual server.Mr Vinje said: “The royalties demanded by Microsoft reflect not any innovative value of the protocols, but rather the strategic value flowing from the ability to prevent interoperability.”Microsoft's proposals on implementing the Commission's antitrust ruling are being tested with market participants. Neelie Kroes the competition commissioner, will then decide whether to accept Microsoft's plan.
1067;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-06-22T16:48:15Z;Europe hits new three-year highs;;European shares hit three-year highs on Wednesday, with technology stocks spearheading the advance.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.36 points, or 0.1 per cent to 1,146.41, while Germany’s tech-heavy Xetra-Dax index finished 0.3 per cent higher at 4,619.60.SAP, the German business software producer, rose 2.6 per cent to €142.80 after Larry Ellison, chief executive of US rival Oracle, said he aimed to pursue a take-over of SAP in the next two to four years. SAP itself on Wednesday announced the acquisition of Lighthammer, a privately-owned US software group.Mobile phone maker Nokia rose 1 per cent to €14.37 following mixed broker reports. UBS upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral” while Deutsche bank cut its rating to “hold” from “buy”.“While we expect the company to deliver a strong set of results in the second quarter and to enjoy a strong 2005 in general, we believe that these positives are largely reflected in the share price today,” Deutsche said.UBS stressed that their upgrade was “not a call on second-quarter results”.Semiconductor makers also had a positive session, with Infineon rising 2.1 per cent to €7.77, ASML 1.5 per cent to €13.86 and STMicroelectronics 1.1 per cent to €13.40.Oil stocks slipped after data showed that US crude inventories had fallen for a third consecutive week. France’s Total slipped 0.3 per cent to €193.70, Royal Dutch fell 0.2 per cent to €51.85 and Eni gave up 0.2 per cent to €21.23.Shares in DaimlerChrysler, the German-American car manufacturer, fell 0.4 per cent to €34.13 on concerns that its Chrysler US arm faces the same problems that prompted Ford to issue its fourth profit warning this year on Tuesday.Investors were advised to take profits in DaimlerChrysler by Credit Suisse First Boston.“Although dollar strength should support the shares, with US risks rising, we remove the ‘trading buy’ view on DaimlerChrysler, preferring BMW or VW,” said Harald Hendriksen at CSFB.The dollar’s strength against the euro has had a significant impact on European carmakers. Earlier this month, Audi, VW’s luxury division, revealed that every one per cent drop in the euro against the greenback increased annual profits €20m.Volkswagen shares rose 1.5 per cent to €38.35 and BMW added 1.1 per cent to €37.42. Shares in Continental, the German auto parts and tyre manufacturer, rose 1.7 per cent to €61.17.Delhaize, the Belgian retailer, was up 3.3 per cent to €51.15 after JPMorgan rated the company a “buy”. “Since the share price drop on May 11, Delhaize has underperformed the US food retailers,” the broker said. “We think this performance gap is overdone especially considering the exchange rate move of 6 per cent, which would imply a 4 per cent positive earnings impact for Delhaize.”Shares inDeutsche Postbank fell 0.4 per cent to €40.19 despite positive analyst reports. “We believe its excess cash and its lowest cost provider status will ensure it continues to be the consolidator of choice in the market.” said CSFB analyst Ivan Vatchkov.Luxury goods groups were mostly higher in the wake of Tuesday’s strong data on Swiss watch exports. Exports rose by 29 per cent to SFr1.03bn in the year to May, the highest rate of monthly growth in five years.“Given that we have now seen two months of strong data we would expect the hard luxury names to react positively, in particular Swatch and Richemont, that tend to track the Swiss watch exports trend more closely,” said JP Morgan. “Richemont remains our top pick in the hard luxury segment.”Richemont shares rose 0.6 per cent to SFr43.95, while LVMH added 0.4 per cent to €63.95 and Christian Dior gained 1 per cent to €64.05. Swatch, however, slipped 0.7 per cent to SFr175.20 after gaining in the previous session.Hennes and Mauritzfell 3.1 per cent to SKr263.5. Sales growth at Swedish fashion retailer lifted second-quarter earnings as the company opened 127 new stores and improved margins.The company’s 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits was in line with expectations and the dip in the shares was likely to be the result of profit-taking after their 16 per cent rise so far this year, according to traders.
1068;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
1069;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-06-15T07:42:34Z;Dan Gillmor: Take your partners for the IT dance;;Seven years ago, Apple Computer introduced a line of Macintosh computers based on the Motorola G3 microprocessor. Apple aired several biting TV advertisements claiming that the G3 was twice as speedy as the Pentium II microprocessor, then the central brains of most machines in the Windows computing world.Times changed. So did Apple, which on June 6 announced that Intel, maker of the Pentium chips, would be its new supplier.And when Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, embraced his counterpart at Intel, Paul Otellini at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, the world witnessed an enduring reality in the high-velocity technology business: yesterday’s rivalries are today’s alliances.This is not exactly shocking. We see it all the time elsewhere, especially politics, where two people will slash and burn each other’s records and reputations, and then, after the election, act as if they’d been best of friends all along.They do so for good reasons. Only the most narrow-minded ideologues fail to understand that it’s possible to be bitterly opposed on most issues but find common ground on a few - because human beings can disagree in good faith.The resemblances among top politicians and major technology figures have always been striking. Egotism, bordering on megalomania, is common. So, frequently, is the conviction that one is doing something to change the world, quite possibly for the better.The shifting alliances in technology seem less rooted in a sense of mutual respect, however, than in the need to get a temporary advantage. In a field that moves so quickly, that can be worth an enormous amount. One can rattle off a long list of such alliances. Intel’s relationship with Microsoft, for example, has been the basis for the so-called “Win-tel” desktop computing platform.Less appreciated has been the frequent tension between the two companies, which became briefly visible when a former Intel executive testified against Microsoft in the big antitrust trial in the late 1990s. Consider also Mark Benioff, former protégé of Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison and now head of his own Web applications company, Salesforce.com. Mr Ellison was an investor in Mr Benioff’s company, but Oracle is now aggressively moving into Salesforce’s territory.The most famous shifting alliance is the one that helped turn the PC into a mass-market phenomenon: IBM’s partnership with Microsoft in the 1980s, when Big Blue shipped its PCs with Microsoft DOS.The partnership was better for Microsoft which proved smarter, more nimble and far less interested in playing by the old rules, while IBM squandered its position and ultimately ceded control of desktop computing.The one-time alliance had turned seriously sour by the 1990s, when Microsoft and IBM became enemies in operating systems. Today, IBM is the principal big-company sponsor of the open-source software movement that continues to dog the Microsoft monopoly.Yet when IBM was selling PCs, it was one of the highest-volume dealers of computers pre-loaded with Windows. Meanwhile IBM and Microsoft are collaborating on some key web standards.The made-up word for this kind of relationship is co-opetition.Making such arrangements work can be tricky. Companies have to seal off one set of workers from another. One engineer may know details about a competitor’s technology but be prohibited, via a non-disclosure agreement, from telling the person inside his own company who most wants to know those details.There’s always a whiff of hypocrisy when former enemies become best friends on the very issues over which they’d fought. Apple finesses its former contempt for Intel by saying the chip maker’s road map to the future is now compelling, but those years of scorn will remain in people’s memories.Or maybe they will not. Politicians, at least in America, have learned that their best friend is the typical voter’s short attention span. Business people count on this as well.As someone who long ago publicly suggested that Apple move to the Intel architecture, I’m naturally in favor of this move.As someone who long ago publicly suggested that Apple move to the Intel architecture - an arena teeming with competition from not just Intel but also Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and others - I’m in favour of this move. (As an underdog, Apple might have picked AMD as its new supplier, but Apple is being rational if cold-blooded.)Will the alliance last? Perhaps. But recall Mr Jobs’ keynote speech at the Worldwide Developers Conference just two years ago. That was the day Apple announced the G5 chip, made by its friend and partner, IBM. The road map was also clear that day.Dan Gillmor is founder of Grassroots Media Inc. His website is bayosphere.com
1070;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-06-07T18:02:45Z;Siebel strife highlights Silicon Valley shift;;Tom Siebel, briefly one of the most successful entrepreneurs the software industry has produced, will face a fractious group of shareholders at his company's annual meeting on Wednesday. But while the decibel level will be high, Mr Siebel is likely to remain unscathed.The clamour that has built up around Siebel Systems, which makes the customer relationship management software that many companies use to manage their salesforces and maintain details of customer relationships, highlights a shift that has brought an unfamiliar group of stock market investors to Silicon Valley.“A lot of the [Siebel] stock is in the hands of very aggressive institutions,” says Herbert Denton, a veteran activist investor whose firm, Providence Capital, has agitated for a change in Siebel's strategy. “We are seeing the confluence of activist investors like us with aggressive hedge funds,” which usually look to take profits on their investments far more quickly, he says.The clearest sign of that change is that Fidelity, the mutual fund group, once Siebel's largest investor, has sold 28.4m shares this year, nearly halving its stake to 5.7 per cent. At the same time, Tudor Investment, the hedge fund run by Paul Tudor Jones, has amassed a 4.7 per cent holding. With corporate raider Carl Icahn also a new shareholder, though with less than 1 per cent based on the most recent filing, Mr Siebel faces a group of shareholders who are far removed from the normal growth-hungry investors seen in the software industry.Behind the shift lies a renewed slump at a company that came to symbolise the boom in corporate technology spending in the 1990s.Mr Siebel presided over rapid growth that took the company's revenues to more than $2bn by the end of the decade. Two years of free fall followed a crisis that Mr Siebel appeared to have turned round last year, partly by handing over his chief executive duties to Mike Lawrie, a former IBM executive. The slump resumed this year, however, prompting Mr Siebel to force out Mr Lawrie.With more than $2bn of cash on hand and steady cashflow from its maintenance and services business, Siebel has become a juicy target for a more activist band of investors.Other shareholders are more prepared to give Siebel's new chief executive, George Shaheen, time to try to fix the company. “They are not in a mature market or a mature industry,” says Paul Marrkand, a portfolio manager at Putnam Investments. “They have to figure out a way to stay inventive” while cutting costs to improve margins in the existing business something that will not be easy, he adds, since Siebel faces intense pricing pressure from German giant SAP and upstart Salesforce.com.A difficult task has been been made all the harder by the knowledge that Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, is waiting in the wings. Oracle has made no secret of the fact that Siebel figures high on its list of acquisition targets. While he will face “sabre-rattling from some investors over strategy”, however, Mr Siebel does not yet face an organised revolt, says Patrick McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services, an organisation that advises investors on how they should vote at shareholder meetings. However, with restless investors at his back, competitors making successful inroads into the CRM software business and Oracle waiting none too patiently, Mr Siebel's time may be running out. “This time next year, if they haven't done anything to get margins or revenues up, the shareholder base will have changed dramatically,” says Mr Denton.That could make next year's annual shareholder meeting the real showdown for Mr Siebel unless, of course, the Oracle takeover machine has moved into high gear first.
1071;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-06-01T07:29:56Z;Stefano Zenti of Canon Europe;;"Change afoot for patient CanonUsers of Canon’s digital cameras, camcorders and printers demand instant or near-instant results from their purchases but big projects inside the company can take rather longer, as Stefano Zenti is happy to admit.Since January last year Mr Zenti has been Canon Europe’s chief information officer and is just over halfway through a four-year project designed to bring a common enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to 13 countries in western Europe by the end of next year.So far just one country, Denmark, has gone live with the system and Italy is scheduled to join in July with an upgraded version, but does it really have to take so long to put an Oracle business suite into your company?In the case of Canon Europe, Mr Zenti says it does. This is no reflection on the technology but more on the structure of the company, and especially the side serving the business market with large office and professional printers, multi-functional devices and a host of other products and services.Each Canon company in Europe had grown in its own way, often developing out of a local importing business or dealership and until a few years ago these individual companies had made their own decisions about IT. The business processes and IT for the consumer side of Canon Europe was standardised by 2003 but the business market is more complex, says Mr Zenti. “Each country developed its own customer related methodology to suit different needs, and this is more difficult to standardise,” he says.“So we tried to understand these peculiarities, and establish a common business policy that enabled people to keep local customs but benefit from a common infrastructure and processes.” A common infrastructure by the end of next year, he says, will enable the company to share and exchange information much more easily across Europe.Transforming a series of local companies into a pan-European whole is easy to say but difficult to make happen, says Mr Zenti. However, supporting this big change on the IT side is what Hajime Tsuruoka, Canon Europe’s chief executive, asked him to do when Mr Zenti moved to the company’s Amsterdam headquarters after a long career at Canon Italy.Because of the peculiarities of local markets, it has taken time - and millions of euros - to develop a pan-European business system that could be effectively used in every country, says Mr Zenti. Consultants have been used widely and software experts from Oracle have helped develop new functionality for Canon that the US company will eventually be able to offer other customers. As an important first step in the pan-European transformation, the individual IT and communications departments at country level have been replaced by four regional competence centres to ensure continuing support across Europe.Ultimately, however, the task for Mr Zenti and his team is not about technology. “Most of my time and energy is spent in making sure people understand what it is for and how to work with it. You can develop the best technology and systems, but they will fail if people don’t detect the benefits coming from it,” he says.Canon has traditionally taken a consensual approach to management, like many Japanese companies, and Mr Zenti is well aware that power is being taken away from IT people in national businesses who had previously been responsible for everything. Thus he avoided an imposed solution - “our approach was a bit more ‘bottom up’ than ‘top-down’,” he says. “A lot of the decisions now are coming from people within the countries, they are not all being taken by people at Canon Europe.”Mr Zenti adds that, with their experience of the pan-European project, Canon’s IT staff have a great opportunity to get more involved in the business, because they will understand how important the new approach is to the company.Throughout the project, Mr Zenti’s dual role - he is also responsible for Canon’s European supply chain - has helped him stay on top of what the business needs from IT.“Forty to 50 per cent of my time is spent on that side of the job,” he says, “and I can’t see a clear dividing line between it and the IT development side.” A core part of the additional software development work for the Oracle business suite focuses on the supply chain, he says, supporting a new European logistics centre concept for supplying goods directly to the end user.In keeping with Canon’s devolved management style, Mr Zenti has considerable autonomy over the regional IT strategy for Canon Europe, and was not influenced by the fact that Canon is a big user of Oracle in the US - “I am asked to develop the best strategy for Europe,” he says.This contrasts with the way many US based multinationals run their IT, with a strong global CIO setting out policy, but things are changing at Canon, too. As well as reporting to Mr Tsuruoka in Amsterdam, Mr Zenti has another boss, the recently appointed Keijiro Yamazaki, group executive for information and communication systems, who is based at Canon’s headquarters in Japan.“There is a clear message from [Mr Yamazaki], he wants to understand how to create synergy between the three regions [US and Canada; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia]. There are a lot of opportunities.”"
1072;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;Siebel prepares for loss of staff;;Siebel Systems, the troubled US software group, on Thursday said its board had approved special measures to retain staff amid heightened speculation that the company could be sold.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Siebel said takeover rumours could “negatively impact employee productivity and company performance”. Siebel then outlined the severance benefits its 5,000 plus employees might be eligible for in the event of a “change of control”.Wall Street bankers said the regulatory filing was a sign of nervousness within the company about competitors taking advantage of the uncertainty surrounding it to poach talented staff.But one Silicon Valley dealmaker, not involved in Siebel discussions, said it was also an indication that Siebel's management, led by George Shaheen, chief executive, was preparing the ground for a deal. In recent months, Oracle held discussions with Siebel about a takeover, but those talks did not bear fruit, according to people familiar with the matter. However, Oracle remained the prime candidate to clinch a deal with Siebel, they added. Others were SAP of Germany or a consortium of private equity buyers.Siebel's revenues from selling new software licences collapsed by 57 per cent between 2000 and 2003, before edging back up by 1 per cent in 2004. In the first quarter of this year they plunged again, falling 40 per cent from a year before.Siebel shares, which have risen steadily in the past few months on takeover speculation or hopes that its $2.2bn cash pile might be returned to shareholders, were up 0.9 per cent to $9.35 yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of $4.8bn.An acquisition by Oracle would mark a quick return to large dealmaking by Larry Ellison, chief executive who engineered the $10bn purchase of PeopleSoft in 2004.
1073;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;SAP steps up search for resale partners;;SAP of Germany will on Wednesday intensify its battle with Oracle of the US for the small to medium-sized enterprise market as it unveils an initiative to tempt more partner companies to sell its software.Announcing the programme at its annual customer conference in Boston, SAP will invite the partners of rival companies to join the SAP reseller network, offering them discounts and marketing funding.It will also scrap its annual charges for resellers, allowing them to pay a one-time joining fee.SAP sells some business software directly, mainly to larger customers. However, it relies on a network of software resellers, such as Getronics Pink Roccade, the Dutch computer services group, to sell its software to smaller businesses.The decision to expand this network signals an increased interest in serving customers in the mid-market, which SAP defines as businesses with turnover of £200,000-£1bn ($368,000-$1.84bn).The announcement comes two days after Oracle, SAP's main rival in the enterprise software market, said it was seeing strong uptake of its software by small and medium-sized businesses. Oracle is offering a special discounted price for companies that want a licence for 10 to 50 users.Previously, the crucial battleground for SAP and Oracle has been large, multinational corporations. However, sales momentum in this sector has recently slowed as there have been few significant updates of the software to spur a cycle of upgrades. Earlier this year, Oracle and SAP were locked in a fierce bidding battle for Retek, a US-based provider of software for the retail industry. Retek, which Oracle eventually bought for $630m, was seen as a key to entering the retail sector, where Oracle and SAP software still have relatively low penetration.Analysts warn, however, that the market could be difficult to crack. Both SAP and Oracle will face competitors who already have a strong presence in this area including Microsoft, Sage, Intuit and SSA.
1074;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-05-05T23:00:45Z;Siebel takes steps to boost growth;;Siebel Systems, the troubled US software company, on Thursday rejected pressure to boost short-term returns for shareholders as it outlined a new plan to cut costs and return to longer term growth.It also brushed off reports it was involved in negotiations for a sale, though it hinted it may be in the preliminary stages of considering a takeover offer or other significant strategic moves.In a regulatory filing, Siebel said it had “recently” been presented with “potential opportunities” that were being considered, though nothing had progressed to the point where it had been discussed by its full board. While not detailing the nature of those approaches, the company said it had looked at “strategic opportunities” a number of times in recent years, including making significant acquisitions or being acquired.Siebel has recently faced calls to pay out some of its $2.2bn cash to shareholders and has been the subject of public takeover interest from Oracle, its larger rival.However, George Shaheen, chief executive, said at an analyst meeting the company would need its cash to fund growth, including acquisitions. “We're going to return this company to its roots of growth and profitability,” said Mr Shaheen, who took over last month. Siebel's revenues from selling new software licences collapsed by 57 per cent between 2000 and 2003, before edging back up by 1 per cent in 2004. In the first quarter of this year they plunged again, falling 40 per cent from a year before. Mr Shaheen attributed the sales collapse in part to big purchases of Siebel licences made during the tech boom that customers had only recently started to use.That overhang of unused software was now past, clearing the way for new sales, he added.He also outlined an expansive plan that would take Siebel beyond the $6bn market for packaged customer relationship management software, where it earns most of its revenues, into markets worth $100bn in total. New business would include components of software for big companies that want to build their own systems.
1075;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-04-21T18:46:56Z;Strong first quarter for SAP;;SAP on Thursday earned several analyst upgrades and a rally in its share price after another good batch of figures showed the German software group shrugging off the worries that had been triggered by recent weak figures from some US rivals.Software licence sales, a closely watched indicator of software companies' future growth prospects, came in at ?434m ($566m) during the traditionally weak first three months of the year, well above analyst forecasts.The 17 per cent rise prompted some analysts to say that SAP's full-year guidance for licence sale growth of 10-12 per cent looked conservative.Pro forma operating profits were up 15 per cent at ?381m, despite SAP adding 1,000 new staff, one-third of the extra hires it plans for this year, in a push to capture market share and invest in further product development while its arch-rival Oracle integrates its PeopleSoft acquisition.In the US, where SAP generates nearly a third of its revenues, its market share increased from 38 per cent to 41 per cent sequentially, helped in part by its ability to lure clients away from PeopleSoft. Software licence sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions also topped expectations, with a 9 per cent rise, and an 18 per cent increase when stripping out Germany, where SAP's dominant market share leaves less room for growth. This confirms the recovery scenario in Europe that the group has been projecting. Combined with the performance elsewhere, this should allow SAP to continue to fund strong investments while retaining the potential for further margin expansion.The group forecasts only a modest increase in pro forma operating margins of up to 0.5 percentage points this year, another forecast that some analysts view as conservative.?The continued strength of SAP's results is just another example of how far we have distanced ourselves from other software companies, and the gap continues to widen,? said Henning Kagermann, SAP chief executive.SAP shares rose 3.66 per cent on Thursday to ?119.73.
1076;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Adobe off 11% on Macromedia deal news;;Adobe, the fast-growing maker of the Acrobat document reader and other desktop software, fell foul of Wall Street's habitual dislike of big software deals on Monday as it announced an all-stock acquisition of multimedia software developer Macromedia.Shares in Adobe dropped by about 11 per cent after news of the deal, pushing the value of the acquisition down to about $3bn and eating into the 25 per cent premium it had initially offered on Macromedia's stock.By adding Macromedia's software for creating and playing multimedia content over the web, including its widely used Flash desktop product, Adobe said it would be able to sell a more complete set of software tools for companies to communicate all types of digital information to a broad audience. The move also puts Adobe on a more direct collision course with Microsoft, which is extending its own reach into software that lets groups of workers collaborate more easily.?This is not a consolidation play,? said Bruce Chizen, chief executive officer of Adobe an apparent reference to Oracle's declared ambition to use a spate of deals to cut costs and reduce the number of competitors in the industry. ?This is all about growth, which is why it's different from the other deals.?That message failed to impress Wall Street, however, where software acquisitions based on claims of growth have also been treated sceptically. The knee-jerk reaction echoed the response to the planned $8.9bn acquisition by Symantec, the largest maker of security software, of Veritas, which makes storage back-up software. Symantec's shares have fallen by more than 40 per cent over concerns about the difficulty of achieving the cross-selling opportunities such deals promise.Software mergers are held back by a number of factors, such as the difficulty of retaining good developers and the disruption that comes from trying to combine two overlapping sales forces, said one Wall Street analyst, who refused to be named. Also, ?you can't take two sets of products and mush them together very easily? a consideration that has complicated Oracle's recent purchase of PeopleSoft.Adobe and Macromedia share a similar business model. Like the Acrobat document reader, the Flash player is distributed free and is present on 98 per cent of all desktop computers that are connected to the internet. The companies then charge developers for the software needed to create files that can take advantage of this large consumer base.To offset the effects of the acquisition, Adobe said it would buy back $1bn of its stock. Although the companies have a large combined share of the market for software that developers use, Mr Chizen said they did not expect antitrust objections.
1077;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-04-08T11:03:54Z;The week in technology: Microsoft faces new foes;;From this week onwards, Microsoft may face a whole new set of foes in its marathon antitrust courtroom battle with the EU. A heavyweight coalition of technology groups including IBM, Oracle and Nokia have fronted up to pledge their support to Brussels.Microsoft’s upcoming case was launched to contest Europe's landmark antitrust ruling last year after it was found guilty of abusing its dominant position in the market for personal computer operating systems by shutting out rivals from adjacent markets such as media players and server software.The EU imposed a €497m ($638m) fine and forced it to change its business practices - actions that Microsoft is currently appealing.The group, called the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, has offered to intervene on behalf of the Commission during the appeal.Not only can ECIS provide valuable technological and legal advice to the Commission, it will help to boost its credibility after a number of high profile defections last year with the likes of Sun Microsystems and Novell settling their scores with Microsoft out of court last year.The committee filed its application to join the proceedings last December, and there is a chance that ECIS could be rejected from these for missing a court deadline. However if it is admitted, it could make all the difference to the EU’s chances of defeating the world’s largest software group.Advertisers eye mobliesCould the golden age of the mobile phone be coming to an end? Just as it seemed that personal telecommunication was getting cheaper and more stylish, the advertising industry is now seeking ways to get its hooks in and we may soon be faced with the dilemma of choosing a cut-price option but having it sponsored by Persil.Andrew Robertson, chief executive of Omnicom’s BBDO , the world’s third-biggest advertising agency, says the best way to reach consumers now is to use wireless devices such as mobile phones, laptop computers and Blackberrys - the hand-held e-mail devices that are must-have toys for corporate executives on the go.The problem is partly that TV is losing its allure throughout the world. A BBDO survey in 15 countries asked people what technology they most wanted to keep. Almost half said their home computers, 31 per cent their mobile phones and only 12 per cent their televisions.And in China - arguably the economic hotspot for the coming century - 61 per cent opted for mobile phones, compared with just 4 per cent for televisions.On top that, machines such as digital video recorders have undermined the supremacy of the advertising exec by giving people the ability to avoid TV adverts altogether. Dial M For McDonalds?Qwest comes back for moreQwest was this week once again left mulling the prospect of raising its bid for MCI, the US long-distance carrier, in spite of MCI’s marked preference for Verizon as a suitor.MCI said it had rejected the latest Qwest proposal for a number of reasons, including negative sentiment among MCI customers and continuing uncertainties over the bid’s value and likelihood of the deal closing.Determined to win over its reluctant quarry, Qwest is pursuing a number of initiatives to help its efforts including increasing its current offer for MCI to between $28.50 and $29 a share and arranging a $2bn equity infusion, conditional on the MCI board endorsing a sweetened bid from the group.People close to the negotiations believe a higher offer from Qwest - perhaps in conjunction with an accelerated equity capital infusion - could be under consideration. They did, however, rule out suggestions that Qwest might raise its bid as high as $30-a-share - which MCI is understood to have named as a price that it would be willing to accept.Other measures Qwest may consider if things dont go its way are taking its existing or a revised offer direct to shareholders or waging a proxy battle for control of MCI.New home for Lara CroftEidos, the troubled maker of the Lara Croft Tomb Raider and Hitman video game titles, said this week that it would recommend an offer from SCi that values its operations at £97m.The company - which last month announced a large loss for the first half and pushed back the launch of the latest Tomb Raider and Hitman games - said it had recommended the all share offer in the absence of an increased cash offer from Elevation, the US venture capital firm whose partners include U2’s frontman Bono.The fact that the SCi bid had gained the support of nearly 47 per cent of the Eidos shareholders, including Schroders, Merrill Lynch and Gartmore, was a strong determining factor for Eidos in favouring the bid.It is also considered unlikely that Elevation would table a higher bid. However, Eidos did concede that SCi might not bring it the same level of scale to allow it to most effectively compete in the computer games market.SCi - whose bid was worth about £76m before the share price rise - says it plans to raise about £60m to revamp Eidos’ main brands and improve the pipeline of products. It believes it could realise £14m in annual cost savings from the combination of the two companies.
1078;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-04-05T23:00:34Z;Software groups enter EU fray against Microsoft;;A powerful coalition of software and technology groups including IBM, Oracle and Nokia has joined the European Commission's long antitrust battle against Microsoft, accusing it of wide-ranging anti-competitive behaviour.The group, called the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, has asked to intervene on the Commission's side in a crucial court case launched by Microsoft against the regulator.It wants to help defeat the US software group's appeal against Europe's landmark antitrust ruling. The Commission last year found Microsoft guilty of abusing its dominant position, imposed a ?497m ($638m) fine and forced it to change its business practices.ECIS, which also includes software groups Red Hat and RealNetworks, could provide valuable technological and legal advice to the Commission.It will also boost the credibility of the regulator's case against the group, dented after a string of its industry supporters dropped out of proceedings last year.Thomas Vinje, a lawyer with Clifford Chance who acts for the group, told the FT on Tuesday: ?The involvement of ECIS and its members reflects a continuing and, in fact, growing concern within the technology industry about a wide range of anticompetitive behaviour by Microsoft.?The committee filed its application to join the proceedings last December, and it could yet be rejected because it missed a court deadline. But ECIS can in any case provide advice to the Commission independently of the court case, and it has the right to apply for a role in the oral hearing on the appeal.Should it, however, be admitted to join the proceedings, the group would significantly strengthen Brussels' case. The Commission suffered a severe setback last year, when it lost the backing of three of its closest supporters within the industry.Microsoft rivals Sun and Novell, as well as the Computer and Communications Industry Association, dropped out of the case after striking lucrative out-of-court settlements with Microsoft.It was only after the CCIA settlement was announced that ECIS decided to get involved too late to meet the court deadline.Sun, Novell and the CCIA had provided valuable technical advice during the Commission's six-year antitrust probe against Microsoft. They also made powerful presentations in an earlier legal challenge launched by Microsoft against the ruling, in which the company sought to freeze the antitrust sanctions imposed by the Commission.That challenge was in December struck down, forcing Microsoft to comply with the Commission's decision with immediate effect.The Commission had in March last year found Microsoft guilty of abusing its dominant position in the market for personal computer operating systems by shutting out rivals from adjacent markets such as media players and server software.Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco and Nicholas George in Stockholm

The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,171.42 and the Nasdaq Composite rose fractionally to 1,991.06.

1080;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-25T14:17:33Z;The week in technology: Oracle outbids SAP;;Oracle claimed another scalp this week as it emerged victorious from its head to head battle with SAP to buy US retail software company, Retek for $630m.But the US group had barely launched into its victory dance when it emerged that costs associated with acquisition of PeopleSoft had led to an unexpected fall in sales of new applications in the third quarter.Hot on the heels of its bid for PeopleSoft, the Retek acquisition ushers in a new era of aggression by its chief executive, Larry Ellison, chief executive, who is determined to thrwart SAP’s growing presence in the US software market.Oracle twice raised its bid for Retek against SAP, however the dent in its third-quarter earnings concerned investors that the group’s belligerent bid tactics may be diverting management attention away from the company's underlying business.New licence revenues from database software, Oracle's biggest business, increased by 12 per cent to $782m, but new licence revenue from applications software increased by only 9 per cent to $152m.Excluding an initial contribution from PeopleSoft, which it acquired in January for $10.3bn, new licence revenue would have declined 13 per cent.MCI still flirting with its suitorsMCI continued to flirt with its two suitors, playing them off each other, as the US long distance carrier first halted discussions with Qwest Communications, due to its previous agreement with Verizon Communications, then two days later, reignited talks with Qwest.MCI’s board, which has accepted a $6.75bn takeover bid from Verizon, the largest US telecommunications operator, has until the end of Monday to pick its long-term partner.Qwest’s latest $8.45bn offering represents a significant premium over Verizon’s bid. If Qwest wins the chase, Verizon would be forced to improve its bid or walk away from the deal. It is thought that the group would be prepared to inch up its bid, but maybe not to the level offered by Qwest.The latest delay comes amid heightened tension between the two competing bidders. Verizon, which initially agreed to allow MCI a two-week window to reopen negotiations with Qwest after some large MCI shareholders objected to the deal, this week labelled the rival Qwest bid as “profoundly flawed”.It accused Qwest of making “extravagant” and “grossly exaggerated” claims in its efforts to win MCI board approval for its takeover bid.Softbank rides to the rescueFuji Television surprised everyone on Thursday when it emerged that Softbank was riding to the rescue as a white knight and would become its largest shareholder despite a court ruling that had appeared to turn the tide in favour of Livedoor, the internet start-up that had instigated a hostile bid for the broadcaster.SBI, the investment arm of Softbank Corporation, said it would set up a venture capital fund with Fuji TV and NBS to invest in content, media and broadband upstarts.SBI will “borrow” Fuji TV shares owned by NBS, and replace it as Fuji TV’s largest shareholder. The deal will give SBI voting rights in the television firm without any money actually changing hands.The deal appears designed to quash the ambitions of Takafumi Horie, the 32-year old president of Livedoor, who has dared to challenge the cosy club of Japanese capitalism.The Japanese public has been enthralled by the clash between a media group that touches their daily lives and the irreverent entrepreneur who says he is frustrated by the speed the internet is spreading and wants to broaden his audience by acquiring the broadcaster.‘Frustrated’ by BrusselsThe long-simmering row between Microsoft and the European Commission over last year’s landmark antitrust ruling has broken into the open as the company launched an attack on the regulator for making inconsistent demands.Microsoft said it was ‘frustrated’ by the slow response time and the conflicting advice from the EC. The surprisingly frank outburst followed the imposition of a ten day deadline to comply with independent monitoring rules and the decision not to grant a veto over which areas the monitor can scrutinise.
1081;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:47:09+0000;Bundles all neatly tied up;;Database management software is something small-to-medium size enterprises (SME) would probably rather not have to deal with. It is, after all, a technically-complex subject best left to specialists. But business data, no matter how humble, needs to be filed properly and made accessible. And this means even the smallest enterprise needs database software.SMEs are voting with their wallets. Meta Group estimates the US database software market for SMEs alone was worth $2bn in 2004 and SME sales are acknowledged as one reason for a return to healthy growth in the overall market last year.When it comes to database software, SMEs have plenty of choice. From the trimmed-down versions of large enterprise databases, such as IBM and Oracle, to packages specially-built for smaller organisations, such as Progress Software and Pervasive, SMEs have many options. They can even avoid the complexities of database management by buying an application package with the database embedded.The last year has seen the big suppliers re-package their large enterprise database software to appeal to SMEs. While these packages are feature rich they are also expensive, which reduces their appeal to many SMEs who are looking for basic features at a reasonable price.“The problem for IBM and Oracle trying to move down market is they need a different sales strategy - they need to balance the cost with features. But these vendors are attached to the idea of introducing new features at extra cost for their enterprise products,” says Paul Kirby, a research director at AMR Research.“Microsoft introduced SQL Server 2005 to make it easier for SMEs. It is more transparent and easier to manage,” says Mr Kirby.He sees a clear advantage for Microsoft in the SME market. Its well established network of resellers and SQL Server’s place as a platform for specialised applications puts it in a strong position.Oracle has also been busy. “In the last 12 months we have renewed our efforts in the SME market. The whole perception is that Oracle is for the big guys - although in reality we have always been in this market,” says Andy Cleverly, Oracle’s director of technology marketing for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He says that a significant part of Oracle’s recent development effort is aimed at SMEs.In addition to repackaging its software for SMEs, Sybase has moved its database package to Linux, the open source operating system. “Our software is designed to run with the minimum amount of intervention. We take a slightly different approach in that we do not see one size fitting all,” says Tom Traubitz, senior marketing manager at US database developer Sybase.Although Linux is free, it costs money to install and maintain. But, so far at least, Linux has not been a major target for virus writers, unlike Microsoft’s operating systems.Open source software also gives SMEs another possible database option. Mr Kirby from AMR notes that open source database packages offer SMEs an alternative to an expensive package.The vast resources of the internet make it relatively simple to track down suitable open source software. “What we are seeing is an entirely new way of doing business. Through the internet, SMEs can get at world class software. Companies such as Datallegro and Netezza are good examples of open source database software,” says Donald Feinberg, an analyst with market research company Gartner.Application software developers, he adds, also offer an alternative which hides the complexity of the database behind the application. “The small company is not going to buy Oracle and build its own applications. The application vendors have spotted this and realised they have an opportunity. So, you see SAP announcing Business One - the SAP product suite revamped for SMEs. And you see Microsoft getting closer to applications vendors.”Choice is clearly something there is no lack of in the database software market for SMEs. The combination of falling prices and new options such as open source and application services, make it an excellent time for SMEs to invest in database software - without taking on the burden of complexity traditionally associated with it.
1082;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-23T08:03:42Z;Many players jostle for a small slice of a growing market;;"Business intelligence has been part of the enterprise software landscape, in one form or another, for as long as 30 years. But unlike other key business software markets, such as infrastructure databases or desktop productivity applications, business intelligence has been slow to mature.While other software markets have consolidated, usually within their first 10 years, fragmentation remains a key characteristic of business intelligence. IDC calculates that the business intelligence market was worth $3.9bn in 2003, with growth at 5 per cent. However, there is no single player dominating the market. In fact, competition in business intelligence is growing as mainstream enterprise software companies, and in particular SAP and Oracle, invest in business intelligence products.The largest business intelligence vendor, measured by revenues, is Business Objects. The company’s acquisition of Crystal Decisions has almost doubled turnover to over $400m annually. The next-largest vendor is Cognos, at $300m, followed by Hyperion at around $240m. However, these figures do not include business intelligence software sales from the likes of Oracle, Siebel, SAP or Microsoft. IDC figures, for western Europe in 2003, place SAS second in the market after Business Objects and rank SAP fourth, ahead of Hyperion.Most of the enterprise software and infrastructure vendors do not break out revenues by individual product lines. However, the importance of business intelligence to the enterprise software companies cannot be overstated. Oracle executives used the high-profile platform of the company’s OracleWorld conference in San Francisco last December to brand Oracle business intelligence as a separate product, in order to attract orders from companies that might not use the Oracle database or applications. SAP continues to see BI as an important area for growth.Keith Gile, US-based analyst at Forrester Research, says that business intelligence software is moving into new areas of companies’ operations. Forrester divides business intelligence into three layers: strategic, tactical and operational, with the user’s tolerance to data latency one of the key differentiators. Strategic planning can readily make use of data that might be weeks old; operational BI users might need data that are close to real time.Mr Gile points out that most business intelligence software sold so far has been developed to help companies with their strategic decision making. This is where the pure-play business intelligence vendors have, so far, done well.The BI specialists have, though, made fewer inroads into areas where tight integration with transactional systems is a must. Mr Gile classifies this as tactical and operational business intelligence. The need for close integration with other enterprise computing applications, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or supply chain management favours the enterprise software companies. “The best-of-breed business intelligence vendors are good at aggregated data,” he says. “We are seeing the [enterprise software] platform vendors play more at the tactical and operational levels.”At the operational level especially, CIOs are faced with a choice not just between a business intelligence specialist and an enterprise software company’s offerings, but also in-house development. Forrester estimates that only 5 to 10 per cent of companies use business intelligence at the operational level. Those that do are likely to write their own code.Research by Gartner suggests that this is changing. The analyst house predicts that most organisations will aim to use packaged business intelligence software, rather than bespoke applications, by 2007. But Gartner stresses that companies should develop a business intelligence strategy, and then conduct a “build versus buy” analysis before making a choice between writing a program in house and buying in a package.Interest in packaged business intelligence - whether from an enterprise software company or a specialist - is being driven by greater maturity in supporting technologies. “Business intelligence has needed a lot of other technologies to mature and come into place,” says John Kopcke, chief technology officer at business intelligence vendor Hyperion. “When we first went into decision support systems, we had to find the data and had to assume that the user had a terminal to get to that data. Now there is richness of data sources, and the browser is ubiquitous. So the underpinnings are in place for the business intelligence market.”Gartner expects the business intelligence market to grow steadily over the next three years, with spending on business intelligence boosted by sales from the enterprise applications and database vendors, as well as by growth from the pure-play business intelligence companies.The market opportunity for both specialists and general software companies is large. Current estimates from the main analyst houses suggest that between 5 and 15 per cent of staff within businesses have access to business intelligence tools.The real growth opportunity lies in persuading CIOs that there is a business case for delivering business intelligence to the remaining 85 per cent. Achieving this will require significant changes, both in how business intelligence is sold and how it is delivered.Mr Gile maintains that the pure-play software companies will not be able to expand business intelligence take-up to any significant extent, unless they move away from a per-user licensing model. And all the BI vendors will have to work harder to deliver business intelligence functionality to a much wider user base.Here, database and enterprise software companies will have an advantage, if customers’ staff are already familiar with their interfaces or portal applications. And vendors such as Business Objects are making much of their integration with Microsoft’s desktop tools as a way to increase the reach of BI.The specialist vendors also emphasise the advantage of opting for one, integrated business intelligence environment, which can in turn serve as a window on to other enterprise applications, especially for non-specialist vendors.Predictions from Gartner support this. Although database and enterprise software companies will expand their BI revenues between now and 2008, the specialists, with revenues of close to $2.2bn, will continue to outsell enterprise software vendors by five to one. Integration with multiple data sources remains the specialists’ key selling point. “By its very nature business intelligence is about bringing information together from multiple sources,” says John Kopcke at Hyperion."
1083;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-23T08:03:42Z;Trail blazing or just a long way round?;;Cornie Victor’s title at South Africa’s Absa Bank is general manager in charge of business intelligence. His job is to identify the holy grail of BI, the elusive single version of the truth, from data generated by a bank with $52bn in assets, 6m customers holding 9m accounts and 32,000 employees spread throughout 653 sites.Absa has implemented Oracle technology, with the software focused on four key areas of performance - finance, customers, resources and process. “The Oracle software acts as an enabler for us, but the software is nothing if you do not go through the whole business of interpretation,” says Mr Victor. This interpretation is the job of Absa’s BI competency centre (CC), although the bank calls it the business enablement department.Integration appears to be the key to understanding how the CC works. Before it was rolled into the CC, Absa used a balanced scorecard approach, but this was applied at a narrow tier at the top of the bank’s structure. The business units below were not integrated into the process.With a 25 strong team and a $3m budget for the programme, Mr Victor had to justify the CC with a strong business case. The choice of software was not a foregone conclusion, although Absa already ran an Oracle data warehouse. “We did look at comparative products, even though there was an obvious fit with our data warehouse,” he says.After 18 months the CC is still evolving as the bank’s own strategy changes, but previous manual processes have been abandoned.“Now we are measuring all the things we did not measure in the past,” says Mr Victor. “For years companies only measured financials and did not look at people and processes and customers.”Is Absa blazing a trail for other IT-savvy businesses to follow? Gartner, the IT consulting group, thinks so. It claims that nearly 40 per cent of large businesses using or intending to use BI have, or will have, a CC within the next year. This is based on a study conducted in North America, Europe, Australia, Japan and China.Not everyone is so sure. Ian Charlesworth, a senior research analyst at the European-focussed Butler Group, thinks that building a CC means taking the long way round the BI course.“In my opinion a CC is just a way of describing what good project managers do already,” he says. “CCs are all about specialisation, but the real challenge in BI is to get it embedded into the business. It should all be about finding points of integration between BI tools and the organisation. That conflicts with the CC view that you should create a hub.”While some companies are picking up the baton of centralised BI, dissidents such as Mr Charlesworth think this is the worst possible route. Boston-based AMR research is similarly sceptical.“For some people this is very faddish. In effect a BI CC is a proxy that says ‘we are at the forefront of innovation.’ If you have got your act together you probably already have the function, but it is known by another name such as the ERP implementation team,” says Paul Kirby, AMR research director.Gartner’s enthusiasm for the CC idea was reflected at a recent conference in Chicago, the home town of Mary Fontaine, the former IT boss at local retail insurance giant Allstate, who launched a CC in 1997.“The concept of finance was broadened to include anything that had numbers in it,” says Ms Fontaine. “We discovered that while every group within Allstate thought they had their own uniquely relevant data, in fact that information could be used and exploited by other groups.” The unit Ms Fontaine created grew during 1998 as silos of data were broken down and information was shared.The real achievement of this reorganisation is best measured by impressive cost savings as Ms Fontaine discovered duplication of software licences and overlapping systems. “A lot of the software you use within a large company is actually redundant.” Further savings came from obvious, but rewarding, projects that eliminated paper and report distribution costs. Over two years Allstate saved up to $10m in assorted costs.So was the much-vaunted CC really no more than a high-powered efficiency drive? “Yes, that is true. A CC is not really technology driven, it is about organisation and it evolves over several years to navigate around aspects of each organisation.”Today Ms Fontaine works as an independent consultant helping vendors and users to optimise their software investment.Edinburgh-based Merit Consulting concentrates on BI strategy, but after a long career with BI vendors Merit’s James Irving is not convinced by the fuss around BI CCs.“They are sometimes credited with turning round non-performing BI implementations. In my experience I have seen exactly the same result achieved through the experience and knowledge gained by that first ill-judged or poorly executed attempt. The BI CC is one way to approach the issue, but for most organisations it is overkill.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 10,470.43. The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,171.87, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9 per cent to 1,985.50.Market-watchers had long expected the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter point to 2.75 per cent. But stocks turned lower minutes after the Fed announced the change, as investors interpreted the wording of the announcement to mean that a more agressive programme of interest rate rises could be on the way.Jack Caffrey, equity analyst at JPMorgan Private Bank, said the Fed’s programme of slow and steady quarter-point rate rises was beginning to take effect.“People are being forced to make economic decisions, rather than just dig into savings,” he said.Traders were also digesting new data on producer prices showing that headline prices rose 0.4 per cent in February – slightly ahead of forecasts. Meanwhile, the price of oil retreated from near-record highs.Mergers and acquisitions continued to grab attention after Retek, the US software group, agreed to a $643m takeover by Oracle, the business software company.Retek shares slipped 2.3 per cent to $11.20 as investors gave up on the prospect of a counterbid from SAP, Oracle’s European arch-rival. Oracle shares fell 1 per cent to $12.53.Elsewhere, Electronic Arts, the video game company, fell 16.4 per cent to $55.45 after a profit warning.General Mills, maker of Cheerios cereal, fell 3.5 per cent to $49.73 after its quarterly earnings fell.Shares in Lennar, the housebuilder, rose 1.6 per cent to $55.77 after it reported higher quarterly profits.Wyeth, the drugs group, rose 3.7 per cent to $40.36 after it raised its quarterly guidance.Transport stocks led gainers on the S&P 500 after Union Pacific, the railroad group, raised its earnings forecasts. The company said it expected to earn 43-48 cents a share in the first quarter, up substantially from its previous estimate of 25-35 cents a share. UP shares rose 4.7 per cent to $69.18.UP shares, which fell in January after a bout of profit-taking, rose 3.5 per cent to $68.40 by midday – a new high for the year.Alcoa fell 1.4 per cent to $31.02 after the aluminium producer announced the sale of a Norwegian subsidiary. Alcoa also said it would cut 2000 jobs in an effort to cut down on costs.Insurers were among the day’s biggest losers. AIG, the biggest US insurer, fell 2.8 per cent to $56.30 as the departure of its chief executive last week amid a government probe continued to reverberate through the market.Consumer products groups fell after the Federal Trade Commission requested information about Procter & Gamble’s planned $57bn merger with Gillette.

1085;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-18T21:50:43Z;Wall St sinks to second straight weekly loss;;Wall Street closed mixed on Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average staged an afternoon rally to close fractionally higher. But it was a case of too little, too late for US stocks, following a mid-week slide that left the leading indices firmly in the red for a second straight week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose marginally to 10,628.42. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 1,189.22, and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.4 per cent to 2,007.79.For the week, the Dow finished 1.3 per cent lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7 per cent to hit a new low for the year.More than 2.3bn shares changed hands - the businest day of trading so far this year- as four types of futures and options contracts expired on the same day - a phenomenon known as ‘quadruple witching’. Volume also rose ahead of long-anticipated adjustments to the relative weight of companies on the S&P 500 by Standard & Poors.Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak, said that most investors had greeted the planned changes as a non-event. “People have known for weeks that [Standard and Poors] were going to do it,” he said.Wal-Mart and Microsoft, two of the companies most affected by the changes, fell 1.7 per cent and 0.9 per cent on Friday, respectively.Most of the attention on Friday turned to a report showing that consumer confidence fell slightly between February and March.That added to jitters about the rising price of crude oil, which broke through the $57 a barrel mark for the first time, only to settle at $56.30.Yet, in spite of the clouded macroeconomic picture, it was corporate news that led to some of the biggest gains and losses this week.General Motors fell sharply after it warned on profits on Wednesday. The announcement led several debt-rating agencies to add the automaker to their watch-lists for potential downgrades and sent shares down more than 13 per cent. They ended the week down 16.7 per cent at $28.61. Ford, GM’s chief rival, fell 8.1 per cent to $11.39.AIG, the biggest US insurer, ended the week down 7.6 per cent at $59.76 after its chief executive stepped down amid a regulatory probe. The setback prompted Fitch, the credit agency, to strip the insurer of its AAA credit rating.Mergers and acquisitions buzz continued as Qwest made a widely anticipated counterbid for MCI, the telecommunications group being stalked by Verizon. Investors were nonplussed. MCI’s shares fell 2.7 per cent for the week to $23.44. Qwest was unchanged for the week at $3.85, and Verizon fell 2.6 per cent to $35.15.Elsewhere, Viacom, the parent company of the MTV and CBS television networks, rose 7.5 per cent after its chief executive said the company was considering splitting up into at least two separate businesses.Genentech was among the week’s biggest gainers after news that its Avastatin cancer drug helped patients live longer in trials. Shares in the company rose 19.1 per cent for the week.TiVo, the maker of digital television recorders, soared almost 53 per cent to $5.78 over the five-day session after it revealed a contract to provide recording services to Comcast, the biggest US cable operator.Research in Motion, the maker of Blackberry personal communication devices, jumped 37.1 per cent for the week after it settled a long-running patent dispute.Among software makers, Oracle slipped 3.6 per cent for the week after it topped a bid by the German group SAP for control of Retek, a US software rival. Retek shares jumped 9.8 per cent.PanAmSat, the satellite group, fell 3.6 per cent on its first day of trading after its initial public offering. Shares later recovered to end the week down 1.9 per cent at $17.35. PanAmSat is the first of several satellite groups to go public after being acquired by private equity firms last year.Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, rose 0.6 per cent for the week after it reported record first-quarter earnings.Bear Stearns, a rival, slipped 1.3 per cent to $103.33 in spite of record earnings, while Morgan Stanley slipped 1.3 per cent to $57.75.Many analysts had assumed that banks would be hit by rising interest rates in the quarter, but strong equity and bonds markets helped boost performance.
1086;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-18T13:26:25Z;Lex: Oracle / SAP;;Outfoxing a seasoned hunter is tricky. But, despite limited shooting practice on the acquisition trail, SAP seems to be pulling off that feat.Its increased offer of $11 a share for Retek, the small US software provider, appears spot on – at least if the intention was to provoke its rival Oracle to shoot from the hip.Oracle’s hasty retaliation with another hostile counter bid at $11.25 looks more than a little peculiar. After all, SAP has increased the termination fee to $25m, or about 45 cents a share, payable if the deal falls through.While the sums involved are puny for both bidders, the episode illustrates how rattled Oracle is. Throughout Oracle’s long battle to win PeopleSoft, SAP has steadily been gaining market share. But the onslaught shifted into a new gear after the German group’s January purchase of TomorrowNow, a service provider for PeopleSoft software. With Retek, one of Oracle’s own long time partners, SAP looked set to consolidate its lead in the attractive retail segment. But it has made no secret of the fact that if need be, it should be able to find other targets to close the remaining gaps in its retail offering.In contrast, Oracle has spent the last few weeks exaggerating the importance of Retek in defending its turf – after reportedly withdrawing from merger talks late last year to focus on more important things. This leaves it little choice but to pay-up now. To maintain its credibility, Oracle will probably need to specify that it always intended to pay the break-up charge on top of the offer. This would translate into an exuberant 55 times Retek’s earnings and 3.2 times sales for this year. SAP would be unwise to try to match that. But if recent experience is any guide, it is unlikely to fall into that trap.
1087;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-18T11:58:41Z;The week in technology: Ebbers found guilty;;"Bernie Ebbers’ attorney hoped that in getting to know his client, jurors would conclude that he was incapable of masterminding an $11bn accounting fraud which led to the biggest bankruptcy in US corporate history.But at the end of a six week trial in which Mr Ebbers surprised jurors by taking the stand in his own defence, his lawyers were proved wrong.Mr Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, was convicted of nine criminal charges related to the fraud at the long-distance carrier.With little in the way of documentary evidence, the jurors had to decide whether they believed Mr Ebbers’ claim that he was ignorant of the WorldCom’s accounting discrepancies or the version of events as related by Scott Sullivan, the company’s former chief financial officer and the prosecution’s star witness.Mr Sullivan claimed that Mr Ebbers knew of the fraud and perpetuated it, continuously asking his second-in-command to “hit the numbers” referring to WorldCom’s grossly overestimated revenue targets.The lion’s share of Mr Ebbers’ personal fortune was wrapped up in WorldCom stock giving him a clear cut motive for painting a rosy picture of the company despite its desperate situation.However, Mr Sullivan was considered a flawed witness who was co-operating with the government only to reduce his own sentence. He admitted lying throughout the years on everything from accounting irregularities to cocaine use and there were no other witnesses to back up his testimony.But, despite Mr Ebbers not contradicting himself under oath and a certain amount of folksy charm, in the end jurors were not convinced that a chief executive with so much to lose or gain from his company’s performance would not be aware of a fraud of such magnitude.Enron executives up for trial soon will be taking note.Oracle ups the anteNever one for backing away from a challenge, Oracle once again topped arch-rival SAP's takeover offer for US retail software firm Retek as it seeks to defend its applications business in North America.Oracle raised its all-cash hostile bid to $645m or US$11.25 a share, trumping SAP by just 2 per cent. The move came barely 12 hours after the German software giant had increased its own, agreed on, offer and signalled a strong escalation of as transatlantic rivalry between the two software giants.The bidding war comes as the two software companies find themselves increasingly encroaching on one another’s turf. Since its $10.3bn acquisition of PeopleSoft, Oracle has found itself in more direct competition with SAP in the market for business software applications used by large-size companies, while SAP has cashed in on the disruption caused by the takeover to take more market share in Oracle's US home market.SAP already has strong presence in the US and also recently bought TomorrowNow, a small private technology services firm that provides maintenance support for PeopleSoft products. It has also moved into ""middleware,"" a sector traditionally dominated by Oracle.The German company signaled on Thursday that it would not raise its offer again, however such statements are not considered binding in the US.MCI mulls Qwest bidMCI is taking plenty of time to consider its options following a sweetened $8.45bn offer from Qwest Communications.MCI's board had already accepted a takeover bid from Verizon Communications, the biggest US telecoms operator, worth roughly $6.75bn but under pressure from shareholders allowed Qwest to bring another offering to the table.A two-week window for talks with Qwest closed on Thursday, giving MCI a month to decide whether to reconsider its support for Verizon.Qwest has a $17bn debt pile that it is struggling to control - which was one of the reasons MCI’s board favoured a lower offer from Verizon. It is expected that Verizon will have to raise its bid if it wants to buy MCI, but it says it has no plans to do so at the moment, instead arguing that Qwest's bid is inferior because of the debt load.It also recently attempted to cast doubt on Qwest’s financial stability and business strength in a letter from Ivan Seidenberg, its chairman and chief executive.Livedoor eyes new targetFuji TV seemed to be feeling the pressure of a circling predator as it more than doubled its dividend, from Y2,000 ($19.12) to Y5,000.The move, which triggered a sharp rise in the group’s shares, was viewed as a defence strategy against a hostile takeover attempt by internet start-up, Livedoor.Livedoor, the internet services company controlled by young entrepreneur, Takafumi Horie, has been buying shares in Nippon Broadcasting Systems in a bid to takeover the Japanese radio broadcaster and gain control of its 22.5 stake in Fuji.But Fuji and NBS have been preparing themselves for a fight.In an attempt to thwart Livedoor’s takeover, Fuji has mounted its own takeover bid for NBS. NBS also tried to issue warrants to Fuji that would have diluted Livedoor’s holding, but this tactic was blocked in court.Bolstering the dividend, which was previously expected to be Y1,200 for this year, may have been designed to increase the value of the company, making it more difficult for Livedoor to make a hostile bid should it gain control of NBS.Fuji’s shares rose 10 per cent on Wednesday and a further 12 per cent on Thursday, giving it a market capitalisation of about Y724bn, more than three times that of NBS and Livedoor."
1088;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-18T04:27:40Z;Oracle tops SAP?s takeover offer for Retek;;"Oracle once again topped arch-rival SAP's takeover offer for US software firm Retek on Thursday night, raising its all-cash hostile bid to US$645m barely 12 hours after the German software giant had increased its own, agreed on, offer.Oracle increased its own offer from US$9 to US$11.25 a share, just 2 per cent above SAP's bid.The tussle over Retek, which makes software for retailers, has come to symbolise an intense new phase in the transatlantic rivalry between the two software giants.While Oracle's recent US$10.3bn acquisition of PeopleSoft has taken it into more direct competition with SAP in the market for back-office applications used by large-size companies, SAP has tried to take advantage of the disruption caused by the deal to push more aggressively into Oracle's home market.The German company has also moved into ""middleware"", which provides the so-called ""plumbing"" on which software applications depend, and traditionally a sector dominated by Oracle.""Oracle is not going to cede any ground in any industry to SAP,"" said Scott Langdoc, a retail analyst at ARM, a US technology research firm. ""The battle between these two for dominance is the Retek shareholders' gain.""Larry Ellison, chief executive officer, made clear last week that the fight over Retek had broader significance.""We are the number one applications business in North America and we intend to defend that position,"" he declared.The latest bid from Oracle capped a flurry of activity in recent days. Earlier on Thursday, SAP had raised its original US$8.50 a share agreed offer for Minneapolis-based Retek by 29 per cent to $11, topping Oracle?s $9 per share bid last week.SAP and Retek have also increased the break-up fee that Retek would have to pay if it breaks off the deal to US$25m.The German company also signaled that it would not raise its offer again, calling its latest bid its ""best and final"" offer. That declaration was a strange tactic to use in the face of a hostile bid since it appeared to leave the advantage with Oracle, one takeover trader said on Thursday. However, such statements were not binding in the US, he added - a fact that Oracle itself took advantage of last year when it raised its hostile bid for PeopleSoft despite declaring an earlier offer final.SAP has made increasing inroads into the US and has set out to woo former PeopleSoft customers. It recently bought TomorrowNow, a small private technology services firm that provides maintenance support for PeopleSoft products.Meanwhile, Oracle appeared determined to secure a takeover of Retek ""if only as a 'quid pro quo' for SAP's acquisition of TomorrowNow,"" said one London-based software analyst, speaking before the US company lodged its higher bid.Adding to the pressure on Oracle is its reliance on Retek to enter the retail industry market, analysts say. ""If SAP gets Retek, Oracle has no definitive retail strategy,"" said Mr Langdoc.Separately, Oracle on Thursday said its chief financial officer, Harry You, resigned to become chief executive of BearingPoint, the consulting and business services group formerly known as KPMG Consulting.Oracle said co-president Safra Catz would serve as interim finance chief until a replacement was hired. Mr You, 45, was appointed to his post at Oracle in July 2004, after a six-month search.He previously served as finance chief at Accenture, a rival of KPMG, beginning in 2001. Before that he held positions at Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers."
1089;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-11T14:00:28Z;The week in technology: IBM gets Lenovo clearance;;Executives at IBM and Lenovo must have been breathing a collective sigh of relief this week after the sale of Big Blue’s PC-making arm was approved by Washington, despite potential national security concerns raised by some US legislators.The Committee on Foreign Investment, an inter-agency group that assesses the security and economic risks of takeovers by foreign companies, gave the green light to the $1.75bn sale to China’s Lenovo.The deal had been referred to the committee, which sits only rarely, after Republican congressmen warned that it could result in the leaking of sensitive or military-related technology to Beijing. Lenovo’s links with the Chinese military has added to the unease.There had also been resistance to the deal because China has been criticised for abusing intellectual property rights in the field of technology.The takeover will now take place after IBM agreed to make modest security changes at a North Carolina research facility in order to secure the regulatory clearance - including moving almost 2,000 staff to a new building.Despite some reports implying otherwise, it looks like Lenovo will not be barred from selling PCs to the US or to the country’s government agencies. As part of the deal, Lenovo will be allowed to sell PCs under the IBM brand for five years - a major boost to its global expansion plans.Ellison delivers slap in face for SAPAfter a two month break, Larry Ellison is taking a stick to the hornets’ nest again.This week Oracle sought to snatch US software company Retek from the jaws of its big German rival SAP.Mr Ellison, Oracle’s chairman and chief executive, offered $9 a share, or $525m, for Retek despite the group already agreeing an $8.50 deal with SAP, claiming Oracle’s technology and strategy was a better fit for Retek.The blood has barely had time to dry on his bitter 18-month siege of PeopleSoft, which ended in a victory for Oracle after a competition court gave it the go-ahead against the wishes of the US government.Mr Ellison’s latest target is small beer compared to PeopleSoft, but it ups the ante in Oracle’s long term campaign against SAP.The companies are crossing swords with increasing frequency, highlighting the more direct competition that has broken out between the two. Oracle has moved more heavily into applications software - a business dominated by SAP - while SAP has started to sell some of the middleware that Oracle specialises in.With the Retek acquisition, SAP was hoping to pinch a bigger a slice of the US market while Oracle focused on integrating PeopleSoft.But now Mr Ellison’s head has turned…and as PeopleSoft proved - once he gets his teeth into a deal it’s very difficult to get him to loosen his grip.Eidos on a knife edgeLong suffering shareholders of Eidos were offered a glimmer of hope this week by the computer games maker who said it had attracted a buyer.But the countdown is on as the company responsible for digital icon Lara Croft, which has been battling against the constraints of being a small, independent UK player, has to formalise an offer within the next two weeks, to avoid falling foul of its new £23m banking agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland.It said it had received an approach about a possible cash offer for 53p per share, valuing the company at £72.4m. Its shares this week fell to 40p - their lowest level in more than 10 years.Eidos was forced to nail up the for sale sign last year after a string of delays to game releases led to disappointing trading and a number of profits warnings.If an offer is not made in time, the group might have to offload parts of the business or its games portfolio, which includes franchises such as Championship Manager, the football game, and Hitman, as well as Tomb Raider.Potential bidders include Ubisoft of France or Electronic Arts, the US group.The purchase of Eidos would signal the departure of the UK’s largest computer games developer from the market. Eidos has flown the flag for the UK games market but has faced fierce competition, with pressure on developers to invest more in research and development to keep up with the next generation of games consoles.News of the potential bid came as Eidos revealed a £28.7m first-half loss, compared with a £7.8m profit last time and said sales had halved.
1090;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-10T21:16:29Z;European Comment: A chance to get smarter in retail;;"From scanning of the first bar-coded product in 1974 (a pack of Wrigley's gum), the US has enjoyed a lead in adopting retail technology, a powerful creator of growth. Could Europe now be poised to close the gap?Driven by Wal-Mart, the general retailer, the US set the pace with bar-codes, scanners, lasers and computers that, coupled with ""lean retailing"" organisational techniques, have transformed supply chains. A report by the Conference Board, the business research network, attributes more than half the US's lead in productivity growth since 1995 to the retail and wholesale trades, a formerly low-technology sector that became a top user of information and communications technology.Europe lagged behind on bar-codes in the 1970s and inventory systems in the 1980s. The US maintained its five-year lead through the 1990s. Wal-Mart was first again recently to prepare for wireless Radio Frequency Identification tags that transmit product information.The report blames Europe's regulatory obstacles such as shop opening hours and land-use rules, as well as barriers to cross-border economies of scale. But the picture is changing. Road haulage is deregulated, operational restrictions are easing and retailers are expanding across borders, such as France's Carrefour and Britain's Tesco in central and eastern Europe.The Conference Board says although technology's share of investment is still below that in the US, Europe has ""the potential to move at a fast pace"". It is certainly overdue for good news.SAP's 'Stack Wars'The US may still lead in use of retail technology, but one of Europe's most successful technology providers - Germany's SAP - is causing mayhem in the US software industry's backyard.Oracle, market leader in US corporate software, has made an unsolicited $525m bid for retail software specialist Retek, topping an agreed $496m offer from SAP, the global business software leader.It shows Larry Ellison, Oracle's boss, will not let the German group make further inroads without a fight, and comes as Oracle is still digesting its $10.3bn acquisition, PeopleSoft.Oracle and SAP are engaged in what Mr Ellison calls ""the Stack Wars"", converging on the integrated ""stacks"" or multiple software layers that make up corporate IT. Oracle has advanced into applications software, dominated by SAP, while SAP has moved into the middleware that is Oracle's speciality. SAP, led by Henning Kagermann, has been exploiting customer uncertainty by courting PeopleSoft clients.The market expects an auction for Retek, which is market leader in a potentially lucrative sector but tiny for both suitors. It is just a skirmish in a wider war. For SAP, challenges go beyond the dogfight with Oracle. It is investing massively in a platform that will allow individual products to be bundled together. Much depends on gambling correctly that this will be the next big trend.Fourtou's frustrationYou can hardly blame Jean-René Fourtou for feeling sore. Parachuted out of semi-retirement to salvage Vivendi, he has completed a remarkable turnround. Yet he is still struggling to win public recognition for what many corporate peers consider a model rescue.The facts speak for themselves. When he replaced Jean-Marie Messier, most people believed he had taken on an impossible task. The scandal-tainted entertainment conglomerate was ready for break-up in 2002 with debts of €37bn and losses of €23bn.After massive restructuring, Mr Fourtou yesterday announced Vivendi was back in profit, debts slashed to €3.1bn, and the company would pay a dividend for the first time in three years. The markets, however, ticked down Vivendi shares, disappointed the figures were not even better. That is the least of Mr Fourtou's frustrations. What bothers him more is the continuing campaign to undermine his reputation.In part it is his own fault for his clumsy handling of an investment in Vivendi convertible bonds at the height of the group's financial crisis. He subsequently reaped a tidy profit for his family foundation. He insists he did nothing wrong, but he would have saved himself a lot of trouble if he had disclosed the investment at the time.His imminent move to chairman has also been greeted with cynicism as a way to keep control while side-stepping company rules to step down as chief executive when he turns 66 in June. Considering his track record, shareholders instead should be pleased.

1091;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-08T23:27:47Z;Oracle in unsolicited $525m bid for Retek;;Oracle waded into another hostile takeover battle on Tuesday with an unsolicited, $525m cash bid to buy a software company that had already agreed to be acquired by arch-rival SAP.The offer for Retek comes less than two months after Oracle completed its 18-month pursuit of PeopleSoft and marks an unexpected escalation in hostilities between the US and German software giants.SAP's own agreed, $496m offer for Retek less than two weeks ago was the latest move by the German software company to capitalise on uncertainty created by the PeopleSoft deal to take a bigger slice of Oracle's home market.?We are the number one applications business in North America and we intend to defend that position,? Larry Ellison, Oracle's founder and chief executive officer, said on Tuesday.Mr Ellison also denied that the latest deal would limit Oracle's declared intention to lead a broader consolidation among the companies that sell software to large corporations and governments.?This is a tiny transaction compared with PeopleSoft,? he said. ?This will be much simpler and wouldn't have any impact on our ability to do a much larger transaction in the next 12 months.?Oracle's offer of $9 a share is only slightly above the $8.50 a share offered by SAP, which itself represented a 40 per cent premium to Retek's earlier stock price.Oracle executives claimed, however, that long-standing links with Retek meant that an acquisition by Oracle would be better for the company's shareholders, customers and employees.Around 80 per cent of Retek's customers already use Oracle's database software and other ?middleware? that acts as the infrastructure on which its applications run, the US company said. He also sought to depict Retek's future technology plans as closer to those of Oracle than SAP.?We think that makes us a much better fit from a technology standpoint than SAP,? Mr Ellison said.The clash with SAP highlights the more direct competition that has broken out between the two as Oracle has moved more heavily into applications software - a business dominated by SAP - while SAP has started to sell some of the middleware that oracle specialises in.Oracle executives have said repeatedly in recent months that they have targetted a number of other software companies for acquisition once the PeopleSoft deal has been digested. Takeover talks with Retek were held last October, Mr Ellison said. ?It has been our intent for some time to acquire Retek. It's just a matter of timing.?The low premium represented by Oracle's bid for the software company echoed its opening shot in the long battle for control of PeopleSoft. To secure that deal, Mr Ellison eventually raised his offer by 65 per cent.Asked about how the latest battle would unfoled, Mr Ellison said: ?Will their be an auction, will SAP walk away? We don't know. We evaluate our next move after we see what theirs is.?
1092;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-08T18:42:50Z;A success à la Silicon Vallée;;"Bernard Liautaud has seen it from both sides. As the founder and chief executive of Business Objects, the French software company, and having once worked for the US database giant Oracle, Mr Liautaud has straddled the divide between the dynamism of US start-up culture and European corporate consensus-building.While Business Objects is still based in Paris, more than half its 3,800 workers are in North America - and it has drawn heavily on US-style entrepreneurial capitalism for much of its inspiration.Business ideas developed in the US, and the freedom that comes from operating across the Atlantic, have been central to the company's success, he feels, and help explain Europe's less impressive entrepreneurial class, particularly in the technology industry.Business Objects was set up in 1990 and is now Europe's third-biggest software company, after SAP and Sage. Sales of its ""business intelligence"" software, which companies use to integrate data held in their disparate information technology systems, reached $926m last year, giving it a stock market value of $2.4bn - and a rare French technology success.From the start, says Mr Liautaud, the company was based on the Silicon Valley model for a start-up. Among the original principles on which the company was founded were: raise venture capital immediately, use stock options to attract management talent and aim for a quick listing on the Nasdaq stock market, where many US tech companies are traded.With venture capital backers from both Europe and the US, Business Objects had an early insight into the different approaches to nurturing start-ups. ""The US venture capitalists clearly had a lot of operational experience,"" says Mr Liautaud. ""Most of them had run companies before."" Their European counterparts were trained as financiers.The American backers thought big. ""They pushed us to have an ambitious plan,"" says Mr Liautaud - to grow at rates of 100 or even 200 per cent in the early years. ""The Europeans were much more risk-averse.""Business Objects took the high-growth option, hitting sales of around $60m after four years and achieving a listing on Nasdaq in 1994.The company also took advantage of the large, homogenous US market that gives new companies much more room to grow before hitting market limits. Business Objects set up operations in the US when it still had only 10 employees in France, giving it access to a market far bigger than it could hope for at home.Freedom from Europe's national differences reduced regulatory and cultural pressure on the young company. ""You are able to have one product, one marketing programme, one sales team, for a market that accounts for 50 per cent of the IT spending in the world,"" says Mr Liautaud.Other aspects of operating in the US were also more conducive to a start-up company. Experienced managers there were more willing to consider working for a new company: ""In the US, everyone is looking for the next great start-up."" Customers also seemed less risk-averse to buying from a young company. They also typically pay their bills within the customary 30-day period, in marked contrast to many European customers.However, there are drawbacks. While the red tape is generally less onerous in the US, Mr Liautaud says, the regulatory burden placed on companies by the recent Sarbanes-Oxley legislation has cost Business Objects ""multiple millions of dollars"".Lawsuits brought by unhappy shareholders or former employees ""take time and money"". Also, greater employee mobility can mean that people leave the company much faster, he says.Yet the disadvantages do not outweigh the more favourable climate for start-ups in the US. Ironically, that may prepare the European companies that make it past their early years better for the rigours ahead. ""If you succeed in Europe, you create a stronger company,"" he says. ""If you are raised in a tough environment, you have to be stronger.""For the many European start-ups that founder early in life, however, that will bring little consolation."
1093;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-03-07T18:35:06Z;Mavericks who spied shift in software;;"The asparagus fields near Heidelberg, in western Germany, are a strange setting for the headquarters of a leading international company. All the more so when the company is a leader in the global software market, an industry that has long been the preserve of US technology giants.But SAP, the German software company whose glass-and-concrete headquarters sprawls across the landscape near the town of Walldorf, has a long tradition of being unusual.Founded in 1972 by five former IBM employees, the company is now a market leader with 30,000 employees, €7.5bn ($9.9bn) in revenues last year and a 26,000-strong customer base that includes Procter & Gamble, Lufthansa and EADS.SAP's business software helps companies manage tasks such as payroll, supply-chain logistics and customer relations. A hefty proportion of its sales - about one-third - comes from the US, where SAP has proved adept at making inroads into the home turf of rivals such as Oracle and Siebel Systems.Its success, which gathered pace in the early 1990s, is due to a combination of management skill, an ability to adapt products to customer needs and a dollop of luck.But it took a bout of madness - or entrepreneurial spirit - to set up the company. SAP would not exist if its founders - chief among them Hasso Plattner, the flamboyant systems engineer - had not been prepared to risk career suicide by starting up the business in 1972.""They had to be crazy to do what they did. In breaking away from the safe haven of employment at IBM, they were very unusual in Europe - that rare breed of maverick entrepreneur,"" says Joshua Greenbaum, an analyst with Enterprise Applications Consulting, based in California. ""But their craziness, combined with a strong understanding of what a business needs, is the kernel of SAP's success.""Ironically, SAP's software products, some of which have become industry standards, were at first no better in design or function than those of its competitors. But the company's lack of obsession with technical coolness has been outweighed by its focus on customer needs, and a knack of being early to spot and adapt to changing trends in the computing environment.""The goal was not to create exciting technology for its own sake, but to produce the best software for businesses,"" says Mr Greenbaum. ""They were not technology innovators, but business innovators.""SAP was also quick to embrace the shift in the 1990s from mainframe to client-server computing, which allows more flexibility in how the software is used in a company. The group's R3 software - one of the first to be based on this new mode of computing - attracted large corporate customers, gave SAP an early-mover advantage and provided the entry into a ""virtuous circle"" of customer growth.Raimo Lenschow, software analyst at Merrill Lynch, says: ""The more customers they got, the more they learnt from them, improved their products and became ever more attractive to new customers.""Two other developments fuelled growth. First, R3 suited business process re-engineering - a set of management techniques used to restructure companies in the 1990s. Second, SAP teamed up with management consultants, such as Accenture and Cap Gemini, who would handle the installation side of the software.Such arrangements were beneficial to consultants, who stood to gain service revenues. And by not insisting on bundling software with service contracts, as did others such as Intentia of Sweden, SAP gained customers and, indirectly, a massive salesforce.Finally, SAP excelled at providing versions of its software adapted to individual industries, such as oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and carmakers. Since the handling of, say, oil and gas inventories is very different from that in the auto industry, such customisation has proved popular.The company is a rare example of a European success story in the US-dominated software industry. ""Being Europe-based brought both disadvantages and advantages for SAP. On the one hand, we did not [unlike US competitors] have a large, homogenous home market,"" says Henning Kagermann, SAP chief executive. ""But the advantage was that it forced us to provide more international, global solutions much earlier on. And by now, it is clear that the extra effort has certainly paid off.""However, the real reason for SAP's big gains in market share following the bursting of the technology bubble is that it has convinced customers of its products' money-saving potential.During the boom of the late 1990s, its competitors were doing well, as customers were happy to bear the cost of integrating diverse software products and customising the generic offerings that ""best of breed"" suppliers provided.With the downturn, however, SAP's solutions packages, or ""suites"", and the range of its industry-specific products became more popular as customers began to appreciate that they stood to save in the long term.In the US, says Mr Greenbaum, SAP has also benefited from Americans' respect for German engineering. ""They are seen as trusted, solid and reliable, while their sales pitch is more European, more consultative, than that of many US companies,"" says Adam Shepherd at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. In its fight for US market share, SAP has been courting clients of PeopleSoft, after that company was taken over by Oracle, and has declared 2005 a ""year of investment"" that will see it boost its workforce by 3,000.Yet challenges remain. Growth in its core Europe, Middle East and Africa region has been slow. It is also unclear how SAP's recent efforts to sell its products to smaller and medium-sized enterprises will fare. As mega-software deals have waned, the SME segment has become an important source of industry growth.Despite its recent successes, SAP cannot afford to miss the next industry trend. ""They are investing a lot in research and development to ensure that doesn't happen,"" says Mr Lenschow. ""The short-term-oriented investors may not like that, as it comes at the expense of slower margin growth this year. But long-term, it is key to ensuring that SAP stays innovative and competitive.""Mr Kagermann says: ""We're seeing a shift away from software as something that allows a company merely to improve its profitability and efficiency, to something that allows it to increase its competitiveness - it's about allowing companies to say 'It's easier and more convenient to deal with me'.""For software companies, this means that the next big thing will not be a single ""killer product"", but a new structure - in industry terms a ""platform"" - that allows individual products to be bundled together. SAP is investing about half of its R&D budget on this approach. ""We're half-way there,"" says Mr Kagermann. ""And we have a substantial time lead over our peers.""THE FINE BALANCE OF VISION AND OPERATIONSKnut Woller, analyst at HVB Group, attributes SAP’s breakthrough in the 1990s to “luck plus nous”. “They bet on the shift to client servers and they won. But they would not have won if they had not had the nous to see the trend coming in the first place, the entrepreneurial spirit to go with it and the customer focus that’s helped them to gain loyal clients,” he says.In the end, much of this comes down to the management team. Hasso Plattner, one of SAP’s founders, is considered by many to have had as formative an influence on the development of the software industry as Bill Gates had on the PC world.Mr Plattner was SAP’s chief visionary but he always had a good operations man by his side, most recently Henning Kagermann, who was co-chief executive for five years before Mr Plattner withdrew from active management in 2003.This balance, and a lack of any “personality cult”, has prevented SAP from becoming excessively reliant on one key individual, and allowed it to manage its handovers well. Mr Kagermann has since completed his transition from operations man to chief visionary, leaving the important operations part of managing SAP to other members of SAP’s seven-strong executive board, such as Lo Apotheker and Werner Brandt. This month, Shai Agassi, who came on board when SAP bought his company TopTier in 2001, received added responsibility for the company’s product development, indicating that he may be being groomed as a new vision heavyweight.For more articles in this series, go to www.ft.com/reformingeurope"
1094;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-02-23T07:50:19Z;More about results than time;;On the surface, flexible working might seem to be about people being able to choose their working hours and, perhaps, spend some time working away from the office. But it is also a fundamental change in the way people work – and, more importantly, the way they are managed. Flexible working is a shift from “time-based” to “results-based” working practices and could herald the biggest change in the workplace since the start of the industrial revolution.New employee legislation is one of the main motivations for employers to introduce flexible working practices – but not the only one. In Europe, for example, employers are obliged to offer parents with young or disabled children the right to request flexible working. Requests can be refused for a number of reasons such as additional costs, problems in meeting customer demand or problems in reorganising work with other staff.While legislation is a major catalyst to introduce flexible working, there are other reasons. In the US, for example, the fall in the price of mass market computer and communications technologies is encouraging organisations to allow more home working to cut costs and improve productivity:“It is starting to happen in the US, but there is a twist. There is a huge impact from the consumerisation of technology because many people now have better kit at home than they have at work,” says Doug Neal, research fellow at Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).“It means you can work better at home than at work. Companies are under pressure to cut costs, so, if their staff are spending post-tax dollars on improving their productivity, why not take advantage of this?” he adds.Flexible working is also likely to appeal to a wider skill pool and help with staff retention. Mary Sue Rogers, human capital management leader at IBM Global Services, says that IBM has embraced flexible working to help with recruitment. “In Europe, companies have to provide flexible working because of legislation – but it is also a way to recruit from a broader skill pool – including women and older people. With an ageing workforce we have to find ways to retain older staff. It also gives greater scope to male employees who increasingly want flexible working to create a better work/life balance. A recent survey of UK graduates found that work/life balance was third on their list of career priorities.”She adds that 55 per cent of IBM’s employees work flexibly and 90 per cent are “enabled” to do so.“To us, it is foremost a business imperative. It is about staff retention, increased productivity and cost reduction,” she notes.Chris Wilson, compensation and benefits manager at Oracle UK, echoes this: “Even before the legislation came in, we were already responding. In the knowledge skills market you need to appeal to the widest skill pool. From a company perspective it means we can respond to different work patterns.”A survey of 300 UK human resource professionals in small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), commissioned by Arizona-based telecommunications company Inter-Tel, found that 40 per cent found it difficult to attract the right skills from their local market and 30 per cent thought they could attract staff if they were offered flexible working. But they also had significant reservations with 93 per cent concerned that staff were more likely to bend the rules if they work from home.Mr Neal of CSC identifies this attitude as being at the heart of the cultural shift prompted by flexible working:“The problem is not all with the worker – it is also with the boss. Management has to find a way to measure ‘results’ rather than time. We have to find new ways to evaluate workers - and their bosses.”He adds that organisations must find ways to build trust between employer and employee: “How do I evaluate people when I can’t see them? In formal terms, trust is the outcome of a series of beneficial transactions. You have to build a culture of trust from working together.”Mr Wilson of Oracle also sees trust building as essential to successful flexible working: “One of the biggest obstacles is to change ingrained attitudes of some managers. You need to build code of practice around mutual trust. You also need to create new approaches to benefits. We have a range of flexible benefits packages which include variable holidays, child care vouchers and contracts based on working a number of days in a month.”Anouska Wilson, flexible working programme manager at IBM UK, says companies must think carefully about the way they support flexible working with trust, again, high on the agenda.“You must establish clear guidelines and create the right foundation and culture if it is going to work. You must have a trusted environment and new ways to assess workers. But you must also have proper support and guidance for workers and their managers. We see facilities to enable people to collaborate remotely as one of the keys.”She goes on to say that good communication between staff is essential for successful flexible working: “You must make sure you are very clear about communication. We encourage regular face-to-face contact to create a community spirit. If an employee is linked to a specific location they can use it as their base and keep in touch.”Although new legislation is forcing organisations to adopt flexible working practices, there are sound business reasons to give employees more flexibility. Organisations which have embraced flexible working have found that it can cuts costs and improve productivity. More importantly, it enables them to recruit staff from a much broader skill pool and retain staff.But it does mean a fundamental change in the relationship between staff and management. Both must learn to trust each other and focus on results rather than time spent in the office.
1095;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-02-14T18:13:07Z;SAP warns of upcoming threat;;Companies from China and India are set to inject fresh competition into the business software market, warned Henning Kagermann, chief executive of SAP, Europe's largest software group.However, Mr Kagermann played down any potential threat posed by Microsoft, the US software giant, saying that, while the US-based software giant had a share in the market for business programmes for smaller companies, it would take a long time to rival the more established players.His comments will surprise industry observers who considered Microsoft as a threat in a sector expected to undergo further consolidation after the takeover of PeopleSoft by Oracle. In 2003, Microsoft approached SAP with a takeover proposal but talks broke down at an early stage.Mr Kagermann told the FT: ?I don't think there will be consolidation among the big players …Microsoft is in our business already, through its small business software, but it will take them a long time to bridge the gap with the big players.?Asked what he considered the main threats to his business, he said: ?There are Chinese software companies and Indian consulting companies, which are offering increasingly sophisticated solutions. This is something to watch.?A second challenge could come from the growing capacity of chips, used for example in mobile telephones and other electronic equipment, Mr Kagermann said. One day, a network of chips might fulfil the functions of a network of computers today.SAP has declared 2005 a year of investment as it tries to exploit any disruption from Oracle's integration of PeopleSoft to further increase its share in the market for complex business applications. SAP expects licence growth, the key measure for software companies, of 10-12 per cent this year.?Oracle made its offer to PeopleSoft 18 months ago. In these 18 months, SAP has gained 6 per cent market share and Oracle and PeopleSoft have lost 4 per cent where we overlap,? Mr Kagermann said.He added that IT investment in Europe was picking up because of renewed confidence among customers. ?Eighty per cent of our business was cost-cutting two years ago. But if you go to clients these days, what you hear is that they want to invest to have a competitive advantage,? he said.To support its sales drive, SAP plans to hire 3,000 people this year, the majority of them outside Europe. While the software group conducts between 60 and 70 per cent of its development in Europe, but Mr Kagermann said he could imagine this proportion falling to 50 per cent.
1096;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;The week in technology: Baby Bell at Ma’s heels;;Baby Bell snapping at Ma’s heelsMa Bell might be snapped up by one of her babies after AT&T and SBC Communications were revealed to be in “advanced” talks about a $16bn merger.The most recognised name in US telecommunications, AT&T - which pioneered telephone services more than a century ago but has floundered since the mid-1980s amid regulatory changes and increasing competition - could disappear from the map if the deal succeeds.A deal could usher in the next chapter of restructuring in the sector, creating a vertically integrated communications giant with a strong presence across technologies and customer bases.Analysts believe this may in turn trigger another wave of consolidation as SBC’s fellow regional telecoms such as Verizon and BellSouth also seek to extend their reach.The most likely targets would be MCI, the long-distance operator recently emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and Qwest, the struggling regional player.America’s telephone companies have been hit by the migration of customers to other technologies such as wirleless and cable. These pressures have led to a series of mergers and talks about deals. Last year, Cingular Wireless bought AT&T Wireless for $41bn and Nextel and Sprint agreed to a $36bn merger.The deals have put Ma Bell’s ability to remain independent into question.SBC is interest in AT&T centres around the latter’s corporate customer base, a segment of the telephony market with a very predictable cashflow dominated by AT&T and MCI, formerly WorldCom.SBC and its regional rivals have tried to break into this sector but have found it tricky going because of lack of contacts and the required technical expertise.Fuzzy picture for LCDsThe chorus of vendors bemoaning last year’s falling prices and lower demand for liquid crystal display screens is getting noisier by the day.The week saw LG Electronics announce its lowest net profit in four quarters, while Japanese giant Sony previously announced a 13 per cent fall in operating profit.Samsung, the world’s largest maker of LCD televisions, and LG Philips, the second largest, have also brought negative tidings as their profits have been dented by sliding flat screen prices.The consensus is that the over-optimistic flat screen productivity of last year and the ensuing price squeeze are to blame for listless display sector performances.But despite the doom and the gloom, some companies are seeing a ray of hope for the end of the year.Sony remains determined to regain ground in the LCD product sector and plans a whole range of new products as part of that initiative, while Samsung has predicted a recovery in LCD prices as early as the second quarter.LG Philips, which expects an upturn in the second half, has also displayed confidence by pledging an aggressive 20 per cent increase in capital spending to Won4,580bn this year.But analysts have struck a note of caution, saying that although prices could bottom out over the current quarter, the oversupply of LCDs in the market may hold off any hope of a sharp upturn in prices.SAP and Oracle square-upSAP displayed a sharp eye for an opportunity as it revealed a battle plan aimed at stealing customers from Oracle and PeopleSoft at a time when its arch rivals are absorbed by their own merger.Europe’s largest software maker pledged a “year of investment” in which it planned to hire some 3,000 extra staff and make small acquisitions to bolster license revenues and win market share.SAP has already preyed on the concerns Peoplesoft’s customers may have regarding the future of the company’s software with product offers and promises of support for their PeopleSoft software.But Oracle, which has cut costs to boost earnings per share, has not taken SAP’s strategy lightly. The group was quick to retaliate, saying it would “love to get in a technology war with SAP”.SAP’s ambitions also come at a price. The group said operating margins - which rose 1 percentage point to 28 per cent last year - would be squeezed to 0-0.5 percentage points this time.But it hoped the short-term decline would pay off by 2007, when it expected margins to top 30 per cent.SAP now has a 38 per cent share of the US market and was confident it could increase software license sales - a key gauge of growth prospects - by 10-12 per cent this year, ahead of expectations.The group also revealed a fourth-quarter profit rise of 29 per cent to €542m and sales up 8 per cent to €2.8bn.Mobile subscriber warsThe battle for Europe’s biggest mobile phone market intensified with T-Mobile, Germany’s leading wireless carrier, losing ground in its home market to UK interlopers Vodafone and MMO2.T-Mobile only signed up a measily 113,000 customers in Germany in the key Christmas quarter compared with 843,000 from Vodafone and 729,000 from MMO2.The figures show the latest fallout from the decision by T-Mobile, the wireless arm of Deutsche Telekom, to cut the amount it spends to win new customers as part of a wider €1bn cost-cutting plan.Operators have poured money into marketing and handset subsidies in a bid to extend their client base in the highly competitive and saturated German market.But while MMO2, who announced the long-awaited launch - on February 1 - of its third generation service, was crowing about its analyst-pleasing German figures, in an ironic twist T-Mobile outperformed the company in the UK.T-Mobile’s engine of growth continued to be the lucrative US market where it added another million customers.Vodafone, the sector giant, powered ahead, saying that its best Christmas performance since 2000 had driven its worldwide subscriber base to more than 150m. Vodafone Live!, the group’s branded data service, enjoyed its best quarter with 3.9m new additions.However, average revenue per user fell in some of its key markets, including the UK , Germany and Japan, amid heavy competition and it refused to say how well its recently launched third generation service was performing.Meanwhile, Nokia reasserted its position as the world’s leading maker of mobile phones after it reported a smaller-than-expected fall in profits and said it was winning back market share on the back of new “clamshell” designed handsets and cameraphones.
1097;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-01-27T18:42:51Z;Saving a Silicon Valley survivor;;"Mike Lawrie is sitting in a London hotel room explaining why he left the solid kingdom of International Business Machines for the wild shores of Siebel Systems. ""People always say to me: 'Why did you leave IBM? You were the number two or three guy. Why did you leave?' Well, I traded scale for scope. This is very rich in scope.""It is indeed. From a giant of the computer industry that has put its crisis days behind it, Mr Lawrie moved last May to become chief executive of a company that is still in the middle of a maelstrom.Siebel Systems is a Silicon Valley software company that enjoyed rapid growth during the 1990s, aided by an aggressive sales force, only to suffer a severe hangover from 2002 onwards.Like other troubled software companies, it turned to the executive bench of IBM for a figure who could restore stability and patch up the damage done to its relations with customers and shareholders.In the same vein, John Swainson, another IBM veteran, was recently appointed chief executive of Computer Associates, after 15 of its executives left following an accounting fraud.IBM's culture is less racy than the typical business applications software company. Tom Siebel, who founded Siebel Systems in 1993, was part of a diaspora from Oracle, the archetypal hard-driving software company. Larry Ellison of Oracle set the tone of rapid growth based on the aggressive selling of software licences to companies, with the promise of huge productivity benefits.It did not always work out like that. Many customers were over-sold licences and found their software hard to integrate. Companies such as Siebel suffered from the backlash as customers refused to buy more licences: that led to declining revenues and a falling stock price.Mr Siebel, who remains chairman, handed operational control to someone the board hoped would do things another way.Mr Lawrie is clearly a different character to Mr Siebel. His last role at IBM was heading its $80bn sales operation and he is a seasoned corporate executive rather than a visionary entrepreneur. He is outgoing and well-schooled in the language of corporate turnrounds, even down to citing Who Moved My Cheese?, Spencer Johnson's allegorical bestseller on responding to change.Mr Lawrie insists that he is happy that Mr Siebel remains chairman. ""I run the business - but he is somebody I can bounce ideas off and get practical advice, some of which I listen to and some of which I don't. Many entrepreneurs never recognise that their business needs to change, but he did. It is a real attribute of Tom's - as a business person and an individual - that he could re-evaluate.""Three months into the job, Mr Lawrie took 55 executives to Harvard Business School for a four-day teach-in and discussion about the company's future. The group slept in dormitories, and discussed the company's troubles and similar cases of corporate crisis with academics who had studied Siebel. His intention was to convince his team of the need to change their assumptions.""More often than not, management is slow to accept that the cheese has moved and the longer they deny it, the bigger trouble they get into,"" he explains. ""The purpose was to make sure that everyone knew the facts, and given that, to ask them: 'What do you want to do? Do you want to keep running the same play?' . . . I don't know yet whether it worked. The story is still unfolding.""One aspect of the company Mr Lawrie has tried to tackle personally is its sales culture. ""Siebel was enormously successful in creating a whole new product category . . . but it became a victim of its own success,"" he says. ""The Siebel way became rigid and inflexible and began to turn the customers off. They found the company hard to work with. There was less listening and more telling.""In an effort to reverse that, Mr Lawrie has spent half his time since May visiting corporate customers to tell them what he is doing to alter things. He uses his visits for another purpose - to train his sales force. ""I take our young reps and others with me, and I try to model for them what it means to listen, to respond to what someone is looking for and needs,"" he says.Mr Lawrie is also changing the company's remuneration policy so that his sales staff are rewarded not simply for selling software licences, but also for the longer-term value Siebel gets from a customer relationship. He says the company needs to be more accountable to its customers - not just for whether its software works, but whether it delivers the concrete benefit that the corporations who license it are seeking.""That is a whole heck of a lot different from asking: 'Does the software function, does it scale to 2,000 users, does this bit get to that side of the screen?' "" he says.Reforming Siebel's modus operandi is not Mr Lawrie's only task. The company faces a disruptive competitor in Salesforce.com. Siebel pioneered customer relationship management (CRM) software, which is used to collect and analyse information from a company's sales force about its customers. Salesforce.com offers the same facility in another form - customers subscribe to an online service rather than buying software.This not only transfers the operational risk away from the customers; it also allows them to rent rather than pay up front for a set of licences. ""Companies will not sign up for these mega-implementations of new software any more because they fail,"" says Marc Benioff, the ebullient chief executive of Salesforce.com. ""We are seeing the old industry dying. Its future is very uncertain.""That has accelerated the fall in licence revenues for Siebel, which has brought out its own ""on-demand"" service. It also announced last month that it would put more emphasis on sales to small and medium-sized companies, which have been the most eager buyers of on-demand services. But Mr Lawrie says that Siebel need not be too frightened by the industry's shifting patterns of demand.""We were slow to get started with this, and a lot of people were afraid that it would cannibalise our market. But application sales have declined, so guess what? That is less of a threat than it used to be,"" he says with a laugh. He adds that it should offer customers a choice of how they receive its software - as a service, as out-of-the-box software or in a customised form.Each sale remains a struggle for now. Siebel's shares have fallen from a high of $119.31 November 2000 to about $9.12 today. ""We have seen declining revenue, profitability and stock price: not exactly what an investor is looking to see.""He knows that he does not have endless time. Oracle recently agreed a takeover of PeopleSoft after a long tussle and Mr Ellison says it is seeking other acquisitions. Mr Lawrie says shareholders decide whether Siebel should remain independent, but ""I am not running this company and positioning it to be purchased. I am running it with the expectation that we are going to rebuild the business"".There is still plenty of IBM man about Mr Lawrie, including the example he cites for his approach: Lou Gerstner, who gradually changed a company that many believed was stuck in the past.""Leadership is aspirational. You have to articulate what you aspire to be, then all the little things you do, day in day out, have to be consistent with that. Over time, you become what you aspire to be.""HOW MIKE LAWRIE MOVED SIEBEL’S CHEESE• He transferred from IBM seeking to trade scale for scope. But he advocates Big Blue’s culture, which is less racy than the typical business software company• He cites Lou Gerstner, former head of IBM, as a model leader. “Leadership is aspirational,” he says. “Over time, you become what you aspire to be.”• He took advice from Tim Siebel, the company’s founder, but made up his own mind on the big decisions. “He is somebody I can bounce ideas off and get practical advice [from] - some of which I listen to and some of which I don’t.”• He cited Spencer Johnson’s self-help book ‘Who Moved My Cheese’• He took 55 top executives to Harvard Business School for a four-day discussion. “The purpose was to make sure that everyone knew the facts and to ask them: ‘What do you want to do?’ “• He has taken young sales reps to corporate customers. “I try to model for them what it means to listen, to respond to what someone is looking for and needs.”"
1098;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-01-26T19:40:09Z;SAP plans ‘year of investment' and growth;;Germany's SAP on Wednesday declared 2005 a “year of investment” in which it planned to hire extra staff, increase software licence revenues and win market share at a time when US rival Oracle is busy with the integration of PeopleSoft.Europe's largest software company forecast that its software licence sales, the key gauge for software companies' future growth prospects, would grow by 10-12 per cent this year, more than many observers had expected.Some 3,000 planned hires, focused on low-cost countries such as India, as well as small acquisitions, come at the price of lower margin growth.SAP forecast its operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs, would rise by only up to 0.5 percentage points in 2005. Last year, it rose by 1 percentage point to 28 per cent.The softer than expected margin outlook sent SAP shares lower on Wednesday. However, Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said the current investment drive would bear fruit by 2007, by which time SAP expects its margins to top 30 per cent.“SAP remains on track to cement further gains against its peers and deliver an acceleration in growth. We remain positive on SAP, given its improving competitive positioning, gearing into a wider IT spending recovery and longer term opportunity to leverage sales in the application integration market,” said analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.SAP has launched an offensive to win PeopleSoft customers after the Oracle takeover, and on Wednesday said its US market share had reached 38 per cent by the end of December, up from 32 per cent a year earlier.Group fourth quarter net profit rose 29 per cent to €542m ($709m) on sales of €2.8bn, up 8 per cent. Licence sales for the quarter were up 8 per cent, at €1bn.Flat software licence sales growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa disappointed investors. But board member Léo Apotheker said licence sales in the region would this year grow faster than the market.
1099;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;SAP and Oracle set to fight for dominance;;Oracle and SAP on Wednesday set out their plans for what Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive, called ?the stack wars? the looming battle between the US and German technology giants to dominate the market for complex corporate software.The two companies also outlined starkly different financial strategies, with SAP saying it would spend heavily to maintain its growth rate and grab market share while Oracle cuts costs following its PeopleSoft acquisition in order to boost earnings.Mr Ellison warned of a head-on confrontation as the two companies, which used to occupy different parts of the software business, converge on the integrated ?stacks? or multiple layers of software that make up corporate information technology systems.?For SAP to pick a technology war with Oracle …this is just madness,? he said. ?We would love to get in a technology war with SAP.?For its part, the German software giant said it would add 3,000 staff this year in an effort to lift new licence revenues by 10-12 per cent more than most observers had expected. Calling 2005 a ?year of investment?, Europe's largest software company said it was pushing to win market share at a time when Oracle was busy integrating PeopleSoft.SAP said its US market share had reached 38 per cent by the end of December, up from 32 per cent a year earlier.However, that expansion will come at the expense of improved profitability. SAP forecast that its operating margin excluding stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs would rise by 0.5 percentage points at the most in 2005. Last year, it rose by 1 percentage point to28 per cent.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, said the investment drive would bear fruit by 2007, by which time SAP expects its margins to top 30 per cent.Mr Ellison, meanwhile, ridiculed SAP's decision to sacrifice short-term profit growth. ?We're [earnings per share] obsessed,? he said. ?It's just good management discipline.?By cutting costs including reducing headcount by 5,000 following the PeopleSoft deal Oracle forecast that earnings per share would reach 76-80 cents in its next fiscal year, an increase of as much as 29 per cent from the year before.However, Oracle failed to issue any forecast for its new licence growth, hinting instead that it might have difficulty boosting new business in the applications software market, where PeopleSoft had specialised.
1100;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-01-26T07:38:37Z;Constructing e-mail links;;A building site can be an unpredictable environment, particularly for workers trying to maintain constant e-mail contact with colleagues and clients. “There’s a lot of machinery which causes radio interference and also other workers who will move or cut a cable to get on with their job. It’s very challenging at a site to keep the technology functioning,” explains Gregg Davis, senior vice president and CIO of Webcor, a leading Californian construction company.Wi-Fi technology (a wireless hotspot or Lan) might sound as if it should be the solution to supporting e-mail, but Mr Davis says it offers poor connectivity with so much concrete and steel around, as well as having poor security.However, the company’s project managers sometimes want rapid answers from architects as well as sub-contractors such as electricians and plumbers, while its project directors need to liaise with the owners of a building, he explains.“What we’re building are 50-storey buildings, but they are often prototypes. These are not cookie-cutter designs so you can find a situation where an air conditioning duct looks as though it’s supposed to go through a wall that can’t be penetrated. The manager has to put in an e-mail to the architect. We need an answer quickly. We can’t sit and twiddle our thumbs.”Webcor has built a range of large-scale projects in California including hotels, residential housing, shopping and office developments for clients including US tech companies Adobe, Electronic Arts, Oracle and Symantec.In the past, the company issued all 75 of its managers with a laptop, which they used to access their e-mail from a site office, along with PDAs and mobile phones. Then 15 months ago, Webcor opted for a smartphone customised with software for its individual needs, so that the managers could get at their e-mail securely while on site. The customised solution also enables them to access corporate applications. The company uses palmOne Treo 600 smartphones and the software is supplied by US vendor Good Technology.Early last year Webcor went a stage further by introducing a programme whereby managers could exchange their laptops, cellular phones and PDA for the combination of a Treo smartphone and a desktop PC. So far around one-third of them have swapped, with a saving in 2004 of $75,000 for the company because it no longer has to provide costly technical support for laptops.The screen of a smartphone is smaller than that of a laptop, making it unsuitable if employees need to study a technical drawing, but this limitation does have one advantage on a building site, according to Mr Davis: “With the mobile we can control more of what’s on the screen. It’s not good for workers to be looking at devices while in a hazardous area. We considered offering tablet PCs to the workers, but they blocked the view of their feet so they might walk into a trench or whack their heads.”
1101;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2005-01-19T23:35:53Z;SAP courts PeopleSoft's clients with purchase;;SAP, the German maker of business-management software, is trying to court PeopleSoft clients, after the US brand was taken over by its rival Oracle, FT Deutschland, the FT's sister newspaper has learnt.SAP has purchased the Californian software maintenance provider TomorrowNow. TomorrowNow offers its services to about 100 companies that use programs from SAP, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards, which was bought by PeopleSoft in 2003. While Oracle tries to reassure unsettled PeopleSoft customers post the merger, SAP on Wednesday announced it would continue to administer PeopleSoft products for clients ready to switch to SAP.?We expect a major number of [these clients] to come to us,? said Peter Graf, SAP's senior vice-president.According to SAP board member Shai Agassi, the current number of 100 employees at TomorrowNow will be significantly increased.SAP refused to disclosethe acquisition price.SAP's move is intended to lure any of PeopleSoft's 12,750 customers concerned about the future of the company after it was purchased by Oracle.The world market leader for business-management software and its toughest rival Oracle are competing to equip big companies with standard software for accountancy and client administration.?This is a very serious offer and very aggressive on SAP's part,? said Joshua Greenbaum, an analyst with Enterprise Applications Consulting in Berkeley.But one uncertainty over the deal for SAP is the fact that companies usually stay with a software program for a very long time.To make its $10.3bn purchase of PeopleSoft a success, Oracle has to keep the clients in order to generate earnings through the important maintenance business.?We will preserve your investment in these products,? Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive, promised thousands of clients on a webcast conference on Tuesday.
1102;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Lex: SAP;;"Ambitious plans are a bit like country lanes: one never knows where they are going to lead. With Wednesday's acquisition of TomorrowNow which provides support for PeopleSoft software SAP is offering the US group's customers a road map to reach its own NetWeaver platform. So far, the German software maker has benefited from the uncertainty created by Oracle's battle to win PeopleSoft. Moreover, by creating a duopoly in many segments, Oracle's move looks set to boost all software makers, at the expense of their clients.Buying TomorrowNow should help SAP tweak its migration offerings at a time when its rivals are vulnerable. But although no financial details were given, the deal also shows that further market share gains might come at a heavy price. With sales still weak in Europe, SAP needs to boost marketing and development spend to keep up its US momentum. While its share of clients' IT budgets looks set to grow further, NetWeaver will expand its presence in lower end applications, adding to pressure on margins. All this leaves consensus estimates looking ambitious. SAP is trading at a still feisty 26 times this year's earnings, excluding stock-based compensation. No wonder that investors have become less infatuated with their former sweetheart. Like companies who have tried to upgrade to a different IT platform, they might have learned a lesson from bitter experience; piling on to a crowded road can sometimes lead to a frustrating journey."
1103;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;Oracle extends PeopleSoft tender;;Oracle has extended its offer period for the tender of outstanding shares in PeopleSoft by two days after failing to gain a high enough stake to complete its long-running merger with the US enterprise software company.Although it took majority control of PeopleSoft in December following a protracted takeover battle, Oracle cannot buy out remaining shareholders until at least 90 per cent of the outstanding stock has been tendered.By the 8pm deadline on Tuesday, PeopleSoft stockholders had tendered about 357.68m shares comprising up to 89.4 per cent of the group’s outstanding stock.Oracle said it would extend the deadline to midnight on Thursday, to give shareholders more time to accept its terms.PeopleSoft’s board, which held out for 18 months against Oracle’s hostile bid, has since advised shareholders to accept the increased offer of $26.50 a share following pressure from investors.Dave Duffield, the PeopleSoft co-founder who returned to run the company after the ousting of Craig Conway, resigned after the board decided to support the latest bid.Oracle has appointed four of its own nominees as directors of the PeopleSoft board and Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, has said that he intended to remove all of senior managers at PeopleSoft once he had control of the company.

However, the deal will not now formally be completed until the new year.Dave Duffield, the PeopleSoft co-founder who returned to run the company this year after the ousting of Craig Conway, resigned late on Tuesday.Mr Duffield had held out against his board's eventual decision to agree to Oracle's bid, though he was eventually overruled.Oracle said that holders of some 75 per cent of PeopleSoft's shares had tendered their stock by the deadline it had set of midnight on Tuesday.PeopleSoft's board had advised shareholders to accept an increased offer of $26.50 a share, after bowing to pressure from many of its investors to end its resistance to a deal.With majority control, Oracle said it had appointed four of its own nominees as directors of the PeopleSoft board. Two of the existing directors would remain on the board until the merger had been completed, it added.Oracle cannot complete the merger, and buy out the remaining shareholders, until at least 90 per cent of the outstanding stock has been tendered.It extended the deadline for its offer by a week, until midnight next Tuesday, to allow time for more shareholders to accept.Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, said this month that he intended to remove all of PeopleSoft's senior management once he had control of the company.However, he also indicated that Oracle would keep on many more PeopleSoft employees than had been expected.It will retain a development team to work on PeopleSoft's products at its head office in Pleasanton, California, and bring some of its salespeople into Oracle's own salesforce.
1105;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-17T21:37:10Z;Muted gains on Wall St mask M&A surge;;"Wall Street crept higher this week as muted gains in the key indices masked a frenzy of merger and acquisition activity and left the stock market hovering close to yearly and multi-year highs.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial average was down 0.5 per cent on the day on Friday at 10,649.26. The broader S&P 500 index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,194.22 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent at 2,135.20.The downward move rounded out a week that saw the Dow rise 1 per cent. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent, while the Nasdaq was up 0.3 per cent.None of the three main indices moved more than 1 per cent above or below their opening in any of last week's sessions, typifying the modest movements that have dominated recent stock market activity.Joe McAlinden, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Mangement, said the market's tight trading range in recent months partly reflected the increased influence of hedge funds, which seek returns from both upward and downward movements in shares.""Everybody's trying to play a trend one way or another,"" he said. ""As soon as a trend starts to get going, the guys on the other side come in.""The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both touched 3½-year highs this week in spite of the slow pace of gains, and bullish investors remain optimistic that a rally after the Christmas holiday will help cement the year's strong gains.Mergers and acquisitions dominated the action on Wall Street as companies announced more than $85bn in deals - the highest weekly US total since January 2000.PeopleSoft ended a bitter takeover battle on Monday by agreeing to a $10.3bn offer by its business software rival Oracle. Shares in both companies jumped by more than 10 per cent.Sprint and Nextel, the telecommunications rivals, added to the merger buzz on Wednesday when they announced a $35bn ""merger of equals"". Shares in both companies fell 4 per cent after the widely expected deal was announced.Johnson & Johnson rose 4.1 per cent on Thursday as investors welcomed the healthcare group's $24bn acquisition of Guidant, the maker of cardiac stents. Guidant shares dipped 0.2.Symantec, the security software group, fell more than 8 per cent, adding to Monday's 16 per cent fall, as it revealed a $13bn deal to buy Veritas.

1106;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-17T12:27:17Z;The week in technology: Oracle wins Peoplesoft;;PeopleSoft finally surrendered its independence this week as it accepted a sweetened $10.3bn offer from Oracle, drawing an end to a bid battle that has raged for 18 months.Despite reassurances from Dave Duffield, PeopleSoft’s founder, that he had no intention of selling the software company when he returned two months ago, the group’s shareholders had the final say on the future of the company.Oracle’s initial opportunistic approach for $16 per share in June 2003 raised questions over the sincerity of its takeover attempt and was unsurprisingly snubbed by Peoplesoft.Since then the two software groups have been locked in a dramatic bidding war, which has seen the dismissal of Craig Conway, PeopleSoft’s former chief executive, accusations that PeopleSoft set up poison pill defences in an attempt to thwart the bid, and the overruling by the US district court in San Francisco of the US justice department’s desire to block the bid.The final offer price of $26.50 per share - 66 per cent higher than the first bid - has left some analysts wondering whether Oracle has overpaid.The group has also had to shelve its original plans to close PeopleSoft’s operations and encourage its customers to adopt its own products in fear of a mass defection by PeopleSoft’s customers.Oracle, which also this week celebrated the fact that its performance in the latest quarter had topped Wall Street’s expectations, said it would launch a new generation of PeopleSoft software within two years.Virtual libraryOne day students will not even have to get out of bed to dig out that obscure, out-of-print thesis by Heidelberg from the deepest vaults of the university library but will simply pull it down from the internet.And they will have Google to thank. The search-engine company announced this week extraordinary plans to scan and digitise millions of books from the collections of five of the world’s top libraries.The new world of wired up scholarship will allow people to read, download and - better still for students - search within books from a virtual library drawn from the university collections of Oxford, Harvard, Stanford, Michigan, Oxford and the New York Public Library.Although recently published books will not be fully accessible, wired-up scholars will be able to view the full content of works that have lost their copyright and may be incredibly rare.No details were given of how much the scheme will cost or how long it will take, although some experts predicted it would take a decade or more to complete.At the Bodleian library in Oxford, home to 8m books dating back 500 years, its inclusion in the Google Print project provoked comparisons with Gutenberg.“This could be almost as significant as the invention of the printing press in the sense that a great mass of information is going to be made available much more readily to people all over the world,” said Ronald Milne of Oxford University’s library services.US companies count the cost of share optionsCompanies across Silicon Valley were dealt a blow as the US introduced a new accounting standard that will force them to take off the cost of share options from their earnings.Companies have long used options as an incentive to staff without having to disclose them in their results statements.The Financial Accounting Standards Board decided to implements the new regulations to bring the US in line with international standards. It said recognising the cost of share-based payments increased the reliability of financial information, as well as making it easier to compare companies’ performance.But the news was met by a wave of opposition in Silicon Valley. Companies have appealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission to step in and overrule the regulations.BT out of the loopThe cost of broadband is set to drop after Britain’s media regulator ordered BT to slash the charges other companies pay to use its “local loop” exchanges.Ofcom published price cuts of 60-70 per cent for connection charges for BT’s wholesale services covering local exchanges and the last-mile access to customer households or businesses.Competing operators such as Cable Wireless or Easynet were expected to welcome the changes, which should stimulate investment in local loop infrastructure.BT insiders predicted the price changes would encourage new operators to move into local loop services. But some executives questioned whether competition would open up in rural areas with relatively few customers compared to densely populated and more internet connected urban markets.
1107;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-15T20:35:44Z;Observer - US;;"Oracle alums in a slump?It hasn't been a good year for the Oracle alumni.Until recently, defectors from Oracle's glittering glass towers in Redwood City held some of the plum jobs in the software industry.There was Tom Siebel, whose Siebel Systems shot to prominence as one of the industry's most successful newcomers of the 1990s. In an effort to pull the company out of its slump, however, he has just handed over the reins to Mike Lawrie, a former IBMer.Then there was Craig Conway, who was ousted as boss of PeopleSoft this autumn. To add insult to injury, PeopleSoft this week succumbed to a takeover by Conway's former mentor, Oracle founder Larry Ellison.Now comes news that Gary Bloom, the whizkid who shot to prominence as head of Veritas, another upstart software company, may soon be eclipsed. A takeover by Symantec, now under discussion, would rob Bloom of his role as top dog after a four-year stint. Bloom, a collector of old cars, has gone out of his way to distance himself from the famously aggressive Oracle culture - even though he thrived in it. And his fast-talking, purposeful style certainly lacks the brashness so typical of the Oracle breed.Even if he stays on after a deal, Bloom would be playing second fiddle to Symantec's John Thompson - another former IBM executive. At 43, that would instantly turn him into one of Silicon Valley's most sought-after chief executives-in-waiting.Still, at least one executive who learned the ropes at Oracle looks likely to end the year on a high note. Mark Benioff, head of Salesforce.com, pulled off one of the year's most talked-about initial public offerings. And don't forget Ellison himself: having just snapped up PeopleSoft, he remains the undisputed leader of the gang.Nextel's raceNever mind the shareholders, the employees, or even analysts. The most important blessing for Sprint's $35bn proposed merger with Nextel might have come from Nascar, the auto racing company that has a 10-year sponsorship agreement with the wireless company.""They are very excited about it,"" said Tom Kelly, Nextel's chief operating officer, at yesterday's deal announcement in the lavish St Regis hotel in Manhattan.It was only 10am, but Kelly, the architect of the sponsorship, had already spoken to Nascar about the merger. He explained that, with 75m fans, Nascar was one of Nextel's most important relationships. For all the talk about synergies and complementary technologies, maybe that's what Sprint was really after.Walking warningManfred Gentz wasted no time in finding a job after his last day - today - as chief financial officer of DaimlerChrysler.The man whose downbeat manner got him nicknamed ""the closest thing to a walking profit warning"" is to become the next chairman of Zurich Financial Services, one of the world's top insurance groups.No matter that Gentz, who gained his sobriquet as the sober foil to the ebullient Jürgen Schrempp, has no insurance experience. He has at least sat on the supervisory board of the Swiss group's German operation, and has had indirect responsibility for DaimlerChrysler's big financial services activities.Gentz demonstrated his political savvy and his business connections a few years back. Working to lift the burden of a dark chapter of German history, he helped chancellor Gerhard Schröder secure a ground-breaking compensation deal for Nazi-era forced labourers.But the modest, mild-mannered 62-year-old will probably be the last to claim he was an obvious choice for the Zurich job. It has been an open secret that, after internal wrangles this year, the Swiss group's board had been searching for a suitable candidate.Zig zagWhat do you do for an encore after coming across as crazed and erratic on national television? If you're Zell Miller, you sign on with Fox News.The life-long Democrat from Georgia whose frothy, fiery address at this summer's Republican National Convention was one of the more memorable moments, will become a contributor in January, when he leaves the Senate.In the aftermath of his speech, which led more than one pundit to question Miller's sanity, he chatted with Chris Matthews, the CNBC talk show host, and ended up challenging him to a duel. (Matthews declined.) Now he could end up taking direct aim at the Hardball host as Miller's brand of invective is released, according to Fox, on an as-needed basis. Stay tuned.Holiday cheersThis just in from the good folks at Dale Carnegie: ""There are more opportunities for a professional faux pas during the holidays than any other time of the year, and workers should be on their best behaviour.""Ah, yes, the dancing that starts bad and only ever gets worse is upon us again. Or as Peter Handal, chief executive, puts it, ""inappropriate or foolish behaviour that co-workers remember . . . for a very long time"".So what to do to keep from becoming the centre of water cooler gossip? Designate ""a party chaperon . . . to cut you off before things turn ugly"". Wiser words were never spoken.Bonus songHere comes a little ditty to show that finance types are not always thinking about money: sometimes they're singing about it. This one has a particularly seasonal theme and goes to the tune of Band Aid's Do They Know its Christmas?It's bonus time,Just how much will we be paid?At bonus time,We find out just who made the grade,And in our world of envy,There's no place for being coy,Suck up to your boss at bonus time.Cue the chorus: Feed my ego, let them know it's bonus time.observer@ft.com"
1108;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-15T07:44:27Z;Ecosystems - own one or join one;;IT professionals must make increasing contributions to corporate goals of revenue, profit and cash flow. Gartner finds that some of the most heated debates between the IT organisation and business operations centre around the issue of change - mostly IT’s inability to respond timely and effectively to it.For years IT has responded to business change by implementing new technology and applications. This has resulted in a lengthening of the IT change cycle at a time when pressures to change in the business cycle has continued to shrink. A number of advances offer hope of progress, however, we believe it is changes in the field of software that can have most impact in providing the agility businesses need to keep pace with change.Major changes are happening in the business applications software industry that go well beyond technical issues. Users of packaged applications are seeking more agility in adjusting to changes in enterprise policies and strategies. At the same time, IT is still under pressure to cut costs or maintain current budgets. The result of this activity is that acquirers of packaged business applications are shifting IT projects from large multi-year marathons to rapid deployment gap applications, and reconfiguration of existing systems to meet these demands.In this, new technologies built around component software architectures will for the first time offer organisations the ability to develop, test, use, re-use, add, and modify functionality needed to serve the business without having to redesign the systems from scratch. As the needs of the business move, so can the software applications be developed in a synchronized fashion.Makers of applications software that help companies manage tasks from payroll to inventory to customer relations, like SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, must carve smaller pieces out of their large packages to adjust to these demands. For this to take place, services oriented architectures (SOA) are a prerequisite. This provides the structure to rapidly develop software applications, not from scratch, but from modifying existing software and only adding specific new functions to support the required new process.Gartner believes that through 2009, organisations that incorporate service-oriented development of applications principles in their development of business applications for internal and external consumption will achieve related process efficiency increases of at least 15 percent.The vendor response to this requirement has been varied – from consolidation exercises such as Oracle’s unsolicited – but now agreed – bid to acquire rival PeopleSoft - to the announcement of major changes to large software packages occurring over a number of years, for example SAP’s change from R/3 to mySAP ERP. As the vendors make the necessary changes in the applications, they must also ensure that those pieces can plug into other products, possible even competing products, as companies cherry-pick more specialised programs from different vendors and have them operate together seamlessly.This shift will have significant implications for both users and business application vendors. Gartner expects consolidation of software vendors across three areas of capability – software technology, business process, and business strategy related to IT. This is already starting to happen with large vendors creating what Gartner terms “ecosystems” where they shape the environment and create frameworks and standards within which other vendors operate.These ecosystems will initially be developed around major providers of services and business applications such as IBM, SAP, and Microsoft. Application stack wars have already erupted among these vendors who are all vying for customers, ISVs (independent software vendors) and VARs (value-added resellers) to adopt their form of the “application technology stack” consisting of technologies that formerly are associated with application development (e.g. integration middleware, application servers). Recent agreements by PeopleSoft and IBM just reinforce the focus now being placed on the ‘stack’ and the partnering around the ecosystem.Ultimately, ecosystems will consist of both large and small vendors who will depend on each other to thrive. To survive, smaller or point solution focused vendors will increasingly select to exist in an ecosystem where they adjust to an environment that will include business application functionality, technology and services (e.g. PeopleSoft’s recent announcement to adopt IBM’s Websphere).Likewise companies buying software will be faced with buying into an ecosystems rather than making an individual purchasing decision for an application to meet a specific need.Type A (leading-edge), type B (mainstream) and type C (conservative) enterprises will adopt the next-generation applications at a different pace. Gartner believes type A enterprises will move quickly to implement early SOA styles and therefore be the first to consider ecosystems. Type B enterprises will begin to refocus their architectures and rebuild infrastructures during 2005, but wait for wide availability and stability of new applications before beginning implementation in the 2007 frame.Type C enterprises will wait until next-generation approaches are proven and mainstream, but by 2010 most will adapt their architectures and infrastructures to begin implementing these new applications and thus will live in one or more of the major ecosystems that have evolved by that time.Yvonne Genovese is Gartner’s vice-president, business applications
1109;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-14T20:10:02Z;Symantec in talks to acquire Veritas for $13bn;;Symantec was on Tuesday in advanced talks to acquire Veritas Software for about $13bn, joining a wave of mergers and acquisitions activity in the US technology industry.An agreement, which would unite two of the largest players in the expanding software security and storage sector, could be announced this week, said people familiar with the matter.However, other groups, including EMC, the largest data storage company, were casting an eye over Veritas on Tuesday to decide whether to make their own bids.Once an industry high-flier, Veritas stumbled in July after an earnings restatement and a collapse in demand for large new software purchases by companies in the US. It faces a new threat next year when Microsoft's own data back-up product is due.Led by John Thompson, a former IBM executive, Symantec has ridden the computer security crisis to become one of Silicon Valley's hottest software companies. A purchase of Veritas would boost its business with large corporate and government buyers, adding to its mainly consumer and small business base.“An entity of this size would have similar gravitas to companies such as the IBM Software Group, EMC Software Group, and Cisco,” said analysts from Goldman Sachs in a research note released on Tuesday.Although exact terms were still being negotiated last night, the talks involve Symantec paying about $30 a share for Veritas , a 19 per cent premium over Veritas's share price on Monday. The talks were first reported in The New York Times on Tuesday.Coming the day after Oracle sealed an agreed $10.3bn takeover of PeopleSoft, the talks point to acceleration of consolidation among the so-called infrastructure software companies whose products form the guts of corporate IT systems.But Veritas, which specialises in storage back-up software, would be a better fit for a company that already had a large presence in the storage business and could reap more immediate cost benefits , said David Rudow, software analyst at Piper Jaffray.Oracle, which has declared its intention to lead the consolidation in the software industry, would be the most logical buyer, he added. However, Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive officer, on Monday ruled his company out of further big deals for at least the next year, until it had proved it could make a success of its PeopleSoft deal.In afternoon trade, Veritas Software rose 8.4 per cent to $27.31 on the Nasdaq.
1110;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-13T23:23:18Z;Oracle secures PeopleSoft for $10.3bn;;PeopleSoft succumbed to a sweetened $10.3bn (€7.56bn) takeover offer from Oracle on Monday, putting an end to a bitter 18-month battle that had sprung from slower growth and tougher times in the technology world.Larry Ellison, the Oracle chief executive who has promised to lead a broad consolidation in the software industry, said his company would stay out of the takeover market for at least a year while it proved it could reap the promised benefits from the deal.The end to the hostile takeover saga came after PeopleSoft had taken informal soundings of its shareholders recently and was told that it should negotiate the best deal it could rather than resist, according to one person familiar with the talks.Dave Duffield, the PeopleSoft founder who returned as chief executive officer two months ago, had told employees that he had not come back to sell the company. He was overruled by a transaction committee made up of the company's non-executive directors, the person said.Oracle sweetened its offer by $2.50 a share, or $1bn in all, to clinch the deal. At $26.50 a share in cash, the final price is 66 per cent higher than its opening bid of $16 a share and tops the $26 a share it offered earlier this year, though that bid was later lowered.To head off a mass defection by PeopleSoft customers, Mr Ellison said Oracle would bring out a new generation of the PeopleSoft software within two years.While the move had been hinted at in recent comments by Oracle executives, it was still a marked reversal of Oracle's initial rationale for the deal, which involved closing all of the PeopleSoft operations and encouraging its customers to adopt Oracle products.About 5,000 of PeopleSoft's 11,250 employees work on product development, though Oracle did not say how many would be retained.The agreed deal sent shares in both companies up by about 10 per cent, adding $8bn to their combined value.The enthusiasm was buoyed by news that Oracle's earnings had beaten Wall Street's expectations in its latest quarter, helped by a 57 per cent rebound in revenues at its struggling applications software business. However, some analysts warned that Oracle had eventually had to overpay to clinch the deal.“It's costing Oracle more than its cost of capital to buy PeopleSoft they would probably get a better deal buying their own shares,” said Charles Di Bona, a software analyst at Sanford C Bernstein. Keeping PeopleSoft's products and adding some of its employees to the Oracle sales force would dilute the financial benefits from the deal and add to the difficulties of making it work, he added.Oracle was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston, while PeopleSoft was advised by Citigroup Global Markets and Goldman Sachs.
1111;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-13T21:59:15Z;Wall Street climbs on acquisition news;;"Wall Street forged ahead on Monday as investors pounced on stronger-than-expected US retail sales figures and a flurry of merger and acquisition activity reinforced speculation of further deals.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 0.9 per cent at 10,640.39, while the S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,198.74.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shot up 1 per cent to 2,148.31, buoyed by news that PeopleSoft had agreed to a multi-billion dollar takeover by Oracle, its business software rival.Bullish investors welcomed signs of renewed vigour in the stock markets following last week's widely expected retreat, which came in the face of uncertainties about world oil supply and a slow, but steady, stream of economic data that presented a mixed picture of the state of the US economy.PeopleSoft shares soared more than 10.3 per cent to $26.42 as Oracle's sweetened $26.50 per share offer brought to an end a bitter 18-month fight for control of the business software group.Oracle shares jumped 10.2 per cent to $14.63 as the company added to investor relief at the end of the takeover battle by reporting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Siebel Systems, a business software rival, slipped 0.2 per cent to $9.97, while US-listed shares of SAP, the German business software group, rose 3.2 per cent to $45.05.PeopleSoft's $10.3bn price tag makes the acquisition one of several multi-billion dollar deals on Wall Street this month. It follows Johnson & Johnson's planned $24bn acquisition of Guidant, the cardiac stent maker, and the pending $35bn merger between Sprint and Nextel, the telecommunications groups. Talks are continuing on both deals, which were announced last week.Merger mania has taken hold across a wide range of sectors in recent days as companies mull whether to capitalise on this year's strong run on Wall Street to make acquisitions.John O'Donoghue, managing director of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that although he was not expecting another big deal before the year-end the recent M&A activity was likely to continue into 2005.""Balance sheets in the US are in probably as good a shape cash-wise as they've been in many years,"" he said, adding that the stock market's strong performance had left many companies in a good position to use their shares as currency in M&A transactions.Honeywell, the diversified manufacturer, rose 3 per cent to $36.35 after its $798m offer for Novar, the UK electrical equipment group, was approved by the company's board. Shares in Toys R Us rose 2.9 per cent to $20.49 after the Financial Times reported that Apollo and Permira, the private equity groups, had teamed up to bid for the US toy group's retail operations.Conexant, the semiconductor company, rose 4.5 per cent to $1.87 in spite of warning that sagging demand and lower market prices would lead to a greater-than-expected first-quarter loss. One trader said that investors were weighing Monday's news against the potential for strong gains at the first sign of a turnround in the chip sector, which some analysts have said could happen early next year.Retailers ended mixed following an early rally sparked by official US data showing that retail sales grew by a stronger-than-expected 0.1 per cent in November. The report by the US Commerce Department also said that October retail sales had been higher than first estimated.Wal-Mart, the retail giant, rose 0.5 per cent to $52.95, but shares in rival Target were 0.4 per cent lower at $51.51. Home Depot, the home improvement group, was up 0.2 per cent at $42.73.Analysts had been disappointed by early reports indicating lacklustre retail sales in November, which included ""Black Friday"" - the day after Thanksgiving - traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said the new data were a hopeful sign that retailers finally had the wind at their backs. ""Barring a major downward revision, we are set for a pretty robust holiday season.""Carmakers fell after motor vehicle and parts sales slipped 1.3 per cent in November, according to the government figures. General Motors slid 0.3 per cent to $38.80, while Ford dropped 0.1 per cent to $14.23."
1112;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-13T18:31:45Z;Ellison's ultimate declaration of sincerity;;So Larry Ellison really was serious all along.Eighteen months ago, when the Oracle founder and chief executive first lodged his hostile offer for rival software maker PeopleSoft, trying to guess his motives became the favourite parlour game in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.There was ample reason to doubt the sincerity of a bid that, at $16 a share, offered a premium of only 6 per cent to the company's share price. With a moderate recovery in tech spending under way and widespread hopes that this would eventually feed a rebound in the business applications software in which PeopleSoft specialises, the low-ball bid seemed opportunistic.Mr Ellison also did not mince words about his intentions for his rival: close PeopleSoft and encourage its customers to adopt Oracle's software. Given the high cost of installing and maintaining software, this left an immediate threat hanging over PeopleSoft: that its customers, unsure about its future, would simply stop buying its products.Either way, Oracle would win. And given Mr Ellison's reputation as the bad boy of the software industry, it should be no surprise that many assumed the worst: that Oracle's intention was simply to torpedo a rival.Mr Ellison has now made the ultimate declaration of his sincerity. By reaching agreement to buy PeopleSoft for $10.3bn in cash, he has raised the value of his initial offer per share by 66 per cent. Add the value of JD Edwards a smaller software company that PeopleSoft bought in the meantime and the price is double Oracle's first offer. To win its deal, Oracle has given ground on two fronts.On price, the agreed offer is marginally above the $26 Oracle offered this year before dropping its bid as the stock market lost confidence in the sector. Justifying that price on Monday, Mr Ellison echoed an argument that PeopleSoft itself has made in recent weeks: that it is a more valuable company than it was 18 months ago. Its maintenance revenues the regular annual fees that customers pay for updates of the company's software have risen 18 per cent this year.It is these reliable recurring revenues that were the target of Oracle's original bid. Mr Ellison said yesterday that closer examination of PeopleSoft's books over the weekend had shown its maintenance business to be ?stronger and more profitable than we thought?, justifying the higher price.The Oracle boss has also given ground when it comes to PeopleSoft's products. Separate development teams will continue to work on the next generation of both PeopleSoft and JD Edwards products, he said. Those versions will come out in ?12 to 24 months?.Longer term, though, Oracle still held out the prospect of converging all three products one of the initial rationales for the deal.Justifying this change in stance, Mr Ellison said the next generation of PeopleSoft products was 18 months closer than it had been at the time of the initial bid, so it made sense to complete the development.Recent independent surveys that have highlighted unease among PeopleSoft's customers may well have prompted this change of heart. Without the promise of upgrades, many PeopleSoft customers may simply end their maintenance contracts and buy less expensive support for their software systems from cheaper rivals.According to a survey by AMR, a tech research firm, 63 per cent of PeopleSoft customers said they would have ended their maintenance contracts. Oracle's financial plans had allowed for the loss of only about 15 per cent of the customers.Proving it can keep those customers happy while reaping the savings promised from the deal will be Oracle's main task over the next year, said Mr Ellison.
1113;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-12-08T23:18:12Z;EDS to scrap poison pill;;Electronic Data Systems, the second-largest computer services group, has become the latest US company to bow to shareholder pressure by dismantling its poison pill defence against hostile takeover.The company said it would terminate its current shareholder rights plan in February 2005 and would not put forward an alternative.EDS has had poison pill defences since 1996, when the company was spun-off from General Motors.US institutional shareholders have become increasingly vocal in their opposition to such plans, which are seen as interfering with the operation of the market for corporate control.Fortune Brands this week withdrew its shareholder rights plan in the face of shareholder opposition. Oracle, the software group, is engaged in a court battle to force target PeopleSoft to abandon its poison pill.However, not all US corporations are backing away from the defence. News Corporation last month proposed a poison pill after Liberty Media acquired an 8 per cent stake in the group. EDS is in the middle of a difficult turnround following the departure in early 2003 of Dick Brown, its former chief executive. The company has been viewed as a possible takeover target since Mr Brown left the company.EDS shareholders this year challenged a number of the company's corporate governance practices, including the shareholder rights plan and a ?staggered? board structure under which only a handful of directors came up for re-election each year.While the majority of shareholders voted in favour of dismantling the poison pill, the board in May rejected the proposal. Now it has reversed that position.?The board wants shareholders to focus on the performance of the company, not on corporate governance matters,? said EDS. The company also plans to abolish its staggered board and rules that require an 80 per cent supermajority of votes cast to remove directors.
1114;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-26T10:52:45Z;The week in technology: CA gets new chief;;CA gets its manComputer Associates has found a chief executive at long last after a seven-month man-hunt. John Swainson, a veteran middleware manager from IBM will step into the gap left by Sanjay Kumar, the previous chief, who was stripped of his role in April amid allegations of accounting malpractice and fraud.Mr Swainson’s career at Big Blue stretches back to the 1970s, where the company’s software business focused on middleware (the bits between the operating system and the application), and where CA’s portfolio of products are now also mainly focused.Mr Kumar’s predecessor was Charles Wang, CA’s founder, making Mr Swainson the first outsider to run the company.The announcement comes just weeks after CA settled a two-year fraud investigation by the US Department of Justice by paying a $225m fine and agreeing to closer outside scrutiny of its accounting. Mr Kumar has since been charged with fraud along with two other former CA executives as the group works to recover $1bn of bonuses paid to senior managers.Kenneth Cron, who has been interim chief executive since April, will remain in the chair during a four-to-six month transition period.PSoft’s poison pill under pressureAs CA closed question marks over its future leadership, Oracle’s bid for softare rival, PeopleSoft continued to bubble away as it once again called on PeopleSoft to redeem its “poison pill” defence.The renewed plea came after almost 61 per cent of PeopleSoft shareholders tendered their shares for Oracle’s $24 a share offer.Oracle said in a letter to the PeopleSoft board that it was for the company to redeem the poison pill rather than for the courts to decide. But later in the week it also announced it was putting up a raft of nominees to challenge PeopleSoft’s existing board of directors at its annual meeting in March next year.If Oracle candidates are all elected at the meeting, they would have the power to dissolve a poison pill that allows PeopleSoft to issue more shares and thwart a takeover.The week’s developments followed talks initiated by Oracle last weekend with the aim of announcing a deal before the market opened on Monday, but PeopleSoft was unwilling to budge - reiterating its view that its own business plan created superior value for shareholders.It also rejected Oracle’s suggestion that more than 60 per cent of its shares being tendered by stockholders was a decisive vote for the deal. However some others have viewed it as a demonstration by shareholders do not want Mr Ellison to walk away from the deal.Retail chief quits BTRumours of a boardroom split at BT were fuelled by the surprise resignation of Pierre Danon, the affable Frenchman who heads up its retail operations.Mr Danon, who leaves for a senior post at Capgemini early next year, had sometimes threatened to overshadow BT chief Ben Verwaayen by regularly courting publicity and maintaining a high profile in the City.Mr Danon’s departure triggered further speculation of a rift between the two executives over the clash of interests between BT’s wholesale arm and its retail business.In recent weeks, Mr Danon had spoken about wanting to invest in local loop unbundling in order to allow BT Retail to carry broadband internet traffic at cheaper rates, thus allowing to compete more aggressively with rivals.However, LLU requires the installation of expensive equipment in BT’s local exchanges at a time when the company is facing a string of challenges weighing on its finances - including greater competition, a multi-billion pound projct to digitalise its entire infrastructure and pressure from regulators to further open up its network to rivals and ensure they receive the same deals from BT that it offers its own retail arm.The ongoing quandary for BT, the former UK telecoms monopoly, has intensified since Ofcom, the communications regulator, demanded earlier this month that BT come up with a blueprint to force its retail and wholesale units to function as separate entities.Meanwhile, if there were any cracks in the relationship between Mr Verwayyen and Mr Danon, they did a very good job of papering over them.Mr Danon received an unprecedented send off for a departing executive, with his own press conference including an informal appearance and friendly banter from Mr Verwaayen himself.In the end, it was likely that frustrations with BT Retail’s regulatory shackles, which prevented it from undercutting rivals’ prices, prompted Mr Danon’s exit rather than any animosity with his chief - ambition and a lucrative pay deal not withstanding.China toughens up on foreign softwareInternational IT groups could find themselves fenced out of the rapidly growing chinese market as the country looked set to issue rules on the extent to which government departments must favour operators closer to home.Software groups such as Microsoft are likely to be jittery in the run up to the ruling, as officials who have eyed the draft policy said it intended to give more weight to domestic suppliers.It is thought that government buyers will be forced to distinguish between software that is domestic, non-domestic and preferred domestic. Departments will have to apply for permission to buy non-domestic software.China’s ministry of science and technology was quoted criticising costly and faulty foreign software and saying that some local chinese governments were paying no regard to national interest and security.The ruling was brought sharply into focus as the Beijing municipal government purchased about $3.5m worth of Microsoft’s software. The deal raised eyebrows among chinese rivals, who said they were not offered a chance to bid. Local media also grabbed the opportunity to question why the US “monopolist” had been favoured over local suppliers.Microsoft played down the impending decision, saying it believed details had not yet been finalised. Overseas groups with sufficient presence in China could be able to win “preferred non-domestic” status.Cingular to slash staffCingular Wireless kickstarted the rationalisation of its business following its $41bn purchase of AT&T Wireless, completed last month.Cingular, the US wireless operator jointly owned by SBC Communications and Bell South, said it would slash about 10 per cent of its combined staff or about 7,000 jobs.The move was expected with some analysts predicting that the cuts would go even deeper, perhaps as much as 15 per cent.
1115;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-25T02:31:19Z;Oracle puts up four for PeopleSoft board;;"Oracle has opened a new front in its 17-month battle to take over rival software company PeopleSoft, announcing a slate of nominees to challenge the existing board of directors at its annual meeting next year.If Oracle's candidates are all elected at the meeting, expected by the end of March, they would have the power to dissolve a ?poison pill? that enables PeopleSoft to issue more shares and make a takeover prohibitively expensive.Oracle's move to mount a proxy battle for control of the board had been expected, but it filed its list just one day before the deadline and hours after it had gone to court again in Delaware, where it is also seeking the poison pill's removal.Judge Leo Strine ruled he would take two extra days of testimony on December 13 and 14 before hearing closing arguments and retiring to consider his decision over the Christmas period.Oracle is expected to argue that shareholders showed they wanted the pill removed after they tendered a significant majority 60.8 per cent of PeopleSoft's shares to Oracle by a November 19 deadline it set. Oracle put forward five candidates for PeopleSoft's eight-member board for its last annual meeting.It withdrew them when the Justice Department sued Oracle on antitrust grounds a case the company went on to win. This time, Oracle has put forward four of the five nominees again, enough to give it a majority on a reduced seven-member board following the removal of Craig Conway as chief executive on October 1.PeopleSoft said it believed Oracle had made the nominations to buy the company for ?an inadequate price that does not reflect the company's real value?.The four candidates are Duke Bristow, an economist and director of two other companies; Roger Noall, a former senior vice-president of a bank holding company; Laurence Paul, managing principal of a private equity investment firm Laurel Crown Capital; and Artur Raviv, a finance professor at the Kellogg School of Management.Jeff Henley, Oracle chairman, said: ?The current board appears intent on obstructing the will of the stockholders. We plan to give them a choice.?Most analysts and legal experts see the proxy battle as the endgame of a bitter and prolonged takeover bid. There are few precedents for Judge Strine to rule inOracle's favour."
1116;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-23T21:56:14Z;Microsoft critic received $9.75m after settlement;;"The landmark antitrust settlement this month between Microsoft and the Computer and Communications Industry Association, one of its oldest adversaries, resulted in a $9.75m (?5.25m) payment to the CCIA's top official, according to confidential documents seen by the Financial Times.Ed Black, CCIA president and for years one of Microsoft's fiercest opponents in antitrust investigations, netted almost half the $19.75m total payment Microsoft paid the association. His payment was approved by the CCIA board.Mr Black and Microsoft on Tuesday refused to comment on the details. However, the US software group said its payment had been to the CCIA alone and it had had no ""visibility"" where the money would go. The payment, which was not disclosed when the sides presented the deal on November 8, casts new light on a settlement many saw as an historic truce.The CCIA ended its support for the European Commission in the six-year antitrust battle against Microsoft and withdrew an antitrust complaint it filed to the Brussels regulator in 2003. Microsoft in turn said it would ""compensate [the] CCIA for certain legal-related expenditures it has incurred, in some cases over the past decade, and provide substantial institutional support for new and important policy undertakings"".The parts of the agreement governing Microsoft's overall payment to the CCIA are separate from that relating to Mr Black, which were signed off by the CCIA board alone. But one CCIA member said yesterday Microsoft would have to have been aware of the approximate size of the package granted to the president by the CCIA board.The judge hearing Microsoft's legal challenge against a ruling last March in which Microsoft was fined ?497m (?348m) has called a meeting of the parties on Wednesday."
1117;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-23T21:33:26Z;Congress approves new H-1B visa programme;;US high-technology companies will be able to hire up to 20,000 of the top foreign graduates from US universities each year as a result of a provision attached to the omnibus spending bill, but they will pay a high price in new fees and restrictions intended to prevent fraud in the visa programme.The measure, part of the $388bn (£208bn) bill passed by Congress at the weekend, was approved in spite of criticism that unemployment among US technology workers is too high to loosen restrictions on foreign hiring. As a result, US companies that lobbied heavily for the provision, including technology giants such as Microsoft and Oracle, were forced to accept several new measures aimed at limiting the impact on US workers.“The cost factor is enormous,” says Theodore Ruthizer, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers' Association. “It's as if Congress is saying we're going to discourage companies from using the programme by making them pay through the nose.”The provision will allow up to 20,000 foreign students who hold advanced degrees from US universities to be hired each year by US companies. This number comes on top of the current annual quota of 65,000 for the so-called H-1B visas for foreign workers, and will be available this year.The H-1B visa programme is so popular that the entire quota for this fiscal year, which began October 1, was exhausted in a single day.Sandra Boyd, who chairs Compete America, a coalition of US companies lobbying for more H-1B visas, said the measure was critical for ensuring that US companies could hire the best science and technology graduates from US universities. More than half of the US graduate students in these fields are from abroad. “There's a frenzied competition for this same group of people worldwide,” she said.With Congress expected next year to consider broader immigration reform, “it establishes the principle that we need to be sure that American companies have access to graduates from American universities”.The bill also includes a range of measures aimed at ensuring that companies are not hiring cheaper foreign workers to replace similarly qualified US workers.It will strengthen the Labor Department's funding and authority to investigate companies for fraud, and will require companies to pay these workers 100 per cent of the prevailing US wage, up from the current 95 per cent. It creates some new restrictions on L-1 visas, which have been used particularly by Indian software companies such as Wipro and Infosys to transfer Indian workers temporarily to their US facilities.Filing fees will also go up, from $1,185 in most cases currently to over $3,000. Ron Hira, who chairs the career and workforce policy committee for IEEE-USA, which represents US technology workers, said that while the new measures were significant, they were unlikely to curb H-1B abuses.
1118;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
1119;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-22T21:41:56Z;Wall St higher at start of shortened week;;"Wall Street stocks began a short trading week on Monday with modest gains as investors attempted to reverse the losses that capped the previous week.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent higher at 10,489.42 while the S&P 500 index was 0.6 per cent higher at 1,177.24. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.7 per cent to 2,085.19.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said: ""Oil didn't go up another $2 today, so I think we went up on that news, plus it was a reversal of losses exaggerated by options expiration on Friday.""Crude oil had returned to centre stage, with futures rising briefly above $49 amid worries about heating oil shortages. However, by the close Nymex contracts gave up some of their gains.Meanwhile, the dollar's flirtation with an all-time low against the euro prevented stock investors from ignoring growing concerns about the twin deficits of the US economy. In the worst-case scenario, the dollar's fall would accelerate and force interest-rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve, choking off the frail US economic recovery.If the market is unable to shake off these jitters in the next two sessions, declines could persist until next week as few investors will want to be caught off-guard before many go away early on Wednesday for Thanksgiving the next day, which is followed by a shortened trading session.However, Mr Hogan noted: ""If you look at the calendar, you recall there is a lot of money looking for an investment this time of year as many portfolio managers do not want to be caught underperforming their benchmarks right now.""Monday's gains notwithstanding, bulls continue to have the challenge of proving that Friday's decline was a much-needed, but only temporary retreat in the wake of three weeks of gains and before a renewed surge higher towards the end of the year.This week's traditionally low volume will be another challenge, but several market watchers have said the historical track record of fourth-quarter rallies could win over dollar-related anxieties, provided the greenback's fall does not pick up speed.However, bears have argued the current rally is poised to have the same fate as previous ones this year, and have expected it to fail prematurely in the absence of solid economic and corporate news.William Livesey, the chief technical analyst at CyberTrader, noted that bulls can ""only hang their hats on"" the stochastic oscillator, which compares closing share prices to the short-term price range of the stock. Mr Livesey said the indicator is in a short-term oversold range and markets have rallied recently from such a condition.""If the market continues to sell off today with stochastics being oversold, that could spell trouble for the next few days,"" Mr Livesey said.Shares in Apple Computer surged 11.2 per cent to $61.35 following a research note from Piper Jaffray analysts that set a target price for Apple shares that was almost twice their Friday closing price. The company has benefited from the huge popularity of its iPod music player.Amid a broader decline in internet stocks, Ask Jeeves shares lost 2.3 per cent to $23.20. Search engine providers such as Ask Jeeves have been in focus ever since Google's stock market debut and Microsoft's plans to launch a competing service.Google shares lost 2.5 per cent to $165.10 after a regulatory filing revealed a significant sale of shares by company insiders, which prompted Benjamin Schachter at UBS to say: ""Investors and potential investors will be dismayed at the level of planned selling so soon after the IPO.""Also among technology stocks, Oracle lost 0.6 per cent to $12.68 amid a prolonged battle to take over PeopleSoft, whose shares inched up 0.8 per cent to $23.36.In a scant corporate news calendar, the shares of Krispy-Kreme fell 16.2 per cent to $9.64 after the doughnut company reported a quarterly loss owing to costs related to closing stores.In the entertainment sector, Lion's Gate Entertainment eased 2.9 per cent to $10.04 after reports the company was trying to put itself up for sale.Pulitzer, the media company, was also exploring its options. Shares jumped 17.2 per cent to $64.25 on the news."
1120;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-18T21:55:51Z;Oracle to gain majority backing for PeopleSoft bid;;Oracle is set to win support from holders of as many as 65 per cent of PeopleSoft's shares to continue its long-running hostile takeover fight for the embattled US software company, according to one person close to the situation.However, another person cautioned that though Oracle looked set to win over a majority of shareholders, the outcome could well be less decisive when the deadline for Oracle's tender offer for the company expires at midnight on Friday.While estimates of the final outcome varied on Thursday, the signs that Oracle is on course to carry the day raises the prospect that the technology industry's biggest hostile takeover battle will continue until at least next spring, when PeopleSoft is due to hold its next annual meeting.Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, has threatened to walk away from the 17-month fight unless a majority of PeopleSoft's shareholders tender their shares in support of his company's $9bn bid by Friday night.A ?poison pill? anti-takeover defence prevents Oracle from buying the PeopleSoft shares that are tendered, turning this latest stage of the saga into more of a vote of confidence from PeopleSoft shareholders over whether they want Oracle to continue its pursuit.People close to PeopleSoft maintain that even if more than half the company's shareholders tender their stock by Thursday night, it would not indicate support for an Oracle takeover at the current offer price of $24 a share. Many shareholders have indicated privately that they believe the company is worth considerably more than that but are tendering their shares to Oracle to keep alive the chances of a higher bid, one person said on Thursday.Dave Duffield, PeopleSoft's chairman, has set out to convince shareholders that he can achieve a higher value for PeopleSoft as a standalone company, but analysts expect the stock to fall heavily in the short term if Oracle's bid fails.Majority support for the bid would not put PeopleSoft's board of directors under any legal obligation to start negotiations over a sale, said Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. He added, though, that ?if over half your shareholders are telling you to take a particular course of action, you'd better have a pretty good reason not to do it?.Backing for its takeover bid raises the prospect that Oracle will try to have its own slate of directors elected at PeopleSoft's next annual meeting. Mr Ellison has not yet said he would fight a so-called proxy battle for control of the board, but would have to show his hand by the end of this month to make sure he has the right to put up his own directors.
1121;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T21:00:00+0000;Software for a safer, cleaner world;;When the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme comes into force at the beginning of next year, many companies will start paying for the carbon dioxide they emit in Europe. It could fuel renewed interest in environmental and other non-financial reporting software - even now, some of the world’s biggest companies are using no more than a spreadsheet to track how much CO2 they produce.“Until now CO2 reporting has been voluntary,” says Charles Donovan, commercial manager at Enviros, a UK-based environmental consultancy and software company. “The EU Emissions Trading Scheme will move people away from that. It helps to lower the payback period of investment [in software].”Environmental, health and safety software emerged largely to deal with legislation brought in after the Bhopal chemical and Exxon Valdez oil disasters in the 1980s. Then, companies’ first instinct was to develop their own IT solutions. Only in the 1990s did specialist software developers emerge, and through acquisition they are now offering a range of software designed to deal with a number of common problems in the field. Among big-name enterprise software companies, only Germany’s SAP has managed to carve out a niche with its SAP EH&S product - Oracle had a presence in the field but has since retreated.Maintaining productivity is a key reason for investing in the software. “Companies don’t want highly-qualified, highly-paid professionals doing bureaucratic roles,” says Jess Kraus, founder of California-based 3E, which specialises in software to help companies deal with dangerous chemicals. Another company offering a broad range of environmental, health and safety software is ESS, based in Arizona. Its software aims to answer the question, “How do we manage chemicals and the environment and how do we manage things if something happens?” says John Gargett, crisis technology manager. Many of the problems which emerged from the September 11 attacks were environmental, he points out.Another more positive motive for companies to invest in software of this kind has emerged with the belief of some companies that there is commercial value in maintaining good reputations with investors and the public, says Elizabeth Donley of US software consultancy Donley Tech. When reports emerge of a company suffering an accident or having to pay a fine, people tend to think more generally that they are not doing a very good job, she says.Ms Donley says that despite consolidation there are still more than 3,000 software products available. As well as tracking emissions these systems help companies keep up with regulatory paperwork, monitor health and safety, produce management reports and, in some cases, manage crisis situations. While many products deal with a single task, she says around 25 now attempt to encompass a range of functions that are becoming more comprehensive and more international in scope. However, “there is still not a clear leader in the field and I don’t see a dominant player emerging right away,” she says.While there is a lot of software about, picking the right solution is not easy. Apart from the nature of their business, factors such as the territories a company is in, its environmental pro-activeness, attitude to web-based technology and preference for a one-off software purchase or ongoing service package all make the outcome individual.Also, some energy companies still want to get involved in the development process. Mr Donovan at Enviros says one “energy major” has shown it wants a big hand in developing new software, taking a stake in the next version of Montage, the software company’s energy and emissions management product. Another company, oil and gas producer BP, is among those using Enviros’ system to try to make energy savings, although it uses its own in-house system for recording carbon and sulphur gas emissions.BP, like Enviros’ unnamed business partner, has in the past tried developing software for itself with an eye to selling it on. Three years ago, the in-house software package Tr@ction replaced BP’s 20 existing computer systems for tracking accidents where action is required - everything from a fatality to the spillage of more than a barrel of oil.“It is fundamentally a safety information system, but it has a major management information spin-off use as a source of safety statistics,” says Nick Coleman, vice-president of health and safety, security, environment at BP. “You can see the likelihood of a twisted ankle in each area of the US or compare the safety records of a gas station in Australia with those in Oklahoma.”As well as feeding safety and incident information back to head office the system allows each of its 30,000 users - site managers, health and safety managers and admin staff - to compare their performance with others. Fostering such a benchmark is helpful improving safety record of an enterprise as big as BP where central control over safety is impossible, he says.In the event, take-up of BP’s system by other companies was disappointing and BP abandoned its sales efforts after a year, but not before attracting custom from the likes of construction company Balfour Beatty and the US military. “Other companies just weren’t geared up to use it,” says Mr Coleman. “This is not a software package, this is a way of life.” Another reason for its failure, according to Mr Gargett at ESS, was simply that “large multinationals wouldn’t want to use the services of another.”BP was not the first big company to move in and then out of the business. US plastics and coatings company Eastman Chemical bought Aerial Research, a company compiling data to help companies adhere to laws on handling of chemicals, only to sell it late last month to 3E. US defence contractor Northrop Grumman is a counterexample, providing a system to the US Department of Defence which it continues to support and offer to other companies.While the commercial incentives - and legislation such as the EU’s CO2 emissions trading scheme - are creating an environment for incremental advances, it might yet take a terrible event for many companies to invest in state of the art technology. It is not a matter of whether such an incident happens, but when, according to Mr Gargett. “I have been in this business long enough to know that we will have an event of some sort.”
1122;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-16T23:24:23Z;PeopleSoft investors divided over Oracle bid;;PeopleSoft's two biggest shareholders have taken opposite sides on the hostile takeover bid from Oracle, adding to the prospect of a tight finish when the deadline for Oracle's $9bn offer is reached on Friday.However, PeopleSoft hinted that it was unlikely to change its stance on the Oracle offer even if it loses what amounts to a vote of confidence in its defence against the bid.Capital Guardian Trust, PeopleSoft's largest shareholder with about 10 per cent of its shares, has indicated that it would tenderits stock in support of the bid, Oracle said on Tuesday.However, Private Capital Management, which holds 9.3 per cent of the stock, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would not back Oracle's $24-a-share offer.With a large block of PeopleSoft's shares in the hands of arbitrage investors, who bet on the outcome of hostile bids, Capital Guardian's support could help tip the balance in favour of Oracle, one shareholder who supports the bid said.The ?arbs? hold 25-30 per cent of PeopleSoft's shares, according to two people close to the situation. Paulson, a hedge fund that has amassed a 2.4 per cent stake in PeopleSoft, said on Tuesday that it would back Oracle.Together with the Capital Guardian stake, the arbs' support would lift Oracle closer to the 51 per cent support it has asked shareholders to provide by midnight on Friday. It said it would abandon its pursuit if it did not get majority backing by then.Even if Oracle wins most of PeopleSoft's shareholders, this will amount only to a strong show of support for the bid rather than a deciding vote. PeopleSoft's anti-takeover defences prevent Oracle from taking control without the board's support. PeopleSoft accused Oracle of misrepresenting Capital Guardian's views by suggesting that the institutional shareholder supported the current $24-a-share takeover offer. The investment firm has instead indicated that it thinks the software company is worth ?significantly more?, PeopleSoft said.The comments echoed recent PeopleSoft claims that it believes it is worth considerably more than the $26 a share that Oracle offered in February, an offer that was later reduced.PeopleSoft's insistence on Tuesday that its shareholders believe Oracle's offer is too low, even as they tender shares in a show of support to stop Oracle from abandoning its bid, suggests it could continue to hold out against a deal even if Oracle wins majority backing this week.
1123;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-11T21:30:29Z;Wall Street higher amid oil price decline;;"Wall Street stocks moved higher on Thursday after crude futures staged a freefall and investors found solace in the Federal Reserve's view of the economy the previous day.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,469.84 while the broader S&P 500 index put on 0.9 per cent to 1,173.48. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3 per cent to 2,061.27.Trading was heavier than expected after bond markets were closed owing to a federal holiday. Even with one less source of guidance, stock investors traded about 1.4bn shares at the New York stocks Exchange, about the daily average volume for the year.Crude oil futures fell 2.9 per cent and erased most of the gains in the prior session as rising crude inventories offset concerns about possible shortages of heating oil this winter. The perception that Yassir Arafat's death overnight would help prospects for peace in the Middle East further undermined crude prices as supply worries eased.This offered support to stocks following their initially muted reaction to the widely expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which reiterated its upbeat view of the world's largest economy.The indices have been bound in a narrow range in the past few sessions, with intraday patterns hinting at a tense tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Some traders characterised the action as bullish consolidation.The bulls will be keen to tack on consistent gains following warnings from some market watchers that the current rally faces technical resistance and that several factors threaten to stop it in its tracks in a similar way to other failed rallies earlier this year.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, attributed much of yesterday morning's gains to the decline in oil prices and the upcoming dividend from Microsoft, set to inject about $30bn in the market.""I think we're coming to the end of it [the current rally] and next year's fundamentals continue to look pretty cloudy,"" Mr Boockvar said.On the corporate front, shares of PeopleSoft eased 1.6 per cent to $22.43 after the company rejected a final takeover bid from Oracle, whose shares edged off 1.8 per cent to $13.14.In other merger-and-acquisition news, Blockbuster launched a $70m offer for Hollywood Entertainment, a rival video rental company. Blockbuster shares were 11.1 per cent higher at $8.20 while Hollywood Entertainment added 11.5 per cent to $10.93.Another deal came in the retail sector, where Jones Apparel Group said it would buy Barney's New York for about $294m. Jones shares lost 3 per cent to $34.91.In the same sector Target edged back 0.2 per cent to $50.78 after the discount retailer reported a 78 per cent rise in quarterly earnings but missed analyst estimates.Among blue-chips, Coca-Cola lost 0.5 per cent to $40.96 after it lowered its long-term earnings and volume forecasts.Shares in rival PepsiCo were up 0.4 per cent at $51.54.Also lower were shares in Starbucks, the coffee house chain, whose 47 per cent rise in quarterly earnings failed to impress the markets. Shares inched up 0.3 per cent to $55.44.Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market saw shares add 9.8 per cent to $94.57 after it reported a 27 per cent increase in quarterly earnings.Among technology stocks, Dell Computer inched up 1.1 per cent to $37.25 ahead of its quarterly results after the close. Agilent Technologies was also due to report results after the bell, and shares gained 2.5 per cent to $25.68.Semiconductor shares saw buying as RF Micro Devices rose 7.6 per cent to $6.69 following an upgrade to ""neutral"" from ""underperform"" by analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices rose 7.5 per cent to $18.59 after Merrill Lynch analysts raised their rating for the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".National Semiconductor shares, up 2.5 per cent to $16.26, defied a downgrade from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" by analysts at UBS.Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, gained 1.4 per cent to $23.17 after it named a new chief executive officer replacing Craig Barrett.A less positive note came from Nortel Networks, whose shares fell 5.9 per cent to $3.37 after the telecommunications equipment group delayed the filing of its quarterly results."
1124;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;The week in technology: BT torn over local loop;;BT was abuzz this week with plans to launch a new mobile phone that could be used to make cheap calls through the internet, alongside a possible move to compete more aggressively in the broadband market.The UK telecoms group hopes to combat the growing threat of the internet to mobile operators with a new ”Bluephone” handset, that incorporates Wi-Fi - the wireless internet technology, and will allow customers to speak over the web.If Wi-Fi phones prove popular, they could bring high-volumes of mobile customers back to fixed-line networks.BT said that as well as diverting mobile calls made in the home or office through its fixed-lines, when Wi-Fi users travelled to one of 17,000 global hotspots, such as airports and hotels, their calls would be directed via the internet.This service, which uses short range Bluetooth technology, could take off with UK jetsetters keen to reduce the current premiums charged by mobile operators on international calls.Meanwhile, elsewhere within the company, BT’s retail division said it was considering following the path of broadband suppliers such as Cable and Wireless and NTL by investing heavily in “local loop unbundling”.BT is keen to embrace unbundling, which will give its retail arm access to BT’s “last mile” copper wire connections and allow it to escape the more expensive wholesale broadband rates.But the news sparked surprise in the industry, given the division’s close ties with BT Wholesale. BT Retail is by far the biggest customer of its wholesale arm and moving to LLU, would damage revenues at the wholesale division.BT Retail currently pays BT Wholesale £12 per month for each broadband connection but could cut this to about £5 by investing in LLU technology, putting it more on a par with cheaper rivals in the market.BT group said that if Ofcom, the media regulator, did not resolve the current imbalances in wholesale broadband pricing, it may also be forced to shelve a £10bn investment in its next generation network. Ofcom has said it is looking into the issue.New bid for PeopleSoftIn the latest contortion in the 17-month battle for control of PeopleSoft, Oracle once again raised its bid in what it called its “best and final offer” to $24 a share, valuing the company at $8.8bn.November 19 is the new deadline for shareholders to accept its offer, which it said would otherwise be abandoned.But the company has threatened as much before, and the latest offer comes three weeks after Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, talked about the possibility of dropping the value of his offer.PeopleSoft, which says it rejected a higher offer of $26 a share from Oracle in February, has advised that shareholders take no action while the board considers the latest bid.PeopleSoft, has a ‘poison pill’ anti-takeover arrangement that could prevent Oracle from gaining control, even with shareholder support - but Oracle said it would appeal to the chancery court in Delaware to reverse these should it win majority shareholder support.The court is already preparing to deliver its judgement on Oracle’s recent attempt to have the poison pill overturned, along with a warranty for PeopleSoft customers, which could leave Oracle with a bill of up to $2.4bn should the takeover succeed.Time Warner stands by AOLTime Warner faced up to its responsibilities this week with the announcement it had set aside $500m for potential legal claims after government investigations into its America Online internet business.The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are investigating practices at AOL covering advertising arrangements, claims of subscriber numbers and accounting related to its holding in AOL Europe before 2002.Time Warner, which four years ago made an ill-fated merger with AOL, recently relegated the troublesome internet business to a company division from its previous home in the corporate masthead, following years of upheaval. But it has recently signalled renewed commitment to AOL, and made clear it would consider selling the online business only as a last resort.The news came as the group announced sharply improved third-quarter results with operating income before depreciation and amortisation up 9 per cent to $2.39bn on revenues up 5 per cent at $9.97bn.The improved performance of Time Warner was underpinned by double-digit profit growth at the AOL, cable and publishing divisions.EDS delays againElectronic Data Systems once again postponed its third-quarter earnings as it continued to negotiate with its auditor over the value of assets tied up in one of its largest contracts. The postponement represents a fresh setback for EDS, which has been trying to rebuild investor confidence under new management since its stock price collapsed in 2002The company was first scheduled to announce third-quarter earnings on October 25, but the statement was postponed until this week pending the outcome of negotiations with KPMG, its external auditor, over the value of $700m assets. KPMG is believed to have questioned EDS’s assumptions about future cash flow from the project, with implications for the value at which assets are held on its books.The assets relate to a $8bn contract, signed in 2000, to build a new communications and computer system for the US Navy. The deal, one of the largest of its kind, has been dogged from the start by management problems, leaving EDS unable to bill the Navy for its work.It also revealed an investigation by its audit committee into accounting practices relating to a company-wide bonus scheme. EDS sought to reassure investors by reaffirming previously-announced earnings guidance for the third quarter and the full year.Fitch, the ratings agency, placed the troubled IT services group's senior debt on watch for possible downgrade from BBB-, one notch above junk or sub-investment grade status.C&W shakeupSome moving and shaking is expected at Cable and Wireless next week as the company prepares to announce some changes to its senior UK management team amid turbulent trading conditions for the company in its core market.Francesco Caio, group chief executive, is expected to assume greater control of the UK business, taking on more of the responsibilities of the regional chief, Royston Hoggarth, hired before Mr Caio’s own appointment.Speculation that Mr Hoggarth, who has been working on the restructuring of the UK business, is being sidelined are likely and several other senior managers are also expected to be replaced.Mr Caio is thought to have concerns that some of the senior executives installed by Mr Lapthorne have expertise in the data markets while most of the group's UK revenues still come from voice services.
1125;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-03T07:52:49Z;An IT tale of two cities;;Detractors like to portray the public sector’s attraction for Linux as being more to do with the camaraderie of joining a worldwide movement, than about the solid economic and technical assessments that should determine the choice of an operating system.But as this IT tale of two cities demonstrates, there are hard-headed business reasons for picking Linux - and beyond that you can choose whether or not to become also a paid-up member and evangelist for the open source movement.Tim Simpson, IT support manager at Dundee City Council in Scotland, is very clear that adopting Linux was purely a business decision. There was no other agenda, and he refuses to be seen as an open source standard bearer.Across the North Sea, Ole-Bjorn Tufledal, chief technical officer of the City of Bergen in Norway is keen to describe the concrete technical and financial benefits that flowed from moving the city’s education and administration systems to Linux. But he wants also to enthuse about a range of other advantages that he sees cascading from this decision.When Dundee decided to migrate 11 Unix servers to virtual servers residing on an IBM zSeries mainframe running Linux, the main attraction was that it provided a way of reducing the cost of using Oracle’s database software.Replacing 11 ageing servers (some with up to four processors), with one mainframe, has saved space and heat output in the data centre. But more significantly, as the IBM machine has only two processors, Dundee needs only two Oracle licenses.The implementation as originally envisaged is not yet complete, as priorities have changed. This demonstrates the flexibility that having virtual servers running on one mainframe provides. Implementing a new virtual server is much faster than commissioning a new machine. “We can have it up in half a day: before that it would have been weeks,” says Mr Simpson, “and there is no capital expenditure.”The zSeries running Linux provides Dundee with a flexible yet robust infrastructure. “But Linux really was a side issue,” says Mr Simpson. “We have a job to do: open source arguments are not relevant to us.”In contrast, Mr Tufledal is happy to talk in terms of the “democratic business model” he believes Linux engenders.“The Linux development process is to a much higher degree user initiated, or user led. The new things in the software are things users want - whereas in the alternatives many design decisions are based on tying the users in. You are not free to choose one change without having the other.”In common with Dundee, Bergen was prompted to adopt Linux in its education and administration database systems when it needed to replace elderly server systems.Bergen’s education system, serving 100 schools, with 32,000 students and 4,000 teachers, has personal computers running Windows NT, with each school having its own Microsoft Windows server.“The software was getting very old, and we couldn’t furnish newer services to students. The system was also increasingly expensive to manage because it is decentralised, and increasingly expensive to support,” says Mr Tufledal.The solution was to junk the servers, consolidating the 100 machines to 20 IBM Blade servers in a central data centre, running Suse Linux. Similarly, the 30 existing Oracle database administration systems, 20 running Unix and 10 running Microsoft Windows, are being replaced with ten Hewlett-Packard machines running Linux.“We tried to consider all costs in running servers and saw some simple elements in this consolidation. Licences and support costs are reduced by 50 per cent, and there are other savings because we can deliver the same services with less hardware,” says Mr Tufledal.In other words, the business case for Linux was pretty much the same in Dundee as in Bergen, and does not reflect - nor is influenced by - any open source idealism.From the end of the year Bergen will go a stage further and begin to implement Linux clients on the desktop in its education system.“We set up test labs in some schools last year with some [machines] running Windows and some Linux,” says Mr Tufledal. “Pupils had very little problem with the Linux desktop.”“The feedback was that the change in moving from Windows to Linux on the desktop was equivalent to getting used to a version upgrade of Windows.”Bergen has a number of older applications that are either Microsoft-based or integrated with Microsoft Office software, such as the document management system. It is now seeking to collaborate with other cities in Norway, to pool resources, and persuade Linux vendors to port these applications free of charge.Although it has become one of Europe’s most high profile public sector users of Linux, Mr Tufledal says Bergen has had no overtures from Microsoft.And he admits freely that at its heart the move to Linux is political. At the end of 2000 the city’s parliament decided to fund an upgrade for 19,000 users to the present version of Microsoft Windows. “But they also voted that in future we should consider Linux and open source alternatives,” says Mr Tufledal.He adds: “Adopting Linux is bringing advances for all of us, because it gives us the means to co-operate.”“In the public sector we don’t compete with each other. Bergen will never take over the citizens of Oslo.”
1126;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-01T19:17:12Z;Oracle's ?best and final' bid, or maybe not;;As a student of Sun Tzu, whose Art of War remains a classic text on military strategy, Larry Ellison knows how to keep his enemies guessing.The Chinese warrior-philosopher, writing two millennia ago, advised the unexpected: ?There are only two kinds of charge in battle: the unorthodox surprise attack and the orthodox direct attack but variations of the unorthodox and orthodox are endless.?Mr Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, has just come up with his fifth and, he says, ?best and final? takeover offer for rival software group PeopleSoft. After all the twists and turns of the past 17 months, the software industry's biggest hostile takeover bid looks to be entering its final stage.Or maybe not.It was only in February, after all, that Oracle put an all-cash offer of $26 a share on the table and called that its ?final? bid. By the summer, with PeopleSoft's performance sagging, the offer was slashed to $21. And it was only last month that both Mr Ellison and Safra Catz, an Oracle co-president, testified in a courtroom in Delaware that they could actually cut the value of their bid again perhaps by as much as a third, if Ms Catz's comments were anything to go by.No wonder, then, that Monday's $24 a share offer, valuing PeopleSoft at $8.8bn, should have been taken on Wall Street with a pinch of salt, along with the threat to walk away once and for all if a majority of shareholders did not back the bid.?The biggest question we have is how best and how final is this?? says Eric Upin, software analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.The effectiveness of Oracle's latest salvo could depend on how seriously it is viewed in Delaware. Judge Leo Strine, vice-chancellor, presided over the court hearings last month. He had been expected to rule shortly on an Oracle application to overturn PeopleSoft's poison pill anti-takeover defences, along with a ?customer assurance plan?, or service guarantee, that would leave Oracle with an extra $2.4bn contingent liability after a takeover.If Oracle executives are to be believed, the judge has been privately nudging the two sides closer together.?We've put out a tremendous price now. We've bowed to the judge he's asked us for our best and final [offer],? says Jeff Henley, Oracle's chairman. ?We think we've done that, we think it's a very rich price.?PeopleSoft denounced that comment, accusing Oracle of quoting information from an off-the-record conference by the judge. It also said that Mr Henley's comments did ?not accurately reflect what occurred?, though it gave no further details.Whether or not the judge asked for Oracle to declare its best bid, though, yesterday's higher offer comes at a sensitive time for PeopleSoft's board. ?It will definitely put them under more pressure,? says Tad Piper, an analyst at Piper Jaffery.The threat to walk away adds to that pressure though several analysts and investors said they did not believe this would mark the end of the takeover battle.If more than half of PeopleSoft shareholders tender their shares for the higher offer, it would amount to a strong vote of confidence in the Oracle bid and ensure that Oracle will continue its fight until at least PeopleSoft's annual meeting next spring, according to one PeopleSoft shareholder.With that sort of backing, Mr Ellison would feel confident about mounting a proxy fight to try to unseat PeopleSoft's board at the meeting, adding to the pressure for a negotiated deal, the person said. With PeopleSoft's shares hovering just below the new bid price yesterday and about 25 per cent higher than most analysts estimate the shares would trade if Oracle really did walk away it certainly looked as though the Oracle chief was moving closer to his final confrontation.?If PeopleSoft doesn't do a deal at this price, their board will have a very big problem,? says Dan Niles, head of Neuberger and Berman, a technology investment management firm. ?It will take them a long time to create that sort of value on their own.?
1127;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-11-01T18:36:00Z;Wall St trades cautiously on eve of polls;;"A decline in crude prices helped Wall Street blue-chips advance on Monday but the broader market was flat in anticipation of Tuesday's presidential elections.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 10,054.39 while the broader S&P 500 index ended the session flat at 1,130.51. The Nasdaq Composite index put on 0.3 per cent to 1,979.87. The similar increases in two of the three indices invited speculation about momentum buying by hedge funds trying to capitalise on short-term moves.About 1.4bn shares traded at the New York Stock Exchange, close to the average volume.Crude prices fell to just above $50 per barrel, offering some support to the stock bulls. However, Tuesday's election attracted most of the attention.As the US prepares to choose its executive leadership for the next four years, national polls continue to show a virtual dead heat between the two candidates vying for the White House.This raised fears of a protracted process in deciding the outcome of the vote and of legal challenges at best similar to, if not worse than, those that delayed the outcome of the elections four years ago.Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Smith Barney, said a protracted process deciding the outcome of the presidential election was the worst-case scenario. In this case, he predicted a decline in the stock market of 7-10 per cent regardless of what happens in congressional races.The possibility of prolonged uncertainty also raised security-related fears after a tape showing Osama bin Laden was aired on Friday.However, if the elections end without any glitches nor a prolonged period of uncertainty, many market watchers expect a rally for stocks.Some strategists sought to temper those expectations on Monday. Tom Sowanick, chief wealth management strategist at Merrill Lynch, noted ""mixed economic fundamentals"" and said they ""should temper the volatility in the market should the election stretch beyond [on Tuesday].""Mr Levkovich at Smith Barney warned against the consensus that a re-election of the current administration would lead to a rally and said it might instead be anti-climactic. However, his team of analysts predicted a decline if Mr Kerry was elected. Furthermore, they said the sell-off would be steeper if Mr Kerry's party gained control of Congress.The Smith Barney analysis, however, urges investors to heed fundamentals in the long run. ""Over time, specific industry fundamentals are far more important than election results, and we believe too many investors focus on the wrong things as the urgency of newsflow distracts them from fundamental developments.""As the broader market focus zeroed on on Tuesday's elections, a handful of specific stocks attracted attention due to earnings news and other factors.The shares of PeopleSoft rose 10.4 per cent to $22.93 after the business software company received a ""best and final"" takeover bid from Oracle, a rival. The bid offers PeopleSoft $24 for each of its shares. Oracle shares, meanwhile, were 0.7 per cent higher at $12.75.Also on the merger-and-acquisition front, Valero shares put on 1.8 per cent to $57.21 after the pipeline company agreed to buy Kaneb Services and Kaneb Pipeline Partners for $2.8bn. The shares of the two groups rose 35.7 per cent to $42.60 and 13.5 per cent to $57.60, respectively, and were among the top gainers at the NYSE.Tyco International shares inched up 1.8 per cent to $31.70 after the conglomerate gave a temperate guidance for future quarters as it reported a quarterly profit for the current three months.Among the battered insurance sector, Humana saw shares add 6.3 per cent to close the session at $20.35 after the health insurer reported higher quarterly earnings.Oregon Steel saw shares lose 8.3 per cent to $13.32 after it reported upbeat results but gave a guidance that appeared to disappoint investors.Merck shares gave up 9.7 per cent to $28.28 amid concern of prolonged litigation against the company after reports the company delayed the withdrawal of its controversial Vioxx drug and challenged evidence it was harming patients."
1128;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-29T09:30:18Z;The week in technology: Google trumps Yahoo;;Investors were champing at the bit for a piece of the search-related advertising action this week pushing Google's stock market value higher than Yahoo’s for the first time since its initial public offering.Unexpectedly strong quarterly earnings from Google fuelled the feeding frenzy which pushed its stock up to new highs after an initially muted response when the company listed in August using a Dutch auction process.Googles’ stock market value rose to $50.8bn early in the week - nearly $2bn more than Yahoo, whose net revenues were 30 per cent higher than Google’s in the most recent quarter.However it is Googles’ search income that is creating all the hoopla, and some market estimates say it has already eclipsed that of Yahoo.The shift in investor sentiment goes against the popular belief that Google, as a pure-play search company, would trade at a discount to Yahoo. It has fewer ways to make money beyond the search business and is relative newcomer into the stock market.On a separate front, Yahoo introduced its own version of internet searching for mobile phone users this week, close on the heels of a rival trial mobile service launched this month by Google.The companies hope that customers will use the mobile search services to deliver local information, such as restaurant or hotel details, to users away from their PCs.Yahoo’s mobile search engine uses a browser to access abbreviated web content, while Google’s users send queries and receive answers with the SMS text messaging system.TDC knocks out Tele2TDC, the Danish telecoms group, looked to have delivered the killer blow in the hotly contested fight for Song Networks, taking out its Swedish rival, Tele2.The two groups have been locked in a takeover battle for the Swedish internet access provider since September.This week, TDC raised its offer to SKr95 per share, valuing Song at SKr5.53bn and trumping the SKr85 per share offered by Tele2. TDC also said it already owned 57 per cent of Song.Tele2 had had its eye on TDC’s broadband arm as the group has lagged behind other operators in that area. Analysts believe the group will now walk away from the bidding.Tele2’s chief executive said: “We can only congratulate TDC on making a good deal, but we could not justify these levels to our shareholders.”TDC’s purchase of Song, which specialises in corporate internet protocol voice and data services across Scandinavia and Finland, would enable the group to beef up its services to the business community and meet growing demand for cross-border services.UK nods through open-sourceThe UK government issued a blow to Microsoft’s public sector stronghold this week as a report from its commerce office concluded that open-source software was a “viable desktop alternative” for government users.Open-source, a cheaper and more flexible type of software that has been spearheaded by Linux, has been battling to raise its profile in a software market monopolised by Microsoft.But some potential users have been twitchy about the cost of training, testing, customer support and installation associated with a switch to Linux, and questions have also been raised about its level of security.This nod from the UK government could prompt government agencies and local authorities to rethink their options. Replacing existing systems with open-source software could help the government in its drive to save £20bn across the public sector.The UK government is not the first body to consider such a move: the city government of Munich has already revealed plans to switch 14,000 PCs to Linux, while officials in France have claimed that Microsoft cut prices by up to 60 per cent in an attempt to stave off a transfer to its open-source rival.Brussels clears path for OracleMario Monti, the European Union competition commissioner, this week cleared Oracle's $7.7bn takeover bid for PeopleSoft, its rival US business software maker in the final regulatory obstacle to the deal.It follows a similar ruling in the US and also marked the end of the European Commission's longest ever probe into a merger, running for more than a year.The Commission said ithere was an absence of sufficient evidence that a merger would cause competitive harm in view of the fact that large companies have other suppliers to serve their needs besides Oracle, PeopleSoft and SAP.Brussels concluded that, despite the reduction in the number of participants, the markets would remain competitive with the likes of Lawson, IFS, Intentia and QAD as rivals, and Microsoft as a “recent vendor of business application software”.It remains to be seen whether Dave Duffield, who rejoined the software company earlier this month, will be able to prevent a takeover by Oracle. He has vowed to go head-to-head with Oracle in the marketplace by driving up PeopleSoft’s revenues and “re-energising employees”.
1129;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;EDS in deal on MOD payroll;;EDS, the US technology group that has been pushing aggressively for a larger share of the UK defence market, will on Thursday announce a contract with the Ministry of Defence to revamp the system that pays and tracks British soldiers.The contract, terms of which have not been disclosed, comes just weeks after EDS lost a high-profile bid to manage the British Army's highest-priority procurement project, the ?6bn ($11bn) family of new armoured vehicles called FRES.The company is also in the running for another major MoD contract, a ?4bn deal to rework all computer networks for the UK armed services, called the Defence Information Infrastructure (DII).Although the new personnel system being developed by EDS and its main sub-contractor, software group Oracle, will be included in DII, Graham Lay, managing director of EDS's UK defence business, said it would not affect their bid for the much larger contract, which could be awarded by the end of the year.The new agreement, an extension and broadening of an existing deal with the MoD, is expected to bring ?600m in savings over 10 years by reducing the number of systems used to manage personnel in the army, navy and air force currently numbering 280 different programmes.It will automate manyof the payroll and pensionprocedures through a web-based network with access for soldiers in the field.The project will build the second largest payroll system in the UK only the National Health Service will be bigger accounting for ?5.7bn in military pay and allowances.Ian Smith, head of Oracle's UK operations, said that the armed services' decision to use the software in similar ways to most large corporations instead of insisting on modifications and major reprogramming a primary recommendation of the Gershon Report on Government Reform issued this year would also bring significant savings.
1130;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-26T19:15:55Z;Lex: PeopleSoft;;Oracle's marathon pursuit of PeopleSoft is on the way to degenerating into a simple game of chicken. The question is which software group will blink first.On Tuesday the European Commission removed the last regulatory obstacle. The next big event is the Delaware judgment on whether PeopleSoft’s poison pill should be allowed to stand. A ruling against PeopleSoft would strengthen Oracle’s hand.But the basic economics of this deal have not changed for months. Oracle wants PeopleSoft for its maintenance revenues. It will absorb that part of the business, in effect shutting down most of what remains. On that basis, the performance of PeopleSoft’s new licence business should not massively affect the valuation. Oracle was once willing to pay $26 a share. The offer now stands at $21, and recently Oracle has pushed PeopleSoft’s price back below $21 with talk of further reductions.On the other side, PeopleSoft knows that its share price is being supported by the Oracle bid. It would probably fall heavily if Oracle retreated. PeopleSoft could struggle to carve out a healthy independent future. It has to weigh up how willing Larry Ellison, Oracle chief executive, would be to walk away after investing so much time and ego in pursuit of PeopleSoft, against how much he really will pay.Mr Ellison still holds the better hand. He can try to lure the PeopleSoft board into an agreed deal. If the board fails to blink, he can see if shareholders have equally strong nerves, by passing the decision over to them in a proxy battle.
1131;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Brussels clears Oracle bid for PeopleSoft;;Mario Monti, the European Union competition commissioner, on Tuesday formally cleared Oracle's $7.7bn takeover bid for PeopleSoft, a rival US software maker.The decision removes the final regulatory obstacle to the deal, which had already been waved through by a US court. It also brings to an end the European Commission's longest ever probe into a merger, lasting more than a year due to a prolonged break in the procedure to collect more information.The Commission said in a statement there was “an absence of sufficient evidence of competitive harm especially in view of the fact that large and complex companies …have other suppliers to serve their needs besides Oracle, PeopleSoft and SAP”.Brussels had earlier this year issued a formal charge-sheet outlining its concerns about the deal.Chief among them was a fear that a combination of Oracle and PeopleSoft would leave only one serious rival to the market leader, Germany's SAP.However, the Commission said on Tuesday that its fears had been allayed, reflecting its analysis of a wealth of new data supplied by Oracle as well as the information collected during the US court's hearing on the deal.Brussels concluded that, despite the reduction in the number of participants, “the markets would remain competitive”. It cited companies such as Lawson, IFS, Intentia and QAD as further rivals, and also pointed to Microsoft as a “recent vendor of business application software”.Finally, the Commission said that the market structure itself made competition abuses less likely.
1132;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;EU poised to back Oracle bid;;The European Union's top antitrust regulator will on Tuesday give its blessing to Oracle's $7.7bn takeover bid for PeopleSoft, a rival US software company.The move will follow the clearance of the deal in the US early last month, and will lift the last remaining regulatory obstacle to the deal. Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, is expected to argue that Brussels had not found sufficient evidence that the deal would have a negative effect on competition in the business software market.He will argue that competition in the market is vibrant enough to ensure that the takeover will not reduce the number of businesses offering certain kinds of business software to just Oracle-PeopleSoft and Germany's SAP.Mr Monti's intention to wave through the deal was first reported in the Financial Times last month.The decision comes after initial reservations that were expressed earlier this year in a formal charge sheet sent to the parties.At the time, the Commission argued that the takeover was likely to reduce competition in some markets to just two companies.However, Brussels has since been busy analysing fresh bidding data supplied by Oracle. The information appears to have convinced the Commission that recent contracts to supply such software were contested by a large enough number of software makers.Moreover, a prohibition of the deal is understood to have been opposed by the Commission's powerful legal services department, which is charged with vetting sensitive Commission decisions. The lawyers had argued that such a prohibition would not have withstood a legal challenge by Oracle at the European Court in Luxembourg.The US Department of Justice had initially also opposed the takeover, but its prohibition was overruled by a court in California in September.Earlier this month, US officials made clear they would not appeal against that decision, effectively ending the regulatory process in the US.In a separate move, PeopleSoft lifted a further obstacle to the takeover by sacking Craig Conway, the company's chief executive and one of the leading opponents of the deal.Tuesday's decision by Brussels will also end fears that the Oracle bid would be treated differently by authorities in the US and the EU a situation that Mr Monti and his US counterparts have been keen to avoid.Mr Monti is due to step down from his post at the end of the week, after five years at the helm of the EU's top antitrust authority. The Oracle/PeopleSoft ruling will be among the last official acts of his tenure.
1133;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-22T10:12:57Z;The week in technology: US earnings rumble on;;There was a glut of news from the US tech sector this week as the US earnings season rumbled on.Surging sales of personal computers in the corporate sector enabled Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, to report better than expected fiscal first-quarter revenues and earnings.Strong demand from corporate buyers upgrading their PCs pushed growth rates up by 10 per cent from the year before. However, the deferred revenue balance, which reflects the willingness of corporate buyers to sign up for longer term contracts, fell by $395m, more than the $200m-$300m Microsoft had estimated.Google also marked its first quarterly earnings since becoming a public company by reporting that revenues had more than doubled from a year before, putting it well ahead of most market forecasts.The results pointed to an acceleration in the online search-related advertising business, as Google gained ground against its chief rival, Yahoo.International Business Machines, was also among those reporting results, and Big Blue appeared to firing on all cylinders as sales rose across all divisions in the third quarter.Total sales grew 9 per cent to $23.4bn as IBM’s hardware business continued its recent impressive run. Its outsourcing division, which is its largest after being the engine of growth for the company throughout the 1990s, chalked up sales growth of 10 per cent.However, there was one very visible blot on IBM’s monitor - a $320m charge to cover the settlement of pensions litigation that dragged down net income.Outsourcing hots upIBM could also find competition hotting up in the outsourcing world after Electronic Data Systems announced a far-reaching alliance with six other tech companies to take on Blue.The alliance - which includes Cisco, Dell, EMC, Microsoft, Sun and Xerox - will cover many aspects of IT business, such as procurement of hardware and software, joint development of IT systems and sharing sales leads.EDS, which was the biggest outsourcing company in the 1990s until it was overtaken by IBM, is seeking to return to former glories by offering a “compelling alternative” to its rival and is also hoping to bolster itself against the threat of new entrants to the outsourcing sector such as Hewlett-Packard.Dell keeps the crownAs Hewlett-Packard’s attempts to broaden its horizons into outsourcing put the likes of EDS on guard, it once again came up short in struggle for dominance in the PC market against powerhouse rival Dell.This week Dell, which overtook Hewlett-Packard as the world’s biggest PC maker earlier this year, extended its market share lead to capture 18.2 per cent at the end of the third quarter, up from 16.9 per cent a year ago.In contrast, according to figures from market research company IDC, HP’s share fell to 16.2 per cent from 16.6 per cent.Both companies increased shipments in the quarter, thanks to strong sales of commercial PCs and strength in the wider European market.PeopleSoft stands firmThe founder of PeopleSoft this week voiced his commitment to retaining the group’s independent status, offering employees and investors the first glimmer of hope that the group would fight a hostile bid from rival Oracle.Dave Duffield, who rejoined the software company earlier this month, told staff in an internal e-mail that he “didn’t come back here to sell Oracle”.His return to the group, together with the sacking of previous chief executive, Craig Conway, who was vehemently against any sale, had sparked speculation that the company was warming to the prospect of a deal.But Mr Duffield has instead pledged to go head-to-head with Oracle in the marketplace, by driving up PeopleSoft’s revenues and “re-energising employees”, with a new five-year vision to get the group back on track.His pledge of independence is the latest twist in a saga that has developed since Oracle first started circling Peoplesoft in June. It came as the Department of Justice decided to drop its efforts to block the potential acquisition.The group also announced that in the third quarter, PeopleSoft beat its own forecasts for revenue and earnings in the third quarter, despite the ongoing uncertainty surrounding its future.Software licence revenue, a more important measure of growth prospects, was little changed from last year at $161m but up 24 per cent sequentially.
1134;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-21T12:27:11Z;Lex: SAP;;Under-promising and over-delivering has long been SAP's communications strategy. Once again, its targets for the year, which looked pretty ambitious back in January, now seem easily within reach. Despite unfavourable currency movements, third quarter software licence revenues grew 13 per cent year-on-year. This augurs well for future revenues, and has benefited margins. Most encouragingly, SAP's growth looks fairly balanced. Europe seems to have turned the corner. Given SAP's traditional conservatism, the increase in marketing headcount shows it sees healthy prospects ahead.Investors should be wary, however, of interpreting this as a sign of wider strength in IT spending. The key point is that SAP is gaining market share and probably a bigger slug of corporate budgets. While some US rivals have started to regain their footing, Oracle's long-running battle for PeopleSoft might help SAP for a little longer and should eventually result in a more stable pricing environment.All this might help justify SAP's 30 per cent valuation premium to its peers, although outperforming them is getting harder. After all, SAP now has a 56 per cent global market share, even on its new definition. The picture remains clearer in absolute terms. SAP trades at 31 times this year's earnings excluding the economic costs of equity-based compensation. It is no wonder that, for all SAP's remarkable successes, its share price is well below the January peak.
1135;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-21T07:15:52Z;Europe pick-up boosts SAP;;SAP, largest software maker, on Thursday beat expectations with its third-quarter results, helped by a surprisingly strong pick-up in European countries, which have in the past lagged behind the US market.Software licence sales a key indicator of software companies' future growth prospects rose 13 per cent to €491m ($617m) during the quarter, while earnings before interest and tax, adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and acquisition costs, came in at €475m, up 12 per cent from a year earlier.SAP has long forecast that the European market would finally start to pick upspeed towards the end of this year.Thursday's results nevertheless offered a welcome surprise as licence sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 24 per cent to €249m.This followed a much more modest increase, of 2 per cent, during the preceding three months.Licence sales also rose 9 per cent in Germany, in spite of tough conditions. In the US, where the German group has been making steady inroads into the market shares of many local peers, licence sales rose a more modest 6 per cent but this was coming off a high base last year.Henning Kagermann, chief executive, on Thursday struck a more upbeat tone than rivals such as Oracle and PeopleSoft, which also have seen sales improve but remain cautious amid pricing pressures in the industry.Mr Kagermann said on Thursday that pricing pressures remained but they had stabilised.The focus will shift to the fourth quarter, traditionally the strongest for software makers.SAP kept in place its forecast for a 10 per cent rise in software revenues for the full year.This would imply fourth-quarter licence sales growth of 7-8 per cent to about €1bn. SAP shares gained 2.6 per cent to €133.42.
1136;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T23:15:08+0000;PeopleSoft founder in pledge of independence;;Dave Duffield, PeopleSoft's founder and largest individual shareholder, has said he does not intend to sell the software company to Oracle, despite the speculation that has swirled since he returned to run the company earlier this month.In an internal e-mail to employees, a copy of which was obtained by FT Deutschland, the FT's sister newspaper, Mr Duffield declared: ?I didn't come back here to sell to Oracle.?Instead, he wrote, ?I'm here to beat Oracle in the marketplace, increase our revenues, re-energise our employees and deliver greater long-term value to our shareholders.?The e-mail is the first evidence of Mr Duffield's declared intention since returning to head the company he founded. Already the chairman and largest shareholder, with 7.6 per cent of PeopleSoft's stock, he returned as chief executive after Craig Conway was sacked at the start of this month.The departure of Mr Conway, who had been vehemently opposed to any sale to Oracle, together with Mr Duffield's age he is 64 led to speculation that the executive shake-up might leave the software company more open to a deal.His return came on the same day that the Department of Justice dropped its efforts to block the potential acquisition.In the e-mail to PeopleSoft's 11,000 employees, Mr Duffield wrote: ?The honest answer is: ?I'm not here to sell. Rather, I'm here to buy.'?Mr Duffield said he was looking to buy a house near the company's headquarters in Pleasanton, California. Subject to some issues ?kids' schools and the like? the purchase would go through by the end of this month.Mr Duffield also said he planned to lay out a new five-year vision for PeopleSoft and called on employees to make sure the company performed well in the final months of this year.Mr Conway had blamed PeopleSoft's weak second quarter on uncertainty among customers caused by the Oracle bid, although the company has shaken off some of the doubts with a stronger showing in the third quarter.
1137;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-12T21:02:58Z;PeopleSoft chairman says bid needed different terms;;PeopleSoft might have considered Oracle Corp.?s takeover proposal more seriously if some of the terms were different, PeopleSoft?s chairman said in a videotaped deposition played in a Delaware court on Tuesday.Chairman David Duffield, in an Aug. 18 videotaped deposition, said that if Oracle dropped some of the conditions attached to its proposal and was committed to selling, supporting and enhancing PeopleSoft products, PeopleSoft?s board would be likely to evaluate it more seriously.Duffield took the additional role of CEO on Oct. 1, after the board of directors fired Craig Conway, who had loudly opposed a takeover by Oracle at any price. Investors have speculated feverishly since then whether PeopleSoft will now be more willing to hold formal talks with Oracle.Duffield, PeopleSoft?s founder, said PeopleSoft did not ask its advisers for a fairness opinion on Oracle?s initial June 2003 offer of $16 a share or its increased bid of $19.50 a share made soon after.When Oracle upped the ante to $26 a share early this year, PeopleSoft?s advisers concluded ?that the offer was inadequate,? Duffield said during the deposition, taken about a month and a half before he took over as CEO.Oracle?s current bid now stands at $21 per share, which would value PeopleSoft at about $7.7 billion. The offer is valid until Oct. 22.Oracle has filed suit against PeopleSoft in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to repeal PeopleSoft?s anti-takeover protections, with a focus on an unusual customer assurance program that could create huge liabilities for Oracle if it is successful in its bid. PeopleSoft on Tuesday extended the expiration date on a version of the assurance program, which could force Oracle to pay PeopleSoft customers between two and five times the cost of their software if Oracle?s post-merger software support and updates don?t meet certain guidelines.Oracle has argued during the trial, which began last week, that it voiced its commitment to support and update PeopleSoft?s products from the moment it launched the bid. ?The problem with the CAP (customer assurance program) is that it is extremely ambiguous,? said Oracle co-President Safra Catz, one of the main architects of Oracle?s bid, who finished testifying on Tuesday. Oracle says the program has already created a potential liability of more than $2 billion that could grow further.Catz testified on Monday that based on PeopleSoft?s performance so far for 2004, Oracle?s valuation of the company is ?down significantly? by a ?magnitude of somewhere between a third and a quarter.? Catz said Oracle has just started to update its modeling of PeopleSoft from January 2004.PeopleSoft?s stock shot above the $21 offer price when Conway was fired, as investors bet Oracle would lob PeopleSoft?s new management a higher bid to seal a deal. But Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, along with Catz, countered those expectations with testimony that Oracle might actually lower its bid.The two sides have, to an extent, used their time in court as a public negotiating forum. Vice Chancellor Leo Strine, who is presiding over the case, remarked on Tuesday that the trial has been part litigation and part business deal.PeopleSoft co-President Phil Wilmington testified that some customers delayed orders or chose rival software providers because of the uncertainty created by Oracle?s bid. He said the customer assurance program was the only way to assure some customers that their investments would be protected.PeopleSoft initially offered the program?s terms to only those customers who were concerned about the effect an Oracle takeover could have on their investments, but eventually rolled out the program to everyone.
1138;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-08T08:26:11Z;The week in technology: Oracle seeks antidote for poison pill;;Oracle v PeopleSoftSome of the movers and shakers behind the long running hostile takeover bid by Oracle for PeopleSoft had their day in court this week as Oracle sought to overturn so called “poison pill” defences it claims were set up by PeopleSoft to deflect its bid.Oracle launched its takeover attempt in June 2003, shortly after PeopleSoft announced an agreement to merge with JD Edwards and this week’s court case follows a number of regulatory and business developments that could help to seal a final triumph for Oracle.These included the dismissal of Craig Conway, PeopleSoft’s chief executive and a vocal critic of the deal, and reports that the European Commission is set to clear the takeover bid. The US justice department had argued in favour of blocking the bid, its stance was overturned by the US District Court in San Francisco.Oracle’s latest move this week was an attempt to demonstrate to a Delaware court that PeopleSoft had erected unreasonable barriers to thwart its bid.The defences set up by PeopleSoft include a shareholder rights plan in the event of a takeover and a provision that it wrote into new contracts since last year offering customers compensation in the event it is taken over.Mr Conway, who testified in court this week, said he had tried to vilify a takeover bid by rival Oracle only because he believed the hostile offer was an attempt to damage his former company.PeopleSoft dismissed Mr Conway amid allegations he lied to analysts about the impact of Oracle’s bid on the company’s business, but he denies that he had intentionally lied or misled them.The removal of Mr Conway has fuelled some speculation that PeopleSoft’s board could in time move to accept Oracle’s offer.Meanwhile, PeopleSoft this week forecast higher-than-expected third-quarter revenues, following Friday’s announcement that license revenues during the third quarter were expected to top $150m - close to the $160m of a year before and well ahead of most expectations after a disappointing second quarter.Broadband battle in Hong KongA spat has blown up in Hong Kong between leading telecoms company PCCW and regulators over the legality of making phone calls over the internet.Many former telecommunications monopolies and incumbent operators are learning to come to terms with Voice over Internet Protocol technology, the technology that allows customers to make free calls using their broadband internet connections, by setting up their own VoIP products in competition with their upstart rivals.But PCCW claims that VoIP services breach license conditions and has warned off potential users. Now the grouching tiger is threatening legal action against Hong Kong’s telecoms authority which has ruled that the the service is legitimate.PCCW’s attitude is puzzling for a company that has a reputation of being a technology pioneer, but the company is under pressure from escalating competition with its share of its core fixed-line falling from 82 to 70 per cent in the past two years.The situation has been exacerbated by the onset of VoIP as a glut of smaller companies offer voice services that cost about half as much as PCCW’s normal tariffs.PCCW wants to charge VoIP companies offering services via its broadband network, but they argue that users are already paying for their broadband connections and shouldn’t pay extra.Established telecoms companies around the world will be watching the outcome of the battle as they determine how they will deal with the new technology.LCD on the big screenSharp moved closer to bringing the effect of the big screen to the comfort of the film lover’s home this week, as it unveiled the world’s largest flat panel liquid crystal display television, boasting an impressive 65-inch screen.The launch outshined the latest offering from the Japanese group’s rival, Samsung, which previously led the LCD field with its 57-inch model.Sharp had previously only manufactured screens smaller than 50 inches and its decision to target the larger market raises the stakes in the battle between manufacturers to produce the most sought after technologies.The group will compete head on with makers of plasma display panels, such as Matsushita. PDPs have previously been considered to have best technology for larger screens, as manufacturing LCDs at sizes above 40 inches was thought too expensive and difficult.Google ramps upMeanwhile Google also took steps to fend off intensifying competition with plans to launch a number of new features aimed at fine tuning its web browsing facilities.Although the intricacies of the new features are to be kept close to the group’s chest for another couple of weeks, it is thought that they will be designed to make it easier and quicker for users to find the exact results they want from the minefield of information available.Google has been put under increased pressure recently as a flurry of internet search providers have entered the field to capitalise on the fast-growing market.The group also revealed it was testing a service, Google Print, that gives users links to relevant books among the search results and allows them to read extracts from the books online. A similar service, “Search Inside the Book” has proved popular at Amazon.com.
1139;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Brussels restarts Oracle probe;;The European Commission on Thursday restarted its investigation into Oracle's takeover bid for rival software company PeopleSoft, ensuring that the deal will be cleared before the end of the month.Although the Brussels antitrust regulator officially has until November 9 to reach a decision, it is widely expected that Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, will rule on the bid before he steps down at the end of October.As first reported in the FT last month, the Commission intends to clear the $7.7bn acquisition, because of concerns that a prohibition would not withstand the scrutiny of European courts. A prohibition had also been opposed by the Commission's powerful legal service, whose task it is to vet important decisions for their conformity with EU law.The decision by Mr Monti would follow the clearance of the deal in a US court last month.Although the US Department of Justice had initially opposed the deal, it has since made clear that it will not appeal the ruling.A further obstacle to the deal was removed last week, when PeopleSoft ousted Craig Conway, the chief executive and main opponent to Oracle's bid.The Commission froze its investigation into the deal in April, to give Oracle more time to comply with Brussels' request for additional market data. Both Brussels and the DoJ had based their initial hostility to the deal on the assumption that a combination of Oracle and PeopleSoft would leave only the new group and SAP of Germany to compete for certain business software contracts.However, Oracle has pointed out consistently that there are more than just three players at present, and that it faced another potentially powerful competitor in Microsoft.The Commission sent a statement of objections to the parties this year.However, people close to the deal say Mr Monti then switched tack, and had been leaning towards a clearance for several months.
1140;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-04T12:03:52Z;Microsoft chief rules out bid for PeopleSoft;;"Microsoft on Sunday night ruled itself out of a white knight bid for PeopleSoft, the software company fighting a $7.7bn hostile takeover by Oracle.Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, told the Financial Times that PeopleSoft did not compare with SAP, the German company Microsoft considered buying last year.Meanwhile, PeopleSoft on Monday forecast better third-quarter revenues than expected, following Friday’s announcement that license revenues during the third quarter were expected to top $150m - close to the $160m of a year before and well ahead of most expectations after a disappointing second quarter.PeopleSoft said revenues should range from $680m to $695m, compared with an average analyst expectation of $660m. However, it added that earnings, excluding one-time items, would be on target with market predictions at about 13 or 14 cents per share.Analysts have speculated that the firing on Friday of Craig Conway, PeopleSoft chief executive, could represent a repositioning for a bid from a third party.But asked whether Microsoft, with its $60bn cash pile, could be that white knight, Mr Ballmer said: ""I don't think so, we like our focus on small and medium-[sized] companies, and if we weren't going to be focused on small and medium companies, you know what we wanted to buy …and then passed on.""Recalling Democrat Lloyd Bentsen's line to Republican Dan Quayle in a US vice-presidential debate - ""I knew Jack Kennedy …you're no Jack Kennedy"" - Mr Ballmer said: ""I know SAP, and they're no SAP.""Mr Ballmer said SAP was not currently ""on the radar screen"", but ""one should never say never"".Asked about competition concerns relating to any bid, he said the level of overlap between the two companies was tiny.The Microsoft chief executive said progress could be made in the current antitrust hearings in Brussels now that enough data had been supplied to the court for assessments to be made.""We have proved the fact that we are not religious zealots, we have an environment now where, some time over the next few months, we will get a ruling from the judge that's possibly helpful,"" he said.In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Ballmer also said he thought Apple's support for its proprietary encoding format for digital music was unsustainable.Referring to illegal downloading and the iPod, which plays music in the MP3 format and its own proprietary format, he said: ""Most of the music on iPods is still stolen music and not in the Apple format.""He cited ""user scenarios that just don't work"", such as Powerpoint presentations that could not use Apple formatted music in the background, and predicted a level of interoperability would come.Mr Ballmer said Microsoft was combating piracy of its own software with cheap, scaled-down Windows ""starter editions"" released in Asia.""It's a very weak product with a much lower price, it won't take advantage of all the hardware on your machine but maybe it will convert people from piracy,"" he said.The chief executive was also upbeat about Microsoft's prospects in the developing smartphone market.He said he was committed to achieving sales of more than 100m units a year of Windows smartphones.""It could be three years, it could be six years, but I believe we can get that kind of position.""Mr Ballmer said he also saw an opportunity for a computer-based service that would do the work of an IT department for the consumer and small business market."
1141;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-10-03T16:21:14Z;Oracle to seek removal of poison pill;;Oracle is set to open its latest legal fight for control of software rival PeopleSoft on Monday, fresh from two developments at the end of last week that appeared to shift the momentum of the hostile takeover battle in its favour.Oracle will ask the chancery court in Delaware to remove two ?poison pill? arrangements that it claims have been used by PeopleSoft to block its $7.7bn bid at the expense of shareholders.The hearings are likely to shed new light on the abrupt sacking last week of Craig Conway as PeopleSoft's chief executive officer, according to people close to the matter.Mr Conway's vociferous opposition to the bid brought accusations from Oracle that he had acted improperly,for instance when he rejected the offer on theday it was launched before the PeopleSoft board had had time to consider it.Skip Battle, a PeopleSoft director, denied that MrConway had been fired over his opposition to the Oracle bid, or that the timing ofhis departure was linked to the opening of the hearings in Delaware.PeopleSoft said that ithad lost confidence in him as CEO, even though it also disclosed that its sales of new software licences were running at a much higher rate than expected.A belief that the sacking removed one of the barriers to a deal contributed to a 15 per cent jump in PeopleSoft's shares on Friday. The rally was also helped by news that the Department of Justice would not appeal against last month's court ruling that overturned its efforts to block a takeover on antitrust grounds.With Europe also expected to drop its opposition toa bid, PeopleSoft's poison pill has emerged as one ofits main remaining defences against Oracle.The chancery court in Delaware, where many US companies are registered, has traditionally backed the use of poison pills, though ?things are changing? said Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware.?The Delaware courts are becoming more hostile to the use of a pill when it appears to be an entrenchment device? by current management,? he said.Leo Strine, the vice-chancellor who will hear thePeopleSoft case, has already shown himself to be a strong defendant of the interests of outside shareholders, said Mr Elson.Mr Strine's decision in 2000 to overturn the takeover defences used by Shorewood Packaging, which was under the threat of a hostile bid from Chesapeake Corp, was only the third time in more than a decade that the Delaware court had sided with a hostile bidder and is seen as one of the landmark cases of its type.Mr Strine also presided earlier this year over the battle between newspaper proprietor Conrad Black and the board of Hollinger, eventually rejecting Lord Black's attempt to sell off part of his newspaper empire.Oracle has asked the court to overturn two of PeopleSoft's defences.One is the sort of shareholder rights plan in placeas an anti-takeover measure at many US companies, while the other is aprovision that PeopleSoft has included in its newcontracts since last year that could compensate customers in the event it is taken over. Potential payments under those guarantees now top $2bn.
1142;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-09-24T11:40:32Z;The week in technology: Twists in the tale of Oracle;;News that the European Union is set to clear Oracle’s bid for PeopleSoft culminated a week of twists in the group’s pursuit of the smaller software company.Peoplesoft moved to shore up its takeover defences by offering extra compensation for workers sacked by Oracle if the bid succeeded. Then it triggered speculation about a friendly bid from International Business Machines after announcing a “landmark” alliance with the IT giant.But its efforts took another blow as people close to the case said Mario Monti, the EU competition commissioner, is expected to announce clearance before he steps down at the end of this month.The decision would follow the US court’s reversal of an attempt by the US justice department to block the bid two weeks ago.PeopleSoft has been pulling out all the stops in its efforts to repel Larry Ellison’s corporate juggernaut.It has pledged to give employees up to $200m of additional compensation between them if a takeover of the company is followed by mass sackings. Oracle has said it plans to shed most of PeopleSoft’s staff if its bid is successful.The extra benefits follow guarantees handed by PeopleSoft to its customers that could cost Oracle as much as $2bn after a takeover.Meanwhile, the PeopleSoft’s software alliance with IBM forced Big Blue to brush off suggestions that closer ties with the software group might eventually lead to a friendly takeover bid.The alliance will see all of PeopleSoft’s applications shipped with IBM’s “middleware“, software that provides the glue for running distributed applications over the internet.Regulators take action in the fight against fraudImportant steps were taken to bring justice to two technology groups this week as Computer Associates reached a settlement with US regulators over charges of accounting fraud, while in the UK a man was arrested on suspicion of stealing Cisco Systems’ source code.CA will no doubt be glad to close the door on what was deemed one of the most widespread cases of alleged accounting malpractice to stem from the technology bubble.Sanjay Kumar, the former chief executive who was forced to quit the software group earlier this year, along with two other executives, were charged with fraud and the company agreed to pay $225m compensation to shareholders.The Securities and Exchange Commission claims CA mistated $3.3bn of revenue between 1998 and 2001.CA now faces closer scrutiny from outside regulators and must trawl through its past accounting documents to try to salvage some of the $1bn in bonuses that were born out of accounting abuses and paid to group executives during that time.But the group could escape a criminal hearing as the Department of Justice has deferred its prosecution for 18 months to give it time to meet the conditions set out by the federal prosecutors.Meanwhile, British authorities took an important step in the battle against software piracy with the arrest of a 20-year-old man in relation to Cisco’s stolen code.The arrest followed a four-month international manhunt launched by the US authorities in May.The code, which gives instructions on how to direct traffic across the internet, was illegally obtained from the networking equipment maker and displayed on a Russian website as well as in hacker’s havens such as chat forums and message boards.The arrest follows police raids at two locations earlier this month, during which several computers and equipment were seized for analysis.Philips issues double disappointmentPhilips took a double blow this week as it confirmed concerns over its semiconductor business by cutting sales growth targets just two days after the surprise resignation of the division’s head.Scott McGregor, who will leave the company at the end of the year to return to the US, warned of a flat performance at the business in the final quarter when he had previously hoped for low growth.His departure was not linked to the performance of the division but was for “personal reasons”.The prospects for the semiconductor market had been a dark shadow over the Dutch electronics group for some time and a number of analysts had pre-empted this week’s bad news with forecasts cuts and downgrades to the market outlook.The industry has suffered a period of instability as customer orders have been unstable and price pressure has intensified.Games groups rev up for ChristmasSony and Nintendo are positioning themselves for another Christmas slugfest in the video games market.Both companies unveiled plans for new consoles they hope will give them the edge during the key Christmas and year-end selling season.Sony said it was launching a smaller version of its bestselling PlayStation machine, which it hopes will expand the market for the console, which has sold 73.6m units to date.The new PS2 will be almost as small as a hardcover book and half the weight of its predecessor. Retailing at $149, it will come equipped with an Ethernet port for network gaming.Nintendo, which has only sold 15m of its rival GameCube console, fought back to maintain its stronghold in the handheld console market with the launch of its latest games machine, the Nintendo DS.Slated to appear in US shops in November, with a Japanese launch set for early December, the DS will retail at a similar price to Sony’s new PS2. It boasts two screens allowing users to experience games from different angles, as well as voice recognition and wireless communication capabilities.But Nintendo can’t afford to rest on its laurels, even on its home turf, because Sony’s debut in the handheld gaming market is imminent.Sony’s offensive is expected to begin in the next few months when its PSP portable games console is expected to hit high streets.
1143;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
1144;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-09-23T23:16:58Z;EU set to clear Oracle $8bn bid for PeopleSoft;;The European Commission is set to clear the $7.7bn hostile takeover bid by Oracle for rival software group PeopleSoft in a move that is likely to pave the way for the creation of a new US software giant.Mario Monti, the European Union competition commissioner, is expected to announce the clearance before he steps down at the end of next month. Though he still has to consult the EU's national antitrust regulators, it is unlikely that he will change his position.People familiar with the case said the Commission had been leaning towards a clearance of the offer for months, long before a US court approved the bid in early September. They said the Commission was still concerned about the possible impact of the takeover on competition but it had realised its case would not withstand a legal challenge in the European court.It is understood a merger prohibition had been opposed by the Commission's powerful legal services, a team of elite lawyers that scrutinises important decisions.If confirmed, the move would end fears of a transatlantic rift in antitrust policy.Though the US justice department had argued in favour of blocking the move, its stance was overturned by the US district court in San Francisco. The ruling could still be appealed, but if it is allowed to stand, a prohibition by Mr Monti could have led to the politically sensitive situation of a major bid being cleared in the US and blocked in the EU.Last time this happened when Mr Monti blocked a merger between General Electric and Honeywell three years ago the Commission was criticised by the US business community.A replay of such animosity looks unlikely. That will be welcome news to Neelie Kroes, who takes over as EU competition commissioner in November and who would have faced the fallout if Mr Monti prevented the bid. The Commission's investigation into the bid is now frozen, but Brussels is expected to reopen it within the next week. Under EU merger rules, the Commission then has about four weeks to make a formal decision.The news will further dent PeopleSoft's efforts to reassure the 15,000 attendees at its annual customers' conference in San Francisco this week that it has a fighting chance of remaining independent.The software company has already blamed publicity around the legal case in the US for scaring away potential customers during the second quarter of the year, and yesterday it appeared to signal that another big drop in sales was likely in the latest three months.With only a week left to go in the quarter, PeopleSoft said its new application licence revenues had topped those seen in Oracle's most recent quarter.However, Oracle's sales reached only $69m, far short of the $160.5m that PeopleSoft achieved in the same period a year ago, suggesting that PeopleSoft is less than halfway to meeting its own sales figure for the 2003 quarter.Oracle has already cut the value of its offer for PeopleSoft once this year to reflect PeopleSoft's declining fortunes, reducing its bid by 20 per cent to $7.7bn.
1145;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-09-23T21:22:10Z;Lex: Oracle/PeopleSoft;;The dominoes are toppling. Only weeks after Oracle won its case against the Department of Justice which was trying to block its PeopleSoft bid Larry Ellison is poised for another victory. The European Commission looks set to avoid a tangle with Oracle's tenacious chief executive by approving the deal. The chance of a DoJ appeal looks relatively low.Regulatory retreat on both sides of the Atlantic would not equal victory for Mr Ellison. He would still need to overcome his target's poison-pill provisions. But at least the removal of regulatory obstacles would leave him able to negotiate more freely with the PeopleSoft board.He has a strong position. The slowdown in the enterprise software industry coupled with the seemingly negative effect of the 15-month battle on PeopleSoft's business will make it tough for PeopleSoft to argue it can reach Oracle's current $21-a-share offer price as an independent company. Those factors will also make any white knight think hard before joining the fray.For Oracle, however, weak new business numbers from PeopleSoft matter little. Oracle wants the company for its installed user base. It will be a challenge for the PeopleSoft board to persuade shareholders that it should keep holding out for independence. It could be equally tough to persuade Mr Ellison to raise his offer from $21, if no other bidder emerges. He may even try his luck and cut the price as a new starting point for negotiations.
1146;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Wall Street lower as oil fears continue;;"Wall Street stocks extended their losses on Thursday amid jitters about a renewed spike in crude prices and disappointing economic news.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.7 per cent at 10,039.13, while the broader S&P 500 was 0.4 per cent lower at 1,108.72. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 1,888.56.Caution appeared to be the prevailing mood in the wake of the worst rout for US stocks since early August on Wednesday, which took market watchers by surprise. Crude futures spiked on Wednesday and were moderately higher on Thursday afternoon, resurrecting fears about a potential squeeze on corporate profits and consumer budgets.News that the Bush administration was looking to approve the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to quell prices was ignored because traders saw the quantity of oil to be used as insufficient.Chris Wolfe, market strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank, said he saw numerous indications that fundamentals-driven investors saw the market as fairly valued and were opting to stay on the sidelines, leading to low trading volumes. Whatever trading has taken place recently has mostly been by hedge funds seeking volatility, he said.On the economic front, an index of leading economic indicators fell for the third consecutive month, according to the Conference Board, the business research firm compiling the indicator. The data, which gauge future economic activity in the US, dented optimistic expectations that the summer ""soft patch"" of slow growth has passed.In addition, the US government said claims for unemployment benefits rose last week amid the effects of hurricanes in the southern US. The less-volatile four-week moving average of the indicator also rose, underscoring fears of continued weakness in the labour market following strong job creation earlier in the year.The news came a day after the quarterly results of Morgan Stanley shook investor confidence in the outlook for the financial services sector and equity markets.In addition, the results and pre-announcements of companies in other sectors have cast a pall over bullish hopes of a fourth-quarter rally.While optimists continue to say investors have ignored positive earnings all year and a rally might still occur, they admit those hopes could be undermined by more immediate - and less pleasant - realities.Airline stocks, which suffer from the high oil price, were broadly lower following a report from the Air Transport Association saying industry performance last month was far worse than initially expected, while the decline in traffic from July to August was the worst in 20 years. The news bodes ill for the winter months, traditionally slow for the sector.Delta Air Lines lost 3.5 per cent to $3.57 while American's parent AMR saw its shares lose 7.7 per cent to $8.07. The sector index was 2.8 per cent lower.In other corporate news, Rite Aid shares lost 4.5 per cent to $3.59 even after the pharmacy chain said it swung to profit and beat analyst expectations.Also reporting results was AG Edwards,whose shares inched up 0.3 per cent to $34.57 after the regional broker missed estimates, citing the languid pace of stock markets as a reason.In the retail sector, Bed Bath&Beyond said sales for the quarter reached $1.27bn, slightly below the medium analyst estimates. Its shares lost 5 per cent to $37.61 .In technology, PalmSource shares lost 5 per cent to $24.85 ahead of its quarterly earnings release, which is expected to say that the handheld computer software company lost 2 cents per share in the previous quarter. Its results come two days after shares in PalmOne saw broad selling on a weak profit outlook from the handheld computer maker.Also among software stocks, PeopleSoft shares were muted after Craig Conway, its chief executive, said earnings would be hit by efforts to escape a hostile bid from Oracle. PeopleSoft also said its sales have exceeded its rival's this quarter. Shares were off 0.4 per cent to $19.25.Exxon Mobil,the world's biggest public oil company, dropped 0.5 per cent to $47.78 after Deutsche Bank analysts downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"", and moved the weighting of the oil sector to ""neutral"" from ""overweight""."
1147;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;PeopleSoft joins forces with IBM;;PeopleSoft on Tuesday unveiled what it billed as a landmark software alliance with IBM, though Big Blue brushed off suggestions that the closer ties might eventually lead to a friendly takeover bid for the embattled software concern.News of the alliance came less than two weeks after a US court cleared one obstacle in rival Oracle's hostile $7.7bn bid for PeopleSoft. The court overturned an attempt by the Department of Justice to block the bid, though the US antitrust regulators may still appeal against the ruling.During the court hearing this year, Oracle predicted that the corporate software business would eventually be dominated by a handful of large companies, led by Microsoft, IBM and SAP of Germany, each of them selling a vertically integrated ?stack? of software.The alliance with IBM on Tuesday points to one part of that closer integration. All of PeopleSoft's software applications will be shipped with IBM's ?middleware? included free of charge, said Craig Conway, PeopleSoft's chief executive officer. Middleware provides the ?glue? for running distributed applications over the internet, making it a vital part of modern corporate technology infrastructure.Microsoft is building middleware into its Windows operating system, while SAP has developed rival middleware of its own to ship with its core applications products.PeopleSoft and IBM will spend a combined $1bn over the next five years to get their technologies to work better together. However, while saying that IBM would commit ?multi-hundreds of people? to the project, Steve Mills, head of software at IBM, said that some of the spending had been committed under earlier arrangements between the two companies.IBM has repeatedly said that it does not plan to re-enter the applications software business, which it quit several years ago. However, closer integration of the different layers of software, a trend highlighted by on Tuesday's alliance, has raised the prospect that old distinctions between classes of software will erode.
1148;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-09-17T10:06:28Z;The week in technology: Chipmakers under the cosh;;Chipmakers under the coshInfineon Technologies became the first semiconductor manufacturer to fall foul of US authorities' probe into price-fixing of high-speed memory chips.The German D-Ram chipmaker was fined $160m, the third-biggest anti-trust fine in US history, after it admitted meeting other manufacturers between 1999 and 2002 to fix prices charged to computer manufacturers.The move followed a two-year investigation into the market for D-Ram chips, used in computers, mobile phones and other electronic devices, by the US justice department.“This case sends the messgage that high-tech price-fixing cartels will not be tolerated,“ said John Ashcroft, US attorney-general.Some high-level Infineon employees helping with the investigation will be exempt from prosecution but others may face criminal charges.The justice department did not name other D-Ram manufacturers targeted by the probe, but some PC makers have filed class-action lawsuits against several companies including Infineon, Samsung, Hynix, Micron and Nanya.Samsung, the world's second largest chipmaker, will hope those suits come to nothing, because it is also facing an insider trading probe launched this week by the Korea Stock Exchange.The investigation was triggered by a 4 per cent leap in shares at the end of last week as speculation mounted that Samsung was about to launch a share buyback in a bid to revive its flagging share price.Lo and behold! the rumoured buyback appeared this week with Samsung promising to purchase 4m shares, valued at about $1.75bn, before the end of the year.If the KSE finds that Samsung violated disclosure rules, it would be a blow to Samsung's reputation as one of the best run companies in Asia and would weaken its share price, already under pressure because of concerns about slowing earnings momentum.Oracle enjoys unexpected twistOracle's hostile takeover bid for software rival, PeopleSoft, took another twist this week as the Department of Justice's attempt to block it was thwarted by a California court.The decision came as a surprise to lawyers, who believe the government could now struggle to reverse the ruling.The DoJ had expressed concerns that the merger of the two software companies was anti-competitive and risked an uplift in prices for products such as financial management and human resources software.The government claimed that large companies had identified Oracle, Peoplesoft and SAP of Germany as the only suppliers for the complex software they required.But the judge, who was criticised for “cherry-picking” evidence, ruled differently, saying that companies actually had a greater choice of software suppliers.The DoJ now has 10 days to launch an appeal but some antitrust lawyers were less than confident that it would succeed in getting the decision reversed.No doubt Oracle's shareholders will be looking for a speedy end to the saga as the group also revealed this week that its pursuit of Peoplesoft cost the group $29m in the latest quarter.The group also reported a steep decline in sales of its new software applications licences. But it denied that its fight for Peoplesoft had caused it to neglect its core businesses, shrugging off the sales drop as a “one-off aberration”.Better news came from Oracle's larger database business, which saw revenue jump 18 per cent in the three months to August 30. Total new software revenue rose by 7 per cent in the period.But the group cautioned that the current quarter could be slower than expected, partly due to the absence of flattering currency effects.More Microsoft software pirates convictedGerman man and his father became the latest people to be convicted in a crackdown on a multi-million euro software counterfeiting ring.Following an 18 week trial in Stuttgart, Dieter Rimmele was sentenced to three and a half years in prison with no parole, in addition to 10 months already served, after he was found guilty of copyright infringement and the sale of counterfeit Microsoft software.The sentence follows a five and a half year term handed down in July to the group's ringleader, Ralph Blasek. Mr Rimmele's father was also found guilty for his participation in the scheme and received a 16 month sentence.Both men were participants in one of Europe's largest software counterfeiting networks, which pirated Microsoft educational software, largely Windows- and Office-based products sold at a discount to schools and colleges, and resold the counterfeit versions at full price.Microsoft, which has made product security one of its biggest priorities this year after a series of security concerns over its Windows operating system, has been cooperating with law enforcement agencies in Germany and elsewhere and welcomed the tough sentences.In July Mr Blasek, a software dealer from Willich, near Bochum in Western Germany, was found guilty of repackaging more than 32,000 copies of software products and sold them on through his company Dino-Soft, defrauding the world's biggest software maker of about 4.5m and allowing Mr Blasek to live in the lap of luxury, owning properties around the world.Mr Rimmele's arrest in November 2003 followed a massive German police operation, in which 142 pallets of illegal software were discovered.Mr Rimmele was sentenced to a year in prison after a previous arrest in 1999 for software manipulation, but had continued to run his illicit operations from jail with the help of his parents.Job cuts in the valleyThe severity of the IT recession was brought into focus this week as a new report revealed that 400,000 jobs were lost in the US high technology sector between March 2001 and April 2004.Silicon Valley took the strongest blow, with San Francisco and San Jose losing 49 per cent and 33 per cent of their workforces respectively over the three-year period.The University of Chicago study said uncertainty over the pace of economic recovery had left IT companies reluctant to hire new employees and concerns had been heightened by the growing trend towards outsourcing.But recent evidence points to a tentative improvement in the IT job market since April, so hopefully the valley can look forward to greener days.
1149;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Market Overview: Oil prices kill off tentative rally;;"An early surge in oil prices and some grim US corporate news combined to send Wall Street lower and snuff out a tentative rally for European stock markets on Wednesday. Just when the recent rise in oil prices looked about to run out of steam, government data showing a fall in US crude inventories to their lowest level for seven months provided the impetus for yet more gains.However, by late New York trade the spike had reversed and Nymex crude for October was down 81 cents a barrel at $43.58 after peaking at $45.08 earlier.The inventories data were announced to the oil market as supply concerns related to hurricane Ivan began to ease. Opec's decision to raise formal output quotas had little impact on prices as the move will not to lead to an increase in actual output.Apart from the fluctuating oil price, Wall Street also suffered a nasty shock in the form of a profits warning from Coca-Cola, the world's biggest soft drinks company.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite index was 1 per cent weaker after Goldman Sachs downgraded its view on the technology sector from ""attractive"" to ""neutral"" due to a poor outlook for capital spending in the sector.There was some better news on the technology front from Oracle, the US software company, whose shares rose sharply in early trade after its quarterly earnings came in better than expected.Meanwhile, continental European stocks surrendered an early advance, with the FTSE Eurotop 300 index settling 0.2 per cent lower at 991.43 after earlier rising to within a whisker of the 1,000 level.London's FTSE 100 index outperformed as banking group HBOS rallied after walking away from the race to buy smaller rival Abbey National.The day's batch of US economic releases added to the uncertainty about prospects for the world's biggest economy. The New York Federal Reserve's Empire State index for September came in much higher than analysts had expected, helping to boost the dollar against most leading currencies. But the gains were capped by separate data showing unexpected weakness in industrial production last month."
1150;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-09-15T20:45:21Z;Coke warning and Ivan hit Wall Street;;"A profit-warning from Coca-Cola, obstinately high crude prices and the prospect of a large-scale disaster due to hurricane Ivan beat up Wall Street stocks on Wednesday.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.8 per cent to 10,231.40 while the broader S&P 500 index eased 0.7 per cent to 1,120.35. The Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent lower at 1,896.52.Weather forecasts saw the most attention as hurricane Ivan, packing winds of 140 mph (225 km/h), approached the Gulf of Mexico coast where more than 1.2m people were urged to evacuate. The storm could lead to heavy insurance claims if there is significant damage to populated areas.Ivan's potential impact on Gulf of Mexico oil production sent crude futures initially higher in spite of a decision by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output by 1m barrels per day starting November 1. Traders said the decision would have no impact because the cartel is already exceeding its self-imposed quotas.In spite of Wednesday's morning's downward momentum in trading, market observers such as Brian Bush, director of research at Stephens Inc, reiterated their belief that US stocks could rally in the final quarter of the year.""If we get through September and it turns out to be better than it has been historically, I think the stage is set for good earnings announcements and good outlook projections,"" Mr Bush said.On the other hand, Tobias Levkovich, the equity strategist at Smith Barney, told reporters on Tuesday that ""the fourth-quarter rally seems to have more to do with hope than with reason"".Coca-Cola, the leading soft drinks group and a component of the Dow industrials, said its second-half earnings would not meet analyst estimates, citing weak demand in key markets. Shares fell 4 per cent to $41.16.Coke's news weighed on the shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest US bottler of Coke soft drinks, which were off 2.3 per cent at $19.07. Coca-Cola Hellenic, the largest international bottler of Coke products, saw its shares lose 2.5 per cent to $22.95. So far this year Coke shares have lost 19.3 per cent while those of its two bottlers are 12.7 per cent lower and 8.8 per cent higher, respectively, since January.A bright spot came from the retail sector, where Best Buy shares rose 4.6 per cent to $52.61 after the consumer electronics retailer beat analyst estimates when it reported quarterly results. Circuit City, its main competitor, was 0.6 per cent higher at $13.92, off earlier highs.In the technology sector Oracle shares rose 7.4 per cent to $11.33 after the company beat analyst estimates when it announced results after the close on Tuesday.Oracle bucked the downward trend in tech shares, which saw losses across the board after Laura Conigliaro at Goldman Sachs issued a sobering outlook for technology spending in 2005. While pointing out the potential for a rally in tech stocks in the fourth quarter, she said: ""We see nothing in the tech capital spending outlook for [next year] that would suggest anything other than a moderate performance for tech stocks over the next twelve months.""As a result Microsoft shares were 0.9 per cent lower at $27.19 while Dell lost 1.7 per cent to $35.41. Hewlett-Packard was 0.7 per cent off at $18.28.The Soxx semiconductor index was 3.2 per cent lower, driven by a 5.3 per cent drop in Xilinx shares, to $27.50. It was the latest chipmaker to warn of slowing revenue growth due to customers' high inventories.In a reflection of a broader trend of rising inventories in the US, the Commerce Department said business inventories in July grew faster than expected and revised June's inventory growth upwards. While also seen as a sign of confidence among companies about future demand, high inventories lately appear to reflect slowing demand catching companies with too many goods in the warehouse."
1151;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-09-14T23:07:58Z;Oracle shrugs off summer spending slowdown;;Oracle shrugged off the worst effects of slowing corporate technology spending this summer to meet revenue forecasts for its latest quarter, though it endured a sharp fall in sales of new software applications licences.News of the 36 per cent fall in applications revenues follows the boost to Oracle's pursuit of rival application company PeopleSoft from a US court ruling last week, which rejected Department of Justice efforts to block the proposed hostile takeover. Harry You, chief financial officer, said there was ?no evidence? that Oracle's application software sales were dented by its pursuit of PeopleSoft. ?We think it was a one-off aberration,? he said of the fall which saw new applications revenues drop to $69m.Uncertainty over the bid has hurt PeopleSoft, which blamed its own disappointing second-quarter earnings on Oracle's approach. Oracle also said the bid had cost it $29m in the latest quarter. Meanwhile, Oracle's larger database business registered an 18 per cent increase in new licence revenues in the three months to the end of August, helping it shrug off the effects of the weaker applications business.Overall, Oracle's new software revenues rose by 7 per cent in the quarter, to $563m. That was near the bottom of the company's guidance of 5-15 per cent, although stronger than some analysts had expected.Mr You said Europe, in particular, was ?a little bit slower? than expected, referring to overall demand in recent months. He added, though, that the US software concern had generally been pleased with sales during what is typically its weakest quarter.Oracle's net income rose 16 per cent to $509m, while earnings per share of 10 cents compared with 8 cents a year ago. Overall sales, including revenue from software updates and services, climbed by 7 per cent, to $2.22bn.About four percentage points of the increase came from the translation effects of a weaker US dollar, Oracle said. The company also gave a more cautious forecast for its current quarter than Wall Street had been expecting, with revenue growth pegged in a range of 3-7 per cent against a consensus estimate from analysts of 7 per cent.New licence revenues could do anything from fall by 2 per cent to grow 8 per cent, it added. The cooling growth partly reflected the absence of the currency effects that have helped revenues in recent quarters, Mr You said.
1152;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;Antitrust victory for Oracle stymies DoJ;;Many antitrust experts were surprised last week when a California court ruled against the Department of Justice's attempt to block Oracle's $7.7bn hostile takeover bid for rival PeopleSoft. But many lawyers say the government now faces an uphill battle to appeal the decision, which could open the door to more mergers in the software industry.The DoJ had argued that large organisations and companies relied on Oracle, PeopleSoft and SAP of Germany for financial management and human resources software. Government lawyers said allowing Oracle to acquire PeopleSoft would have left two companies dominating the market, resulting in increased prices for consumers.In a 164-page decision, however, Judge Vaughn Walker took a different view of how the market for such software was defined. He concluded that the government had used an overly narrow definition of the software market, saying large companies had other choices for software.The government offered testimony from large companies that claimed that Oracle, PeopleSoft and SAP were the only options they could turn to for the complex software. But Judge Walker dismissed this evidence, saying the government had relied on customers' concerns as opposed to hard facts.?It's another in a series of opinions that really gives short shrift to the government's evidence,? says Charles Biggio, a lawyer at Akin Gump, who formerly worked in merger enforcement at the DoJ's antitrust division.Mr Biggio says it is difficult to conclude that the government had left gaps in its evidence. He argues instead that judges often subjectively pick through evidence and decide which elements to ignore or take seriously, which makes it very difficult to build a case.?If you're at the DoJ, you scratch your head and say, what do you have to do here?? Another antitrust lawyer, who describes the decision as ?shocking?, says the judge did not look at the preponderance of evidence but instead appeared to cherry-pick evidence that favoured Oracle.?I can smell the frustration of the justice department because they actually have the support of the industry customers,? says the lawyer. ?Giving the court the benefit of every doubt, what you can say is Oracle witnesses were better prepared and presented a more scientific analysis. The government witnesses said the right things and prayed the mantra but didn't pray with conviction.?The DoJ was given 10 days to decide whether to appeal the decision. Antitrust lawyers expect the government to appeal but say it faces a steep climb to get the decision overturned.Mr Biggio says the government is handcuffed by the extent to which Judge Walker outlined why he disregarded the testimony of the government witnesses. He says an appeals court would only be inclined to overturn the decision if they found he made an ?egregious mistake?.But David Balto, an antitrust lawyer at Robins Kaplan Miller & Ciresi, who was on the winning team SunGard in the last major merger case, argues that the DoJ could have some room to manoeuvre.?The decision is striking because of the lack of deference it gives to the testimony of customers, who are really the linchpin of antitrust analysis,? says Mr Balto. ?He's holding the government to too high a standard.?Mr Balto describes the decision as ?eminently appealable?. He says the judge chose to ignore customer evidence in favour of what are only theories about how competition in the software market could develop in the future.Failure by the government to get the decision overturned is likely to have broad ramifications for the software industry.?Like other mergers that initiate a process or trend, this could be followed by other companies combining or being taken over by larger competitors,? says Bob Pitofsky, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which, with the DoJ, regulates antitrust in the US.?You could get a bit of a merger trend in the software industry. It is probably sufficiently deconcentrated that some of the early mergers might not be a problem.?
1153;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-24T00:03:03+0000;European Comment: Vuitton finds euro a luxury;;Louis Vuitton's 150-year anniversary celebrations would be perfect but for one problem: the strong euro and the prospects it could rise even higher against the dollar.The ever-cheerful Yves Carcelle, head of the flagship leather goods company of the LVMH conglomerate, claims the overvalued euro is not spoiling the birthday party but making life a bit more difficult.“It is not dramatic for us,” he says, but the company would be growing even faster if the euro was lower. The problem is common to all top luxury brands condemned to manufacture their products in Europe to preserve their image.To protect margins in the US, its second-biggest market after Japan, Vuitton raised its prices this year. Arch-rival Gucci now regrets it did not follow suit with Serge Weinberg, the boss of Gucci owner PPR, saying the group in future would be more careful to defend margins from currencies.At a time when others are stepping up offshoring, luxury groups are turning into what Mr Carcelle calls “the last Indian reservations” of European manufacturing. The company has 14 plants in France, one in Switzerland for watches and another in Italy for shoes.There is a silver lining. “When the euro falls back, prices outside Europe will drop and we will see a strong rebound,” says Mr Carcelle. He may have to be very patient.Telecom suppliersIn the civil aircraft business, two dominant aircraft manufacturers and three engine makers supply scores of airlines. In the telecommunications industry, nearly 100 companies supply no more than a dozen large customers who are themselves busy consolidating.Something has to happen, says the head of one of Europe's leading telecom equipment and network suppliers. What and when is another question. But there are already three compelling reasons to trigger the long overdue consolidation of a sector now finally recovering from the technology bubble.First is the need to spread rising research and development costs that have traditionally accounted for 14-17 per cent of annual revenues over a wider base.Then there is the impetus given by smaller suppliers who managed to finance themselves before the market crashed four years ago. This has helped them ride out the crisis but pressure is now mounting on them to group together.Last but not least, many companies risked going bankrupt four years ago but were salvaged by their bankers. But the bankers are increasingly anxious to return to their banking roots rather than remain shareholders and industrial saviours of telecom equipment companies. The quicker they can get out, the better.Who will pull the trigger? To the chagrin of the Europeans and Americans, it may well be the Chinese who are showing a growing appetite to expand westwards in the telecom and electronics industry.Monti and OracleHowever you look at it, the US court decision to wave through Oracle's bid for Peoplesoft - overturning the Department of Justice - is bad news for Mario Monti.If the European competition chief rules against the bid he will bequeath to his successor, Neelie Kroes, the biggest transatlantic rift over a merger since he blocked General Electric's takeover of Honeywell in 2001.On the other hand, if, as many in Brussels expect, he approves the bid after the Commission has already laid out objections, he will be accused of failing to act independently of the US. And if he delays a decision beyond his departure in November, he will seem to be running scared.It is reasonable for Mr Monti to reassess the Commission's chances of success, because a reversal in the EU courts would damage its credibility. The US judge challenged arguments Brussels is likely to deploy in arguing the deal would reduce to two the number of competitors for certain business applications software for big companies.If, however, the Commission believes it can sustain its argument that an Oracle-SAP duopoly would be able to raise prices, then it should put customers' interests before the politics and block the bid.european.comment@ft.com
1154;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Lex: SAP;;Oracle's fight for PeopleSoft is starting to look like one where all players win prizes. Investors are betting that SAP, the leader in enterprise software, will benefit from Thursday's court ruling, which has cleared one hurdle for Oracle's takeover bid. After all, the uncertainty surrounding PeopleSoft has already helped Germany's SAP to extend its market share gains.Curiously, however, the shares of Oracle and PeopleSoft have also risen. This partly reflects hopes that the two will become a more credible threat to SAP. But, in that case, investors on one side of the Atlantic must be wrong. A more likely explanation is that the error lies with the US court.As the European Commission pointed out in its initial assessment, the deal would create a duopoly in key areas. Analysts hope it would reduce pricing pressures. The US Department of Justice might be well advised to cite recent SAP research notes from various banks, if it appeals against the US ruling. That does not mean that luscious software margins and revenue rises much higher than global economic growth will last forever. Oracle is right that the market for business applications software remains fluid. Even better returns in the high-end of the market would further increase its attractions to rivals, such as Microsoft. At 30 times this year's earnings, SAP's valuation still discounts the notion that it walk away with all the prizes.
1155;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-09-10T21:00:49Z;Earnings fears loom as Wall St rally slows;;"Wall Street notched its fifth consecutive weekly gain on Friday, but the recent rally seemed in danger of losing steam as investor worries about a coming earnings slowdown increased.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 10,313.07, for a 0.5 per cent gain on the week. The S&P 500 added 0.5 per cent to 1,123.92, for a gain of 0.9 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq was 1.3 per cent higher at 1,894.31, for a 2.7 per cent gain on the week.Trading volumes have remained relatively tepid throughout the week's four sessions.Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck, said: ""Investors are confronted with a decent economy but not a runaway economy and naggingly high oil prices …with that kind of backdrop it's not surprising we've gone from a summer lull into a fall lull.""Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, said investors' sunny mood became increasingly difficult to maintain in the face of Corporate America's warnings of soft demand.He noted that the pre- announcement season, when companies warn investors of disappointments and surprises in earnings, traditionally begins in the third or fourth week of the final month of a quarter. This week, the first of the final month of the quarter, marked an early start to the ""confessional season"". ""That tells me we've probably got a lot more coming,"" Mr Boockvar said.Technology stocks climbed in spite of warnings, because markets had anticipated the bad news - most notably from chipmakers, who in recent weeks signalled softer-than-expected demand. Plus, the sector has already been badly beaten. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index has shed about 20 per cent since July.But lower forecasts from other sectors, including foods, auto parts makers and materials producers, heightened investors' worries about a slowdown.Chipmakers admitting to slumping demand included Texas Instruments,which gained 0.6 per cent to $18.83 on Wednesday in spite of lowering its quarterly revenue outlook. National Semiconductor,which also reduced first fiscal quarter revenue expectations, still saw shares gain 12.3 per cent to $13.48 on Thursday, as investors focused on its robust quarterly profits.On Thursday night, chipmaker warnings emerged. Culprits included Transmeta,which lowered revenue guidance and saw shares drop 9.5 per cent to $1.34 by Friday's close. Atmel and Vishay Intertechnology reduced sales targets for the third quarter, blaming soft demand and slipping prices. Atmel shares slid 1.1 per cent to $3.71, while Vishay added 8.6 per cent to $13.70.Elsewhere, Alcoa,the world's biggest aluminium producer, dragged on the Dow, falling 7.6 per cent to $30.75 by the close on Friday after it said third-quarter earnings would miss Wall Street's expectations, blaming soft demand.Autoparts makers added to the gloom. American Axle shares slipped 2.8 per cent to $33.37 on Thursday after the General Motors supplier said earnings would be below forecasts. Visteon on Friday shed 11.1 per cent to $8, after the company warned that second-half results would be sharply below estimates.Bad news also emerged in the food sector, as Dean Foods, the largest dairy group in the US, warned on Wednesday that its third-quarter and full-year profits would drop sharply. Like ailing poultry producers last month, the company blamed rising fuel and raw materials prices. Shares fell 18.1 per cent to $30.40 on the day.However, a ray of light peered out from the technology sector on Friday, as Oracle appeared finally to have won its hostile takeover bid for rival software outfit PeopleSoft. On Thursday a court ruled against a Department of Justice attempt to block the deal. By the close, PeopleSoft shares had gained 10.3 per cent to $19.79."
1156;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Lex: Oracle/PeopleSoft;;Oracle used to say it was in the business of writing software, not cheques. But the software company's investors have had 15 long months to get used to Oracle's U-turn as it pursued PeopleSoft. Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, does not take no for an answer and the company's victory in the courts against the US Justice Department has shifted the balance of probability back towards an Oracle takeover of PeopleSoft.There are, it is true, a few more obstacles in Oracle's way: the EU has yet to rule, the Justice Department could appeal and PeopleSoft's poison pill has to be coughed up.Not all of these are under Oracle's control. But, by keeping the pressure on the PeopleSoft board, Oracle can certainly make it very difficult for its target to retain its takeover defences. The most obvious pressure is price.Oracle's offer has bounced around during this interminable bid battle. And at $21 a share, its current offer is hardly cheap, according to some estimates of the value in PeopleSoft's annuity-like maintenance revenues. For PeopleSoft to be worth nearly $8bn, Oracle will have to be able to extract significant cost savings and sell Oracle products to PeopleSoft customers. In the meantime, PeopleSoft's business has weakened and could weaken more - PeopleSoft's salesforce is hardly going to be the most motivated lot sensing possible job losses. This gives Oracle a better negotiating hand on price but even if the bid fails, Mr Ellison has weakened a competitor.
1157;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2004-09-09T22:03:29Z;Court rules in favour of Oracle over hostile bid;;Oracle on Thursday handed a big defeat to US anti-trust regulators as a court ruled against a Department of Justice effort to block the software company's hostile takeover bid for rival PeopleSoft.The sweeping decision found in favour of Oracle on most of the major issues raised by the trial. However, the justice department was given two months to decide whether to appeal against the ruling, while European anti-trust authorities are still conducting their own investigation into the proposed deal.The rare legal defeat for the US government's trustbusters threw one of the most contentious hostile takeover bids of recent years back into play. Oracle, which has been pursuing PeopleSoft for the past 15 months, immediately called on the embattled company to drop its defences and begin negotiations over the proposed $7.7bn deal.The decision could also touch off a round of mergers among other technology companies, since the high levels of concentration that exist in many tech markets had raised concerns in the past that deals would be blocked on anti-trust grounds, analysts said. ?It certainly opens the conversation to that,? said Crawford del Prete, head of research at IDC, a tech research firm.The justice department had argued that a combination of the second- and third-largest makers of the specialised software applications used by large companies to run their financial management and human resources would lead to less choice and higher prices. Alongside market-leader SAP,the German software maker, it would have left only two companies dominating an important part of the business, it claimed.However, judge Vaughn Walker, the federal court judge in San Francisco who heard the case, ruled that the US government had taken too narrow a definitiion of the software market that would be affected by the merger. He called evidence from an economist who acted as a key witness for the justice department ?wholly in applicable? to the market analysis at the heart of the case, while also condemning as ?equivocal and vague? much of the other evidence presented by the government.The decision represents a major loss for the justice department, whose last significant loss in a merger case involved a 2001 decision involving SunGard, another technology company. In that case, the court rejected the DoJ's market definition because it could not demonstrate that a substantial number of customers would be left without competitive alternatives after a merger.Though the US government's case was based on traditional anti-trust analysis, the theory has been largely untested in court when it comes to the technology industry, said David Balto, an anti-trust lawyer at Robins Kaplan Miller & Ciresi. The judge's ruling that the anti-trust regulators had not met the basic market-definition test opens the way to other potential deals in the software industry, he added.PeopleSoft's shares jumped by around 13 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday to stand at around $20.36, close to the $21 a share that Oracle has offered for the company. PeopleSoft said its board would consider the implications of the legal decision, though it added that the board had rejected Oracle's offer in the past as inadequate.
1158;ORCL;Oracle Corp;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Wall Street traders find little reason to act;;Wall Street drifted lower on Wednesday as some companies gave profit warnings and Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, gave a neutral assessment of the economy to Congress, failing to inspire market participants to more decisive trades.Mr Greenspan continued to attribute the slowing growth of the economy to higher energy costs while pointing out that expansion was still occurring, a position some economists took issue with.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 10,313.36, while the broader S&P 500 index edged off 0.5 per cent to 1,116.27. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 percent lower at 1,850.27.The action failed to offer relief from the late-August lull, which some senior traders said was even duller than they had seen in previous years.Arthur Cashin at UBS noted the lockstep of the indices in the previous session, as well as early yesterday. He said that such action generally owed more to so-called momentum surfing, or algorithmic trading decisions made automatically through computerised models, as opposed to longer-term investment decisions from money managers.Mr Greenspan told the Budget committee that the world's largest economy was growing “reasonably well”, thus avoiding possible accusations of partisanship from either Republicans or Democrats.Market participants are also pondering what Mr Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve might do to benchmark interest rates this month, with the consensus view being that the economic situation is far from clear.Market participants did not get much clarity on that topic from the Fed's Beige Book, the periodical survey of grassroots conditions in the economy, gathered from its regional offices. The report said economic growth slowed somewhat in the summer months due to lower consumer spending.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, disagreed with some of Mr Greenspan's relative optimism and concluded that the Fed would raise interest rates this month.On the corporate front, the shares of Texas Instruments added 0.6 per cent to $18.83 as the mobile phone chipmaker lowered its quarterly revenue outlook a week after Intel announced similar moves.Elsewhere in technology, Oracle shares eased 2.2 per cent to $9.86 following a downgrade by analysts at Piper Jaffray. Shares in PeopleSoft, with which Oracle is embroiled in a hostile bid battle, were off 1.3 cent to $17.49.In deal-making news, the shares of Tellabs rose 4.9 per cent to $9.57 after the telecommunications equipment provider revised the terms of its buyout offer for Advanced Fibre Communications, whose shares fell 7.6 per cent to $15.90. Acquisitions are generally seen as dilutive for the shareholder value of the acquiring company and accretive for the target group.Coca-Cola lost 4.8 per cent to $43.45, weighing on the Dow, after the largest bottller of its products cut its earnings forecast.Also lower was Avon Products, the cosmetics company, which warned of lower operating profits by as much as 10 per cent. Shares lost 6.1 per cent to $42.86.Dean Foods, the largest dairy group in the US, gave another grim outlook to investors, a day after saying it was facing sharply lower profits due to a variety of factors. Shares tumbled 18.1 per cent to $30.40.Among pharmaceuticals, the shares of Mylan Laboratories added 0.6 per cent to $18.18 after news that Carl Icahn, a well-known investor, had acquired a 6.8 per cent stake in the company and opposed its acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals. Shares in King fell 5.3 per cent to $12.32.In airline stocks the shares of JetBlue added 0.3 per cent to $23.14 after the low-cost carrier, and one of few stockmarket darlings in the sector, said the aftermath of Hurricane Frances would hurt its earnings by affecting demand for its flights to Florida.Among insurers, the shares of Allstate eased 0.8 per cent to $47.54 while St Paul Travelers was off 0.4 per cent at $34.04. Jay Cohen, analyst at Merrill Lynch, cut earnings estimates for the two insurers by 2.7 per cent and 5.1 per cent, respectively, noting worse than expected effects on the companies' earnings from Hurricane Charley.
