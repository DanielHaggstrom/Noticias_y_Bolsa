0;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2018-01-08T12:34:13Z;Geopolitical rivalries cloud prospects for Mediterranean gas finds;Fields are attractively close to Europe but political risks make development complex;When gas started flowing from the Zohr field last month it was an important step in Egypt’s drive for energy independence and signified that the eastern Mediterranean was finally establishing itself as a force in gas production.Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Eni, the Italian group leading the $12bn project, said Zohr would “completely transform Egypt’s energy landscape, allowing it to become self-sufficient and turn from an importer of gas into a future exporter”.Zohr is the largest hydrocarbon discovery made in the Mediterranean and the hunt is on for more. Israel and Cyprus see similar potential to end dependency on energy imports and generate an economic windfall by exporting surplus supplies. Lebanon is also opening its waters to exploration.The prospect of a big new source of gas on Europe’s doorstep looks strategically attractive when North Sea reserves are in decline and the region is fretting about its dependence on Russian supplies.Yet development of eastern Mediterranean resources is far from straightforward because of the cocktail of political risks and rivalries involving the countries concerned.“The exploitation of gas reserves could change dramatically the political and economic climate in the eastern Mediterranean,” says Emmanuel Karagiannis, an energy security specialist at King’s College London. “At the same time . . .[it] has the potential to exacerbate decades-old border disputes and generate new tensions.”Even if the politics can be resolved, the economics are just as tricky. Global energy markets are awash with cheap gas from Russia, the US and elsewhere. Zohr made sense because of domestic demand but Israel and Cyprus require exports for their projects to pay off. “The obstacles are commercial as much as political,” says Gareth Winrow, an independent energy and foreign policy analyst. “It’s going to be difficult for the eastern Mediterranean to compete.”Despite these doubts, progress is being made. A drilling ship leased by Eni and its partner Total of France arrived off southern Cyprus last month to explore west of the Aphrodite field, which was discovered in 2011. Work started last year to develop Israel’s long-awaited Leviathan gasfield in a $3.75bn project led by Noble Energy of the US, and the go ahead is expected this year for the nearby Karish and Tanin fields controlled by Energean of Greece.Finding and developing gas is only half the challenge, however. At least as difficult is establishing the export routes to reach international markets.Political support has been given to a proposed €6bn pipeline from Israel to Italy via Cyprus and Greece. The four countries signed a provisional agreement last month to jointly develop the project with an aim for completion by 2025. But, at 2,000km in length and depths of up to 3km, it would be the longest and most difficult subsea development of its kind. Many experts doubt its viability.A cheaper option would be a pipeline via Turkey but Arab-Israeli hostilities rule out a path through Lebanese and Syrian waters, even if Israel and Turkey could overcome their own differences. An alternative route close to Cyprus is no easier given Nicosia’s fraught relationship with Ankara, which supports the breakaway Turkish part of the island.Mr Karagiannis says a pipeline could form part of an eventual settlement of the Cyprus dispute but that is an uncertain prospect after peace talks broke down last year.For now, hydrocarbons look more likely to inflame tensions. Turkey has condemned the latest drilling off Cyprus as an “unacceptable” violation of “the inalienable rights” of the Turkish Cypriot people. A Turkish seismic research vessel has been positioned off northern Cyprus in a sign of Ankara’s desire for a stake in the region’s resources.Analysts question whether energy companies will commit the billions of dollars needed to develop Cypriot gas in the absence of a deal to remove the political risks. Aphrodite is still undeveloped six years after discovery.Egypt has found it easier to attract investment because of its much larger domestic market. Zohr came on stream less than three years after discovery, compared with the seven taken to start development of Israel’s Leviathan. There is already an export route for Egyptian gas via the country’s two liquefied natural gas terminals, from which tankers can serve not only Europe but also Asia through the Suez Canal. The LNG plants have been dormant in recent years as falling domestic production turned Egypt into a gas importer. But the arrival of Zohr, together with new developments by BP in the Nile Delta, could produce surpluses in the 2020s.Israel and Cyprus could also feed gas into the Egyptian LNG terminals via much shorter pipelines than those proposed to Italy and Turkey. A report for the European Parliament last year deemed this the most realistic option.“Egypt seems to hold the key to the eastern Mediterranean’s gas future,” the report said.Tarek El-Molla, Egypt’s petroleum minister, told the Financial Times last year that his country was willing to work with neighbours to create an energy hub. “We are ready to receive this gas, liquefy it and sell it to the international market,” he said.The incentives for co-operation are strong but so too are the barriers. As Egypt reaps the rewards of Zohr, its neighbours face difficult choices if they are to unlock the full energy potential of a region that has mixed commerce and conflict for millennia.
1;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2017-10-15T04:43:32Z;BlackRock and Vanguard’s climate change efforts are glacial;The engagement excuse on global warming is wearing thin, writes Attracta Mooney;BlackRock, a large investor in companies that rely heavily on fossil fuels, does not seem a likely environmentalist.But one year ago, the world’s largest asset manager issued a stark warning about global warming. “Investors can no longer ignore climate change,” said the fund house, which oversees $6tn in assets.The New York-listed company argued that even if one did not agree with the science, investors could not disregard the “swelling tide of climate-related regulations and technological disruption”. Investors, it said, needed to act to protect their portfolios.Yet just a few months later, BlackRock appeared to forget its own warning. Throughout the year to June 2017, the fund house repeatedly voted against resolutions at annual general meetings that called on companies to provide more clarity about how they might be affected by climate change.According to Proxy Insight, the data provider, BlackRock voted against so-called scenario-planning climate change resolutions, which are typically put forward by shareholders and often not supported by management, at 14 oil and gas companies, including Southern Company, Noble Energy and Hess. It backed the measures at just two, the big oil majors ExxonMobil and Occidental.In most cases, the resolutions asked that companies annually assess how they might be affected by measures to limit temperature rises to 2C, in line with the 2015 Paris agreement.BlackRock is not alone in its inconsistent voting. JPMorgan and Vanguard, which have also warned of the risks posed by climate change, failed to back resolutions at 14 companies, but supported them at two. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-largest fund house, supported resolutions at eight oil and gas companies, abstained at five and voted against at three, according to Proxy Insight.This patchy record makes little sense. If a fund house believes climate change could hurt stocks over the longer term, it seems sensible that investors should demand as much information as possible on these risks at all companies.Investors with inconsistent records typically explain the difference in their voting record as “engagement”. Big investors often speak to management privately during the year, and particularly before AGMs, and will try to use their influence to change company policy behind the scenes.This is BlackRock’s explanation for its voting record. It says it takes “climate change seriously and engages with relevant companies”.“We do vote for shareholder proposals on climate when we think our engagement has not led to the change we seek,” BlackRock told FTfm. “We don’t decide how to vote based solely on our views on the issue under consideration. Our vote reflects our assessment of the company’s response to our engagement in light of the long-term financial impact.”But almost two years after the Paris agreement, the excuse of engagement is wearing thin. Climate change will not just affect a few, it has the ability to alter entire sectors radically. And secret discussions will not drive the sector-wide disclosure that is required.As Carolyn Hayman, who co-chairs Preventable Surprises, a lobby group, says: “We are talking about systemic risk from climate change that will effect the whole economy worldwide. [Investors] have a fiduciary duty to understand this.“A case-by-case approach doesn’t get the sector-wide change that is really needed. No one but the people engaging can know what the impact of engaging is. [This] requires a top-down approach rather than company by company.”The climate change issue is here to stay. Even with the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement, governments show few signs of slowing down their drive to limit global warming — including France and the UK, which will both ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2040.Investors will of course continue filing resolutions at a wide variety of companies over climate change. But it is now up to the world’s biggest investors to put their vote where their mouth is. A couple of high-profile protest votes that generate nice headlines is no longer good enough.As Ms Hayman says: “A lot of investors are very concerned and are voting against management in really large numbers [on climate change resolutions]. It’s time for Vanguard and BlackRock to get with the project.”Attracta Mooney is the FT’s investment correspondent
2;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2017-08-03T17:40:51Z;Energy shares drag S&P lower amid output concerns;;Energy stocks dragged the S&P 500 lower on Thursday as quarterly earnings from a number of mid-sized oil producers disappointed and moderating output growth raised concerns for the remainder of 2017.The S&P energy sector was the day’s biggest loser, dropping 1.1 per cent and weighed on the broader S&P 500, which was trading 0.2 per cent lower in midday trading. The day’s decline takes the energy sector’s losses so far this year to nearly 13 per cent – the most among the 10 major sectors on the S&P.Pioneer Natural Resources, Apache Corporation, Noble Energy and Conocho Resources were among the biggest laggards on the benchmark index after their latest results missed expectations and forecasts for production growth has been adjusted.Pioneer extended its losses from Wednesday, dropping another 5.6 per cent after closing 10.8 per cent lower last night. The oil and production company, which narrowly missed revenue estimates in the quarter, said it now expects production growth to be between 15-16 per cent – the lower end of its previous forecast of 15-18 per cent growth.Apache, which also missed revenue estimates, lowered its daily production forecasts following the sale of its Canadian assets last month. In 2017 it expects between 457,00 to 471,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, down from 485,000 to 503,000. Shares in the group are 6.7 per cent lower at $44.67.Nobel Energy, in its quarterly earnings, posted a dramatically worse-than-expected loss of $3.20 per share, far more than the 13 cents loss analysts had expected. The decline stemmed from an exit of an upstream asset in Marcellus shale, though the company met expectations on revenue. Adjusted for this, the company said it expects annual production to be on the mid to upper end of its previous guidance. Shares are down 8.1 per cent to $25.78.Shares in Concho also fell 10.9 per cent to $114.65. Revenue of $635m missed expectations of $673m, though the group actually raised its production growth forecast. It expects a growth of between 24 per cent and 26 per cent.Appetite for energy stocks was also dented by the fresh drop in oil prices. After being boosted by the weaker dollar last week, crude has endured choppier trading over the past couple of days. West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, was down 0.8 per cent at $49.21 a barrel while Brent was down 0.3 per cent at $52.22.
3;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2017-01-19T11:05:24Z;‘Permania’ grips the US shale oil industry;Crude found in the Permian Basin straddling Texas and New Mexico is an M&A hotspot;They call it “Permania”. The Permian Basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico has become the hottest region in the US shale oil industry, for drilling, for production and for dealmaking.The region was already in high demand for acquisitions last year, and a couple of deals this week with a combined value of almost $10bn have confirmed that Permian assets are still the most sought-after for companies seeking to increase their US oil production.Asset prices have been bid up to the point that some observers are starting to ask if they are unsustainable.As one respondent to a recent survey for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas put it: “Permian transactions are approaching price multiples associated with a bubble or a Ponzi scheme”, reminiscent of the property boom of the early 1980s or the technology bubble of the 1990s.As in the dotcom bubble, there is a technological revolution underlying the inflation of asset prices. Spurred by the slump in crude prices that began in 2014, shale oil producers across the US have been cutting costs and boosting productivity.The Permian region has weathered the downturn the best. Since April 2015, oil production has dropped 19 per cent and 37 per cent respectively in the shale areas of Bakken in North Dakota and Eagle Ford in south Texas, according to the US Energy Information Administration. However, in the Permian it has risen 14 per cent.The best parts of the Permian are now among the lowest-cost sources of new oil anywhere in the world, according to Wood Mackenzie, the research company. There are some large packages of drilling rights available, and companies with the financial strength to make acquisitions have been taking full advantage.In 2012 there were 21 merger and acquisition deals involving Permian assets. Last year there were 66, representing about a third of the total number of transactions in the US onshore oil and gas sector.Valuations have also been soaring. In 2012, Concho Resources paid $1bn, or about $5,000 per acre of drilling rights, for the assets of the Three Rivers companies in the Delaware and Midland basins, which are sections of the Permian.Last August Concho paid $1.6bn for operations with drilling rights on 40,000 acres in the Midland Basin, giving a valuation of about $28,000 per acre.In the highest-priced deal last year, QEP Resources paid $600m for assets, which worked out at about $58,000 per acre.Those comparisons are never precise, because no two areas are identical, but they give a sense of how dramatically prices have risen.The two deals announced this week confirmed the market was still healthy. ExxonMobil is paying up to $6.6bn in cash and stock to the low-profile billionaire Bass family, for companies with 275,000 acres of drilling rights, with 250,000 of those in the Permian. That works out at $24,000 per acre.Noble Energy has agreed to buy Midland-based Clayton Williams Energy for $3.2bn including debt, valuing its drilling rights at about $35,000 per acre.The value of Permian assets has been transformed by advances in production technology. Following the initial breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling and seismic surveying that first made oil production from shale viable in 2009-10, companies have continued to innovate to boost output and cut costs.One of the motives for acquisitions has been for producers to secure larger patches of contiguous acreage, so they can drill more efficiently. From a single “pad”, horizontal wells can be drilled like the spokes of a wheel, cutting down the time spent moving rigs.Companies have also been experimenting with tighter spacing of the clusters of perforations punched through the steel well casing and into the shale rock to crack it. Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the leading producers in the Permian, said last year that it had gone from spacing perforation clusters 60ft apart to having them 30ft apart, and was experimenting with 15ft.More intensive well completions such as these are more expensive, but they can also be much more productive. Peak production for wells in the Midland and Delaware basins was about 35 per cent higher in 2016, according to Drillinginfo, a data and analysis company.At the end of 2011, the Permian was adding 101 barrels per day of new oil production per rig in the region, according to the EIA. Next month, it will be 660 barrels per day per rig: a sixfold increase in just five years.As a result, many companies find it commercially viable to bring Permian wells into production, even with US crude at today’s levels of about $52 per barrel.The number of rigs in the region drilling horizontal oil wells has nearly doubled from its low of 116 last May, reaching 221 last week, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group.That increase is likely to continue. The problem for the region is that as increased drilling also raises US crude production, it will put downward pressure on prices.Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, has been a big help to US exploration and production companies by securing an agreement last year to curb output, but that is scheduled to last only six months.Not all analysts agree that the prices being paid for Permian assets are excessive. Drillinginfo has estimated that even QEP’s deal last year could still be profitable with US crude above $31.50 per barrel. But Wood Mackenzie thinks that on average the Permian deals announced in 2016 need oil at $67 per barrel to break even.In the long term, the future of the Permian looks bright. The region has many layers of oil-bearing shale, and companies are only just beginning to explore the potential of those multiple zones.But if oil prices falter, companies that have been overambitious with their acquisitions will face difficulties.“If history holds true,” says Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie, “the tail-end of the boom is when the cliff edge back to reality emerges.”A critical factor in sustaining the US shale industry through the oil price downturn has been the support of the capital markets, and particularly equity investors.US exploration and production companies raised a record $34.1bn in equity financing last year, according to Dealogic, and often they issued shares to make acquisitions.RSP Permian, for example, in October announced a $2.4bn cash-and-shares deal to buy two companies called Silver Hill with assets in the Delaware Basin, a section of the Permian Basin. This involved a stock issue to raise about $870m to finance the cash component of the transaction.PDC Energy similarly announced in August a $1.5bn deal to buy two privately held companies operating in the Delaware Basin, and then in September a $500m share issue to help finance it.The trend has continued into 2017, with Parsley Energy, another Permian-focused company, last week agreeing deals for assets in the Midland and Delaware basins for $650m, and launching a share issue that raised $770m. That plan, from a company that was active in buying assets in 2016, too, received an initially sceptical reaction from the stock market, but its shares have since rebounded.Investor appetite for US E & P company equities will probably be put to the test this year with several initial public offerings, according to Bill Nelson of Haynes and Boone, the law firm. They will follow Extraction Oil & Gas, which in October became the first US E & P company to float for more than two years.
4;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2017-01-19T10:56:05Z;Oil & gas M&A: back to basics;Straightforward buyouts for drillers have been few and far between;"The ingenuity of oil and gas companies is not limited to just digging wells. They have become masters in complex deal structures such as exotic “DrillCos”, joint ventures and leasing arrangements. They use these to raise rescue cash when commodity prices are low or expand production as they rise. In this context, a straightforward if dull acquisition such as this week’s outright purchase of Clayton Williams Energy by Noble Energy for $3.2bn has become something of an anomaly.In one sense, Clayton Williams is no outlier. Its acreage is in the Delaware Basin, a subsection of Texas’s Permian Basin. This is considered America’s most productive shale deposit; ExxonMobil said on Tuesday it would acquire $6.6bn-worth of drilling leases there, while independents WPX Energy and Parsley Energy made big bets there last week totalling more than $1bn.There was $133bn-worth of oil and gas M&A in 2016, according to Dealogic, well ahead of any year since 2012. But for all the speculation about which quoted group would be next to succumb, the only large public company target last year was Memorial Resource Development. It was acquired by Range Resources for $4bn.The obstacles to buying the equity of an energy producer outright are numerous. The volatile oil price makes negotiating a premium tricky (Noble Energy is paying for Clayton Williams partly with equity, so the target will share in any upside). The net debt, which may be distressed, has to be bought out at par. And as Société Générale points out, equity markets are wide open for oil and gas groups, so E&P firms can sell shares in order to fund expansion instead of buying it through other companies.Clayton Williams shares traded as low as $7 in 2016 so the $139 takeover price has worked well for investors. Some 20 independent producers in the US look as appetising as Clayton Williams. Their investors will also be dreaming of a bidder with the self-confidence to overcome the odds stacked against a deal.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
5;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2017-01-17T18:34:45Z;ExxonMobil buys drilling rights in big bet on US shale;Oil group acquires package of companies as it doubles resource base in Permian Basin;ExxonMobil has placed a big bet on US shale oil, agreeing a deal worth up to $6.6bn to buy companies with drilling rights on about 250,000 acres in the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico.The deal, which is worth $5.6bn in Exxon shares plus up to $1bn more in cash, is the company’s largest since the $41bn acquisition of XTO Energy, agreed in 2009.It is also the first big decision for Darren Woods, the new chief executive who took over from Rex Tillerson at the end of last year.Exxon is buying a package of companies from the Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, which was identified by Forbes magazine as one of the 30 richest families in the US in 2015, controlling an “intensely private fortune”.The deal is the clearest indication yet of how Exxon and other large US oil groups have shifted their attention from large multibillion-dollar projects to more flexible developments where individual wells are much less expensive. The acquisition will double Exxon’s resource base in the Permian region to about 6bn barrels of oil equivalent.The deal is also the latest example of the intense interest from oil producers in the Permian region, which holds a number of different shale layers including the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Spraberry formations.About half the value of all acquisitions in the US onshore oil and gas production sector last year was spent in the Permian region, according to Wood Mackenzie, the research company.Sections of the Permian Basin are among the world’s lowest-cost areas for new oil production, encouraging a flood of investment into the region. However, asset values have been rising sharply, and some analysts have warned that the prices now being paid mean deals will be profitable only if oil prices rise significantly from current levels of about $53 per barrel for US crude.On Monday Noble Energy announced that it had agreed a deal worth $3.2bn including debt to buy Clayton Williams Energy, a company with 171,000 net acres of drilling rights in the Permian region.The companies being acquired by Exxon hold drilling rights to 250,000 acres in the Permian, most of that in a section in New Mexico called the Delaware Basin, and 25,000 acres scattered around other locations.They are estimated to hold 3.4bn barrels of oil equivalent, about 2.6bn of those in crude and related liquids.The price paid by Exxon works out at about $24,000 per acre of drilling rights, which is in line with other prices paid for deals in the Permian region, and well below the maximum of about $50,000 per acre paid last year.Mr Woods said in a statement that the Delaware Basin investment “can generate attractive returns in a low-price environment.”He added: “By utilising ExxonMobil’s technological strength coupled with its unconventional development capabilities, we can drill the longest lateral wells in the Permian Basin, reducing development costs and increasing reserve capture.”
6;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Noble Energy buys Clayton Williams in $3.2bn shale deal;;Noble Energy is to buy Clayton Williams Energy, a Texas oil and gas explorer, for $3.2bn including debt – in the latest sign of consolidation in the shale oil industry following the collapse of crude prices two-and-a-half years ago.Under the terms of the deal, Clayton Williams shareholders would receive 2.7874 shares of Noble common stock and $34.75 in cash for each of their shares.Based on Noble’s closing stock price of $37.39 on Friday, this values Clayton Williams shares at about $139 each – and represents a 33 per cent premium to Clayton’s closing stock price on Friday.Noble – which operates offshore, and onshore fields in Colorado and Pennsylvania – is also taking on about $500m of Clayton William’s net debt.The acquisition is the latest for Noble, which bought another shale producer Rosetta Resources for about $3.7bn including debt in May 2015.Despite the recent recovery in crude prices, analysts said they expect consolidation to continue in the energy sector.
7;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2016-09-26T13:54:16Z;Israel’s Leviathan signs $10bn gas deal with Jordan’s Nepco;;Shareholders in Israel’s Leviathan offshore gas field have signed a landmark deal to supply Jordan’s National Electric Power Co (Nepco) over 15 years, in a deal valued at $10bn.Israel’s Delek Drilling, which owns a 23 per cent share of the project, announced the signing of the deal in an announcement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and Israel Security Authorities on Monday, reports John Reed in Jerusalem.The contract will see Leviathan deliver 45 billion cubic meters of gas once the field begins producing, and transportation systems in Israel and Jordan needed to deliver the gas to Nepco are ready, Delek said.“The supply of natural gas to Jordan will enable the people of Jordan to benefit from the same clean, efficient and economical energy source as in Israel and will contribute to the continuing economic growth and prosperity of the respective economies of Jordan and Israel,” Yossi Abu, CEO of Delek Drilling and Avner Oil Exploration, another Leviathan shareholder, said.Delek and Avner’s shares both rose on Monday afternoon after the companies reported the news.Mr Abu said Leviathan’s partners would continue to pursue long-term sales agreements with other customers in the eastern Mediterranean, including in Egypt, Turkey, and the Palestinian Authority.Jordan and the Leviathan partners signed a letter of intent on the gas supply agreement in 2014, but the project was mired for more than a year in regulatory red tape in Israel. The notion of buying gas from Israel has brought protests in Jordan from political activists and some MPs who oppose doing business with the Jewish state.Leviathan’s largest shareholder is Houston-based Noble Energy, which owns just under 40 per cent of the estimated $5.5bn project.Jordan’s industry minister told the Financial Times last week that his country was demanding Tel Aviv allow more Jordanian exports into the West Bank and cover the costs of a section of gas pipeline inside Israel before agreeing to the deal.There was no immediate word on whether Israel, with which Jordan has a peace treaty dating back to 1994, had ceded to these demands.The Jordanian economy has been feeling the impact of an energy shock since 2011, when the political chaos of the Arab Spring disrupted the supply of low-price Egyptian gas on which it relied.
8;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2016-09-04T11:22:33Z;Israel seeks to lure big oil and gas groups for rights auction;Bids are due in November for 24 offshore drilling blocks;"Israel says some of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies have expressed interest in its forthcoming auction of exploration rights as the country attempts to restore confidence among investors after years of regulatory uncertainty.Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s energy minister, will hold talks with potential Asian investors in Singapore this week after meetings in London last week.Bids are due in November for 24 blocks being opened for drilling off the Israeli coast.The roadshow represents an attempted relaunch of Israel’s natural gas resources among overseas investors after delays to the $6.5bn Leviathan offshore project led by Noble Energy of the US and Delek of Israel.The project was finally approved by the Israeli government in June after surviving an antitrust investigation and a Supreme Court challenge by opponents who claimed Noble and Delek would have too much control over the country’s gas reserves.Uncertainty over Leviathan has deterred further investment in exploration but Mr Steinitz said the regulatory framework had now stabilised.“Israel is back in business,” he told the Financial Times.Interest in eastern Mediterranean gas has been fuelled by big finds in Egypt, where Eni of Italy and BP of the UK have committed to large developments this year. Cyprus is also thought to have significant untapped resources.Mr Steinitz said the region was emerging as an important new source of gas for Europe as North Sea reserves decline. “If you want to be part of what’s happening in the eastern Mediterranean, you need a presence in Israel,” he said. “Most of the natural gas in Israeli economic waters is still to be found.”The latest geological surveys were presented at a conference in London last week and in Houston earlier this year. Once the Singapore wing is completed, most large and medium-sized oil and gas groups will have attended one of the presentations, Mr Steinitz said.BP is among those known to have attended the London event but it and other companies contacted by the FT declined to comment on their potential interest.Analysts said the industry remained wary of Israel after the Leviathan delays and cautioned that attracting investment in exploration anywhere in the world was currently difficult with energy companies under pressure from low oil prices.Israel is already self-sufficient in gas from its Tamar field, operated by Noble and Delek; Mr Steinitz said Leviathan and any further finds would be used for export.Deals have been struck with Egypt and Jordan for gas from Leviathan but the longer-term aim is to establish an export route to western Europe. Three main options are under consideration: shipping by sea from liquefied natural gas terminals in Egypt and potential pipelines through Turkey or through Cyprus and Greece.The region’s tense diplomatic relations could complicate the push to link eastern Mediterranean gas with international markets but Mr Steinitz said there was a strong incentive for co-operation. Israel had received more visits from Cypriot and Greek leaders in the past year than for decades previously, he added."
9;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Positive data and bets by hedge funds that the oil price would rise also helped to send prices higher.But Monday’s pullback led to a broad decline in oil company stock prices.Marathon, the Houston-based exploration and production company, led the pack, falling 6.9 per cent to $15.64 amid the additional investor pressure triggered by managerial changes.JR Sult, the company’s chief financial officer, left the company on Monday, citing personal reasons. Pat Wagner, vice-president of corporate development and strategy, has been named interim chief financial officer.Marathon, also the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index on Monday, has struggled due to the prolonged drop in oil prices.It reported its sixth straight quarterly loss this month, cutting its production outlook for the year. It has curtailed spending and sold off more than $1bn in assets.It said its revenue fell below $1bn in May for the first time since it became a standalone company in 2002.Other oil stocks also struggled. Murphy Oil was down 3.3 per cent to $29.07, Noble Energy fell 1.5 per cent to $35.57 and Southwestern Energy declined 1.8 per cent to $13.47.At the other end of the spectrum, pharmaceutical companies saw early gains after Pfizer reached a deal worth $14bn to acquire California biotechnology company Medivation.Pfizer, the world’s second-largest drugmaker, saw its stock tick up by 0.2 per cent before giving up ground and closing 0.4 per cent lower at $34.84. Medivation, not in the S&P 500 index, soared higher, up 19.7 per cent to $80.42.The top three performers in the S&P 500 index were pharmaceutical companies.Regeneron rose 3.6 per cent to $418.65, Vertex Pharmaceuticals gained 3 per cent to $100.96 and Alexion Pharmaceuticals climbing 3.3 per cent to $136.53.Elsewhere, clothing brand Urban Outfitters saw its stock fall 3.2 per cent to $36.61 as Goldman Sachs downgraded it from buy to neutral. The bank suggested it was at “near peak” operating performance, leaving less room for meaningful improvement.The S&P 500 was relatively unchanged at 2,182.6, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 18,529.4, and the Nasdaq Composite ticked 0.1 per cent higher to 5,244.6.
11;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2016-07-18T16:47:56Z;EnQuest plans stake sale in North Sea field;Deal with Delek of Israel to reduce UK company’s debt load amid fall in crude prices;Plans by EnQuest to sell a stake in one of the biggest development projects in the North Sea show how independent oil and gas producers are scrambling to shore up their balance sheets in response to prolonged oil price weakness.EnQuest said on Monday it was in talks about selling 20 per cent of the Kraken oilfield east of the Shetland Islands to Delek Group of Israel, in a deal analysts estimate would reduce the UK company’s debts by as much as $190m this year.Kraken was given the go-ahead in 2013 when oil prices were over $100 a barrel but, in common with many energy projects, its multibillion-dollar development costs have become a heavier strain since oil prices crashed in 2014.While the final terms of the deal were still under negotiation, analysts said the main financial component was likely to be the share of capital expenditure taken on by Delek, which has agreed to backdate its contributions to January 1.James Hosie at Barclays said this was likely to result in a cash injection of $170m for EnQuest in 2016, in addition to a $20m loan from Delek which will only be repayable if the Israeli group has not recovered its project costs after five years.He added the deal was likely to be dilutive to EnQuest’s shares and highlighted “both the challenging North Sea asset market with oil prices below $50 per barrel and EnQuest’s need to reduce its debt levels”.Shares in EnQuest closed 0.84 per cent down at £29.50 yesterday.Other London-listed independent explorers have also been scrambling to strengthen their finances in recent weeks, as low prices and high exploration costs take their toll on companies across the sector.Premier Oil, another big North Sea producer, secured an agreement from creditors for its debt covenants to be waived for a month to give it more time to reduce borrowings. Meanwhile, Africa-focused Tullow Oil launched a $300m bond issue to cut dependence on bank lending facilities linked to the price of oil.Mr Hosie estimated the Delek deal would reduce EnQuest’s net debt to $1.75bn at the end of this year, down from his previous forecast of $1.94bn. He described it as “a necessary step to improve the balance sheet” at the expense of sacrificing a slice of future production.EnQuest owns 70.5 per cent of Kraken, with the remainder held by Cairn Energy, another UK-based oil company. The field is expected to reach peak production of 50,000 barrels a day, with the first oil expected to flow next year.The project was initially expected to cost EnQuest $3.2bn to bring on-stream, but that figure has been reduced by about 13 per cent through contract renegotiations with suppliers and other savings since the oil price collapsed.EnQuest said it had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Delek and that, in addition to the provisional terms outlined on Monday, talks were continuing over an “additional contingent consideration” for the stake.For Delek, controlled by Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva, the deal would help diversify its assets beyond Israel, where it co-owns the Leviathan gasfield with Noble Energy of the US.

The share was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 index.The fall comes off the back of fourth-quarter earnings reported this morning. The company reported earnings of $1.10 per share, beating expectations of $1.09. But disappointing revenues have set the tone for full-year 2017 earnings that are yet to come. Revenues missed analysts’ forecasts of $1.82bn, coming in at $1.79bn.The restaurateur revised 2017 earnings down to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share, when analysts were looking for $3.99 per share.“These results reinforce our firm belief that our strategy is working as we continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy,” said Gene Lee, the company’s chief executive. “This focus, together with our competitive advantages, drove our strong performance for the year and increased shareholder value.”On the other end of the spectrum, Hershey’s, the American chocolatier, is the subject of a takeover bid from Mondelez International. The news resulted in trading in Hershey shares being temporarily halted after a sudden rise of over 7 per cent just after 10:30am in New York. Hershey’s was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 index, up 16.8 per cent to $113.49, helping push the consumer staples sector up 2.2 per cent.Molson Coors also saw its share price rise after the brewer, known for beers such as Amstel and Carling, issued bonds on both sides of the Atlantic in recent days.The company was the first to issue in the US after the Brexit vote last week. It secured a low coupon on its debt as yields across investment-grade bond indices and benchmark US Treasuries have been falling.The brewer’s shares rose 2.7 per cent to $101.13, responding to the bond deals, which will probably be used to fund its full takeover of MillerCoors.After strong gains on Tuesday and Wednesday, the rally in the energy and materials sectors in the S&P 500 index slowed marginally, gaining 0.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, as Brent crude dipped 1.8 per cent to $49.68.Murphy Oil saw earlier gains in the week pared back, falling 0.8 per cent to $31.75. Noble Energy dropped 1.2 per cent to $35.87, while Marathon Petroleum gained 1.9 per cent to $37.96.Chesapeake, the second-largest producer of natural gas in the US, led the sector’s pullback, down 3.2 per cent to $4.28, after the company announced that its retirement plan was in partial termination following a more than 20 per cent reduction in the company’s workforce over the past two years.On the day, the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent to 2,098.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 17,930, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.3 per cent to 4,842.7.
13;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2016-06-29T21:49:51Z;Murphy Oil drives Wall Street energy rally;All main S&P 500 sectors close in the black;Energy stocks helped lead a second consecutive day of gains on Wall Street, buoyed by rising oil prices.The S&P 500 energy sector climbed 2 per cent on the day in New York, with materials also gaining, up 1.7 per cent, as the price of Brent crude rose 2 per cent to $50.61 a barrel.After two days of volatility and losses exceeding $1tn for US stocks over Friday and Monday, equity markets have staged a comeback as concerns over Britain’s vote to exit the EU subside. US data showing falling crude inventories helped oil prices rise, with some analysts also pointing to a potential strike in Norway — the largest crude oil producer in western Europe — as contributing to the rally.Murphy Oil, an oil and gas exploration and production company, helped lead the sector’s rebound, rising 6.4 per cent to $32.01.Marathon Petroleum, the fourth-largest oil refinery in the US, rose 4.4 per cent to $37.26. Noble Energy gained 3.5 per cent to $36.31.It was a different story for Texas-based Southwestern Energy. Its stock price fell 6.2 per cent on Wednesday to $13.03, the worst performance across the S&P 500 index, after the company offered 75m common shares to the public.The company intends to use proceeds from the stock offering to repay $375m of debt. Its share price rose by more than 10 per cent on Tuesday after extending maturities and tweaking conditions on more than $2bn of outstanding credit.The financials sector also had a strong rally, rising 2.3 per cent. The sector had been hard hit after the UK’s vote to leave the EU and was braced for the release by the Federal Reserve of bank’s stress test results on Wednesday evening.Utilities also made gains after initially lagged behind the broader stock market rally, rising 0.3 per cent. The sector typically performs well when investors are defensive, making its underperformance indicative of some renewed risk appetite.Elsewhere, Nike, the sports clothing and equipment brand, saw its stock price bounce 3.8 per cent to $55.13, having fallen by more than 6 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday following a mixed earnings report.Nike reported profits of 49 cents a share for its fiscal fourth quarter, above analysts’ expectation of 48 cents a share. But the focus turned to underwhelming revenues growth, which rose 6 per cent to $8.24bn, below the market’s target of $8.28bn.“We remain bullish on both secular and structural tailwinds for Nike’s business,” said analysts at Stifel. “Stiffer [currency] headwinds and a more volatile macro picture, however, leave us slightly more cautious on near-term fundamentals.”Rival sporting goods producer Under Armour rose 5.9 per cent to $39.75, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 index.Alcoa, the metals producer, outlined plans for its split into two companies, hiving off mining, refining and smelting from the more profitable materials production business that serves transportation and construction industries.The announcement sent the company’s stock down 2.5 per cent to $9.10. The spun off company will retain the Alcoa name, while the remaining assets will begin trading under a new name of Arconic.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent to 2,070.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6 per cent to 17,694.7 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.9 per cent to 4,779.3.
14;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2016-06-26T17:36:05Z;Israel’s Harel in talks with Noble for stake in Tamar gasfield;Insurer says it is in talks with Noble Energy for up to 4 per cent stake;Israel’s Harel Insurance and Financial Services said on Sunday that it was in talks to buy up to 4 per cent of the Tamar offshore natural gasfield from Houston-based Noble Energy, currently its biggest shareholder.The sale would be part of framework deal agreed by Noble and other investors in Israel’s offshore gas sector with the country’s government in order to address an antitrust challenge and allow the much larger Leviathan gas project to go ahead.Harel, Israel’s largest insurer, said in a notice to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange that the talks with Noble covered a 3 per cent share, with an option to buy another one per cent of Tamar. The field began producing gas in 2013, and is now Israel’s main source of supply.The insurance group said that any deal would require regulatory approval. Noble’s spokesperson in Israel declined to comment.Noble agreed as part of a gas framework plan reached with Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to cut its stake in Tamar from 36 per cent to 25 per cent. Delek agreed to sell all of its 31.3 per cent stake. The compromise was a response to a challenge in December 2014 posed by Israel’s antitrust watchdog, which recommended that Leviathan be broken up as Noble and Delek had too much control of the sector already.News of Noble’s sale talks with Harel comes as work finally begins on Leviathan, one of the eastern Mediterranean’s biggest gas reservoirs and a potential cash cow for Noble and Delek, which have signed preliminary export deals with Jordan and two refinery projects in Egypt.The field is also due to supply customers in Turkey with gas via a proposed undersea pipeline, following a reconciliation deal between the Turkish and Israeli governments expected to be finalised shortly.Leviathan, touted in Israel as a game-changing regional energy project, faced long delays after the antitrust challenge, which pushed the investors and Israel’s government into long negotiations on the gas framework, which were complicated by disagreements within the governing coalition.Opposition politicians accused the Netanyahu government of guaranteeing the investors too high a gas price, while the gas companies and the government accused them of economic populism and overzealous regulation.A final version of the gas framework was finally agreed last month after being amended to address a further challenge from Israel’s Supreme Court.Last week Delek and Avner, another Leviathan shareholder, said that they had begun work on a $120m plan to build Leviathan’s production platform, which they described as “a significant milestone for the overall project”. The field is due to begin producing gas by 2019.
15;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2016-02-15T15:45:47Z;Israeli supreme court puts Leviathan gas project at risk;Netanyahu warns that investors could ‘go to enemies’;"Israel’s $6.5bn Leviathan offshore gas project has been thrown into doubt after the country’s supreme court challenged Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to circumvent the Knesset by drafting a framework to jump-start investment.Shares in energy companies fell by 3 per cent in Tel Aviv on Monday, a day after the rightwing Israeli prime minister made an unprecedented appearance in the Supreme Court to defend the gas plan, which has faced stiff resistance. Left-of-centre opposition parties and non-governmental groups had petitioned the court to block it.The Israeli leader, who assumed the role of economy minister last year to push through the gas framework, warned of “grave consequences” if there were further delays in developing Leviathan.“We have undermined the energy companies’ confidence in us, as well as that of the international banks that are supposed to finance the investments, and that of countries who are supposed to be customers for Israeli gas,” Mr Netanyahu told the court.The gasfield, one of the largest in the eastern Mediterranean, was discovered in 2010. However, its development has been delayed by regulatory red tape — including a challenge in 2014 from Israel’s antitrust commissioner — and a political backlash from Israelis who accuse their government of giving investors too generous a deal at a time when gas prices are low.Industry executives and legal experts said on Monday that the next move was likely to come from the Supreme Court, which could either block the stability clause entirely — and with it the gas plan — or allow it to go ahead, while voicing its reservations.The US government has pressed Israel to push forward with its gas plan. Houston-based Noble Energy and Israeli companies in the Leviathan consortium, led by Delek Drilling, have threatened to pursue claims in arbitration if the country backs out of it.Leviathan’s partners have reached tentative agreements to sell gas to customers in Egypt and Jordan, and have spoken to potential buyers in Turkey. Noble and Delek, along with Mr Netanyahu’s government, claim the project could have a benign geopolitical effect in a volatile region where Israel has poor relations with many of its neighbours.“If we go backwards, we’ll fall into the abyss,” the Israeli leader warned. “The investors won’t wait for us; they’ll go elsewhere, to our enemies.” Israeli officials have voiced fears that the opening of Iran’s much larger gas sector post-sanctions could cause energy companies to bypass Israel. Moreover, neighbouring Egypt discovered Zohr — an offshore field larger than Leviathan — last year.However, the court challenged a “stability” clause in Mr Netanyahu’s gas framework. This promised investors in Leviathan that they would not be hit by regulatory changes for at least a decade.The court suggested that any such guarantee should be the subject of a new law.However, Mr Netanyahu’s government, which holds a single-seat majority in the Knesset, would be unlikely to pass it, given that three cabinet ministers have recused themselves from making decisions on the controversial gas issue because of conflicts of interest."

Discoveries were made at several other wells, including one called Isobel Deep.The group said on Friday:Following a number of material operational issues with the Eirik Raude rig during the term of the contract to date, Premier and Noble Energy issued a termination notice to Ocean Rig on 11 February 2016, terminating the contract with immediate effect.

Noble Energy, based in Houston, said it planned a 50 per cent cut in spending for 2016, as it also reduced its quarterly dividend from 18 cents per share to 10 cents.Mr Hamm said Continental’s budget “confirms our intense focus on cash flow neutrality”: ensuring capital spending is covered by cash the business generates so the company does not need to raise additional financing.Greg Hill, chief operating officer of Hess, said it planned to “reduce activity at all of our producing assets” and would “pursue further cost reductions and efficiency gains”.John Hess, chief executive, said the company’s focus would be on “preserving the strength of our balance sheet”.Kenneth Fisher, chief financial officer at Noble, said its capital spending and dividend cuts were ""part of a comprehensive effort to spend within cash flow"" and reduce the company's debts.External financing from debt and equity markets for small and midsized US oil and gas producers slowed sharply in the second half of last year.Continental, Hess and Noble are the first US oil companies to announce budgets following the slump in crude prices this year to about $31 per barrel on Tuesday.The costs of drilling and completing wells in the US has fallen sharply — in some cases by 40 per cent in the past year — but not as fast as oil prices.The slowdown in activity at both Continental and Hess means their production is set to decline.Continental predicted average output of 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, down 5 to 9 per cent from 2015.Hess said production would be 330,000 to 350,000 b/d for 2016, a drop of 7 to 12 per cent from its rate in the first nine months of last year.Noble did not predict a fall in production, but said it expected oil and gas sales to be ""consistent"" with last year's levels at abut 390,000 b/d.The declines mark a sharp reversal from the rapid growth of the US oil industry in recent years.Continental’s production grew by an estimated 24 to 26 per cent last year, the company has said, while Hess’s output for the first nine months of last year was 19 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 2014.US oil production is expected to drop by 1.2m b/d, or 12 per cent, between its peak in April 2015 and the end of 2016.Continental’s net debt was about $7.1bn at the end of September. Noble also had net debt of about $7bn, while Hess’s was $2.95bn.Mr Hess said his company was “well positioned to navigate the current low oil price environment with one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions” among the US independent oil companies.Continental and Hess are among the largest operators in the Bakken formation of North Dakota, one of the centres of the US oil boom of the past seven years, and also have other American shale assets.Hess in addition has offshore oil and gasfields in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, Malaysia and Guyana.Continental said that, as well as cutting spending, it was building up a backlog of “drilled but uncompleted” wells that could be completed and brought into production as oil prices recovered.It expects to have 195 of these “DUCs”, as uncompleted wells are known, in the Bakken formation by the end of the year, up from 135 at the end of 2015."
18;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-12-18T16:37:03Z;Israeli gas: pilot light;Some Israelis seem to object to energy independence;Many political leaders blather on about achieving energy security for their country. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did something about it. Five years after the discovery of one the world’s largest offshore natural gasfields (called Leviathan with 22 trillion cubic feet), Israel should finally develop this gas. About time.The gas is enough to cover Israel’s needs for over a century. One hitch: plenty of Israelis do not seem to want this independence. Or if they do, not if just two companies, US-listed Noble Energy and Israel’s Delek Group, control most of this gas. These two explorers also own two-thirds of another nearby gasfield — half the size of Leviathan — called Tamar. The fear in some quarters is that the two companies could conspire to sharply raise energy prices, independent of world markets.Really? Surely Israel would become the largest market for this gas, even if some goes to Jordan (from 2020) and Turkey in the years afterward. Current Israeli demand would take up as much as half of Tamar’s and Leviathan’s likely maximum output. That means that in the unlikely event that its owners choose to stop servicing its main market, cash flow would drop sharply. Plus, any attempt to squeeze Israeli customers with production cuts would bring a robust response from Israeli regulators or, worse, nationalisation. Noble and Delek seem unlikely to consider such a move.It will not all go the producers’ way. Israel’s government has mooted plans for price controls on this gas, failing to placate the naysayers. A compromise to reduce the holdings of Noble and Delek over time also did not help. What should improve the mood is cleaner air: replacing dirty coal fuelling half of Israel’s electricity generation.Mr Netanyahu has used some unorthodox methods to get the offshore gas developed, even taking over the economy ministry himself. In this case, the end will justify the means.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
19;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Benjamin Netanyahu tries to end gas dispute with Egypt;Plan to export billions of dollars’ worth of the resource from eastern Mediterranean under threat;Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, says he will send a special envoy to Egypt with the aim of resolving a dispute over natural gas that has threatened the two countries’ ambitions to export billions of dollars’ worth of the resource from the eastern Mediterranean.Mr Netanyahu made the remarks in the Knesset as he defended a controversial plan to develop the country’s gas reserves, which has sparked mass protests among Israelis who think the US and Israeli companies who control the offshore fields are being given too good a deal.The Israeli leader said he had spoken to Egypt’s government on Monday, a day after arbitrators at the International Chamber of Commerce ordered two Egyptian gas companies to pay $1.76bn to the state-owned Israel Electric Corporation for rescinding a gas export deal with Israel in 2012. The Egyptian groups were also ordered to pay $288m to Eastern Mediterranean Gas, a privately owned pipeline operator.The arbitration decision related to the disruption of supplies during Egypt’s political transition in 2011 and attacks by militants in the Sinai peninsula on EMG’s pipeline.Egypt responded by saying it would freeze all negotiations over gas imports from Israel and appeal the ruling.Alaa Arafa, a partner at Delphinus, an Egyptian group that last month agreed a $10bn deal to buy natural gas from Israel’s still undeveloped Leviathan field, said: “No one will be able to produce gas or import gas without the agreement of both the Egyptian and the Israeli governments”.Gas executives told the FT they expected talks between the two governments aimed at mitigating the award, possibly by reducing it or making it payable over a long period. As IEC is state-owned, renegotiating with EMG will be the bigger challenge, they added.EMG’s pipeline has been earmarked to pump gas to Egypt, reversing its previous flow, under the deal with Delphinus.Leviathan’s shareholders also have tentative deals to export Israeli gas to two idled Egyptian liquefied natural gas (LNG) refineries run by the UK’s BG Group and Spain’s Unión Fenosa Gas.LNG exports from Egypt ceased in 2012 because of rising local demand, but Cairo wants to restart its unused LNG infrastructure and transform itself into a production and export hub in the eastern Mediterranean.On the Israeli side, the Egyptian export contracts are crucial for bankrolling the $6.5bn Leviathan project, which has faced many regulatory and political obstacles in its home country.A year ago Israel’s antitrust authority recommended that the partnership controlling Leviathan be broken up because US-based Noble Energy and Israel’s Delek and Avner, its shareholders, also controlled a smaller Israeli field that began producing gas in 2013.Mr Netanyahu responded by seeking to override the regulator’s authority by invoking national security, arguing that Israel needed to diversify its energy supply. Along with the gas companies, he also said the contracts would help shore up the country’s relations with its neighbours.“If we do not approve the plan, we’ll remain without competition, without gasfields, without energy security and without the ability to export,” he told the Knesset’s finance committee on Tuesday, as dozens of protesters who oppose the government’s gas plan demonstrated outside the legislature.“The ability to export gas makes us more immune to international pressure,” Mr Netanyahu added, a reference to international condemnation of the country’s policies towards the Palestinians. “We don’t want to be vulnerable to boycotts.”Isaac Herzog, the centre-left Israeli opposition leader, accused Mr Netanyahu of “amateurish” leadership on the gas issue.Also on Tuesday, Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s energy minister, said the country was eyeing other export options for its gas including Jordan, Greece, Turkey and western Europe. Turkey’s recent estrangement with Russia, its biggest gas supplier, has revived hopes in Israel that the huge Turkish market could open up to Israeli gas, despite political rancour between the two countries.

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had tried to overrule them but ran into political opposition and public protests from Israelis who felt their country was giving the gas investors too sweet a deal.Confidence in Israel’s fledgling gas sector was also hit by news that Italy’s Eni had discovered Zohr, the largest offshore field ever found in the Mediterranean, thought to contain a possible 30tn cubic feet of gas.Separately, the Leviathan partners said they were continuing talks to seal a potentially bigger export contract, supplying BG Group’s liquefied natural gas plant in Egypt via an undersea pipeline over a 15-year period.They have already done a preliminary deal to supply Jordan’s electric power company with 3 bcm of gas over 15 years. Next year, Noble Energy and its Israeli partners are due to begin exporting gas from their smaller Tamar gasfield to Jordan’s potash and bromine operations in a separate deal.Israel has peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, but public animosity in both countries over its policies toward the Palestinians runs high.Gideon Tadmor, Avner’s CEO, said: “The gas discoveries will enable the reinforcement of Israel’s relationships with neighbouring countries and affect the lives of millions of citizens throughout the region.”On Wednesday, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange’s TA Oil & Gas Index rose 1.1 per cent to its highest level in three weeks.

Pressed for names, he said they included Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, and Hess.Mr Steinitz also dropped an eye-popping number: He said there could be 10-15,000 billion cubic meters of gas in the eastern Mediterranean basin covering Israel, Egypt and Cyprus — enough to supply the country’s domestic needs as well as for export to Europe.He said Israel had only “seriously investigated” 25 to 30 per cent of its offshore waters for gas so far.“We believe, based on geological research and data, from our own exploration and global companies, there is still the potential for new discoveries in our waters,” Mr Steinitz said.“It is very likely the case that some other Leviathans or Tamars are waiting to be explored,” he added, referring to Israel’s Tamar field off Haifa, which has 311bcm of proved reserves and began producing gas in 2013.Leviathan, a $6.5bn project and one of the gas industry’s biggest discoveries in recent years, contains an estimated 621bcm, but has been tied up in red tape as Benjamin Netanyahu’s five-party, rightwing coalition government tried to wrest a regulatory framework for the sector into place.Israel finally approved the framework last week, which was needed to face down an antitrust challenge and accusations by opposition politicians and the media that it was selling its gas bounty too cheaply to foreign companies and “tycoons”. Mr Netanyahu’s rightwing government holds a tenuous one-seat majority in the Knesset, and its ultra-Orthodox economy minister, Aryeh Deri — who opposed the deal — had to quit in order to get it through cabinet.In another sign that Israel has big plans for gas, Mr Netanyahu on October 29 met with Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Eni. The Italian company in September rocked the industry — and overshadowed the delayed Leviathan project — with its discovery of Zohr, a “supergiant” gasfield off Egypt, which has a possible 30tn cubic feet of gas.With the framework now in place, the government is still facing angry street protests staged by leftwing social activists who still think Israel is selling out.But finally it should be able to move ahead with Leviathan.Israel needs investors for the small Karish and Tanin fields, which Leviathan and Tamar’s investors — led by Noble Energy of the US and Israel’s Delek — must sell as part of the gas framework deal.But Israel also wants to tempt gas and oil companies to resume offshore exploration, which has juddered to a halt in recent years because of investors’ worries about the Jewish state’s febrile regulatory environment.The new gas framework includes a promise by Israel to refrain from making regulatory changes to the sector in the coming decade.Israel has other interests too in its new charm offensive on gas: it wants to diversify away from relying on Tamar, its sole big producing field. Gas generated about 28 per cent of the country’s primary energy consumption last year, and Israel sees it as a cornerstone of energy security. It also wants to export gas to its neighbours — notably Egypt and Jordan to give an economic underpinning to their chilly and pragmatic peace treaties.Energy companies, which have faced a tax hike, regulatory delays, and public vilification in Israel, could be forgiven for treading gingerly there. On the other hand, the discovery of new Egyptian field, which is on a deeper layer than Tamar and Leviathan, could tempt them to see what lies in Israel’s waters again.“It’s a new geological play,” one executive said on Tuesday. “There will be some interest from oil and gas companies to come to the region.”The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times

Five years later, development has stalled as Israel’s politicians fight over how much of the gas windfall should go to the companies tapping it, and how much to the public in the form of taxes and lower gas prices.Mr Netanyahu’s government, which holds a one-seat Knesset majority, is on the defensive after having agreed a backroom deal that would allow Leviathan to proceed with Noble and Delek, its co-shareholder in the field, which is majority owned by Israeli billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva.“It’s a great shame that there is decisive co-ordination among the tycoons and the government,” Shelly Yachimovich, MP with the centre-left Zionist Union party, said at a recent meeting, airing a widely held view in Israeli opposition circles that Mr Netanyahu’s cabinet is colluding with big business.The outline was meant to settle a challenge from David Gilo, Israel’s antitrust regulator, who in December said he would review whether the two companies’ control of Leviathan represented a “restrictive agreement” because the two companies already control the smaller Tamar field. In May, Mr Gilo announced he was quitting after a compromise emerged, brokered by Mr Netanyahu’s government, that would see Delek and Noble divest some of their gas assets and agree a formula on future gas pricing.However, Mr Netanyahu was forced to refer that plan to public consultations last week after MPs attacked a deal they claimed favoured rich “tycoons”. An impassioned Knesset committee debate on the matter on Monday at times degenerated into shouting.“This is organised robbery,” said Yaron Zelicha, an economist and former finance ministry official who is a vocal opponent of the gas deal, as he questioned how successive Israeli governments awarded drilling licences and set gas prices.“We have the most expensive flats in the western world, the most expensive cars, the most expensive food, and now we will have the most extravagant margins on our gas.”There is more at stake than just Leviathan: Mr Netanyahu says that Israel’s reputation with foreign investors is at risk, and that the country must not yield to “populism” or risk going the way of its bankrupt regional neighbour, Greece.“We will not capitulate to populism. we must extract this gas,” Mr Netanyahu said on Sunday. “We must find the right balance between the needs of the Israeli economy and the need to ensure both additional investments and competition.”The government, along with Noble and Delek, say Israel’s tax regime, a 40 per cent ceiling on gas exports, and other controls on the gas market are already among the toughest in the developed world.Mr Netanyahu and the gas companies have warned that if Leviathan’s investors are squeezed for more concessions, the field’s estimated 22tn cubic feet of reserves could remain undeveloped.“If the government doesn’t approve this arrangement in the near term, Israeli citizens will not enjoy the economic and geopolitical benefits of the development of offshore natural gas resources,” says Yossi Abu, chief executive of Delek Drilling.Critics, however, are crying foul over an alleged lack of transparency in the government’s talks with the gas companies.“You would expect your government to take care of the public interest and at least not sound like the corporations, but in fact they sound the same,” said Or-ly Barlev, a leader of the Mavak Hagaz, or “Gas Fight”, Facebook group that has helped organise protests in Tel Aviv and other cities in which thousands took part. “But in fact, they are talking the same language: we say they talk fluent Noblish.”Ms Barlev and other protesters are heirs of a mass movement that in 2011 saw tens of thousands of Israelis protest in Tel Aviv and other cities against high living costs and the control by rich family shareholders of some of Israel’s biggest companies.On Saturday evening, about 500 protesters held a demonstration in Tel Aviv’s Habima Square holding signs saying “It’s a robbery” and depicting Mr Tshuva and government ministers as pirates. “This is everybody’s gas,” they chanted.Both sides’ arguments have some statistical backing.Social justice campaigners point out that Israel’s level of income inequality is among the highest in the developed world, according to figures from the OECD.Netanyahu is right to exploit abundant energy opportunitiesContinue reading“Israel is among the most unequal countries in the OECD,” says Claude Giorno, senior economist for Israel for the organisation, noting that as measured by gaps between high and low earners the country is in fifth place after Mexico, Chile, Turkey and the US.The gas companies’ accusations of economic populism are backed up by some other Israeli companies, most notably Israel Chemicals, which has frozen investments in its home country after a tax rise and other regulatory changes it says makes Israel an unprofitable place to invest.Foreign direct investment in Israel fell nearly 50 per cent last year to $6.4bn, from $11.8bn 2013, according to the UN agency Unctad.However, the drop reflects in part several high-profile investments and FDI by nature “tends to be lumpy, especially in smaller economies”, said James Zhan, an Unctad analyst.

So goes the joke. For those trying to develop Israel’s natural gasfields, it is no laughing matter.Although Israel has one of the strongest economies in the Middle East — inflation is low and GDP is expected to grow at around 4 per cent this year and next — it has always had to import its energy. It also burns a fair bit of dirty coal and oil to generate electricity.All that changed in 2009 with the discovery of 40tn cu ft of offshore gas, sufficient to supply Israel for a century. Instead of rejoicing, politicians set about obstructing development of the fields. Regulators fear that the group which own the fields — Israel’s Delek Group and US-listed Noble Energy — will gouge the country’s consumers by charging high prices for gas. That is short-sighted.Regulation is in place to capture windfall profits. Since 2010, the Israeli government has followed the recommendations of an expert committee and taxed the output of Israeli oil and gas production. About 60 per cent of what Israeli consumers pay for natural gas goes back to the government, according to Goldman Sachs. That is a reasonable amount by international standards. Any local fears that the owners of these oil and gas companies will somehow exercise undue control over Israeli energy supplies sounds alarmist. A proposal to encourage more gas competition, by inducing the owners to sell their smaller gasfields was seen as insufficient by politicians and the antitrust regulator.This week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invoked a special legal clause to overrule the antitrust regulator, David Gilo, in order to move forward with developing the offshore gas. Mr Gilo, who had wind of what was coming a month before, has already resigned. Good.On energy, Israel can have it all. It should move quickly, and take it.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
24;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-06-30T15:30:11Z;Anger grows over Israeli government’s Leviathan gasfield deal;Netanyahu forced into climbdown over $6.5bn project amid growing disagreement with opposition MPs;"Benjamin Netanyahu’s two-month-old coalition government is facing its most serious challenge yet after an angry backlash over a backroom deal agreed with natural gas companies to develop Israel’s large offshore Leviathan field.Yuval Steinitz, energy minister, on Tuesday was obliged to present details of government’s agreement with the investors, led by Noble Energy of the US and Delek of Israel, after opposition MPs rounded on the government for a lack of transparency surrounding a compromise needed to unlock the $6.5bn project.The disagreement between the government and opposition MPs, which had been building for months, reached a peak on Monday. Mr Netanyahu had been preparing to submit a motion to the Knesset allowing his government to overrule an antitrust ruling against the project and push through a compromise deal with the gas companies allowing Leviathan to go ahead.However, he withdrew the measure after it became clear that it would not have enough votes to pass. Three members of the Israeli prime minister’s cabinet, including Moshe Kahlon, the popular centre-right finance minister, said they would abstain from the vote, pleading conflicts of interests.Avigdor Lieberman, ex-foreign minister and head of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, said he supported the compromise on antitrust issues, but was not prepared to help Mr Netanyahu with the votes needed for Monday’s measure to pass.The fracas has underscored the weakness of Mr Netanyahu’s five-party coalition formed in May, which holds 61 seats or a one-seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset, after a contentious election campaign in which the long-serving Israeli leader antagonised political foes and allies alike.It also attests to a populist mood in the Knesset. Many MPs are feeding on public discontent with social inequality in Israel and public anger at the tycoons who control some of Israel’s biggest companies. Delek is majority owned by Yitzhak Tshuva, one of Israel’s richest men, who according to Forbes is worth $4.1bn.“If I were to implement a populist economic policy, we would be in the same situation as Greece,” Mr Netanyahu told his Likud party on Monday, ahead of the abortive vote. “We need to act responsibly. The gas plan is a good one.”David Gilo, Israel’s antitrust commissioner, ruled the Leviathan project a cartel in December, triggering a scramble by the government to ensure the long-delayed project is completed.Mr Gilo and other critics of Delek and Noble contend that the two companies hold too much power over Israel’s gas reserves and market prices because they control both the still-undeveloped Leviathan and Tamar, Israel’s biggest operative field, which began producing gas in 2013.Mr Gilo last month announced he was quitting after expressing disapproval for a compromise emerging in private talks between Mr Netanyahu’s government and the gas companies.That agreement, outlined by Mr Steinitz on Tuesday, would require Delek to sell its stake in Tamar within six years, and Noble to decrease its stake from 36 per cent to 25 per cent over the same period. Both companies will sell their entire stakes in two smaller offshore fields, and agree a new price control mechanism for future contracts.“The outline we reached is not just good; it is the best,” Mr Steinitz told journalists at a press conference in Jerusalem. “It is the best possible, in reality.”Mr Netanyahu and his supporters have argued that a workable compromise needs to be reached with gas companies, or Leviathan — with estimated reserves of 22tn cubic feet — risks never being developed.Gas companies have voiced frustration with Israel after Mr Netanyahu’s former government doubled taxes and capped the amount of gas they can export to 40 per cent of their total output. New drilling for gas off Israel has ground to a halt because of investors’ worries over Israeli regulatory risk.Leviathan’s backers in government and industry have also argued the project could improve Israel’s delicate relations with its regional neighbours as Delek and Noble have inked preliminary deals to export billions of dollars of gas to Egypt and Jordan.However, opponents of Mr Netanyahu, including MPs from the centre-left Zionist Union and leftwing Meretz parties, accuse his government of caving to the gas companies.Guy Rolnik, editor of The Marker, the business publication of Israel’s left-leaning Ha’aretz newspaper, last week accused Mr Netanyahu and the “gas barons” of telling Israelis “lies” about the compromise deal made with gas companies."

A mid-stage trial involving 450 people will start next year followed by a late-stage trial with 3,000 people in 2017-18.Similar collaborations have taken place before, such as funding bed nets, but this is thought to be the biggest investment of its kind by an African government and industry partners in vaccine development.Stephen Hoffman, Sanaria chief executive, said the funding showed that African governments were recognising the importance of vaccines to long-term elimination of malaria and offering more support for research and development.The first malaria vaccine to reach market is expected to come from GlaxoSmithKline, the big UK pharmaceuticals group, whose product, called RTS, S, is awaiting regulatory approval after 30 years of development.However, in clinical trials, RTS, S only cut infections in children by half and in babies by a quarter suggesting that, while it could help reduce the number of cases, it would not halt the disease.This leaves open an opportunity for smaller players such as Sanaria to develop more effective vaccines but with only a fraction of GSK’s resources it is dependent on outside help to push its product forward. In some small early-stage trials, PfSPZ was 100 per cent effective in preventing malaria.600,000Number of people killed by malaria every yearBig progress has been made against malaria with the death rate halving since 2000. Yet it remains among the world’s biggest killers, especially among the young, and weighs heavily on African economies.Although Marathon says its main motivation is philanthropic, there is also a long-term commercial incentive to help eradicate a disease that affects about 10 per cent of the locals among its 900-strong workforce in Equatorial Guinea each year.Foreign energy companies are among the biggest investors and employers in the oil-rich west African nation of 760,000 people. Other agencies involved in setting up the trials include the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and Medical Care Development International, a US non-governmental organisation — as well as researchers from Tanzania, where another small trial has taken place.
26;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-06-09T13:18:11Z;After the oil rout, energy deals are set to focus on US shale;Smaller groups with low-cost crude and high debts are seen as vulnerable to takeovers by majors;"“When something on this scale happens, every board asks: ‘What do we do?’ And they call in their M&A advisers and ask them the same question.”According to one senior oil executive, Royal Dutch Shell’s £55bn offer for BG Group, the biggest energy takeover in at least a decade, has prised open a window to dealmaking. The collapse in oil prices could lead to an industry shakeout.Even before the Shell-BG deal, energy groups were accelerating spending cuts, delaying projects and selling assets to reduce costs. More than $100bn of investment has been deferred or scrapped in response to the near-50 per cent plunge in crude over the past year. Just six major oil projects were approved in 2014, the fewest in 15 years. Smaller companies from the US to the North Sea are struggling under high debts. Some are near bankruptcy.As the economics of expensive new projects become questionable, companies sitting on lower-cost oil and gas output in America’s shale producing heartlands are expected to become targets for predators, particularly those with weak balance sheets. So too could operators with cost-effective production but stretched finances elsewhere in the world, such as Sweden’s Lundin or Gulf Keystone and Tullow Oil, which are focused on oil in Kurdistan and Africa respectively.“The cold wind of austerity has hit the independents hard,” says one chief executive. “I would be surprised if a quarter or a third of companies with more solid assets don’t combine.”How the shale revolution changed the world
. . . and why nothing will ever be the same againOne response to the oil price fall may be to seek salvation in size, as the industry did after the 1998 collapse, creating today’s “supermajors”. The problem, though, with the mega-merger scenario is that there are few such plausible combinations.ExxonMobil buying BP is one, the attraction being the UK company’s Gulf of Mexico presence, its Brazilian and Angolan assets, and the prospect of cost savings. But the British government has added to the risks surrounding a deal — the greatest being as yet uncapped liabilities from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster — by making clear its opposition on the grounds it wants the group to remain a British industrial champion with global reach. Total and Italy’s Eni have close governments links, complicating any cross-border deals with them.Set Shell-BG aside, and buyers and sellers are far apart, the result of oil’s volatility. “There is really nothing cheap out there, no big bargains to be made,” says Eldar Saetre, Statoil’s chief executive. “The big transformation stuff is challenging.”Deals will be done. But it will be oil companies’ efforts to jettison costly projects and reshape portfolios with cheaper output that determine what the industry looks like years from now.Small and medium-sized US shale producers are starting to become attractive targets for large energy groups that do not have big exposure to these unconventional oil resources. Such producers may be of particular interest to large groups with low leverage but relatively high cost oil and gas output.Many shale producers reacted to the crude price plunge by slashing costs and improving their productivity, thereby reducing “break-even” levels for untapped resources to a US crude price of about $60, and making these barrels more economic to extract than much of the deepwater, heavy oil and even conventional reserves.If recent productivity improvements continue, shale oil production in the US could go as high as 15m barrels a day in the long term. Certain analysts say US shale is replacing Opec as the world’s “swing” producer, reacting swiftly to moves in supply and demand.Some of the US shale producers are vulnerable to takeovers because they have weak balance sheets.The ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for 29 US producers is predicted by analysts at Goldman Sachs to double this year from 2014, to a group-wide two times ebitda as profits fall on the back of the lower oil price. Some companies could rise to as much as five times.The Goldman analysts say shale producers that could become targets include Continental Resources, EP Energy and Halcón Resources, whose leverage — net debt as a percentage of capital employed — is predicted to reach 61 per cent, 49 per cent and 61 per cent respectively next year.So far, though, M&A involving US shale companies has been sluggish. The only deal of any size has been Noble Energy, one of the larger US independents, buying Rosetta Resources for about $3.7bn including debt.Also, most companies with good positions in the three main US shale areas — the Bakken of North Dakota and the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin of Texas — are not yet under the financial strain that would force them to seek a buyer at a knockdown price. Capital markets remain open.However, the longer oil prices stay low, the more likely that is to change, according to Peter Speer of Moody’s, the credit rating agency. “If we get to the latter part of this year and into next year, and we don’t have a strong oil price recovery, then we will definitely be seeing more transactions,” he says.The next round of borrowing renegotiations for smaller US oil companies, which determine how much banks are prepared to lend, is looming in September. It is expected to result in a further tightening of funds that will be available.Companies that have raised new equity this year are expected to find it harder to do the same again. Hedging strategies that protected producers from the full effects of the price drop this year offer much less protection for 2016.The bigger players, and especially the majors, may therefore bide their time before taking a gamble on shale, or assets in Kurdistan and Africa.Should crude prices of $60 or less persist into next year, they could yet find that wait worthwhile.Additional reporting by Michael StothardWhen international oil companies think about making more acquisitions in the US shale oil and gas industry, one obstacle will be the differences in culture, writes Ed Crooks.Large oil companies can often be slow-moving and bureaucratic, while successful US shale producers are usually more nimble and innovative. There is a danger that if a big company takes over a US independent and imposes its own management techniques and practices, it will crush the dynamism out of the business.One oil industry adviser says the contrast in styles was plainly visible after ExxonMobil bought XTO Energy, a leading shale producer, in 2010.“There were all the Exxon people in white shirts with red ties, and the XTO guys in jeans and cowboy boots,” he says.Exxon made a conspicuous effort to preserve XTO’s character, keeping its organisation separate, complete with its own head office.BP has attempted to foster a distinct culture at its US shale business, setting up a separate subsidiary complete with its own head office to run the group’s operations.But however hard a large international group tries to preserve the culture of its US shale operations, it is still always vulnerable to a loss of its top talent.Statoil is often seen as one of the more successful foreign participants in the US shale oil boom, buying Brigham Exploration for $4.4bn in 2011 and using it as a platform to build a strong position in the Bakken formation of North Dakota. Its ability to retain key Brigham personnel was seen as central to that success."
27;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Israel near Leviathan gasfield deal after antitrust chief quits;David Gilo resigns in protest over $6.5bn development project;Israel is near a deal to pave the way for the development of the huge Leviathan offshore gasfield, after the resignation of the antitrust chief who declared the project a cartel.David Gilo quit his post on Monday after disagreeing with a compromise between the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and investors in the $6.5bn project. The deal, when signed, will end the antitrust challenge from his office which delayed the field’s development.Mr Netanyahu told cabinet colleagues on Tuesday: “We will extract this gas from the depths of the sea, we will bring it to the citizens of Israel, and we will make society as a whole better off.“We will not repeat the mistake other countries made when they sought ideal solutions for their gas and . . . oil, as a result of which both the gas and the oil remained below the seabed or underground.”Development of Leviathan — one of the world’s biggest recent offshore gas finds with an estimated 22tn cubic feet of reserves — was put on hold in December after Mr Gilo said he would recommend the partnership developing the project, led by Noble Energy of the US and Israel’s Delek, should be broken up.Noble and Delek already control Tamar, Israel’s biggest exploited offshore gasfield, and Mr Gilo ruled that Leviathan would give them excessive control over gas supplies and prices.However, his decision angered energy groups already frustrated over tax and regulatory changes by successive Israeli governments. Exploratory drilling for gas off Israel’s coast has come to a halt over the past year because of investors’ misgivings over what they see as a volatile investment climate.Gideon Tadmor, chief executive of Delek Drilling, said on Tuesday: “This change of heart, this flip-flopping by the antitrust commissioner, has already cost us one year delay in the development time [for Leviathan]. “The Israeli gas industry is frozen because of the regulatory environment.”The antitrust move also threw into doubt preliminary deals agreed last year between Noble and Delek to supply gas to BG Group in Egypt and to Jordan’s electric power company.Under the compromise reached between Mr Netanyahu’s government and the gas companies, Delek will sell all its shares in Tamar within six years of signing the agreement. Noble, currently Tamar’s biggest shareholder, will reduce its stake from 36 per cent to 25 per cent.The two companies have also agreed to sell the smaller Karish and Tanin fields to other companies, a person briefed on details of the deal said. The companies hope to close the deal in the coming months and bring the first gas from Leviathan to the market by 2019.However, the compromise that led to Mr Gilo’s resignation brought angry reaction from some opposition leftwing MPs and could have more political repercussions.Moshe Kahlon, the new centre-right finance minister, has told Mr Netanyahu he cannot make decisions on gas-related matters because of his friendship with Koby Maimon, whose company, Isramco, is a shareholder in the Tamar field. News of the move this week alarmed and angered some Israelis, as Mr Kahlon voiced support for Mr Gilo during his campaign.
28;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-05-11T19:44:05Z;Noble Energy to buy Rosetta Resources in $3.7bn shale deal;Analysts say oil explorers are poised to start on a round of dealmaking that could reshape industry;Noble Energy, the US oil and gas group, is to buy Rosetta Resources for about $3.7bn including debt, in the first acquisition of a significant US shale oil producer since the fall in crude prices in the second half of last year.The agreed deal is a sign of how financially weaker shale oil producers unwilling or unable to finance enough drilling to keep their production from falling can be compelled to accept a bid as the best option for investors.The all-share deal gives Noble — which operates offshore, and onshore fields in Colorado and Pennsylvania — its first shale positions in the Eagle Ford and the Permian Basin, both in Texas and two of the heartlands of the US oil boom.Dave Stover, chief executive of Noble, said it was buying into shale regions that were among “two of the most economic in the US, which will expand our resource base and development inventory and further diversify our portfolio”.Mr Stover said Rosetta’s assets would be able to generate enough cash to finance the drilling needed to increase production by 15 per cent per year for several years.Noble’s strong financial position meant it had more freedom to drill when it needed to, he added.“The combination of scale and financial strength means we are set up to take full advantage of the assets,” he said.Analysts said the world’s oil and gas producers were poised to embark on a round of dealmaking that could reshape the energy industry, reacting to the recent collapse in prices by targeting rivals to replenish falling reserves.Figures from Morgan Stanley analysts show the number of deals announced, including asset sales, standing at 38 so far this year, with a total value of $93bn, after a near moribund first quarter in which just 30 transactions worth about $4bn were done — a 20-year low.Signs of a recovery in deal volumes, albeit tentative, owe much to a slide in companies’ stock market valuations, which have yet to track higher after a strong rebound in the price of Brent crude to $65 a barrel.While the total value of deals announced in the second quarter will be skewed by Royal Dutch Shell’s £55bn agreed offer for BG Group, analysts point to evidence that activity is picking up.Martijn Rats of Morgan Stanley said deals were “arguably cheaper and safer” than capital spending for oil and gas producers. “With depressed exploration and production valuations . . . the opportunity for the majors to cheaply replenish portfolios at below organic finding and development costs increases,” he added.Mr Rats saw a “sweet spot” of rising oil prices and falling costs, the result of companies’ efforts to slash expenses, leading to a recovery in free cash flow and increased transactions.Big oil groups were likely to turn to acquisitions, following the Shell-BG deal, having replaced just 88 per cent of their production in 2014, versus 111 per cent the previous year, he added.Noble’s Mr Stover added that the company was not yet planning to step up drilling on its existing assets.“I think folks are going to be feeling comfortable with that if we’re heading back towards $70,” he said. “I would not expect to see a big change in activity unless we get back to that area.”The Noble-Rosetta deal received an initially negative response from investors, with Noble’s shares being marked down about 5 per cent in early trading in New York.The deal offers 0.542 shares in Noble for every Rosetta share, valuing the target’s equity at $1.9bn based on the buyer’s share price of about $46.60 on Monday morning. Noble is also taking on about $1.8bn in debt.At that valuation, the offer is worth $25.26 per Rosetta share, a premium of 31 per cent to its closing price on Friday.Noble was down 6.21 per cent to $46.07 by the close, while Rosetta had advanced 27.19 per cent to $24.58.The offer is still worth less than half Rosetta’s share price at its peak of over $60 in 2013. The company reported disappointing results earlier this month.The price Noble is paying for Rosetta represents about $13.12 per barrel of oil equivalent in the target’s proved reserves, 61 per cent of which are in oil and other liquids, and about $3.50 per barrel equivalent including unproved resources.
29;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-05-05T18:39:28Z;Shale groups rise to oil price challenge;EOG raises prospect of production growth before the end of the year;EOG Resources, the largest shale oil producer in the US, on Tuesday raised the prospect of its crude production returning to growth before the end of the year.US shale oil companies have been detailing in their first-quarter results how they are cutting costs and increasing productivity as they grapple with sharply lower crude prices since last summer.Companies including EOG, Anadarko Petroleum, Concho Resources and Noble Energy reported steep cuts in both capital and operating costs, while their production is either growing or roughly flat.EOG said that if benchmark US West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $65 per barrel or higher — compared with its price of about $60 on Tuesday — then the company could resume “double-digit” production growth, while covering its capital spending from its operating cash flows.EOG reported a loss of $170m for the first quarter, and an $843m cash outflow, and reiterated its guidance that it expected its average production for 2015 to be roughly unchanged compared with last year.However, William Thomas, EOG’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday morning that the company had been building up a backlog of wells that had been drilled but not yet completed, and planned to start bringing some of these on stream in the third quarter.“We expect our oil production to return to growth in the fourth quarter, building momentum as we head into 2016,” he added.EOG’s statement came after David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager who made his name betting against Lehman Brothers before the bank collapsed, on Monday argued that shale oil producers were overvalued, labelling them “frack addicts” that failed to create value from their investments even when crude was over $100 per barrel.New extraction techniques and oil prices boost US oil production“A business that burns cash and doesn’t grow isn’t worth anything,” he said.However, US shale oil companies, while reporting losses or very small profits for the first three months of this year, are arguing that cost cuts put them on a course for renewed financial health once crude prices recover.Noble reported a $22m loss for the first quarter, but said it had greatly improved the efficiency of its drilling.Concho, which operates in the Permian Basin of west Texas, reported a profit of just $7.5m for the first quarter and said it had cut the number of rigs it was using from 36 at the start of the year to 18 today.However, it raised the midpoint of the range of its guidance for 2015 production growth from 18 per cent to 20 per cent.Timothy Leach, Concho’s chief executive, said: “We expect to deliver higher production growth on a lower capital spend and with fewer rigs.”Anadarko, which has offshore operations in Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as its US shale business, said it expected average production for 2015 to be slightly lower than in 2014, as it reported a $3.3bn loss for the first quarter, including a writedown of $2.9bn.The company said it had cut the average cost of drilling a well in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas by 14 per cent since the last three months of 2014.Al Walker, Anadarko’s chief executive, struck a cautionary note on the company’s call with analysts, saying it would be careful about stepping up spending and production growth in response to a recovery in oil prices.“As we achieve higher prices, we could see activity increase and prices, unfortunately, could suffer as a result of higher production than people are anticipating,” he said.“So we’re going to be a little careful in terms of adding to that production number.”
30;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-03-29T17:22:28Z;US oil independents share sales boom despite crude price fall;Equity issuance of $10.8bn hits new quarterly high;"US independent oil and gas companies have raised a record amount from share sales in the first three months of the year, as they seek to shore up their balance sheets following the plunge in oil prices since last summer.The small and midsized exploration and production companies that include the pioneers of the US shale revolution have sold shares worth $10.8bn this year, making this quarter the most active on record for equity issuance in the sector, according to data provider Dealogic.Noble Energy, Newfield Exploration, Southwestern Energy and Laredo Petroleum are among 22 exploration and production companies that have sold shares this year.By contrast, merger and acquisition activity for oil and gas independents has slowed to its lowest value since at least 2007.Bankers said the ability to raise equity capital this year signals continued investor interest in the sector in spite of the oil price slump.Osmar Abib, the global head of oil and gas at Credit Suisse, said: “The capital markets are open, in a way that many people hadn’t predicted at the start of the year.”While large oil and gas groups have generally been using debt to raise funds, with ExxonMobil selling $8bn of bonds this month, and Chevron $6bn in February, the smaller companies with typically lower credit ratings are relying more heavily on equity.Exploration and production companies raised $9.08bn from bond sales this quarter, but only 11 companies issued debt, half the number that sold shares.Syndicated loans to the sector have also been robust at $12.7bn, although that is still well below the quarterly record of $40bn reached in 2012.Bank lending to US exploration and production companies is generally tied to the value of their assets, which are assessed twice a year. The current round of revaluations will reflect lower oil prices, lowering the funds available to borrowers.Companies that issue equity will help reduce the risk of coming under financial strain, particularly if oil prices remain at present levels of about $48 per barrel for US crude for a protracted period.Poppy Allonby, of asset manager BlackRock, said on average companies that issued equity this year had subsequently outperformed the sector average.She added that energy sector valuations relative to the broader US equity market looked “extremely attractive”, and were even lower than after the oil prices collapses of the 1980s and 1990s.“If you had invested in the energy sector at those times, you would have been rewarded,” she said.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingAnalysts at Barclays argued in a note last week that US exploration and production shares appeared to reflect expectations of a rebound in US crude prices to about $85 per barrel.In the futures market the price of crude for December 2020 is only about $66.Industry advisers said the willingness by investors to support companies that want to issue equity is one reason for the slower pace of dealmaking.Whiting Petroleum, the largest producer in the Bakken formation of North Dakota, looked for a possible buyer in the past few weeks but instead opted to raise about $1bn from issuing new shares and $2bn from selling debt."
31;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-03-19T11:10:45Z;Explorers hold high hopes for oil prospects off Falkland Islands;Oil-related tax revenue could transform the remote islands in the South Atlantic;"Argentina began issuing 50 peso notes this month featuring a map of the Falkland Islands. Through mass circulation, they are designed to remind citizens of the continued claim by Argentina over the UK dependent territory it unsuccessfully invaded in 1982 and calls the Malvinas.But the longstanding diplomatic dispute between the UK and Argentina has not deterred several smaller oil companies from persisting with ambitions to pump oil and gas from the remote waters around the Falklands.Most of the money being spent over the coming months — to drill six wells at a cost of $400m — is being committed by London-listed Premier Oil and Noble Energy of the US. Junior partners include UK-based Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas.Oil was first found off the Falklands in 2010 by Rockhopper in a field named Sea Lion that is located north of the islands. The discovery was too modest in size to secure interest from large energy groups, but the tax revenues associated with the crude could yet be transformational for the scarcely populated Falklands.There were hopes that production in the Sea Lion field could start by 2017, but concerns over the engineering challenges of operating in the South Atlantic ocean, and delays in securing financial support, have pushed that timetable back. The 50 per cent fall in oil prices since last summer risks further delays.However, Sam Moody, chief executive of Rockhopper, insists that a scaled-down plan for the Sea Lion field, involving initial capital expenditure of $1.8bn or less, could still secure a start to production before 2020.“We are confident it [Sea Lion] will still get [approved],” says Mr Moody.Mr Moody also insists the Sea Lion field will be developed whether or not this year’s exploration campaign in other areas around the Falklands succeeds. “We are talking about 400m barrels of recoverable oil. I can’t remember the last time that amount was discovered in the UK’s North Sea.”A decision over the final go-ahead for the Sea Lion field rests with Premier Oil, the FTSE 250 company which bought a majority stake in the project, and took over as operator in 2012.In January, Tony Durrant, Premier’s chief executive, conceded that the company could only back the field if there was a significant recovery in Brent crude prices to more than $50 per barrel. On Wednesday, Brent was trading at $53.05.Any firm commitment by Premier to the field’s development will also depend on balancing realistic assumptions about future oil prices against the fiscal terms offered by the Falklands government.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingThe authorities in Stanley expect to receive a 9 per cent share of production revenues through a longstanding framework offered to oil explorers, while successful developers will also pay a tax of 26 per cent on company profits to the Falklands government.Stephen Luxton, director of mineral resources for the Falklands government, defends the terms on offer to successful developers — seen as being among the most generous in the world.“It’s an important principle to maintain fiscal stability for companies considering investing in projects over 15 to 25 years,” he says. “Companies need a good return to work here as it’s such a remote area.”Mr Luxton is reluctant to be drawn on just how much money could flow into the coffers of the Falklands government should the Sea Lion field proceed to development — although he agrees it could be transformational.The islands, which have fewer than 3,000 inhabitants, generate an annual gross domestic product of £100m — or less than £30,000 a head.It’s an important principle to maintain fiscal stability for companies considering investing in projects over 15 to 25 years. Companies need a good return to work here as it’s such a remote areaThe islands’ economy has traditionally been based on sheep farming, although much of the Falklands government’s revenues are now derived from exports of frozen squid, fished by foreign vessels whose crews are recruited in Korea, Vietnam and other Asian countries.All that will change if the Sea Lion field proceeds. The first stage of the field’s development would deliver 60,000 barrels of crude a day, and the Falklands government could feasibly receive $2.5bn in oil-related tax over 15 years. That equates to close to $1m of tax per head of population from the first stage of the project alone.Another $2.5bn of tax could be obtained from a potential second phase of the Sea Lion field’s development. If there is further exploration success in the waters off the Falklands, the islands could secure billions of dollars more in tax over the coming decades.Mr Luxton and other Falklands officials have visited Norway and discussed how to apply the lessons learned by the Nordic country in managing its vast hydrocarbon wealth accrued since the 1970s.“It’s an issue that has been firmly on our radar for a number of years,” says Mr Luxton. “We have to look after this resource responsibly and look to stretch the benefit over several generations.”"
32;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-03-05T08:17:19Z;US oil industry needs capital to keep flowing;As access to capital narrows, bid activity will rise;The world may run on oil, but the oil industry runs on money. The US shale boom would not have been possible without a huge inflow of capital: the small to midsized companies that led the revolution raised $875bn from syndicated loans, bonds and equities in 2007-14, 83 per cent of it in debt, according to Dealogic.The critical question for the industry, and for the future of US oil production, is whether that financial lifeblood will continue to flow.It is clear that some sources are drying up. E&P companies are still raising funds through equity issues: Noble Energy announced a $1bn-plus share sale last week, and Goodrich Petroleum a $49m issue on Monday. But equity is a more expensive source of capital now than it was in August, after a 35 per cent-plus drop in the S&P 500 E&P sector index.Bond issuance by smaller independent companies has slowed to a trickle, with only two sales in January and February, according to Dealogic. At the same time, bank lending is also facing constraints.Smaller US independents generally use reserve-based lending, with their borrowing secured against valuations of their oil and gas assets, which are linked to market prices. The borrowing bases are typically calculated twice a year, with one round of valuations going on about now. The plunge in both crude and US natural gas in the past six months will curb the amount that companies can borrow.So given those constraints, where will the industry find the capital it needs? One answer is through larger companies, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, swallowing up the smaller, buying both assets and entire businesses. With its triple A credit rating — better than the US government’s — Exxon has ample access to cheap capital, as its $7bn bond sale on Tuesday showed.Even Exxon, though, will want to be selective about its acquisitions. Management capacity is finite, and it cannot buy everything. Market valuations are also a disincentive to making acquisitions for shares. Anadarko Petroleum, for example, is often talked about as a takeover target, but its shares are trading at about 40 times 2016 earnings, while Exxon’s are at 16 times.$4.5bnAmount raised by Blackstone to invest in energyA takeover would dilute Exxon’s earnings unless it can improve Anadarko’s performance dramatically. The best value deals will be available only from companies that are forced sellers.The other increasingly important source of capital is going to be private equity and hedge funds. Blackstone has raised $4.5bn to invest in energy, while Apollo Global Management, Goldman Sachs and others have also been raising funds. If these funds still have a positive long-term view on energy, it is a much better time to buy in now than a year ago.Already a few deals have been done. Linn Energy, a heavily-indebted E&P company structured as a partnership, in January announced an investment of up to $500m from GSO, Blackstone’s debt unit. Resolute Energy at the end of last year raised a $150m loan from Highbridge Capital Management, a hedge fund owned by JPMorgan.But this source of capital does not look like cheap money, though. Resolute is paying Highbridge an interest rate of 10 percentage points over Libor, with a minimum of 11 per cent.Companies seeking financing will have to show that they are investable propositions, and for the most part that is likely to mean planning for significantly higher returns on capital than in the past, even at significantly lower commodity prices.That means that cutting costs will be vital. If costs cannot be brought down fast, both by increasing efficiency and by squeezing lower rates out of service companies, then the outlook for investment in US E&P companies will continue to deteriorate.For anyone wanting to understand the outlook for US production and world oil markets, costs in the shale industry will be a critical indicator to watch.The Commodities Note is online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
33;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2015-01-05T18:10:31Z;Caterpillar falls on downgrade due to oil and gas exposure;Exposure to oil price accounts for about 12% of company’s revenues;Caterpillar was among the worst-performing stocks on the US benchmark on Monday, after JPMorgan analysts downgraded the mining and construction equipment maker for its exposure to oil and gas.Analysts at JPMorgan cut Caterpillar to “underweight” from “neutral” and lowered their price target to $80 from $95.At a time when the price of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has fallen more than 50 per cent since mid-June last year, Ann Duignan, an analyst at JPMorgan, said Caterpillar’s direct exposure to oil and gas through services and products used in exploration and production accounts for about $6.5bn, or 12 per cent, of its total revenues.The company also has indirect exposure to mining, US construction and emerging markets where growth is expected to be pressured by lower oil prices. North American construction accounts for about 17 per cent of Caterpillar’s revenues, and of that Ms Duignan estimates 5 per cent “may be leverage to oil and gas states”. Canadian Oil Sands, which is also expected to experience a slowdown in demand, represents about 3 per cent of total revenue.“Overall, Caterpillar’s combined indirect exposure may be as much as 15 per cent of its revenues — implying that upwards of 30 per cent of its total revenue may come under increasing pressure in 2015-16,” said Ms Duignan. The stronger dollar is another factor that could hurt Caterpillar’s competitiveness.Shares of Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $87.03 and are down nearly 21 per cent in the past six months.Shares of Isis Pharmaceuticals gained nearly 11 per cent to $69.19, after the company announced a collaboration with Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, to develop drugs to treat autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Isis will get $35m in upfront payments and an additional $800m in licence fees. Isis will also receive tiered royalties.Shares of drugmaker Biogen Idec declined 1 per cent to $337.77 after analysts at Nomura downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy” and lowered their price target to $378 from $407. M Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura, lowered his sales estimates of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, following slower US sales growth based on data from IMS, which tracks drug prescriptions and sales.Mr Somaiya lowered his US multiple sclerosis drug sales estimates for Biogen by 3 per cent in 2015 to $6.3bn and by 4 per cent to $9.8bn in 2020.The S&P 500 was dragged lower by the energy sector, which fell 4 per cent, as the price of Brent crude fell more than 6 per cent to $52.90. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, fell to fresh five-and-a-half year lows, below the $50 a barrel mark. Diamond Offshore Drilling, down 9 per cent to $33.99, Denbury Resources, down 8 per cent to $7.30, and Noble Energy, down 10 per cent to $42.39, were the worst-performing energy stocks on the US benchmark.The S&P 500 slid 1.8 per cent to 2,020.58, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9 per cent to 17,501.65.

34;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Jordan $15bn gas deal under threat amid conflict;Country takes unprecedented step of recalling its ambassador from Israel;"A proposal for Jordan to buy $15bn of natural gas from Israel is facing strong opposition in the kingdom because of the intensifying Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which officials fear could delay or even scupper the deal.Jordan this month took the unprecedented step of recalling its ambassador after Israeli security forces entered Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque to subdue protesters angered over a move to end a longstanding deal prohibiting Jewish prayer at the site. It was the first time Jordan has officially recalled its envoy to Israel since the two countries signed a peace treaty 20 years ago.The controversy over the gas deal highlights the high stakes in a sensitive bilateral relationship that sees Jordan’s government co-operate closely with Israel on water, security and other issues, despite widespread public antipathy toward the Jewish state and its policies toward the Palestinians.Following a summit last week convened by US secretary of state John Kerry, Jordan’s King Abdullah and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu agreed undisclosed measures that cooled tensions over al-Aqsa, for now.According to Jordanian officials, the 15-year deal to buy gas from Israel’s offshore Leviathan reservoir remains on track.However, they warn that any renewed tensions over al-Aqsa would jeopardise all areas of economic co-operation – tacitly including the gas deal, which awaits final government approval.Mohammad al-Momani, Jordan’s information minister, said: “The peace treaty between us and the Israelis organises all sorts of bilateral relations. If the escalation continues, all sorts of co-ordination and co-operation regrettably might be affected.”Noble Energy of the US and Israel’s Delek Drilling initialled the deal – an anchor for their $6.5bn Leviathan project – with Jordan’s National Electric Power Company (Nepco) in September.Before the clashes at al-Aqsa began last month, Jordan’s energy minister said the country was on track to sign the gas agreement in November. The deal would end Jordan’s reliance on patchy supplies of gas from Egypt and reduce its annual energy bill by an estimated $1.4bn.However, opposition to the agreement is building among civil society groups and politicians.Yahya Mohammad Al Saud, an MP and president of the Jordanian parliamentary committee on Palestine, said: “The Jordanian [people are] not willing to accept this agreement. I will return to riding on a donkey and heating my house with wood before I would consider taking gas from Israel.”At a protest on Sunday in front of Nepco’s Amman headquarters, protesters held up placards opposing “the Zionist gas deal”.“You cannot depend on the Israelis; they have breached all agreements. And you know what’s going on in Jerusalem and at al-Aqsa,” said Rima Abad, one of the demonstrators. “We cannot give them money to support the settlements and the occupation.”The Jordanian [people are] not willing to accept this agreement. I will return to riding on a donkey and heating my house with wood before I would consider taking gas from IsraelFellow protester Fadi Nashashibi, an engineer who is among the roughly half of Jordanians who are of Palestinian descent, added: “We are building a very good terminal in Aqaba where we could buy liquid gas from anywhere in the world.”Jordan is constructing a new liquefied gas terminal in the southern city that could allow it to bring in product from Qatar or elsewhere, but officials and analysts say Israeli gas is the cheapest source.Jordanians have watched with alarm the ascendance of extreme rightwingers in Mr Netanyahu’s government and the ruling Likud party, who have called for the annexation of further Palestinian lands and a change in the status quo at al-Aqsa.In a speech this month, King Abdullah deplored “Israeli unilateral policies and measures in Jerusalem”.The situation is complicated by the fact that Jordan’s Hashemite monarchy is custodian of the sensitive holy site, a status enshrined in the peace treaty that analysts say bolsters its standing both at home and in an increasingly unsettled Middle East.Oraib Al Rantawi, director of the Al-Quds Centre for Political Studies in Amman, said the dispute was causing “serious damage to the treaty”.“It affects Jordanian security and stability and the king’s credibility and legitimacy,” he added, particularly relevant at a time of rising Islamic extremism.The deal matters to Israel too, and highlights the risks to its economy posed by the ongoing unrest in Jerusalem. The country is counting on its recently discovered offshore gas to support investment and growth in coming years, but investors in the sector have voiced concern recently over perceived regulatory and political risks.Leviathan’s partners are trying to line up the Jordanian contract along with another $30bn proposed deal to pump gas to a facility in Egypt operated by the UK’s BG Group. The smaller Tamar field, which began producing last year, alone contributed half a percentage point of Israel’s 2013 GDP.“It is going well,” an industry figure close to the Leviathan consortium said of the gas deal. But he also acknowledged the uncertainties over Jerusalem that have threatened to delay it: “It is the Middle East.”"

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland.

The reason for the hiatus, according to the industry, is the increasingly hostile regulatory environment, including a rule that about half the output should be reserved for the domestic market, although analysts say the recent softening in gas prices has played a contributory role.The $6.5bn Leviathan offshore project, on which Israel’s Delek Drilling and Noble Energy of the US want to begin work next year, with gas in production by 2017, continues to inch forward. However, industry investors warn this could be the last significant gas project off Israel’s shores for some time.“Leviathan . . . will be developed, but with the regulatory challenges they have put in the last three to four years, they have killed the industry,” said a senior energy industry executive, who requested anonymity due to the poor relations between big business and Israeli politicians and regulators.The halt to new drilling comes as other Israeli companies, including potash producer Israel Chemicals (ICL), complain of overzealous regulation and a mood of economic populism in government and in the Knesset that they say makes their home country an unrewarding place to invest.Yoram Turbowicz, previously chief of staff to Ehud Olmert when Israeli prime minister and who now advises ICL, says: “There is a pendulum of regulatory pressure . . . and right now we are probably in a period of extreme intervention by the various regulatory authorities in Israel.”Economic growth has slowed in Israel and political risk is rising because of a worsening communal conflict with the Palestinians.A dispute over Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa mosque led Jordan to last week withdraw its ambassador to Israel, raising doubts over whether a proposed $15bn deal tied to Leviathan that would see Israel provide gas to its Arab neighbour would go ahead. The Jordanian contract is essential collateral needed by Leviathan’s operators to finance the field, alongside a proposed $30bn deal to supply a liquefied natural gas facility in Egypt operated by BG Group of the UK.“I absolutely hope we will reach a commercial agreement between BG and the Leviathan partnership by the end of the year,” says Sami Iskander, BG’s chief operating officer. “The issues are not insurmountable,” he adds, while declining to say what stood in the way of the deal.Israel’s government last year approved the creation of a fund to manage increasing revenues from its gas industry. The Tamar offshore field, which began producing last year, contributed half a percentage point to Israel’s gross domestic product.Dan Shapiro, US ambassador to Israel, spoke last week of the need to “move quickly” on developing nearby Leviathan, adding that energy companies needed a “stable, predictable investment environment”.“Companies have many places where they can invest their money,” Mr Shapiro told an energy conference in Tel Aviv.Australia’s Woodside Petroleum pulled out of its $2.7bn investment in Leviathan in May, saying negotiations had “failed to reach a commercially acceptable outcome” and complaining about uncertainty over tax and export issues.The remaining Leviathan investors await a final decision on whether Israel will impose price controls on domestically sold gas – a potential deal-breaker they believe is unlikely but on which they still need confirmation.In addition, the Israeli Antitrust Authority has ordered Leviathan’s owners to sell oil and gas rights to two smaller fields to allow greater market competition.Avishay Braverman, head of the Knesset’s economic affairs committee, took to Facebook recently to argue that breaking the “gas monopoly” would reduce the price of electricity in Israel by 15 per cent.Leviathan . . . will be developed, but with the regulatory challenges they have put in the last three to four years, they have killed the industryPublic anger over high prices and the cosy – sometimes corrupt – links between politics and business in Israel came to the fore with a wave of social protests that swept the country in 2011. This is now finding expression in an uncompromising stance taken by politicians such as Mr Braverman and Yair Lapid, the populist finance minister who last year vetoed a proposed merger between ICL and Canada’s PotashCorp.Analysts say such regulatory zeal and economic nationalism is having a marked effect on the investment climate. In a report on the gas sector prepared for Norway earlier this year, consultancy IHS ranked Israel lower than Angola or Mozambique in terms of officials’ respect for contracts.Earlier this week, a government committee in charge of setting tax policy on non-gas natural resources – in effect ICL – approved a recommendation to impose a surtax worth between 25-42 per cent on the minerals the company extracts from the Dead Sea.ICL said the new tax makes further investments in its home base in Israel’s southern Negev region unprofitable, and that it will now put more money into its overseas operations in Spain, the UK and Ethiopia.In a symbolic snub to its home country, ICL’s board this week announced their quarterly results from Barcelona. The company also revealed plans to invest a further $435m in its Iberian operation, even as it cuts $80m of costs at home..
37;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2014-10-22T17:11:25Z;Israeli gas: landing the Leviathan;The Leviathan and Tamar fields offer potential, and challenges;If necessity is the mother of invention, its second cousin must be energy demand. A society’s requirement for light and heat for its people can bridge political differences. Witness what is happening in Israel. Big offshore natural gas discoveries there since 2009 could help bring cheaper energy not just to Israel but also to Jordan, Palestine and eventually even Egypt and Turkey.These gasfields, the largest of which are Leviathan and Tamar, were discovered in 2009-10 by Noble Energy and the subsidiaries of the Israeli conglomerate Delek Group (Delek Drilling and Avner Oil and Gas). According to the oil consultants Netherland & Sewell, the resource is huge: the equivalent of 150 years of Israeli gas demand of 245bn cubic feet last year. After some years of drilling to prepare for production, commercial contracts with customers are close.The fields have more than enough to supply not only Israel, but also its neighbours. Some of these countries are short of energy – note the rush-hour blackouts in Cairo, for example. Delek says it already has preliminary agreements with Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, and it is also talking to the Egyptian government.Delek and Noble Energy together control about 80 per cent of the projects. If all the gas is contracted to customers, Credit Suisse thinks that Noble Energy’s Israeli offshore assets are worth nearly $16 a share, about a quarter of its current value. At the two Delek companies (Delek Drilling and Avner Oil), the gas could be worth just over $3bn for each, the equivalent of their respective market values. The latter two trade at earnings multiples 50 to 100 per cent higher than Noble, so the market is counting on success.But there are plenty of risks. Contracts may not be signed, and regional politics could intervene. Israeli regulators may feel that too much gas sits in the partners’ hands. As with most things in that region, a delicate negotiation will be required for success.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
38;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2014-09-03T14:18:36Z;Israel to supply up to $15bn of natural gas to Jordan;;Israel is to supply up to $15bn of natural gas from its Leviathan field over 15 years to Jordan, easing an energy crunch in the kingdom and marking the biggest such bilateral deal its nascent offshore industry has yet seen.Noble Energy of the US and Israel’s Delek, the two main investors in Leviathan, announced the deal in stock exchange filings on Wednesday in which they said they would supply 1.6tn cubic feet over 15 years via a new pipeline.The investors said they would deliver the gas at a border location between Israel and Jordan once pipeline infrastructure was complete. Jordan’s National Electric Power Company will be the buyer of the gas.The Israeli companies did not put a price tag on the deal, but a person familiar with its terms estimated the contract’s value at $14bn to $15bn. Noble and Delek will build the section of the pipeline leading to the Jordanian border, and Jordan will build on the other side.The agreement followed long negotiations fraught with political sensitivities. Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994 and co-operate closely on security matters, but there is widespread public animosity toward Israel in Jordan because of its occupation of Palestinian lands.The parties involved in the deal said they were working in co-ordination with, and with the support of, the US state department.Jordan’s economy is still reeling from the loss of cheap Egyptian natural gas since 2011, when political unrest and sabotage of the pipeline running through the Sinai peninsula caused the resource to run dry, compounding pressure on its economy caused by the war in Syria and broader chaos in the Middle East.The deal announced on Wednesday is a non-binding letter of intent, and Noble and Delek said they planned to sign a final purchase and sales agreement this year.Leviathan is one of the industry’s largest deepwater offshore fields found in recent years, with estimated reserves of 22tn cubic feet. The field’s investors expect to begin producing gas there from 2017.In June, the field’s partners signed a preliminary agreement to supply $30bn worth of gas to Britain’s BG via a new undersea pipeline to the British producer’s liquefied natural gas plant in Egypt, which had run out of supply because of shortages on the Egyptian market.Noble and Delek have also signed smaller supply deals to sell gas to the Palestinian Authority and Jordan’s Arab Potash.In May they signed a letter of intent to sell gas from Israel’s smaller Tamar offshore field to a second Egyptian refinery operated by Unión Fenosa Gas, a joint venture between Spain’s Gas Natural and Italy’s Eni.Keith Elliott, Noble’s vice-president for eastern Mediterranean business, said the companies now had more than 60 per cent of Leviathan’s initial capacity secured with letters of intent from potential customers.Noble and Delek have also held preliminary talks with potential customers in Turkey on a deal that would see gas pumped there via an undersea pipeline. However, political relations between Israel and Turkey, already tense, frayed badly during this summer’s Gaza war, and industry participants say a deal there is unlikely to be agreed soon.Israel’s Delek Drilling and Avner Oil Exploration own 45 per cent of Leviathan, Noble owns 40 per cent and another Israeli company, Ratio Oil Exploration, has a 15 per cent stake.
39;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2014-06-29T11:25:55Z;Israel’s Leviathan partners target $30bn supply deal with BG;;The partners in Israel’s biggest offshore natural gas field have reached a preliminary agreement on a $30bn deal to supply gas to Britain’s BG in Egypt via a new undersea pipeline, in the biggest cross-border deal yet of its kind between the nascent Israeli industry and a neighbouring country.The deal will see Israeli gas pumped directly from the Leviathan field off Haifa, northern Israel, to BG’s liquefied natural gas plant in Idku, Egypt, which has been affected recently by acute gas shortages on the Egyptian market.The investors in Leviathan said on Sunday in a filing to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and Israel Securities Authority that they had signed a non-binding letter of intent with BG to supply it with about 7bn cubic meters of gas a year over 15 years.BG said the letter marked “a first step” towards supplying its stalled Egyptian plant with gas, but also said it was “very early days”.“We are looking at a number of options for increasing the supply of gas to the Egyptian LNG facility, and this is one of several currently under consideration,” the company said.Israel’s Delek Drilling and Avner Oil Exploration own 45 per cent of Leviathan, Noble Energy of the US owns 40 per cent and another Israeli company, Ratio Oil Exploration, has a 15 per cent stake.A person with knowledge of the deal said that the proposed contract’s value was $30bn. This amount covers only gas sold and not the pipeline, which BG is expected to build.The proposed deal, if struck, would provide an anchor for the development of Leviathan, one of the industry’s largest deepwater finds anywhere over the past decade, which holds an estimated 19tn cubic feet of discovered gasThe contract reflects a reversal of fortune for Egypt’s natural gas industry, which until recently exported to Israel and Jordan, but stopped because of domestic shortages and attacks by militants on its pipeline running through the troubled Sinai peninsula.BG declared force majeure in Egypt in January because it did not have enough gas to keep its plant in Idku running.In May, Noble and Delek signed a letter of intent on a smaller deal to export up to 4.5bcm per year over 15 years from Israel’s smaller Tamar field, which is already operating, to a second Egyptian refinery in Damietta operated by Unión Fenosa Gas, a joint venture between Spain’s Gas Natural and Italy’s Eni.The proposed deal, if struck, would provide an anchor for the development of Leviathan, one of the industry’s largest deepwater finds anywhere over the past decade, which holds an estimated 19tn cubic feet of discovered gas.Noble and Delek want to begin developing the field by the end of this year and export gas from late 2017.The Leviathan investors have pushed the project forward against the backdrop of tense discussions with Israeli regulators, who have set caps on how much they can export, probed antitrust issues surrounding their control of the industry, and set a surtax on windfall profits.The geopolitics of Israel exporting gas to neighbouring countries are also delicate because of friction over the country’s unresolved conflict with the Palestinians.However, the Leviathan partners have signed a small supply contract to sell gas to potash and bromine companies in Jordan, and are negotiating larger contracts to pipe gas from Leviathan to Jordan and Turkey.
40;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2014-06-04T20:03:01Z;Falkland Islands explorers agree six-well deal;;Explorers with blocks in waters surrounding the Falkland Islands have committed themselves to another round of drilling, with a possible $250m or more spent on attempting to find further deposits of oil and gas.Premier Oil and Noble Energy have agreed a deal, which will include at least six wells drilled around the islands in a campaign beginning next year.The initial plan will use a rig suited to the harsh operating conditions of the South Atlantic – tipped to be the Eirik Raude – to drill two wells close to Sea Lion discovery in the North Falklands Basin operated by Premier Oil. The rig will then proceed to drill two wells in the South and East Falkland Basin in blocks operated by Noble Energy before returning north to drill a further two wells.Rockhopper Exploration, which discovered the Sea Lion field but is now junior partner following a selldown of its interests to Premier Oil, will contribute towards the costs of the initial 240-day contract along with Falkland Oil & Gas, which has stakes in blocks in both basins.Companies declined to confirm a likely overall budget for the next wave of drilling around the Falklands, following the failure of the last campaign to find commercial deposits to the south and east of the archipelago.However, at a likely staring cost of at least $500,000 a day for a suitable rig, the minimum initial cost of drilling six wells in waters whose sovereignty is disputed by Argentina is estimated to be about $250m.The deal also involves the companies securing options to drill a further eight well ahead of the rig starting its drilling campaign and an additional layer of options to deploy the rig at a further eight sites if required during the campaign.Mark Henderson, analyst at Westhouse Securities, said: “This is a positive step for all the players in the Falklands, having had little in the way of significant positive newsflow over the past months. The northern basin will probably be the more important focus from the market’s perspective, as two of the planned wells will serve to prove up further resource potential on the Sea Lion field.”Analysts at Mirabaud Securities said the options negotiated to extend the drilling campaign would provide two other companies with equity stakes in Falkland Islands blocks – Borders & Southern and Argos Resources – a “window of opportunity” to secure funding and buy into the drilling campaign later.
41;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2014-05-21T14:41:13Z;Israel gas supply deals to Egypt and Jordan draw closer;;The companies investing in Israel’s offshore gasfields are negotiating major supply deals that could soon see the country export in large volumes via pipeline to neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, three people with knowledge of the talks said this week.Acute gas shortages in Egypt and the country’s move from Islamist rule to a military regime less hostile to Israel – due to be cemented in next week’s election– have laid the groundwork for big exports of the commodity from Israel’s Leviathan gasfield, executives and analysts said.US-based Noble Energy and Israel’s Delek are lead investors in the huge deepwater field off Haifa, which they say has 19tn cubic feet of discovered gas, and where they plan to begin work by end-2014 and export gas from late 2017.Egypt and Jordan, which until recently relied on cheap Egyptian gas to fuel its economy, would be the first candidates for big pipeline sales from Israel, the people familiar with Noble and Delek’s plans said.For Egypt, which until recently itself exported gas to Israel, Israeli gas could be the cheapest source of supply and the quickest fix for its troubled gas export industry.Production at two LNG facilities has stalled as Egyptian authorities diverted gas to the domestic grid. Power cuts have hurt Egyptian companies and fed public discontent ahead of next week’s election, which is expected to confirm Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as president.On May 5, Noble and Delek signed a letter of intent to export up to 2.5tn cubic feet of gas over 15 years from Israel’s smaller Tamar field to the LNG plant in the Nile Delta city of Damietta, operated by Unión Fenosa Gas, a joint venture between Spain’s Gas Natural and Italy’s Eni. Noble said that it expected that to result in a binding agreement within six months.“In Egypt, the return of military rule has facilitated old links with Israel,” said Catherine Hunter, a researcher specialising in north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean with IHS, the consultancy. “There were good trade links between Israel and Egypt in the Mubarak era, including gas, so reversing that flow makes more sense under a military framework.”The FT has learnt that Noble and Delek are also in preliminary talks with Britain’s BG Group to restore production at an LNG facility it operates in Egypt. In January the company declared force majeure in Egypt because it did not have gas to run the plant.A person with direct knowledge of the talks said that a deal was under discussion similar to the proposed one with Unión Fenosa, but added that BG was “a little more sensitive” to what was happening in Egypt politically.Noble and Delek both declined to comment on their plans because of the political sensitivities surrounding the talks.“We are working with the government and other stakeholders on an acceptable situation in Egypt,” BG said, but declined to confirm or deny any talks with the Leviathan partners. “Before we make any further investments in the country, we would need to be confident the overall investment climate is improving.”In Jordan, Noble in February announced a $500m contract to supply gas over 15 years to Jordanian potash and bromine factories on the shores of the Dead Sea.Before we make any further investments in the country, we would need to be confident the overall investment climate is improvingThe Leviathan partners are now talking to Jordanian officials about a much bigger, longer-term export agreement that could see Israel supply the country with up to 3 to 4bcm of gas per year, the same amount it used to buy from Egypt.Offsetting the Middle East’s demand for cheap gas are cultural sensitivities around buying anything at all – much less a vital natural resource – from Israel because of its occupation of Palestinian lands.Israel has peace treaties with both Egypt and Jordan and discreet political and security consultations with both countries, but antipathy toward Israel among their population is widespread. Abut half of Jordan’s population are Palestinians.When the Unión Fenosa Gas supply deal was announced, Egypt’s oil ministry said it would only proceed if it “realises high added value for the Egyptian economy”.The same sensitivities apply to Turkey, where Noble and Delek have been talking to a consortium of potential corporate customers about a major supply deal that would see construction of a new undersea pipeline. Turkey and Israel have yet to restore full diplomatic relations after Israel’s fatal storming of a Turkish ship heading for the Gaza Strip in 2010.
42;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2014-05-21T07:59:37Z;Woodside backs out of $2.7bn Israel gas project;;Australia’s Woodside Petroleum has pulled out of a $2.7bn deal to buy 25 per cent of Israel’s offshore Leviathan gasfield after a shift in the project’s commercial priorities.Peter Coleman, the group’s chief executive, said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on Wednesday that it had been a “difficult decision” to withdraw from the project.“All parties have worked very hard to secure an outcome which would be commercially acceptable, but after many months of negotiations it is time to acknowledge we will not get there under the current proposal,” Mr Coleman said.Remarks by executives from the other companies involved in Leviathan indicated Woodside was retreating because of a shift in initial plans for the field from gas liquefaction – the Australian company’s field of expertise – to exports of gas to neighbouring countries via pipeline.“The plans for development of the Leviathan discovery have significantly changed since we began the search for a partner approximately two years ago,” said Charles Davidson, chief executive of Texas-based Noble Energy, the US company that will operate Leviathan.Leviathan, located in 5,550 feet of water in the eastern Mediterranean, holds an estimated 19tn cubic feet of natural gas – more than enough to satisfy Israel’s domestic needs – and has positioned the country to become a big regional exporter for the first time in its history.Woodside and Leviathan’s partners had been in talks since late 2012, and signed a memorandum of understanding in February 2014.The Australian company’s withdrawal leaves Noble with just under 40 per cent of the project, and Israeli companies Delek Drilling, Avner Oil Exploration and Ratio Oil Exploration holding the remaining shares.Mr Davidson said the growth of regional markets for natural gas, which can be supplied by pipeline, was creating “dramatic changes” and had pushed the need for liquefied natural gas to a later stage.“Now the focus is really on regional opportunities, including Egypt, Turkey, Cyprus and so on,” said an executive at one of the partners in the project who asked not to be named.Work on Leviathan will begin at the end of this year. The field is due to start producing gas from a floating production, storage and offloading system to Israel and regional markets by 2017.Demand for gas is growing among Israel’s neighbours including Egypt, which was formerly the region’s biggest exporter but is now experiencing shortages and considering importing Israeli gas. The disarray in Egypt’s gas sector has hit supplies to Jordan, formerly one of its biggest customers.In January Leviathan’s shareholders signed a $1.2bn agreement to sell gas to the Palestinian Authority for use in a planned power plant in the West Bank, in the first of what they hope will be several bigger regional export deals.Noble and its partners, which last year began producing gas at the smaller offshore Tamar field, are also talking to Jordan’s government and a consortium of companies in Turkey about large-scale gas export contracts.Earlier this month, the companies signed a letter of intent to export up to 2.5tn cubic feet of natural gas over 15 years to an idle LNG plant in Damietta, Egypt, operated by Unión Fenosa Gas, a joint venture between Spain’s Gas Natural and Italy’s Eni.
43;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2014-03-03T05:01:51Z;Environmental group highlights need for action on methane;;Methane gas emissions from the US oil industry will rise significantly over the next five years unless companies take steps to curb them, but controls will be relatively cheap to put in place, a leading environmental group has said.The Environmental Defense Fund, which aims to work with businesses to cut pollution, is on Monday publishing an analysis showing that methane emissions from the onshore US oil and gas industry are set to rise about 4.5 per cent between 2011 and 2018, because of the oil production boom.Last week, Colorado became the first US state to impose regulations on methane emissions associated with oil and gas production, and the EDF is pushing for other states to follow suit. The rules were drawn up with the co-operation of the leading oil and gas producers in the state, including Noble Energy, Anadarko Petroleum and Encana.Emissions of methane cause concern because of its contribution to the threat of global warming: it is a greenhouse gas estimated to be 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide 20 years after release, and is still 28 times as potent after 100 years. Methane leaks are also often associated with releases of volatile organic compounds, which can cause smog and local air pollution.Methane is the principal component of natural gas, and concerns about leakage from wells and pipelines are one of the main arguments used by environmental campaigners opposed to increased oil and gas production.The analysis done for the EDF by ICF, a consultancy, suggests that all of the expected increase in US methane emissions comes from oil production, which is rising fast because of the shale boom. Oil reservoirs also hold associated natural gas, which comes up to the surface along with the crude as it is produced. That gas is often unwanted, and is either simply vented into the air or burnt in flares that do not consume all the escaping gas.ICF argues that by using the most effective available equipment methane emissions from oil and gas could be cut by 40 per cent for a cost of just $108m per year across the entire industry, taking into account the fact that gas prevented from leaking can often be sold.The new regulations in Colorado include requirements to fit that low-emitting equipment and to make regular checks for leaks.Chuck Davidson, Noble’s chief executive, said the company had decided to work with the state on drawing up the regulations to show that the industry was doing everything possible to minimise the impact on the environment, without being asked to reach unattainable goals.“We in the industry believe we can produce safely, but it’s important the public shares that view,” he said. “Our concern was that we didn’t go down a path that we were not quite ready for.”Fred Krupp, the EDF’s president, said Colorado’s plan for methane emissions would help make the case that it was better to switch more power generation from coal to gas, which creates less greenhouse gas emissions when it is burnt.“I view this as a very hopeful sign that shows the industry we want natural gas to be as clean as it can be,” he said.The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry group, said recent estimates showed that methane emissions were already lower than had previously been thought, and highlighted federal regulations introduced by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2012 intended to cut emissions from gas production.It added: “The industry will continue to make substantial progress to reduce emissions voluntarily and in compliance with EPA’s recent emissions standards. Methane is natural gas, so capturing more of it helps companies deliver more energy to consumers. This creates a built-in incentive to continue reducing emissions.”
44;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2014-02-19T17:02:11Z;Noble Energy signs $500m deal to supply gas from Israel to Jordan;;Noble Energy, the biggest foreign investor in Israel’s offshore Mediterranean natural gasfields, on Wednesday announced a contract that will see gas exported to customers in neighbouring Jordan.The contract, worth $500m, runs for 15 years and will see the Houston-based, New York-listed company supply about 66bn cubic feet of natural gas from Israel’s Tamar field to Arab Potash and Jordan Bromine, both of which have facilities near the shore of the Dead Sea.Sales of the gas are due to begin in 2016, once minimal pipeline infrastructure has been completed, Noble said. The company will sell the gas based on a price of at least $6.50 per thousand cubic feet, with upside linked to Brent crude oil prices.Jordan’s economy has suffered since 2011 from a disruption in the supply of cheap natural gas from Egypt because of political unrest and militants’ attacks on the pipeline that runs through the Sinai peninsula. Officials in the kingdom have been looking to shore up alternative energy sources, including from Israel.The deal is significant as the second of what Noble and its partners in two offshore gasfields – Tamar and the larger, still-undeveloped Leviathan – hope will be a series of export agreements with Israel’s neighbours, which analysts say could influence political relations in the eastern Mediterranean.Noble and the other shareholders in Leviathan, led by Israel’s Delek, last month signed a $1.2bn sales agreement with the Palestinian Power Generation Company, which plans to build a gas-fired power plant in the northern West Bank city of Jenin.Keith Elliott, Noble’s senior vice-president for the eastern Mediterranean, said the export deal with Jordan pointed to “the growing regional opportunities for our natural gas”.Noble operates Tamar, which has an estimated 10tn cubic feet of discovered natural gas, and holds a 36 per cent interest in the field alongside Israel’s Delek and other shareholders. The field began pumping gas in March 2013, with most of its output earmarked for domestic use in Israel.Noble describes Leviathan, which has 18tn cubic feet of gas, as the biggest exploration success in its history. The company and its partners in the planned field have held talks with potential customers Turkey, Cyprus and Egypt about future export deals from Leviathan, which the companies hope will begin pumping gas by 2017.The project still must overcome regulatory hurdles, including the outcome of an Israeli antitrust probe and a decision on where the terminal receiving the gas onshore will be located.“Noble is working together with the [Israeli] government to create the necessary regulatory framework to allow for project development while at the same time exploring regional and global export markets,” said Bini Zomer, director of corporate affairs and joint ventures with Noble in Israel.
45;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2013-11-06T07:38:55Z;Israel set to become major gas exporter;;The Tamar deepwater natural gas platform rises 290m from the seabed off Ashdod, in southern Israel, emerging above the waterline only for the last 50 metres or so.The $3.5bn project is described by its investors Delek of Israel and Noble Energy of the US as the largest private sector infrastructure undertaking in Israel’s 65-year history. The gas from Tamar, which began sending its output onshore in late March, will contribute about a percentage point of the country’s gross domestic product this year.Israel is on the threshold of becoming a major energy power in the Middle East – with potentially game-changing consequences for geopolitics and economic relations in a volatile region – after a court decision unlocked the path to exports.Executives at Delek and Noble told the Financial Times they are fast-tracking discussions on a range of export options for the much larger, still undeveloped Leviathan field, which lies about 30km to Tamar’s west, and holds an estimated 19tn cubic feet of gas – one of the industry’s biggest recent deepwater finds of its kind.They are moving forward following a decision by Israel’s supreme court in late October to reject petitions brought by civil society groups and opposition politicians who questioned the right of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to set aside 40 per cent of Israel’s gas windfall for exports without having consulted the Knesset, Israel’s legislature.When Mr Netanyahu’s government set export policy in June, it estimated that gas sales outside Israel could bring the small, traditionally resource-poor economy a windfall of $60bn over 20 years.“I think that now, after the Supreme Court made its ruling, the door is open,” says Gideon Tadmor, Delek Drilling chairman. “I am quite optimistic that we will fast-track the project.”Delek and Noble are looking at a range of export options that could see total investments by the companies and their partners of $5bn to $15bn in developing Leviathan and possible pipelines or liquefied natural gas facilities needed to export its output.This is a win-win situation for Israel and the neighbouring countriesThe two companies say the export options they are considering include piping gas to Turkey, Greece, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, or even Egypt, which is suffering gas shortages after the political unrest of the past two years. Delek and Noble are also deliberating over big-ticket investments in LNG, which would open up markets as far away as Asia.“Many countries in the region, by using Leviathan gas, could reduce their electricity tariffs between 40 to 50 per cent,” says Yossi Abu, Delek Drillings chief executive. “This is a win-win situation for Israel and the neighbouring countries.”The options for exporting Israeli gas that are being explored by Delek and Noble Energy.One option they may pursue is a state of the art floating facility moored directly over the Leviathan field. Another is onshore LNG production either in Israel or in Cyprus, where Delek and Noble have rights to the Aphrodite field, and could pool its gas with Leviathan’s.One of the most ambitious export projects being considered is an undersea pipeline from Leviathan to energy hungry Turkey, which would entail an investment of $2bn to $3bn. Noble and Delek have been sounding out potential Turkish customers and Taner Yildiz, Turkey’s energy minister, said at a conference in Istanbul last week: “Turkey is interested in Israeli gas.”To transport Israeli gas to Egypt, Noble and Delek have studied options including reversing the flow in the Egyptian export pipeline that crosses the restive Sinai peninsula, or sending it via a new undersea pipeline to its neighbour’s two onshore LNG facilities.Israel’s government is supportive of the notion of exporting, not only because of the royalties and revenues it will collect from the industry, but because of potential positive knock-on effects on traditionally strained relations with its neighbours.However, Delek and Noble are reticent about the status of their negotiations because of the political sensitivities elsewhere in the Middle East around buying anything from Israel.Political relations with Turkey have not recovered from a diplomatic fracture caused by Israel’s fatal storming of the Turkish Mavi Marmara flotilla heading to Gaza in 2010. Despite Mr Netanyahu’s apology in March, brokered by US President Barack Obama, political rhetoric on both sides remains rancorous, even if commercial relations are improving.Inside Israel, the mood among members of the Knesset elected in January is deeply sceptical of big business and Mr Netanyahu’s rightwing government’s shepherding of the gas finds. Lingering resentments remain over the speed and manner in which his cabinet decided to export up to 40 per cent of Israel’s gas.“The entire decision of the future of Israel’s natural gas was made behind closed doors, without transparency,” says Stav Shaffir, an MP with the leftwing Labour party, which supported the supreme court challenge. “It’s not a decision that can be made like that,” she says, snapping her fingers.Delek and Noble still need to negotiate a lease for Leviathan. Another obstacle to developing the field is an antitrust probe into the two companies’ powerful position in the Israeli gas market that could potentially delay the project.Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: Israel’s energy independence has been transformed for years to come. At an even deeper seismic level below the gas, Noble and Delek believe offshore Israel has the potential for oil, and they plan to send a new drilling ship to begin looking for it in 2014.
46;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2013-04-11T15:29:46Z;Noble urges Israel to set gas policy;;Noble Energy said it was considering piping natural gas from Israel’s big offshore fields to Jordan or Turkey, but urged Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to make a decision on its export policy soon, warning the “clock is ticking”.Charles Davidson, the US company’s chief executive, also said Israel would deter companies from investing in the sector if it raised tax on gas retroactively again, as it did in 2010 after Noble had invested $1bn into the Tamar offshore field.The executive’s remarks come amid signs of resurgent resource nationalism in Israel.On Wednesday Yair Lapid, the country’s new finance minister, said he would block a proposal by Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan to buy control of Israel Chemicals, and said he would convene a public committee to review the use of Israel’s natural resources by private companies.“Before we can really move forward with export we need an appropriate export policy from the state of Israel,” Mr Davidson told reporters at a briefing on Thursday.Noble and Delek Energy, the two main investors in Israel’s gas sector, are waiting for Mr Netanyahu’s government to make a decision on a report on natural gas submitted last August by a committee of ministers.The Tzemach Report recommended that the country export up to 500bn cubic meters of its natural gas windfall, while reserving 450bcm for its domestic needs.However, disappointing drilling results since have raised concerns among policy makers that Israel’s gas reserves may be smaller than previously thought. Investors in the sector disagree, saying that Tamar and Leviathan contain more gas than they previously believed, but they are worried that government may cut the amount it earmarks for export.Mr Netanyahu’s new cabinet took office last month after an election campaign fought on populist themes that brought new politicians such as Mr Lapid to power.Noble and Delek say they need regulatory certainty before they will proceed with plans to develop the bigger Leviathan offshore field, which will require billions of dollars of further investments. Woodside Petroleum of Australia is poised to join the US and Israeli companies as a partner in the venture, but Mr Davidson said a final agreement had not been signed.Mr Davidson said Noble was exploring “a number of options” for export, including producing liquefied natural gas at a floating or onshore facility in Israel. This would also open up for Noble and its partners lucrative export markets such as Asia.He also confirmed earlier reports from industry executives that the company was considering exporting gas to Jordan– which has seen its natural gas flow disrupted from Egypt – or to Turkey, with which Israel recently ended a long political estrangement.These discussions were still at the “exploratory phase”, Noble said.To make its case with the Israeli public, Noble recently began running television spots about natural gas, in conjunction with the start of the $3bn Tamar project on March 31.In one of these, an Israeli woman is seen asking: “What is energy security for Israel?”Another woman answers: “The gas is the state of Israel’s gas.” A man says: “It is totally in our control.”In 2010 Israel’s ministry of finance appointed a committee which increased the government’s take of gas companies’ profits from 35 per cent to as much as 65 per cent, angering investors in the sector.“If the state of Israel did that again, it would clearly put off more investors from exploring again,” Mr Davidson said.Noble said it understood Mr Lapid’s remarks about natural resources refer to those other than gas, policy on which was already covered in the Tzemach Report.“There is already a committee that studies what to do with natural gas resources,” Mr Davidson said.
47;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2013-03-31T11:51:53Z;Israel begins offshore gas production;;Israel began pumping its first offshore natural gas at the weekend, in a move it is hoped will boost economic growth and transform the country’s energy security in coming years.Gas from the Tamar field, the smaller of Israel’s two biggest offshore reservoirs, began to flow at 4pm on Saturday, the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources said.It said the gas would take about 24 hours to travel from the well, about 90km off the coast of Haifa in northern Israel, via pipeline to an onshore terminal at Ashdod in southern Israel.Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister, said the start of production at Tamar marked “an important day for the Israeli economy”.“On the Festival of Freedom, we are taking an important step toward energy independence,” Mr Netanyahu’s office said on Saturday, referring to the week-long Passover holiday, which ends on Monday. “We have advanced the natural gas sector in Israel over the last decade, which will be good for the Israeli economy and for all Israelis.”The Tamar project cost $3bn, took four years to develop, and is the largest privately funded infrastructure project in Israeli history.The Bank of Israel estimates that the Tamar field will contribute a percentage point of the country’s gross domestic product growth this year, which is estimated to reach 3.8 per cent.Israel’s gas reservoirs at Tamar, which were discovered in 2009, and the larger, undeveloped Leviathan make the nation’s offshore finds among the world’s biggest in the past decade.Mr Netanyahu’s new government is expected to decide soon on the report of the Tzemach Committee, published last year, which recommended that Israel export up to 500bn cubic meters of its gas and save at least 450bcm for its domestic needs.The two biggest shareholders in Tamar and Leviathan, Noble Energy and Delek Energy, are hoping for permission from the government to export a significant portion of the gas they extract as they say demand for gas in Israel is too small to cover the estimated $3bn to $4bn they would need to develop Leviathan.The companies are studying options including exporting liquefied natural gas, or export via a pipeline, to Jordan or Turkey, with which Israel recently ended a long diplomatic estrangement when it apologised for the 2010 Mavi Marmara flotilla incident in which eight Turkish citizens and one Turkish-American were killed.In a statement on Saturday, the investors in Tamar said that the project would save the Israeli economy about $13bn a year in energy costs.Yitzhak Tshuva, owner of the Delek Group, said the start of production at the field marked an end to Israeli “slavery” and dependence on foreign energy sources. “This is the beginning of a new era that will change the face of the Israeli economy,” he said.
48;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Israel apologises for Turkish boat attack;;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has issued an apology to Turkey over a deadly flotilla attack that Ankara had long demanded, in a move aimed at healing the rift between the two former allies.In a telephone call to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his Turkish counterpart, Mr Netanyahu apologised for the deaths in 2010 of nine Turkish activists at the hands of the Israeli Defence Force.The apology, brokered by US President Barack Obama during his visit to Israel, meets a longstanding objective of Washington of bringing its two allies closer together after more than a year of virtually frozen diplomatic relations.The move came as a surprise to many analysts and officials, who had argued that the political and personal animosity between Mr Netanyahu and Mr Erdogan was too great to be overcome. But in a Middle East in flux, the two men displayed greater flexibility than many of their critics had suggested.In particular, the apology paves the way for greater co-operation between two states that both view developments in neighbouring Syria with alarm and which until recently had growing trade with each other. Officials in Ankara had already suggested that an apology would remove an important barrier to exploring the possibility of exports from Israel’s large offshore gasfields to Turkey.Senior US officials described the conversation between the Israeli and Turkish leaders as a “first step” towards normalisation of relations between the two countries, adding that the topic had been the subject of talks between Mr Obama and Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem this week. They noted that the 30 minute call took place at Tel Aviv airport just before the US president left for Jordan and that Mr Obama himself participated in part of the conversation.Confirming that Mr Netanyahu had apologised to Mr Erdogan, the Israeli government said on Friday that two men had agreed to normalise relations between Israel and Turkey.Referring to the Mavi Marmara, the ship stormed by the IDF while seeking to break the Gaza blockade, the Israeli statement said: “The prime minister made it clear that the tragic results regarding the Mavi Marmara were unintentional and that Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life.”It added: “In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational errors, prime minister Netanyahu apologised to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation/non liability.”In a sign of the sensitivity of relations between the two countries, a later Israeli statement omitted mention of steps laid out in Israel’s first comments, referring to the exchange of ambassadors and the cancellation of legal moves against Israeli soldiers.Turkey confirmed that Mr Erdogan accepted the apology. In a statement, the foreign ministry in Ankara added that the Turkish prime minister had expressed his regret that “relations that have strategic importance for peace and stability in the region” had been disrupted and he had emphasised “centuries of common history and strong bonds of friendship between the Turkish and Jewish people”.“Erdogan is one of the most pragmatic political figures around,” said Ross Wilson, a former US Ambassador to Ankara now at the Atlantic Council. “He will stake out tough if not extreme positions. and yet he will take other actions that advance his and Turkey’s interests and that is what he has done here: he has eased a big problem in US-Turkish relations that constrained President Obama’s ability to deal with Turkey sensibly and he has expanded the menu of possibilities on Syria for Turkey.”Nevertheless, few officials expect relations between the two governments to be warm, despite the move towards normal diplomatic ties.Relations between Turkey and Israel, which had hit a peak in the 1990s, have been on a downslide since Israel’s 2008-2009 military operation in the Gaza Strip. But the rift grew worse after the IDF’s 2010 storming of the Mavi Marmara.Turkey later withdrew all but junior diplomats from its embassy in Tel Aviv, a step Israel reciprocated in its embassy in Ankara. And just this month, Turkey upgraded its consul general in Jerusalem to the status of ambassador to the yet-to-be established Palestinian state.But Turkish diplomats have insisted in recent months that an apology would break the deadlock. Other demands by Mr Erdogan – such as the compensation Israel now suggests it is ready to pay and the alleviation of restrictions on Gaza – have been seen as more surmountable, diplomats say.Mr Erdogan has also demonstrated his ability to reposition himself on other fronts in recent months, most notably by giving the green light to talks with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party.
49;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2013-03-17T20:21:55Z;Gas in Cyprus – how much of a guarantee?;;The controversial bailout deal for Cyprus proposed by eurozone finance ministers has led President Nicos Anastasiades to promise investors who stay in the country after the compulsory forfeit of 9.9 per cent of their deposits that they will share in the country’s future wealth from natural gas.In return for the forfeit they will be given shares in the banks and what are described in press reports as ” equity returns, guaranteed by future natural gas revenues”.Whatever equity returns means, nothing can be guaranteed by future gas revenues at this stage. The facts are simple. Only one well has been drilled offshore Cyprus. The field identified – in Block 12 to the South East of the island – is said to contain perhaps 7 tcf of gas. But with only one well there can be no hard estimate. It could be more, but it could just as easily be less. Nor does anyone yet know what the cost of extraction will be.The head of Cyprus’ State Hydrocarbons Company – Charles Ellinas – said last week that Cyprus could have up to 40 tcf of gas within its exclusive economic zone. He talked about Cyprus exporting gas to Europe via an LNG terminal by 2019.Yes, and pigs might fly over Nicosia. No one will build an LNG terminal until someone drills more wells to confirm the existing find and several more successful wells on other blocks. The licensing round has barely begun, and interestingly Noble Energy, who drilled the first successful well, are not bidding for more acreage. That is a very odd decision if the company shares Mr Ellinas’ view that the area holds 40 tcf.Let’s say more gas is found in the next year or two. A major new greenfield LNG plant will take a minimum of seven or eight years to build. That means there will be no gas flowing to Europe before the early 2020s at best. That is a long time to wait for a guarantee.And then there is the small problem of Turkey which does not recognise the independence of Cyprus and which retains claims on the north of the island. To pass from one part of Cyprus to another you have to go through a checkpoint under the eyes of armed soldiers. Turkey has said it will not tolerate the development of gas in Cypriot waters.International investors, many of whom have significant interests in Turkey, do not take the threat lightly. In some countries, Turkish Ambassadors, on instructions from Ankara, have advised major companies to stay out of Cyprus. Quite a number have taken the hint and the list of applicants for licences in Cyrpus is pretty thin.Finding and developing any fields which are found will not be simple and will require some agreement between Cyprus and Turkey. Building a LNG facility will be costly (say $8bn) and heavily dependent on selling the gas into a secure market. The gas market in Europe is anything but secure and the existing players including Gazprom are not likely to roll over and allow Cypriot gas to take their market share. At best there will be fierce price competition.In short, the guarantee is worthless. Any revenue flow from Cypriot gas is a long way off and inherently uncertain. Indeed, the EU proposition which the Cypriots are due to vote on this week may make some players hesitate still further about investing. If ordinary depositors (who are hardly to blame for the current problems) suddenly find their assets shrinking what guarantee do energy investors have that anything they find will not be expropriated, or made subject to penal taxation rates to cover the country’s debt.The situation facing Cyprus is very difficult and a sign that the eurozone crisis is not over. But the solution proposed could make a bad situation worse, particularly if it is grounded in a false promise about guarantees provided by revenues from gas sales which owe more to hope than to present realities.
50;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2013-03-11T16:40:16Z;Producers eye export routes for Israeli gas;New cabinet to decide on level of natural gas exports;When Benjamin Netanyahu forms a new government in Israel in coming days, it will have a full agenda of pressing business, including plans to cut a growing budget deficit and to restart peace talks with the Palestinians.One of the new cabinet’s most highly anticipated policy decisions is how much of its vast offshore natural gas reserves it will export and how much it will reserve for domestic use.With Israel emerging as a regional energy power, the deliberations will be watched beyond its borders. Inside Israel two main investors in the sector are positioning themselves to export gas, possibly via new pipeline projects that could reshape the map of the eastern Mediterranean by deepening ties between Israel, Turkey and other states in the region.At present, the rift between Israel and Turkey remains a daunting obstacle – underscored recently when Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Zionism a “crime against humanity,” remarks Mr Netanyahu and US secretary of state John Kerry condemned.However, proponents of greater energy ties argue that tensions between the two countries could be overcome by mutual economic interest.Noble Energy and Delek Energy, shareholders in Israel’s two biggest gasfields, have been sounding out potential customers such as energy and chemical companies in Turkey and Jordan, which has seen its gas supplies from Egypt disrupted recently by sabotage attacks in the Sinai.“Gas sales to Israel’s neighbours are a distinct possibility and one we are committed to exploring,” says Noble Energy. However, it adds: “Until the government decides on an export policy and clarifies other regulatory matters, we are unable to mature these discussions.”Last year a committee set up to advise government on the gas reserves – among the largest offshore finds of their kind in the world – recommended that Israel export up to 500bn cubic meters of its gas and save at least 450bcm for domestic needs.Mr Netanyahu’s new government is expected to form its energy policy based on the findings of that report, which was submitted to the prime minister and energy minister late last year.At the same time, Israel’s anti-competition commissioner is examining a restraint of trade case brought against Noble and Delek over their control of the two biggest offshore fields found to date that could – depending on the watchdog’s decision – set back their investment plans.“We need certainty,” says one Israel-based energy executive. “We don’t want to invest then have the government change the rules.”The potential pay-off for Israel’s economy is big. The smaller of Israel’s two big gasfields, Tamar, which is due to begin production in April, will contribute a percentage point to Israel’s projected 3.8 per cent GDP growth this year.Leviathan, which is the industry’s biggest offshore gas discovery of the past decade and nearly twice the size of Tamar, will supply well in excess of the small Israeli market’s domestic needs.Noble and Delek are now exploring possible export routes to justify the big investment they will need to make to bring gas from the field to Israeli customers by 2016.The two companies have argued that as Israel generates more of its energy from gas, it will face a shortage by the middle of the decade if Leviathan is not developed. At the same time, they say they need to export to underwrite the project’s estimated $4bn cost, either in the form of liquefied natural gas or via a pipeline.Leviathan’s backers have mooted producing LNG – which they could sell profitably in Asia – onshore in Cyprus, Israel, or possibly even Jordan’s Aqaba free trade zone.As for pipelines, senior Israeli and Turkish officials have suggested that Turkey is the one market in the region large enough to make the business case for Israeli gas exports.Zorlu Holding, a Turkish company active in the Israeli energy sector, acknowledged recently that the issue of a pipeline with Israel had “come up” in its discussions, although it added that it had taken no formal initiative.But to go ahead, any Israeli-Turkish project would need to overcome two formidable problems: the deep political rift between the two countries and the question of finding a workable pipeline route in a region riven by diplomatic rivalries.Taner Yildiz, Turkey’s energy minister, said last week that before any pipeline project could go ahead, Israel would have to meet Ankara’s demands for redress over the 2010 storming of the Mavi Marmara, a ship trying to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip.Nine Turkish citizens died in the assault by the Israeli Defence Force, which took place on the high seas.While Ankara has set out three conditions – an apology, compensation and an end to the blockade, some Turkish officials suggest that the main sticking point is now the apology, since compensation is relatively straightforward and Israel is taking some steps to reduce Gaza’s isolation after last year’s military confrontation.Turkey says the fundamental decision rests with the Israeli coalition government being formed after last month’s election. Previously, Israel was reluctant to issue more than a statement of regret.In a possible sign of diplomatic movement, Israel this month supplied Turkey with military equipment for the first time since Turkey effectively froze relations over the Mavi Marmara storming, providing electronics for Awacs aircraft. But a Turkish official played down the step’s significance, arguing it was due to contractual obligations.Another question concerns the pipeline’s route, problematic because Israel remains officially at war with Lebanon and Syria, while Turkey has no diplomatic relations with Cyprus, which has discovered big gas reserves of its own.“The two options for running the pipe from Israel to Turkey are among the continental shelves, either of Cyprus or of Lebanon-Syria,” says Matthew Bryza, a former US ambassador to Azerbaijan. “Obviously, neither would be easy from a political perspective. But a pipe to Turkey makes lots more economic sense – including for Cypriot gas – than either liquid natural gas or a pipe to Greece.”
51;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-09-17T16:06:05Z;Falkland Oil’s discovery fails to boost shares;;The discovery of gas in a field to the east of the Falkland Islands has failed to boost shares in the Aim-quoted company paying for test drilling.Falkland Oil & Gas, which raised £48.5m at 43p in January to fund further exploration in blocks to the east and south of the islands in the South Atlantic, said on Monday that a well drilled at its Loligo prospect had encountered gas.But shares edged up just 0.25p to 70.5p as the well failed to discover signs of more lucrative oil or gas condensate.Tim Bushell, chief executive, said the well had demonstrated that Loligo was “a valid trap that contained gas bearings zones”, adding work would continue to assess the “potential and commercial viability of this discovery”.However FOGL, which has a 75 per cent stake in the well alongside minority partner Edison of Italy, has opted to switch the next test well from the Loligo prospect to an alternative geological target in deeper waters further east.The lacklustre results follows disappointment over this year’s drilling campaign by fellow Falkland explorer Borders & Southern, which had co-operated with FOGL in jointly hiring the Leiv Eiriksson rig to work in waters whose sovereignty is disputed with Argentina.Both are exploring blocks in basins to the south of the Sea Lion field where Rockhopper Exploration successfully drilled for oil in its own recent campaign.In April, shares in Borders & Southern Petroleum fell by nearly a third amid disappointment over the results of the first test well drilled at its Darwin prospect in a basin to the south of the Falkland Islands in spite of the detection of a “significant gas condensate discovery”.Shares in Borders & Southern fell sharply again in July after its second well of the year was abandoned amid technical difficulties amid some signs of gas but failure to find any oil.The Loligo well is the first drilled in FOGL’s blocks since 2010. Shares in the company hit a high of 267p in July that year amid high hopes that its Toroa well drilled in a joint venture with mining group BHP Billiton would strike oil. But shares then halved after it emerged it had drilled a dry well and BHP Billiton quit the joint venture in March last year amid persistent complaints from Argentina over drilling in Falklands waters.Since FOGL’s fundraising earlier this year, the company has strengthened its financing through the sale of minority stakes in its blocks to Edison in June and a further “farm out” agreement with Noble Energy agreed in August.In return for a 35 per cent stake in blocks excluding its Loligo and nearby Nimrod-Garrodia prospects, Noble has agreed to contribute up to $230m over the next three years towards further drilling in acreage currently controlled by FOGL.The company said on Monday that it expected its cash balances following completion of this year’s exploration campaign to be $200m or more.“With our partners Noble Energy and Edison, we have the technical resources and funding in place to carry out substantial 3D surveys, followed by further drilling in 2014,” said Mr Bushell.
52;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-09-02T16:16:03Z;Mediterranean playground for oil groups;;Best-known for sun, sea and sand, the Mediterranean has suddenly become a playground for the global oil industry.The Arab Spring, and a series of huge natural gas finds in the so-called Levantine basin have piqued interest in an area that barely made it on to oil companies’ radar a decade ago.Italy’s partial relaxation of a ban on offshore oil and gas drilling introduced in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster has also stimulated activity, with a clutch of companies now dusting off plans to drill in the Adriatic.Malta is the latest spot in the Mediterranean to debut on the oil map. Last month, Genel Energy, the oil company run by former BP chief executive Tony Hayward, said it had bought a stake in exploration blocks off the coast of Malta from AIM-quoted explorer Mediterranean Oil & Gas.Bill Higgs, MOG’s chief executive, says the revolutions that swept north Africa and the Middle East last year have encouraged companies to take a fresh look at the region. “There are a lot more opportunities than there were before the Arab Spring in places like Egypt, Libya and Tunisia,” he says.That was reflected in Egypt’s recent oil licensing round, which attracted a huge volume of bids. “I’ve seen a significant number of international oil companies looking to consolidate their position in Egypt and Libya and new entrants coming in,” says John Conlin, an energy lawyer at Norton Rose.But it was the big finds in the eastern Mediterranean that fundamentally changed the industry’s view of the region. Since 2009, some 35tn cubic feet of gas – roughly half of Canada’s total reserves – have been discovered in the deep waters off Israel and Cyprus, much of it by the US independent Noble Energy. One of the fields, Israel’s Leviathan, which was discovered in 2010, was the world’s largest deepwater gas find in a decade.The US Geological Survey estimates the Levantine Basin, a subsea area which runs from Egypt north to Turkey, contains 1.7bn barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and 122tn cubic feet of gas – a massive prize. Leviathan, and the Aphrodite find in Cyprus last year, seemed to confirm the optimism.“Those discoveries really invigorated interest in the Med,” says Brian O’Cathain, chief executive of AIM-quoted explorer Petroceltic, which has interests offshore Italy. “An area that wasn’t considered prospective was found to have huge amounts of gas.”For Genel, the deal with MOG is a bet that offshore Malta will prove as rich in hydrocarbons as nearby Libya. Mr Hayward knows Libya well, having spent months negotiating BP’s famous $900m exploration deal with the Gaddafi regime in 2007. In an interview last month, he said Malta was an extension of Libya’s Sirte basin, one of the world’s great oil-producing areas. Malta’s waters had “significant exploration potential”, he said.While Malta remains a frontier play, other countries like Cyprus are now well-established in the oil and gas universe. The island’s second licensing round this year attracted bids from 15 companies, ranging from supermajors like France’s Total SA to smaller explorers like Cairn Energy, for nine offshore blocks. By contrast, its first licensing round in 2007, barely noted by the industry, resulted in only once licence being issued – to Noble.Meanwhile, prospects have also perked up in Italy, which last month eased its ban on oil drilling in coastal waters. The restrictions still apply for new projects, but all ventures that were up and running before the Gulf of Mexico oil spill can now proceed. Mr O’Cathain of Petroceltic says the company will resume drilling next year, pending the necessary environmental permits.Spain is also attracting interest. Cairn has plans to drill in the Valencia Basin off the eastern Spanish coast in 2014. It will also submit bids for an offshore licensing round in Lebanon next year.Yet the Mediterranean is not a walk in the park. Explorers venturing into its waters risk getting caught up in a complex web of regional squabbles and rivalries. Turkey has repeatedly told oil companies to stay away from Greek Cypriot waters. Last year, Italy protested against Malta’s publication of a tender for oil and gas exploration covering parts of the Ionian Sea claimed by Rome. Malta itself is in dispute with Libya over offshore areas further to the south. And Israel and Lebanon have sparred over Leviathan, which is close to the disputed line separating their territorial waters. Hizbollah, the radical Shia group, has accused Israel of stealing Lebanese gas.However, MOG’s Mr Higgs dismisses the geopolitical dangers. The Mediterranean is “proving to be a place with relatively low political risk, especially on the European side”, he says.
53;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-08-19T16:23:32Z;Sagi’s Genesis Energy set for Aim float;;Teddy Sagi, the Israeli billionaire who founded and owns almost half of online gaming group Playtech, is poised to float his second company in London with an initial public offering of Genesis Energy.The Middle East focused gas explorer, which is 40 per cent owned by Mr Sagi, hopes to raise $90m-$120m through the IPO, valuing the group’s equity at as much as £500m.Genesis Energy has mandated Canaccord Genuity to handle the IPO and a roadshow is expected to be held in the next few weeks. The company hopes to join Aim, London’s junior market, in the third quarter of 2012.The gas explorer declined to comment on the IPO, other than to say that arrangements for the London listing were at a preliminary stage.If successful, the IPO would be the largest on Aim this year, beating the £17m raised in May by Incadea, a German-based provider of software for car dealerships.However, the environment for Aim IPOs has been tough of late, with Alufer Mining recently aborting plans for a $40m fundraising and Rare Earths Global of China only managing to raise $10m, compared with an initial upper target of $50m.Genesis Energy, which is also backed by the Israel Opportunity Fund, the investment group, holds interests in seven offshore licences in the Levantine Basin in the Mediterranean Sea between Cyprus and Israel.The eastern Mediterranean caught the energy world’s attention in 2010 when Noble Energy, a Texan company, announced that the Leviathan field, adjacent to Aphrodite and lying in Israeli waters, contained significant hydrocarbon reserves.According to the US Geological Survey, the natural gas deposits in the Levant Basin – a region adjoining Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon and Syria – may contain as much as 120tn cubic feet of recoverable gas, equivalent to 20bn barrels of oil.However, the discovery of such vast reserves has led to political squabbling between the region’s powers, with Israel and Cyprus already staking their claims in an effort to cut their reliance on gas imports.Mr Sagi, a flamboyant figure in the business world, brought Isle of Man-based Playtech to market in March 2006 when the online gaming group joined Aim at 257p per share, raising about £265m gross.In June, Playtech agreed to pay Mr Sagi nearly £5.6m per year for the licences to use software for online social gaming and traditional gambling activities such as online casino, poker and bingo.Late last year, Mr Sagi raised his shareholding in the online gambling software provider to 43.7 per cent after underwriting a £100m Playtech share placing to fund new acquisitions.
54;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-08-17T12:52:39Z;Sierra Leone marries up oil block bidders;;"When Sierra Leone’s Petroleum Resources Unit (PRU) named provisional winners of eight offshore oil blocks last month, it teamed various bidders together for four of the blocks, telling them to move forward as partners in negotiations. The companies had no say in the matter.“It is like a forced marriage,” said Adekunle King, legal officer for the PRU.The interest in Sierra Leone exploration was sparked by Texas-based Anadarko Petroleum. In 2010 it announced a big find of high quality light, sweet crude off the shores of the west African nation. Russia’s Lukoil opened an office in Sierra Leone in April, and said it would spend $100m on exploration of a previously acquired block.King said the nation’s Petroleum Act of 2011 states the government may grant a petroleum license to two or more companies that offered favorable terms, following a fair and transparent process. That’s why the committee paired up companies bidding on the blocks without their input, he explained.“Companies truly interested in our agenda will find a way to work with each other,” he said.According to the government statement announcing the awards, the blocks to where bidders have been required to team up are as follows:Australia-listed oil explorer African Petroleum and US-listed Kosmos Energy have both been provisionally awarded block 4a.Signet Petroleum, an exploration and production company with offices in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, Minexco Petroleum, an unlisted UK-based junior oil explorer with operations in Africa and South America, and Sierra Leone-based Elinilto (SL) received block 7a.US-listed Noble Energy, Chevron Sahara and UK-based exploration firm Odyewere awarded blocks 8a and 8b.While this kind of “forced” pairing is uncommon, it’s not a barrier to the exploration and development of the blocks, said a Renaissance Capital oil and gas industry analyst. These kinds of pairings can happen when the government wants a major oil company to come in but it has already assigned a block to a smaller company, and officials tend to “suggest” partnerships.In other instances, the government can assign the full block to a company, but then reserve the right to assign a portion of the project to a third party; the main company doesn’t have a say in who the third party would be, the analyst explained.Typically, the operator of the block gets a majority stake, but can always sell or look for farm-in partners. In the Sierra Leone situation, companies are likely to find a way to work together in order to get the deal signed, then look to buy out some of their partners.There could be some legal wrangling over signing fees paid to the government, according to a person involved in the process. Each bidder proposed closing fees based on receiving 100 per cent of the block, so they could potentially argue that the fees be slashed since the block is being shared.It’s unlikely the companies will say anything about the process publicly prior to having a deal finalised by the government, for fear of souring relations. The companies contacted declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.Related reading:

55;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-08-06T17:10:33Z;Falkland Oil in farm-out deal with Noble;;Falkland Oil & Gas, the Aim-traded explorer, has clinched a deal with Noble Energy of the US that it says will strengthen its balance sheet and help fund the next phase of its drilling programme.FOGL is looking for oil and gas off the coast of the Falklands Islands and chief executive Tim Bushell said talks with potential investors started last August. “Given the precarious nature of equity markets we decided we needed an equity partner to help finance our future.”Noble will take 35 per cent stakes in FOGL’s Northern Area Licences and Southern Area Licences, excluding the Loligo and Nimrod-Garrodia prospects, and will become the operator of the drilling programmes during 2013 and 2014.In return Noble will fund 60 per cent of the first two wells and pay $25m in cash to FOGL, a total investment of between $180m and $230m over the next three years.Mr Bushell said Noble’s funding commitment meant FOGL would end the year with $200m on its balance sheet compared with $100m as expected.FOGL signed a similar “farm-out” agreement in March with Edison, the Italian energy group recently taken over by France’s EDF.Keith Morris, oil analyst at Investec, said Noble had more expertise than Edison in frontier oil exploration and was therefore “a more mainstream partner” for FOGL, and that terms of the deal were in line with market expectations.Houston-based Noble’s portfolio includes oil and gas fields in west Africa, the eastern Mediterranean and the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. It is the first US company to join the new wave of Falklands oil exploration, after Amerada Hess left the region in the 1990s.Mr Bushell said doubts about the commercial viability of oil production in the Falklands, because of its remote location, were “a red herring” as shipping costs for oil are relatively low. He said the biggest challenge was the cost of extracting oil and gas from such deep waters, and in harsh weather conditions similar to the North Sea.Mr Morris at Investec said much more drilling was needed in the Falklands to determine whether it would be a significant oil producer. “It is a huge area, it requires a lot of exploration to ascertain whether there’s anything there or not.”The companies looking for oil and gas in the region have had mixed fortunes in recent months. Last month Premier Oil, the UK oil group, agreed to buy 60 per cent of the assets of Aim-quoted Rockhopper Exploration, attracted by the potential of its Sea Lion discovery.But shares in Borders & Southern Petroleum fell sharply last month after it failed to find commercial quantities of gas at its Stebbing prospect.Shares in Falkland Oil & Gas rose 12.3 per cent on Monday to 84.25p, while Noble Energy’s shares fell 0.4 per cent to $87.34.
56;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-08-06T13:38:29Z;Falkland oil – drilling for profit;Early-stage investors struggle to reap value;"Every time the oil and gas industry conquers its last frontier, a new one hoves into view. The waters around the Falkland Islands are the latest to attract the sector. Monday’s deal by Noble Energy of the US to invest in Falkland Oil & Gas’s licence to explore 40,000 square kilometres of South Atlantic waters shows that Biggish Oil thinks the area is worth a punt. As Rockhopper’s discovery of the Sea Lion field demonstrates there is oil around the Falklands; how much is anyone’s guess. But investors in the handful of London-listed exploration companies working down there are having a bumpy ride.Noble is taking a 35 per cent stake in Falkland Oil’s exploration licence in the waters to the south and east of the islands and will become the operator. With a market capitalisation of $15bn, it is huge relative to the minnows doing the legwork. Noble’s arrival also follows Premier Oil, which farmed in to the Sea Lion field alongside Rockhopper last month in a deal worth up to $1bn.That is politically risky stuff. Argentina claims that all the activity in Falklands waters is illegal; it has warned explorers and their advisers that it is ready to sue. There are suggestions that the risks may be less in Noble’s case because it is a US company. But Argentina’s expropriation of Repsol’s YPF assets by the government of President Cristina Fernández suggests that view may be too complacent.The more immediate concern for early-stage investors in Falklands exploration, however, is ensuring that they reap the value. Shares of Falkland Oil jumped 13 per cent after the Noble announcement and are at a year-to-date high. But Rockhopper shares have tumbled 20 per cent since the Premier deal; some investors wanted a full takeover. Spare a thought, too, for shareholders in Borders & Southern: its shares are down 70 per cent since disappointing drilling news a month ago.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
57;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-07-30T18:51:31Z;Gazprom: Ecuador’s new petro-amigo;;"Amistad is a nice word. It means friendship in Spanish. Now it seems Ecuador has found a new friend for its oil sector: Russia’s Gazprom.The Ecuadorean government has signed a “memorandum of understanding” with the energy giant to explore the Amistad natural-gas field in the Gulf of Guayaquil, in the coastal south of the country. “Gazprom wants to explore natural gas in all offshore available areas,” Jorge Glas, Ecuador’s minister of strategic sectors, said late last week.Ecuador is a tempting destination for Gazprom, as it currently produces around 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day, part of which goes to China.Besides, its hydrocarbons sector has been scaring more ‘traditional’ energy investors lately. A local unit of US-based Noble Energy formerly ran Amistad, but Ecuador’s state-run Petroecuador took it over in 2010 after the company refused to change its production-sharing contract to a new service agreement. Most recently, and after reviewing the case once again, a court in the Andean country said oil-titan Chevron must pay $19bn for environmental damages in the Amazon region.According to Glas, Ecuador has turned to Gazprom International “because we are aware of the [company's] production potential and professional experience.” Yet he also made the point clear in a recent visit to Moscow that cooperation with Gazprom was consistent with the policies of Ecuador’s leadership, which is “seeking to strengthen relations with the Russian Federation.”This is not the first regional move by Gazprom to set foot in a left-leaning South American country, having struck deals in Bolivia and Venezuela.For Carlos López, a South American energy consultant, the word amistad seems to cover all manner of sins here. “Gazprom’s oil exploration agreements signed with Venezuela, Bolivia and, now Ecuador give these so-called ‘Bolivarian’, anti-American regimes, a much needed political boost in light of their flagging oil and gas industries and the drought of much needed investment in those industries,” he explains.According to López, this also provides Gazprom with a foothold in energy-rich countries, “on preferential and extremely favourable terms … Gazprom’s dual essence as a mostly state-owned gas company and as a Russian government geopolitical tool must not go unnoticed here.”But the Russians are not Ecuador’s only petro-amigos. The government of Rafael Correa recently announced it would purchase $400m worth of oil from Iran, in defiance of sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic. And they are also in talks with China’s CNPC over a potential investment in a $12.5bn refinery project, called Pacífico.The Pacífico refinery is already a joint venture between Petroecuador and its unconditional ally, Venezuela’s PDVS, which shows that despite having new ones, old friends never die.Related reading:

58;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-05-18T18:28:12Z;Turkey: sabre-rattling over Cyprus gas;;"The old adage that oil or gas always adds fuel to an international dispute is being revived on the divided island of Cyprus.The discovery last year by US-based Noble Energy of a major gas field in an area of the Mediterranean in Cyprus’s exclusive economic zone has predictably prompted a wave of interest from big oil and gas groups.And, equally predictably, it has brought warnings from Turkey about possible reprisals against those who do business with the internationally-recognised Republic of Cyprus, which is licensing new offshore acreage.This is only the latest of many confrontations in the 38 years since a Turkish invasion split Cyprus into two states – the Republic of Cyprus, that is now an EU member, and the isolated Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (TRNC) that controls the north of the island and is recognised only by Turkey.Now Ankara is annoyed at the enthusiastic response to the Republic of Cyprus’s second licensing round from 15 companies and consortia hoping to join Noble Energy in what could be be a gas bonanza.A statement issued on the internet site of the Turkish foreign ministry invited the bidders to “act with common sense” and withdraw from the tender, warning that they risked both being responsible for escalating regional tensions and being excluded from energy projects in Turkey.Whether Turkey can deliver on the latter threat is moot.The 15 bidders include a subsidiary of Gazprom – which supplies roughly two thirds of the gas Turkey imports and Italy’s Eni which in partnership with Gazprom owns Turkey’s biggest gas supply line, holds a stake in Turkey’s largest oil pipeline and is planning to build a second oil line across Turkey in partnership with Turkey’s Calik group whose CEO is the son-in-law of Turkish prime minister Tayyip Erdogan.Which is not to say that Turkey’s isn’t serious about Cyprus. As the foreign ministry statement points out Turkey has long protested that any natural resources belonging to the island should be exploited for the benefit of both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities.Last year Ankara protested long and hard against the commencement of drilling by Noble, warning that it threatened to derail talks between the two Cypriot republics aimed at cementing a re-unification deal before Cyprus takes on the EU presidency in July.As predicted, the talks failed to broker an agreement despite being billed as a “last chance for reunification” with many pointing to Cyprus’s new-found energy self-sufficiency as offering little incentive to compromise.Self-sufficiency in energy is one thing but the reserves of the Noble field are now estimated at over 900bn cubic metres – enough to supply the island for several centuries and leave as much again available for export.For Cyprus it raises a further difficult proposition – how to get the gas to European markets. Exporting as LNG is the obvious solution but is also highly wasteful with each shipload of liquefied gas requiring an equivalent volume of gas to be burned.Not the solution of choice for a carbon-conscious EU.Far better to export by pipeline but with the only logical route for a line being via Turkey, both the Cypriot government and the companies bidding to prospect would do well to think ahead.It’s one thing to have the gas, but another entirely to get it to market.Related reading

59;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2012-03-14T20:32:03Z;US oil producers fight pipeline request;;North American oil producers are squaring up to a pipeline venture over a project that could ease dislocations in crude markets.At issue is the reversal of the Seaway pipeline to run from the oversupplied central US to refineries near the Gulf of Mexico.Enbridge and Enterprise Products Partners, Seaway’s owners, have sought authority to charge what the market will bear when the pipeline starts flowing north to south.Industry groups including the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and the Independent Petroleum Association of America, and companies including Chevron, Continental Resources, Noble Energy and Canada’s Suncor Energy, are fighting the request.They argue that the pipeline will not face enough competition for rates to be unregulated.The 500-mile Seaway pipeline is important because it would be the first to link expanding supplies at the trading hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, to the global oil market.Stocks at Cushing last week swelled to 38.7m barrels, the highest since June 2011, after production rises in the US and Canada.The high stocks have weighed on US oil prices, eroding profits for regional producers. Nymex April West Texas Intermediate settled at $105.43 a barrel on Wednesday, down $1.28. ICE April Brent was at $124.97, down $1.25.Oil shippers welcome the reversal but want rates overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the US agency weighing the application for market-based rates.The Independent Petroleum Association of America “is interested in Seaway because the reversed flow from Cushing to the Gulf gives the pipeline the potential to alleviate some of the congestion around Cushing to get crude oil to refineries”, said Susan Ginsberg, vice-president. “However, the benefits of the reversed flow could be taken away if Seaway is granted the authority to charge market-based rates.”When Seaway pumped crude north, rates were regulated and no more than $1.10 a barrel, FERC said.Enbridge and Enterprise have not disclosed how much they hope to charge shippers. The pipeline would at first carry 150,000 barrels a day with room for expansion to about 375,000 b/d by early 2013, according to a regulatory filing.Already, oil traders have been moving crude by train, barge and truck from the central US to the Gulf. Prices range from $5 a barrel by rail to as much as $24 a barrel by truck.TransCanada, another pipeline operator, has also recently proposed a leg of its controversial Keystone XL pipeline to run from Cushing to Texas, creating competition for Seaway.“In sum, Seaway will lack market power in both the proposed origin and destination markets, and protestants fail to raise any issue of material fact to the contrary,” the pipeline companies said in a regulatory filing last month.

With just two trading days left in 2011, the benchmark US index is down 0.6 per cent for the year, and is set to end December, historically one of the best months of the year, a mere 0.2 per cent higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 12,151.41 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.3 per cent to 2,589.98.Energy and material stocks fell the most as the price of oil fell for the first time in seven days.Oil explorers Nabors Industries and Chesapeake Energy dropped 4.1 per cent to $17.41 and 3.7 per cent to $22.66 respectively.Investors in refiners, which see margins squeezed when the price of crude oil inputs rise faster than petroleum prices, appeared to catch on to the fact that the price of crude is back up around the $100 a barrel mark. Tesoro fell 4.2 per cent to $23.07 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 and Valero Energy was off 2.3 per cent to $20.77.In the materials sector Californian rare earth metal miner Molycorp fell 14.1 per cent to $24.04, after the Chinese government raised its export quota for rare earths, putting downward pressure on prices.The S&P 500’s financial sector fell 1.6 per cent, with Bank of America off 3.6 per cent to $5.29 and Citigroup off 2.9 per cent to $26.13.Whirlpool, the dishwasher manufacturer, fell 0.6 per cent to $46.37. Shares had slumped more than 8 per cent on Tuesday, as investors feared the worst after Sears Holdings, whose outlets stock Whirlpool products, announced it would close up to 120 stores due to poor sales of consumer electronic goods.Sears Holdings shares also fell another 0.2 per cent to $33.33 after their 25 per cent fall on Tuesday, as analysts responded to the announced store closures.“While the company announced a series of measures to sustain cash flow, we do not see how they dig out of these problems,” said Gary Balter, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse.Mr Balter highlighted the company’s resort to bank borrowing lines at a time when retailers see high cash flow from holiday spending, and told clients, “one wonders if vendors begin to worry about their own exposure.”Data from Bloomberg on Wednesday suggested initial public offerings on US exchanges by internet businesses next year may raise $11bn, with Facebook expected to deliver the largest-ever internet IPO.But separate data from Birinyi Associates showed that the 19 internet and social media companies which debuted on US exchanges this year have generally delivered poor returns to investors.While the $6.2bn raised by internet and social media IPOs in 2011 was the third-highest ever, only trailing the $15.9bn raised in 1999 and $9.6bn in 2000, the majority of those companies are currently trading below their debut price.At the close last Friday, this year’s internet IPOs were on average 17.5 per cent below their IPO price compared to a 0.4 per cent decline for all other IPOs.Once first trading day jumps are factored out, new internet stocks have fared even worse. Investors who bought internet stocks at the open on their first day of trading had seen share prices fall an average of 37.5 per cent by the close last Friday, against an average loss on all other IPOs of 14.6 per cent, according to Birinyi.Of those 19 internet IPO stocks, 84 per cent were trading below their debut price at the close last Friday compared to 69 per cent for all the other IPOs this year.The trend continued yesterday with recent IPO stocks continuing to show softness.Social game developer Zynga was down 2.6 per cent to $9.50 yesterday, 50 cents beneath its launch price two weeks after its debut. LinkedIn was off 1.8 per cent to $61.73. The market capitalisation of the professional networking website has fallen by more than one-third since the start of August, although it remains well above its $45 debut price. Groupon fell 1.9 per cent to $22.62.“[Internet IPOs] have created trading opportunities in the short term, but if you are not allocated shares at the IPO price, buying in the open market on the first day of trading with the intent of holding the stock has not been a profitable strategy,” said Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi.
61;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

The technology-heavy index fell 1 per cent to 2,577.97.Research In Motion was one of the few bright spots, climbing 10.1 per cent to $13.78 on hopes that it could be an acquisition target after reports that Yahoo had considered a bid for the BlackBerry handset manufacturer.RIM’s market capitalisation has fallen 75 per cent this year due to poor sales of its PlayBook tablet
and a failure of its BlackBerry network but analysts said the share price may fall further before a buy-out.“We expect to see further pressure on RIM’s share price,” said Stuart Jeffrey at Nomura. “While we believe that RIM shares could be worth $15 in a gradual wind-down scenario, we don’t see financial buyers bidding until the stock falls below $10.”Shares in Yahoo itself were on the move too, climbing 5.9 per cent to $15.99 late in the day on reports the internet portal will sell Alibaba Group and its Japanese affiliate back to their majority holders in a deal that could be worth $17bn.Tech stocks also weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended the day flat at 12,107.74, with IBM off 3.1 per cent to $181.47 and Cisco Systems down 2.7 per cent to $17.92.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2 per cent to 1,243.72, turning positive late in the day, despite Moody’s warning of a possible downgrade to US sovereign debt in 2012.The S&P 500 had opened lower as European nerves returned, after strong demand from the continent’s banks for three-year loans from the European Central Bank.US bank stocks also reversed early losses to close in positive territory, with Bank of America up 1.2 per cent to $5.23.Oil producers showed firmness as the price of crude oil edged up for a second day, nearing $100 a barrel, after falling as low as $94 last week. Among the smaller explorers, Noble Energy was up 1.9 per cent to $94.56 while, among the majors, ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $83.12.Cintas Corp rose 9.3 per cent to $34.19 for the best performance in the S&P 500. The provider of bathroom supplies and entrance mats raised its fiscal year 2012 profit forecast to at least $2.16 a share, 13 cents higher than expected.Nike climbed 2.9 per cent to $96.35 after the world’s largest sports goods company reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates by 12 per cent on strong North American sales.Walgreen shares tumbled more than 5 per cent in early trading after the pharmacy missed earnings estimates on declining market share, but shares recovered to close down just 0.4 per cent to $33.37.Rival CVS Caremark ticked up another 1.7 per cent to $40.46 after surging 9 per cent on Tuesday, as it raised its dividend.The CBOE’s Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 fell to its lowest level since the start of August, closing at 21.63. It had consistently traded above 30 from August through November."
63;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-12-06T00:28:06Z;Wells Fargo sells $1.5bn of unsecured debt;;Wells Fargo, the largest US bank by market value, has sold $1.5bn of five-year senior unsecured notes at 175 basis points over comparable Treasuries, underscoring the ability of US banks to secure funding at a time when their European competitors are struggling to raise money.US banks’ cost of funds last quarter dropped 20bp from last year to 0.7 per cent, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a US bank regulator, the lowest quarterly figure recorded in data going back to 1984.The spread between US bank debt and comparable Treasury securities stood at 386bp as of Friday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. European bank spreads were at 434bp over government securities.However, because US banks are sitting on a record $10tn in deposits, they have only raised $106bn in debt this year, according to Dealogic. About $14bn of that has come in the past four months. European banks have issued more than $659bn in debt this year.“US banks have been virtually nonexistent in funding markets, not because they don’t have access but because they have more money than they know what to do with,” one senior banker said.Over the summer, spreads on European bank debt were narrower than those of their US counterparts as US banks suffered from the aftershocks of a US fiscal debate that ultimately led to a credit downgrade of US sovereign debt. But the eurozone debt crisis has changed that.Wells Fargo’s notes were issued at a higher spread than its previous five-year debt offering in March last year. But the spread was narrower than that of other large US banks. The offering came a week after the San Francisco lender’s debt was downgraded by Standard & Poor’s.Wells issued the debt on Monday with a 2.625 per cent coupon, bringing down its borrowing costs from March 2010, when the lender last issued five-year debt in 3.625 per cent notes.“Of the four largest US banks, we are most impressed with Wells from a credit perspective,” said Jim Leonard, bank credit analyst at Morningstar. “Wells Fargo has a clear funding cost advantage, as low-cost deposits fund its entire loan book and approximately 75 per cent of its earnings assets.”Mr Leonard said Wells’s notes are priced “significantly tighter” than JPMorgan Chase’s five-year notes, which trade at about 220bp over Treasuries, he added.John Stumpf, Wells chief executive, is today expected to address investors at a Goldman Sachs banking conference.The Wells issuance was one of Monday’s largest deals. Duke Energy, Tencent Holdings and Noble Energy were among the companies that issued debt. Companies were expected to sell more than $9.6bn of bonds as of Monday’s close, the largest amount since November 14.
64;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-12-05T22:45:37Z;Rebound spurs $10bn of corporate bond issues;;Companies were expected to sell more than $9.6bn of bonds on Monday as issuers including Wells Fargo, the US largest home lender, took advantage of the past week’s market rally, which brought down borrowing costs and helped boost appetite for riskier assets.As of late afternoon in New York, companies had already priced about half of the day’s expected total, making it the busiest day for US investment-grade issuers since November 14, when $10.24bn worth of investment-grade debt was sold. That level is still far from the $17.6bn mark reached on January 4, according to data compiled by Dealogic.With fewer than 20 business days left in 2011, more issuers may sell debt this week to take advantage of lower borrowing costs.Duke Energy, Tencent Holdings and Noble Energy were among the companies that issued debt earlier in Monday’s session.US corporate and junk bond markets have slowly rebounded from the lows hit in early October when fears about Europe’s debt crisis intensified. Global markets extended last week’s gains on Monday and government bond yields fell sharply in both the US and Europe.As of the start of the month, total corporate debt issuance in the US stood flat at about $1,000bn versus 2010, according to data from Standard & Poor’s. In recent months, volatility in the financial markets had kept many corporate issuers on the sidelines. This has been compounded by so-called blackout periods, when companies cannot sell debt close to their earnings announcements, resulting in a significant backlog of bond deals as the end of the year approaches. A syndicate executive at one large bank said he expects up to $15bn in issuance in the US investment-grade debt market alone this week.“With the end of the year and the holidays approaching, the calendar [for issuance] is very limited. Companies may take the opportunity now to come to markets,” said Richard Peterson, director of markets at Standard & Poor’s.In one of the largest deals on Monday, Wells Fargo sold $1.5bn of 2.625 per cent unsecured five-year notes, at 175 basis points over comparable Treasuries. The San Francisco-based home lender last issued five-year debt in March 2010, when it offered $1.25bn in 3.625 per cent notes, to yield 123bp over Treasuries, according to Bloomberg data.Monday’s sale came one week after S&P downgraded the bank from double A minus to A plus, based on the rating agency’s revised bank criteria.

It extends almost 1,770km (1,100 miles) from Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital, through Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, and through Turkey to Ceyhan on the Mediterranean coast.But for Turkish policymakers, the August 2008 bombing was a stark reminder that security challenges form an essential component of Turkish energy policy as the nation seeks to live up to its self-proclaimed image as the region’s most important place energy transit.Turkey buys almost all its oil and gas from abroad, and its fast-growing economy is sure to require ever larger volumes of imports over the next decade.At the same time, it lies at the crossroads of the supply routes that connect Russian, Caspian and central Asian producers with consumers in western, eastern and southern Europe.Annual energy transit fees provide Turkey with a tidy sum of money that would be at risk if oil flows were interrupted by domestic terrorism or regional conflicts, such as the 2008 Russian-Georgian war.The interconnection be­tween the country’s domestic energy needs and its role in hydrocarbons transit was well illustrated in a landmark agreement signed in October by the Turkish and Azerbaijani governments.Under this accord, Turkey committed itself to buying up to 6bn cu m of gas from Azerbaijan by 2017 and to facilitating the flow of another 10bn cu m through its pipelines to markets in Europe.This deal is important because it highlights Azerbaijan’s potential as an alternative to Gazprom, the state-dominated Russian company, which at present is the main gas supplier to Turkey and a number of European Union countries.Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz gas field, in the Caspian Sea 70km south-east of Baku, is one of the world’s largest gas development projects. When the field’s second unit comes fully on-stream in 2016, Shah Deniz is expected to produce about 25bn cu m of gas a year.But one big question remains unanswered: which pipeline will the consortium that controls Shah Deniz use to deliver gas to Turkey and Europe? For the past decade EU governments have pinned their hopes on Nabucco, a project whose partners include Austria’s OMV, RWE of Germany and Botas of Turkey.Delays, cost overruns and an inability to nail supply deals have plagued Nabucco from the start. According to Günther Oettinger, the EU’s energy commissioner, the project may end up costing €10bn-€14bn ($13.6bn-$19bn) rather than the originally estimated €7.9bn.But the strategic imperative – as EU governments see it – of reducing dependence on Russian gas, is such that they are keen to make Nabucco work.Moreover, the project should receive a boost from Germany’s decision this year to abandon nuclear power once and for all, as well as from an Italian referendum that rejected the Berlusconi government’s plans to resume atomic energy production.When some of the EU’s biggest economies spurn nuclear power, gas delivered through Turkey becomes an even more vital part of the European energy mix.From Turkey’s perspective, Nabucco is just one of several possibilities. A second project, known as the Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy (ITGI), would link Azerbaijan to these three countries.Because much of the necessary infrastructure is already in place, the cost of ITGI is put at only €1.25bn and the project is expected to be completed by 2015.A third project, the €1.5bn Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), would carry Azerbaijani gas through Turkey to Greece, Albania and southern Italy. Meanwhile, the Russian-backed South Stream project envisages the flow of Russian gas to international markets through Turkish territorial waters in the Black Sea.For Turkey, none of these options presents a political and security challenge of the type contained in Cyprus’s decision in September to drill for gas in the eastern Mediterranean.The exploration is being conducted by Noble Energy, a Texan company, in waters that are internationally recognised as belonging to the Greek Cypriot-controlled government of Cyprus. A potential bonanza awaits Cyprus, for an adjacent Israeli gas field was last year discovered to hold abundant reserves.Turkey says the Cypriot government has no right to drill for gas on behalf of an island that, since 1974, has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and a Turkish Cypriot north.But Ankara knows it has little support from other countries for its view. This may explain why, in spite of some aggressive-sounding rhetoric, Turkey’s response has been fairly restrained.The Turks despatched the Piri Reis, an exploration vessel, to an area close to the Cypriot drilling, but not so close as to provoke a diplomatic or military incident.Even so, EU diplomats suspect the the discovery of further gas riches in the eastern Mediterranean, coupled with the lack of a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem, would draw a more robust response from Turkey.
66;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-11-16T17:35:59Z;Turkey hopes for Shell exploration deal;;Turkey said it hopes to conclude an exploration deal with Royal Dutch Shell in the coming days, a move that would intensify the scramble for energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean.“Next week we will sign [deals] for exploring oil and natural gas both on the ground and under the sea with Shell,” said Taner Yildiz, Ankara’s energy minister, in response to reports that an agreement had been reached to drill in the Mediterranean off the coastal city of Antalya.Shell declined to confirm that agreement had been reached. “We review our growth portfolio on a regular basis,” said the company. “We are continuously looking at opportunities worldwide.”But a Turkish energy official told the FT the deal had been reached with TPAO, the country’s state-owned oil and gas company. “We plan to have the signing ceremony next week in Ankara,” the official said. “First they will do the seismic search and, according to the results, will start exploration”.The exploration may be more significant for Turkey, which is greatly dependent on outside supplies of energy, than it is for Shell. Ankara expects its energy import bill this year to total some $50bn, accounting for two-thirds of its current account deficit.A joint bid to explore the area for oil and gas reserves would be only the latest signal of interest, by companies and countries alike, in hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Such resources could both increase energy self-sufficiency in the region and supply European markets.Last year the US Geological Survey estimated the eastern Mediterranean area known as the Levant Basin, which encompasses Israeli, Lebanese, Syrian and Cypriot waters, could contain about 122 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered reserves of natural gas. By comparison, Algeria, a critical supplier of natural gas supply to Europe, contains 159 tcf of proved reservesNoble Energy, a US group, has already begun exploratory drilling for both Israel and Cyprus, and the two countries have deepened co-operation after agreeing their common maritime border.Turkey, which is estranged from Israel and has no diplomatic relations with Cyprus, has been angered by such moves and has vowed to step up its own presence in the eastern Mediterranean.However, Turkey has limited maritime territory, partly because many of Greece’s islands are relatively close to the Turkish coast. Turkey has also announced exploratory drilling of its own close to Cyprus, by agreement with the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.But since the Turkish Cypriot government is not internationally recognised, it is far from clear to what extent energy companies will be interested by such exploration.
67;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-10-25T15:49:53Z;Prospect of offshore gas lifts Cypriot spirits;;After its most traumatic year since the 1974 Turkish military invasion, Cyprus is bubbling with excitement at the prospect of offshore gas riches so abundant that they will guarantee prosperity for generations to come.Not one cubic metre of recoverable gas has yet been found in the Aphrodite field off Cyprus’s southern coast where Noble Energy, a Texan firm, began exploratory drilling last month.But for a small country which lost more than half its electricity supply in July when an explosion destroyed its largest power station, and which turned to Russia this month for a €2.5bn emergency loan to protect its public finances, visions of stupendous energy wealth are irresistibly attractive.As a result, the government of Cyprus is already examining the multibillion-dollar sovereign wealth funds of Norway and Qatar for ideas on how to operate an investment fund of its own, if and when the cash comes rolling in. “There’s a climate of euphoria in Cyprus,” confesses Praxoula Antoniadou, the island state’s industry minister.The eastern Mediterranean caught the energy world’s attention last year when Noble announced that the Leviathan field, adjacent to Aphrodite and lying in Israeli waters, contained reserves so large that they held the potential to turn Israel into a gas-exporting nation.According to the US Geological Survey, the Levant Basin, adjoining Cyprus, Gaza, Israel, Lebanon and Syria, may contain as much as 122,000bn cubic feet of recoverable gas, equivalent to 20bn barrels of oil.The first indications of hydrocarbon reserves in what Cyprus terms its “exclusive economic zone” are expected in early to mid-December, Ms Antoniadou told a conference this month in the coastal resort of Limassol.She promised that any wealth would be shared fairly between the Greek Cypriot population of the island’s south and the Turkish Cypriots of the north, whose breakaway state is recognised by no country other than Turkey.Turkey itself takes the view that Cyprus should not be drilling for gas until negotiators settle the long-term future of the island’s two communities.The persistent tensions that surround the island’s division are not, however, the only question on the minds of Cyprus’s political leaders as they prepare for a possible gas bonanza.For a country with no experience of managing extensive natural resources, it is equally important to work out how to exploit the wealth – if it is there – in a sustainable fashion.At the Limassol conference, Hans Jochum Horn, a Norwegian businessman with deep knowledge of the oil and gas sectors of Norway and Russia, had some blunt advice for Cyprus’s leaders.“You have no time. You have to get the key issues on the table very soon and take some quick decisions. If you set the right framework at the beginning, you will not squander the riches,” Mr Horn said.Cyprus may choose to create a national energy champion, as Norway did when it established Statoil in 1972, he observed. “If so, the company should be run like a private company. It should have independent directors and should be quoted on a major stock exchange.”Mr Horn, who is deputy chief executive officer of the Renaissance Group, an investment company that specialises in emerging markets, said that if Cyprus set up a wealth fund, “everything you earn offshore should go into the fund and only a little bit should trickle out [for current expenditure]”.Norway made a mistake in 2002 by deciding to take out 4 per cent of its fund’s annual revenues for current spending, Mr Horn said. A limit of 2 per cent a year should have been set.Amit Mor, an Israeli specialist who runs Eco Energy, a consulting and investment firm, told the conference that “a transparent bidding and licence process” was paramount for the long-term success of a future Cypriot energy sector.He added: “The resources belong to future generations. It’s very important for Cyprus to internalise this lesson.”
68;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-10-09T15:00:43Z;Mediterranean gas reserves tension flares;;Beneath the seabed of the eastern Mediterranean are natural gas deposits potentially so vast that the economic map of the region is already being redrawn, even as tensions flare.Israel has been first to develop the reserves, which could help give it energy independence from a suddenly unpredictable Egypt.In a co-ordinated move, Cyprus is following suit, amid hopes that gas riches could boost its economy, still reeling from an explosion in July that knocked out the island’s biggest power station.The Greek Cypriot government expects that Noble Energy, the US contractor drilling for gas off southern Cyprus, will be able to confirm by the end of next month whether its waters contains deposits that can be commercially exploited.Turkey has responded angrily to the drilling by dispatching an exploratory vessel of its own to the area, as prospects dim for a resolution to the dispute over the division of the island between the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot South and the Turkish Cypriot North.Indeed, so great are the suspected riches that tensions are rising across the region, echoing the scrabble for energy resources in the South China Sea.Last year the US Geological Survey estimated the eastern Mediterranean area known as the Levant Basin, which encompasses Israeli, Lebanese, Syrian and Cypriot waters, could contain about 122,000bn cubic feet of undiscovered reserves of natural gas. By comparison, Algeria, a critical supplier of natural gas to Europe, contains 159,000bn cubic feet of proved reserves.The find has taken on particular significance for Israel in the wake of the Arab spring, which was just getting under way when Noble Energy announced in January that its drilling in the 125 square mile Leviathan-1 field had “the potential to position Israel as a natural gas exporting nation”.Israel still relies on Egypt for about 40 per cent of its gas supplies, which worries Israeli officials, particularly as the pipeline from Egypt’s Sinai has been blown up six times since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in February and Cairo recently announced a sharp rise in the price it charged Israel for gas. Companies with contracts with EMG, the Egyptian supplier, are already negotiating deals with the owners of an Israeli offshore field.“We would like the agreement with Egypt to continue successfully and it’s in the interest of both countries,” said an Israeli official.“But we have made our own natural gas finds and we will be exploring those finds …All countries have an interest in diversifying energy sources.”The official emphasised that Israel had discussed co-operating over exploring gas resources with countries such as Cyprus, Greece and Russia.Indeed, Israel and Cyprus struck an agreement on their maritime borders last year, a move that facilitated exploration for both sides, although Israel is much more advanced in the process. Cyprus is also looking to co-operate with Israel in developing reserves and building a LNG plant on the island, which could receive gas from both countries’ offshore fields.But the deepening partnership between Cyprus, Turkey’s old adversary, and Israel, Ankara’s now estranged former ally, is far from the rule in the eastern Mediterranean.When it comes to the maritime boundaries between Israel and Lebanon, two countries, still technically at war, there is no such agreement, with each submitting boundary proposals to the UN. Lebanon did agree maritime boundaries with Cyprus in 2007, but the deal was never ratified by parliament and at least one Lebanese parliamentary leader has said the country will seek to revisit it.Meanwhile, as part of Turkey’s deepening rift with Israel, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish prime minister, has warned Ankara will play a more “visible” role in the eastern Mediterranean. Soon after news of the Cypriot drilling emerged, he reached his own, parallel agreement with Northern Cyprus – which only Ankara recognises – and dispatched the Piri Reis research ship to the area.Cyprus is trying to forestall any moves by Turkey by offering two other blocks for exploration. Gazprom and GDF Suez of France are seen as frontrunners for winning licences.So far, however, analysts in Athens said the Piri Reis had been careful not to stoke tensions further. Turkish officials say that after having come as close as 40 nautical miles to the Greek Cypriot drilling it has moved further north. And it has not been accompanied by Turkish warships, despite suggestions to that effect by Mr Erdogan.But with such high stakes – and equally high tensions – the eastern Mediterranean has unmistakably become a more volatile part of the world.Additional reporting by Kerin Hope and Vita Bekker
69;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-09-27T15:48:04Z;Turkish gas hunt off Cyprus stokes tensions;;Turkey has begun gas exploration in waters near Cyprus – a move that increases tension between Ankara and its neighbour and could further damage the troubled Turkish quest to join the European Union.Turkish officials said a research ship, the Piri Reis, had begun looking for gas near the island, but did not disclose its exact location. Some reports said it was accompanied by warships.“This must not be understood as a threat,” said Bulent Arinc, Turkey’s deputy prime minister. “I hope the Greek Cypriots do not go ahead and push Turkey to use force.”In turn, the Cypriot government said that “with its behaviour and action, [Turkey] is causing tension in the region and [violating] the rules of international law”.Turkey’s step came in response to Cyprus’s decision to start drilling for gas last week. Noble Energy, the US contractor carrying out the work for Cyprus, said in 2009 it believed that the area could contain about 6,000bn cubic feet of gas – the equivalent of more than 1bn barrels of oil.The EU has called on both sides to avoid confrontation and concentrate on finding a permanent settlement to the division of the island between the Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north.In an echo of the territorial disputes in the energy-rich South China Sea, the potential riches at stake have accentuated strains between Turkey, which does not have diplomatic relations with Cyprus, and the island’s internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government.Cyprus emphasises its sovereign right to drill in its exclusive economic zone and highlights its backing from the US to do so. But Turkey says Nicosia is wrong to proceed before the division of the island is resolved.While Cyprus says the Turkish Cypriot side will also benefit from the income from the gas find, officials in Ankara argue that the riches of such a huge find will further remove the pressure on the Greek Cypriots ever to agree a permanent deal with the north.In a prelude to Tuesday’s announcement, Ankara concluded an oil and gas co-operation agreement last week with the Turkish Cypriot government, which no other government recognises.The dispute – and the risk of confrontation – comes as Turkey’s EU membership drive remains largely stalled, partly because of the existing problems between Ankara and Nicosia.Cyprus has frozen six of the negotiating “chapters” that need to be completed if Turkey is to join, while Ankara has refused to implement an agreement with the EU to open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriot traffic.Some EU officials are concerned that a further crisis could spell the end to Turkey’s application.Tensions are all the higher in Turkey because Cyprus paved the way for the drilling with a 2010 agreement with Israel to demarcate maritime borders. Turkish-Israeli relations are in crisis after Israeli forces killed nine Turkish-based activists aboard an aid ship trying to break the blockade of Gaza last year.

72;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Turkish gunship threat over gas drilling;;Turkey is threatening to dispatch gunships to the waters off Cyprus in an energy dispute some diplomats fear could further damage Ankara’s troubled bid to join the European Union and increase tensions in the Mediterranean.Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister, said Turkey would send gunships and the air force to monitor the area, in response to reports that Noble Energy, a US-based company, was beginning exploratory drilling for natural gas as part of a deal with the Cypriot government.Turkey does not have diplomatic relations with Cyprus, an EU member state, and recently threatened to freeze relations with the bloc as a whole when Nicosia assumes the EU’s revolving presidency in the second half of next year.Some western diplomats say a confrontation could spell disaster for hopes of keeping Turkey’s EU bid alive, at a time when the membership negotiations are already largely stalled because of tensions with Cyprus. France is also opposed to Ankara joining the bloc.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, called on Monday for both sides to exercise restraint. “You have an escalating situation,” said an EU official, noting that Turkey had announced rival drilling plans to explore for gas in the area.The official added that the tension complicated talks planned for coming weeks to discuss a permanent settlement for Cyprus, which is divided between the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north.Turkey argues Cyprus should not begin gas exploration work at a time when the final settlement of the island’s dispute – which could affect maritime territorial rights – has not yet been reached.“This exclusive economic zone is disputed and we have told them it is not right for them to take a step like this,’’ Mr Erdogan said at a press conference on Monday.But many diplomats say Ankara’s legal case is weak. Rather than opposing Cyprus’s plans, as Turkey wants, the US has declared its support for the attempts to develop the eastern Mediterranean’s energy resources.Washington and other allies of Turkey have also sought to persuade Mr Erdogan not to dispatch warships. “We are sending this signal privately and publicly that we do not want to see either side engage in provocative action or action that raises tension,” said a state department official last week.The tension is all the greater because Cyprus agreed a deal on maritime territory with Israel last year as part of establishing its claim to the gas deposits. Turkish-Israeli relations are currently in crisis because of the deaths at the hands of Israeli forces of nine Turkish-based activists in 2010. Mr Erdogan has promised to beef up Turkey’s presence in the eastern Mediterranean as a result.
73;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-07-15T17:01:39Z;BP vows tougher Gulf drilling standards;;BP has tried to reassure the US authorities about its reputation as a safe operator by promising tougher drilling standards in the Gulf of Mexico, going beyond the minimum legal requirements.The British oil group, scarred by the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, wants permission to resume drilling in the gulf. To this end, it pledged on Friday to introduce four additional “voluntary performance standards”, designed to address the weaknesses exposed by last year’s devastating spill from the Macondo well.In future, BP will insist that all contractors use better subsea blow-out preventers, which stop the uncontrolled release of oil and gas from a well. The failure of a blow-out preventer was a central cause of the Deepwater Horizon accident.In addition, whenever a contractor brings a blow-out preventer to the surface for testing, an independent assessment of the device will be conducted by a third party. When other drilling materials are tested by outside contractors, BP experts will have to review their work. Finally, the company will compile an enhanced oil spill response plan.Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, said these new commitments “will promote greater levels of safety and preparedness in deepwater drilling”. The aim was to apply the lessons of last year’s disaster to “improve the way we operate”, he added.The pledge came in a letter from James Dupree, BP’s regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in Washington. The new commitments go beyond the operating standards of other oil companies with assets in the gulf.During a Congressional hearing, Ed Markey, a Democrat member of the House of Representatives, said: “BP’s new voluntary safety standards demonstrate that other oil companies can adopt similarly stringent standards…..If BP can do this, so can everyone else.”Mr Markey wants to make tougher standards mandatory, but Congressional Republicans oppose this proposal.BP has applied for permission to resume drilling in the deepwater of the gulf, although it aims to start with development wells in existing oilfields, not new exploration.So far, the accident has directly cost BP $41.3bn, while the moratorium on gulf drilling has deprived the company of access to some of its most important acreage.The BOEM started re-issuing deepwater drilling permits in the gulf earlier this year.BP was the largest shareholder – but not the operator – in the first deepwater exploration well to be approved since the Macondo disaster. However, BP has yet to secure the regulator’s approval to be the operator for a new deepwater drilling project.The first permit approved after the spill was for a project led by Noble Energy, a Houston-based company, which resumed work on the Santiago well.
74;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-05-03T20:51:55Z;Energy and materials lead Wall St lower;;Shares in Pfizer slipped back after its first-quarter revenues fell short of expectations, weighing on the healthcare sector and helping to lead the wider markets lower for the second consecutive session.The world’s largest drugmaker by revenue reported that sales had fallen slightly in the quarter to $16.5bn, which was short of the $16.6bn expected by analysts.This left shares in the company down 2.8 per cent at $20.44 as investors chose to focus on this revenue miss rather than the company’s 10 per cent increase in net income, which was ahead of what analysts had expected.The market’s disappointment over the results weighed on the healthcare sector with Watson Pharmaceuticals falling 1.2 per cent to $62.63 and Mylan losing 2.5 per cent to $24.23.The S&P healthcare index was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 12.3 per cent this year and one of the best-performing sectors on Wall Street.These losses helped pull the wider markets lower, with the S&P 500 index closing 0.3 per cent softer to 1,356.62.But the biggest drags on the index were energy and material stocks as many commodity prices lost ground.Within the energy sector, Halliburton, the oilfield services company, was down 2.1 per cent to $47.89 while Noble Energy fell 2.9 per cent to $90.60.Disappointing results from Chesapeake Energy also helped to weigh on the sector, with shares in the energy group falling 5.7 per cent to $31.33 after it reported a drop in first-quarter earnings.The S&P energy index fell 2.4 per cent, by far the worst performance of an S&P sector.The materials sector also lost ground, although not by as much, edging back 1 per cent. Massey Energy, the coal miner, fell 3.6 per cent to $65.25 while Consol Energy lost 3.5 per cent to $52.26.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was broadly flat at 12,807.36 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent to 2,841.62.In the previous session, the markets were given an early boost following news on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed by US forces in Pakistan. But the benchmark indices still closed the day slightly lower as investors began to worry about where the market was now heading following the lofty technical highs reached in previous few sessions.Last week, the S&P achieved a 35-month high, the Nasdaq rose to a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.“A lot of technicians are saying we are overbought here and we should move back for a while,” said Linda Duessel, senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors.JPMorgan released a downbeat note on Tuesday saying they expected “turbulence” in the equity markets during the coming months because of the turmoil in the Middle East, fallout from the Japan earthquake, US budget deficit concerns and growing inflationary pressures.However, a survey from Charles Schwab, the retail brokerage, found that investor sentiment was at its highest point since late 2009 with 47 per cent of traders surveyed saying that they were feeling optimistic about the market compared with 28 per cent a year ago.In another positive sign on Tuesday, US factory orders rose in March for the fifth consecutive month, in the latest sign of strength in US manufacturing.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in MetroPCS Communications jumped 10.1 per cent to $18.14, the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, after the wireless provider reported a doubling in its first-quarter earningsThis helped to lift the telecoms sector. American Tower advanced 1.9 per cent to $52.52 while AT&T added 2.1 per cent to $31.86. The S&P telecommunications index was up 1.5 per cent.In the utility sector, FirstEnergy put on 6.1 per cent to $42.02 after the power company gave an earnings outlook that surpassed expectations.The gains came despite the fact that the company’s reporting a fall in profits as it booked costs related to its $4.7bn purchase of Allegheny Energy in February.Anadarko Petroleum, the US oil and gas company with a minority stake in BP’s disaster-hit Macondo well, reported a 12 per cent fall in underlying earnings for the first quarter because of a decline in natural gas prices and a rise in costs. The stock declined 2.3 per cent to $78.51.
75;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-03-21T00:18:15Z;Gulf of Mexico: Companies feel effects of Macondo disaster;;"When US regulators approved in February the first deepwater drilling permit since BP’s Macondo disaster last April, the industry dismissed it as a political gesture aimed at quieting calls from Congress to resume drilling. Unrest in north Africa and the Middle East was pushing up oil prices. And the public was already seeing higher prices at the petrol pump.However, Michael Bromwich, head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, said politics had not been a factor. Noble Energy had simply met all the requirements for a permit.Yet the reality was that Noble did not have to do everything now being required by regulators to get a new permit; it had been drilling when Macondo happened and only needed clearance to finish its job. No permits for new projects have been issued.“The deepwater drilling moratorium has been lifted in name only,” said John Hess, chairman and chief executive of Hess.And the industry does not see rising oil prices changing that.Andy Steinhubl, partner in the Houston office of Bain & Company, the consultancy, notes pressure on regulators to permit new deepwater drilling has been high for some time because of the economic downtown, high unemployment and growing financial pressure on drilling companies from lost work. Seahawk Drilling has already filed for bankruptcy, citing the drilling ban.“The administration has been sticking to their principles. They’re not stalling. There was a lot to work through and they’re working through it,” Mr Steinhubl said. “I don’t see this [north Africa/Middle East] crisis as accelerating that timetable.”Yet the industry is impatient. Companies such as Chevron had been counting on new projects in the gulf to increase production in coming years. And while they are still hopeful, with most companies on standby, oil companies believe they are being held to a much higher standard than any other industry. The constant refrain is that when there is an aircraft crash, the US does not ground all aircraft.Yet the reality is that regulators have come under so much criticism for being what Mr Brom­wich calls a “permitting mill” before Macondo, that they are going to do everything to change that reputation.Companies complain that permit applications are repeatedly kicked back by regulators, who are asking for more information, and that they need a clear template for what is needed. Regulators have yet to come up with one.Mr Bromwich says regulators were working on a number of improvements to strengthen oversight, given that they had simply failed to keep pace with the transformation of the offshore drilling industry as it moved into deeper water.He points out these things take time, noting that UK activity dropped off substantially for two years after the Piper Alpha accident there and almost came to a standstill. “We have a new normal; it’s going to take more time than in the past,” he says.Kurt Hallead, co-head of global energy research at RBC Capital Markets, is among those who sees the Noble permit as a positive sign.“We’re going from a standstill to some movement,” he said. And, despite all the threats to leave the region if the deepwater drilling ban went on too long, the majors remain keen to get back out there. He adds: “The major oil companies view the Gulf of Mexico as a world-class oil-producing region. They have every intent to continue to invest there.”John Parry, principal energy analyst at consultancy IHS, says he expects offshore contract drillers to see increased demand for their newer, more technologically advanced rigs.And competition between operators will surely drop, as smaller companies move to leave the gulf, given the liability of operating there demonstrated by Macondo.These are both attractive reasons for those with deep enough pockets to wait patiently on the sidelines for permit granting to resume.“The US cannot afford to shut down one of its key sources of energy supply,” said Rodolfo Guzman, director at Arthur D Little, the consultancy. “Once the dust settles, and the rules become clear again, most deepwater players will go back.” However, the region will never again see business as usual.Many companies insist that least some of the changes afoot in the US – such as the requirement of adequate spill response systems – should be duplicated around the world the better to safeguard deepwater drilling from Africa to Brazil.Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, says it is working to spread the lessons learnt from the disaster. “We believe we have a responsibility to share our learning with those who can benefit from it – including our competitors, partners, governments, regulators,” he says.He adds: “Indeed, we have been asked by people around the world to explain what we have learnt. BP executives have travelled to Angola, Russia, Australia, Brazil and elsewhere in recent months, bringing our learnings to stakeholders, industry partners, academic and governments.”"
76;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-03-02T01:33:45Z;Well award puts BP back in Gulf of Mexico;;BP is the largest shareholder in the first deep water exploration well to be given the go-ahead in the US since the Deepwater Horizon disaster last year, showing how the company could have a future in the Gulf of Mexico even after last year’s spill.The details of the project emerged as the oil industry lobby group described the permit award as “not enough” and urged the US government to move faster.The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement on Monday approved a permit for Houston-based Noble Energy to resume work on the Santiago well in the Gulf of Mexico, which was under way last year but stopped when the Obama administration imposed a moratorium on deep water drilling in May.Noble is the operator, meaning it is in charge of day-to-day decisions about the well, but it owns just 23.25 per cent of the project. BP has the biggest stake, with 46.5 per cent.Michael Bromwich, the director of the BOEMRE, did not mention BP’s involvement when he announced the permit award on Monday, saying that Noble had “successfully demonstrated that it can drill its deep water well safely and that it is capable of containing a subsea blow-out if it were to occur.”Noble has a contract for spill response with a group led by Helix Energy Solutions Group, an oil services company that helped develop the equipment that was eventually successful in sealing BP’s Macondo well last year.By acting as a non-operating partner, BP has been able within a year of the disaster to restart its development in the gulf, where it holds more leases than any other company, and has two large discoveries to develop and more prospects to explore.Bob Dudley, chief executive, said last month that BP hoped to have five rigs resuming activity in the region this year, but pointed out that it also had stakes in several projects operated by other companies.He added: “One of the key uncertainties we face in 2011 is the pace at which activity and getting back to work will be restored in the Gulf of Mexico. We are not unique: the industry faces a similar uncertainty.”The oil and gas industry association continued to press for regulators to issue new deep water drilling permits more rapidly.Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said: “While every permit is welcome news, tightening the screws on domestic oil and natural gas production during a time of increased demand and global uncertainty is a formula for disaster.”
77;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-03-01T00:26:44Z;First deepwater permit approved since BP spill;;US regulators approved the first deepwater drilling permit in the Gulf of Mexico since BP’s Macondo well disaster last April, and signalled that further permits could be awarded in the “coming weeks and months”.The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement gave permission to Noble Energy to restart a well that was halted after the Obama administration issued its moratorium on deepwater drilling.“This permit was issued for one simple reason: the operator successfully demonstrated that it can drill its deepwater well safely and that it is capable of containing a subsea blow-out if it were to occur,’’ said Michael Bromwich, bureau director. Noble said it could contain a spill in the event of an accident using one of two systems developed by the industry.Noble plans to use the Helix Well Containment Group’s capping stack, which is said to be able to stop a leak in 5,600 feet of water. Mr Bromwich said the permit did not signal support for the Helix system over the other system under development, the Marine Well Containment Company backed by ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips.The industry and some members of Congress have been urging a resumption of activity in the Gulf of Mexico as fuel costs rise and instability in north Africa raises fears of future supply constraints. Mr Bromwich denied any politics behind the approval. “It was ready to be acted on and approved,’’ he said.This week, Ken Salazar, US interior secretary, will testify before Congress and is expected to come under pressure over the pace of permit awards.Shell said in a statement: “While it is encouraging that the industry now has a green light to resume previously approved drilling operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are hopeful this positive momentum will drive forward much-needed, new exploratory drilling in a timely manner.’’Mr Bromwich said: “We expect further deepwater permits to be approved in coming weeks and months.”
78;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-02-18T22:44:46Z;Wall Street gains led by energy stocks;;Shares in Progress Energy lost ground after the company reported weak fourth-quarter earnings, but the wider market edged up to fresh two-and-a-half-year highs led by oil stocks.The power generation company reported a 19 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits as interest charges and taxes increased, although revenue edged up and lower operating costs buoyed margins. The stock was down 0.5 per cent to $45.70.Progress is in the midst of being acquired by rival Duke Energy in a $13.7bn deal that would create the largest power utility in the US. Duke was down 1 per cent to $17.94.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,343.01, a gain of 1 per cent over the week, led by oil and gas stocks. On Wednesday, the index reached the point where it had doubled from its recession low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,391.25, up 1 per cent over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 per cent to 2,833.95, adding 0.9 per cent over the five-day period.Energy stocks saw the strongest gains as oil prices edged higher on political uncertainty in north Africa and the Middle East. Murphy Oil was up 1.7 per cent to $73.88 while Chevron added 1.6 per cent to $98.72. The S&P oil and gas index was up 0.8 per cent.Material stocks gave up ground, however, on news China had raised its reserve ratio requirement by 50 basis points in a further move to combat inflation.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 4.2 per cent to $52.95 while the S&P basic materials index was 2.4 per cent lower.Traders also had one eye on Europe amid concerns about Portugal’s ability to raise funds in the capital markets, ahead of this weekend’s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Paris.In earnings news, Newpark Resources, a provider of drilling fluids, reported fourth-quarter earnings of 15 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, and sending the stock up 4.8 per cent to $6.81.Elsewhere in the wider energy sector, SunPower, the second-largest supplier of solar cells in the US, forecast 2011 earnings of as much as $2.20 a share, far surpassing the $1.74 cents a share estimated by analysts. The shares were up 3.5 per cent to $18.04.Campbell Soup was down 3.9 per cent to $33.58 after the food company reported second-quarter earnings down 7.7 per cent and lowered its 2011 outlook.Mergers and acquisitions activity dominated the week on Wall Street.Monday kicked off with a $2.8bn acquisition by General Electric. The biggest US industrial group by market capitalisation said it was buying the well support arm of John Wood Group, the UK oil services company. GE was up 0.5 per cent to $21.44 over the week.Along with high oil prices amid tensions in the Middle East and north Africa, this helped energy stocks see some of the strongest gains over the week. Among the leaders was Noble, the offshore driller, which was up 8.1 per cent to $42.07 while Schlumberger added 5.1 per cent to $95.04.Elsewhere, NYSE Euronext unveiled formal plans to merge with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.NYSE was down 1.4 per cent to $37.79 on the week, however, after investors reacted negatively to the specifics of the deal which will see the German exchange own 60 per cent of the new company and have the majority of directors on the board. NYSE is still up 13 per cent since rumours of merger talks emerged.Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical group, finally agreed its deal with Genzyme for $20.1bn in the biggest takeover in the pharmaceutical sector since 2009. This led Genzyme up 3.9 per cent over the week to $75.38.In the retail sector, an investment group made an offer for Family Dollar Stores, sending shares in the discount retailer up 19 per cent to $52.55 over the week.Shares in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the US market leader in one-cup coffee brewing, lost ground after Starbucks said it was partnering with a rival single-serving coffee company.The stock had jumped more than 40 per cent in the previous two weeks on rumours it was in talks with Starbucks.Analysts at Roth Capital argued, however, that this might all be a negotiation tactic by Starbucks and that there was still a “fair chance” an alliance would be reached. Still, shares in Green Mountain were down 3.8 per cent to $41.81 over the week.A raft of economic data also helped to move the markets higher. The most promising piece of data was from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.However, data also showed that the number of people claiming for unemployment had risen by 10,000 more than expected, to 410,000.In other data, US home construction was strong and consumer price index inflation was higher than expected. The Federal Open Market Committee revised the US gross domestic product outlook up and unemployment down.
79;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-02-17T22:45:05Z;Manufacturing data lift Wall Street;;Cliffs Natural Resources jumped on strong quarterly earnings while the wider markets edged to new 30-month highs as blockbuster manufacturing data outweighed disappointing employment numbers.The iron and coal miner’s record fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, sending the shares up 7.2 per cent to $100.55. The company reported net income of $384.4m, or $2.82 per share, ahead of the $2.18 Wall Street expected.That lifted the iron and steel sector by 2.6 per cent, with Allegheny Technology, the speciality metal manufacturer, adding 1 per cent to $69.16.Indices fell in early trading after employment data showed that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits had risen by 25,000 to 410,000 in the second week of February – economists had expected the total claims to come in at 400,000.Data also showed that consumer price inflation had risen more than expected in January. Headline CPI was up 0.4 per cent while core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent.But losses on the S&P 500 were pared later in the session after data from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.“The Philly Fed number was extraordinary,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. “It just blew away expectations.”That helped the S&P 500 to close up 0.3 per cent to 1,340.43, a fresh 2½-year high. In the previous session the index reached the point where it had doubled from its March 2009 low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher to 12,318.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 2,831.58.The industrial sector saw healthy gains after the release of the manufacturing figures.Masco, the US building products group, was up 3 per cent to $13.20 while the S&P construction and materials index added 1.3 per cent.The data managed to outweigh concerns over global political instability as unrest continued to spread throughout the Middle East, lifting oil and gold prices.The turmoil did help certain sectors and stocks, however. The oilfield service sector gained from the higher oil prices, rising 1.7 per cent with Noble up 3.5 per cent to $41.33 and Halliburton adding 2 per cent to $48.43.Newmont Mining, the gold miner, was up 1.7 per cent to $58.96 as gold prices spiked up.In earnings news, CBS said net profit had risen 78 per cent to $319.4m in the fourth quarter.Earnings for the media group were boosted by local advertising revenue as television, radio and billboards proved popular with advertisers rebounding from the recession. This lifted the stock up 1.1 per cent to $22.35.Williams, the energy group and gas pipeline operator, added 8.4 per cent to $30.08 after announcing that it planned to separate its exploration and production businesses into two independent, publicly traded groups. The company also said it would boost its quarterly dividend by 60 per cent to 20 cents a share for the first quarter of 2011.That helped lift El Paso, another pipeline owner, by 3.9 per cent to $18. The stock was also helped by news that Raymond James Financial had raised its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”. The S&P pipeline index was up 6.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Duke Energy said fourth-quarter profit had risen 23 per cent, boosted by asset sales, sending its shares up 2.4 per cent to $18.12. Duke agreed to buy rival Progress Energy in a $13.7bn deal that would create the largest power utility in the US.Disappointing results from NetApp weighed on the technology sector.The data storage technology company fell 6.5 per cent to $54.77 after its third-quarter figures showed that revenues had fallen because of component shortages. The computer hardware sector was down 1.2 per cent.Weight Watchers International, which provides services and products for dieting, surprised the markets by issuing a 2011 guidance that far surpassed investor expectations, sending its shares up 45.6 per cent to $65.39.Skechers, the shoe company, was down 0.1 per cent to $22.06 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings had fallen by 88 per cent.
80;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-01-04T22:22:17Z;Delek warns of impact from Israeli tax regime;Rise in oil and gas levies could scare off investors;Companies exploring for natural gas in Israeli waters have warned that a proposed rise in oil and gas taxes could scare off foreign investors and undermine the natural resource-poor country’s potential to become a gas exporter.Their warning came a day after a government-appointed panel recommended doubling the state’s overall share of the revenue from gasfields to between 52 and 62 per cent from the current 30 per cent.“I am really disappointed with the recommendations,” said Gideon Tadmor, the head of Delek Energy, the oil and gas arm of Israel’s Delek Group, a conglomerate controlled by billionaire Yitzhak Tshuva. “It will be very hard to encourage investors to continue to invest in this sector.”Mr Tadmor said that the proposed rules would reduce the returns on investment in gas projects to less than 12 per cent from the “minimum” returns of at least 25 per cent needed to attract investors to Israel.Delek is part of a consortium of Israeli and US energy companies that have made record gas discoveries off Israel’s Mediterranean coast in the past two years.Last week Noble Energy of the US announced that the Leviathan offshore field contained about 16,000bn cubic feet of gas, making it one of the largest deepwater gas finds in the world in the past decade.Leviathan, along with the nearby Tamar field, which is estimated to be half the size, may even make Israel a gas exporter.Mr Tadmor said: “Tens of billions of shekels will need to be invested [to develop exports]. In order to do that, the government needs to be friendly to investors and give them a feeling that there is stability.”Some experts, however, say foreign companies are still likely to view Israel as a lucrative investment should oil be discovered below the gas layers in the Leviathan field.“The investors will come in spite of the upcoming changes in the tax regime if they see prospects for oil and for exports,” said Amit Mor, chief executive of Eco Energy, an Israeli consulting and investment firm.Analysts said that the recommended government take would be lower than that of Norway or the Netherlands but higher than of the US or UK.Charles Davidson, Noble’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company opposed tax changes applied retroactively for existing fields.Mr Davidson added: “Noble fails to understand why Israel’s government take should exceed that of the United States and the United Kingdom, where gas markets are dramatically more robust and developed than that of Israel.”
81;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2011-01-03T20:08:55Z;Israel seeks bigger share of gas profits;;The Israeli government is poised to raise sharply its cut of the expected profits, likely to run into billions of dollars, from a spate of offshore discoveries of natural gas.A state-appointed committee on Monday recommended lifting the overall “government take” from the current 30 per cent of net profits to 52-62 per cent. This would leave Israel with a smaller share of oil and gas profits than is taken by Norway and the Netherlands but a higher cut than demanded by the US and Britain.Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli finance minister, said he was convinced the new regime would “encourage energy corporations to proceed with their activities – not just to produce but also to explore”.Israel has emerged as a source of potentially huge hydrocarbon riches, after the discovery of several large gasfields in the waters off the northern coast.A consortium of US and Israeli energy companies last week said the biggest discovery to date, the Leviathan field, contained about 16,000bn cubic feet of gas. This confirmed an estimate issued in June, making Leviathan one of the world’s largest deepwater gas discoveries of the past decade.The field sits 47km south-west of the second significant discovery in Israeli waters, the Tamar field. Tamar is estimated to contain more than 8,000bn cubic feet of natural gas. Analysts agree that these two fields alone will allow Israel to become a significant exporter of natural gas – potentially transforming the country's economy.The discoveries, coupled with the government's determination to overhaul laws on profit sharing that date back to the 1950s, sparked furious lobbying.Israeli and international energy companies were especially angered by the interim findings of the committee, which is headed by Eytan Sheshinski, an economics professor. Tabled in November, they called for an even higher profits levy and other measures that would have raised the government take to 60-66 per cent.Mr Steinitz denied that the committee had changed its views as a result of corporate lobbying and attacked the gas industry for making “illegitimate” threats, including warning that it would not develop the newly discovered fields.Noble Energy, a US company, holds the largest stake in both the Tamar and Leviathan fields, with Israeli groups Delek and Avner owning the bulk of the remaining shares.The companies had argued that the Tamar field, which was discovered two years ago, should be excluded from the new regime. The Sheshinski committee has proposed a transition agreement in which profits from Tamar and similar fields will be subject to a government take of 43-59 per cent, provided they come on stream before 2014.Profits from Leviathan, however, would be subjected entirely to the new rules. The committee's findings must now be agreed by the government and parliament before coming into force.
82;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2010-11-25T01:13:12Z;Quito takes over Petrobras fields;;"Ecuador began the takeover of Petrobras’s oil fields on Wednesday after the Brazilian national oil company refused to bow to the president’s push for increased state control of the oil sector producing 475,000 barrels a day.Ecuador, the smallest producing member of the Opec oil cartel, has hailed the negotiations as a victory after most foreign companies agreed to relinquish profit-sharing agreements in an exchange for a flat fee for oil production.Rafael Correa, Ecuador’s leftist president who has rattled foreign investors with a $3.2bn debt default and the seizure of Anglo-French company Perenco’s oil fields over a tax dispute, said that the new contracts would bolster state coffers by $5.4bn. “The best part of oil revenues must go toward the owners of the resource, the Ecuadorean people,” Mr Correa said.Petrobras was the biggest in terms of production output of four foreign companies to balk at the switch, although unlike Noble Energy of the US, it will not be leaving Ecuador, as it retains a stake in a heavy crude pipeline.José Sergio Gabrielli, Petrobras’s chief executive, told reporters in São Paulo that the disagreement would not harm relations with Ecuador. “We just didn’t accept the conditions. It was an economic decision, but our relationship with Ecuador was not affected.”However, the company said that it would “take the necessary measures” to secure compensation.Petrobras’s fields in Ecuador produce about 19,500 b/d, a fraction of the 2.23m the company extracted from Brazilian oil fields in the third quarter.Petroecuador, the state oil company, will take possession of fields representing 14 per cent of Ecuador’s total output over the next 120 days, giving it a total of 64 per cent.Wilson Pastor, oil minister, said that the contracts would increase state revenues from 70 per cent of oil exports to 80 per cent.Repsol, of Spain, Ecuador’s biggest foreign oil producer, signed a contract that will see it paid $35.95 a barrel. Eni of Italy will receive $35 a barrel for its 17,3000 b/d; Andes Petroleum and PetroOriental of China will receive $35 per barrel and $41 a barrel for their joint 53,900 b/d; and Enap of Chile will receive $16.72 a barrel for 16,000 b/d.The companies have also agreed to invest $1.27bn in Ecuador’s oil fields, including some $240m for badly needed exploration.Mr Correa, in an interview with the Financial Times, said that the fresh contracts would give clarity to foreign investors.But Ramiro Crespo, head of Quito-based Analytica Securities, said that the lengthy talks had seriously damaged investment.“Oil production has come down because the companies over the past two or three years have, of course, not invested anything but the minimum required to keep the fields working. They have done no long-term investment because they were afraid they would have to leave,” he said."
83;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2010-11-24T01:21:56Z;Ecuador reaches deal with most oil companies;;Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company, was the only major foreign oil company holding out on a new contract with Ecuador on Tuesday night, paving the way for a possible exit from the Andean nation.Repsol of Spain, Eni of Italy, Andes Petroleum and PetroOriental of China and Enap of Chile will remain in the country, investing $1.27bn in the oil sector, according to Wilson Pastor, Ecuador’s minister of oil policy.Noble Energy of the US, will leave Ecuador after its contract was cancelled, handing over some $59m in assets to the state.Rafael Correa, Ecuador’s president, has repeatedly threatened to expropriate the assets of foreign companies that did not agree to new contracts by midnight on Tuesday, although he has promised compensation.With hours to go before the midnight deadline, a spokesman for Petrobras refused to confirm the company would exit Ecuador, telling the FT it would make a full statement on Wednesday.However, Wilson Pastor, Ecuador’s oil policy minister, told reporters in Quito on Tuesday night that state-owned Petroecuador would begin the takeover of Petrobras and Noble Energy assets from Wednesday.Petrobras has an output of about 19,300 barrels per day from a bloc in the Ecuadorean Amazon and a stake in a heavy crude pipeline.The new agreements, which will see the companies paid a flat fee for oil production, will increase Ecuador’s share in oil profits from 70 per cent to 80 per cent, providing a welcome boost for Mr Correa’s leftist administration, which has invested heavily in social programmes since he came to power in 2007.During a fraught negotiation period, Andes Petroleum and PetroOriental had complained to Ecuadorean officials about a lack of transparency in proceedings and threatened to seek international arbitration.There was also strong speculation that Repsol would pull out over disagreements in the level of service fee, fuelled further by Mr Correa’s announcement over the weekend that two unnamed companies had pulled out.Ramiro Crespo, head of Quito-based Analytica Securities, told the FT the lengthy negotiations had seriously damaged investment in the oil sector.“Oil production has come down because the companies over the past two or three years have, of course, not invested anything but the minimum required to keep the fields working. They have done no long-term investment because they were afraid they would have to leave,” he said.
84;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Companies hit at Israel gas move;;Companies drilling for natural gas in Israeli waters say any rise in the state’s share of revenues from fields already discovered would deter foreign investors.Asaf Bartfeld, chief executive of Delek Group, controlled by Isaac Tshuva, the Israeli billionaire, said it was “unbelievable” that the government was considering raising its share.The authorities had the right to change the rules but should not apply them retroactively, said Mr Bartfeld. “Foreign investors will think twice before they come to Israel.”The energy group, which owns a 31.25 per cent stake in the Tamar field, the world’s biggest natural gas discovery, also holds about 45 per cent in Leviathan, an offshore field that might contain twice as much.Noble Energy, a US explorer, which owns 36 per cent in Tamar and 40 per cent in Leviathan, estimates there is a 50 per cent chance of finding 16,000bn cubic feet in the latter field.Analysts believe that ministers are more likely to apply any change in state royalties to Leviathan.Noble has enlisted the help of US officials to lobby against a rise, with the US embassy writing to Yuval Steinitz, finance minister, said a person familiar with the matter.Lawson Freeman, vice-president of Noble’s eastern Mediterranean operations, said: “We feel that the energy industry in Israel is in its infancy. And it’s probably at the most critical point to have stability of fiscal terms to encourage international investment.”Shares in Delek and some other energy companies have risen at least seven-fold since Tamar was found in January 2009. Tamar’s partners have signed agreements totalling more than $11bn (€9bn, £7bn) for the supply of natural gas after production starts in 2012.If Leviathan meets the best expectations, Israel would have double the proven gas reserves of the UK, making it a significant exporter.But there are hurdles to the development of export infrastructure. Building pipelines through neighbours such as Turkey is unlikely because of recent political tensions, said Amit Mor, chief executive of Eco Energy, an Israeli consultancy.A more likely option would be to build the capacity to liquefy gas for tanker transport. But this would cost billions of dollars and might take more than a decade, Mr Mor added.
85;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Israel set for clash over gas revenue share;;The Israeli government is heading for a clash with energy companies over how to divide the revenues from natural gas reserves, possibly worth hundreds of billions of dollars, discovered in the Mediterranean.Yuval Steinitz, finance minister, made it clear in an interview with the Financial Times that the government planned to revise legislation with a view to increasing the state’s share of future gas revenues.“We have to find the right balance. Investors should make a good profit if they discover natural resources. But it is reasonable to expect that the people of Israel and the state of Israel will benefit from these ­discoveries,” said Mr Steinitz.The minister has established a committee to review what officials say is an “anachronistic” law dating from 1952 giving the state only 12.5 per cent of the royalties from any oil or gas production.The panel will deliver its verdict in mid-August, but the broad thrust of its recommendations is clear: “The chance that the committee will decide to recommend to reduce the government take seems to be very small,” said Mr Steinitz.The planned revision of the law has sparked protests from the companies involved in offshore drilling, notably Noble Energy of the US and Israel’s Delek group. They have been particularly angered by suggestions that any changes to the royalty or taxation regime would be applied retrospectively to gas fields in which they have already invested.Mr Steinitz, however, rejected their protests. “The argument against retro­active [application] seems to be very weak,” he said, arguing that changes in tax rates always affected companies independently of past investment decisions.The discovery of substantial gas fields in Israeli waters has started a debate over how best to use the wealth.Mr Steinitz said much would depend on the size of the reserves: “Until a few months ago, we were talking about $50bn (€41bn, £34bn) in gas. Now there are some estimates that [the fields may contain gas worth] hundreds of billions of dollars.”The Tamar field, found last year, is expected to cover Israel’s domestic gas consumption for the next 35 years. However, the discovery of another field, known as Leviathan, has caused much greater excitement. Noble Energy said it might contain 16,000bn cubic feet of gas – enough to make Israel an exporter.Mr Steinitz pointed out that such large reserves have the potential to yield large revenues – but also destabilise the economy. He pledged to avoid a replay of “Dutch disease”, which saw a decline of the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands in the 1970s after the discovery of natural gas drove up the value of the Dutch currency.“We must not let these discoveries kill our export industry,” the minister said. Instead, Mr Steinitz said any surge in revenues should be used to pay off debt, lower taxes and improve the country’s infrastructure.Israel’s economy has performed strongly in recent years. It was among the first to emerge from the world economic crisis and return to growth. Mr Steinitz said his goal was to return to annual growth rates of 5 per cent – which it has regularly achieved over the past decade.To that end, he has proposed cutting the corporation tax rate from 26 per cent last year to 18 per cent in 2016, and the top rate of income tax from 46 per cent last year to 39 per cent in 2016. The minister argues that Israel’s policy response to the global downturn ­differed from that of other countries. The government pushed through a small tax increase at the height of the crisis, but promised broader tax cuts in the years ahead.

It reaffirmed its intention to keep rates “exceptionally low for an extended period”.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets, said the move was widely expected: “The latest economic data has been pretty soft. The Fed would not want to make any waves right now.”He said he was focusing on the weekend’s G20 meeting in Toronto.“The G20 meeting could see some fireworks, particularly in the areas of global financial regulation, fiscal stimulus versus austerity measures, and bank taxation,” Mr Cieszynski said.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent at 1,092.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 0.1 per cent to 10,298.44 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.3 per cent to 2,254.23.Adobe Systems, a maker of graphic-design software, declined 7.3 per cent to $30.38 as it forecast third-quarter revenue of between $950m and $1bn. Analysts on average estimated revenues of $962m.US-listed shares in BP were flat at $29.67 on news that Robert Dudley would take over the company’s response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from Tony Hayward, chief executive. New York state’s pension fund said it planned to sue the company to recover losses from the fall in the oil company’s share price due to the “disastrous” oil spill.The fund said it owned more than 19m shares when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April.Deepwater drillers moved lower on Wednesday after the Obama administration said it would appeal against a federal judge’s decision to overturn the government’s six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, imposed after the oil spill began nine weeks ago.Diamond Offshore Drilling was 0.4 per cent lower at $62.62, Noble Energy fell 2.1 per cent to $29.45 and Nabors Industries dropped 1 per cent to $20.08.The telecoms sector was the S&P 500’s best performer, boosted by a sector upgrade at Credit Suisse. The broker cited supportive valuations, fallen expectations and stabilising wireless pricing.Sprint Nextel gained 4.6 per cent to $4.52, Verizon Communications rallied 0.9 per cent to $29.33 and AT&T was 0.3 per cent higher at $25.44.Rite Aid rose 5.9 per cent to $1.07 after the drug store chain posted a first-quarter loss of 9 cents a share, better than the 14 cent loss per share expected on average by analysts, helped by lower expenses and lower charges related to store closings.The company reaffirmed its outlook for the full year. It expects a loss in the range of 41 cents to 65 cents a share and revenues in the range of $25.2bn to $25.6bn. Analysts expect a loss of 52 cents a share for the year and revenues of $25.4bn.Rival drug store chain Walgreen was 0.1 per cent up to $28.13 as the stock’s target price was raised from $27 to $29 by Meredith Adler at Barclays Capital.Edwards Lifesciencesdropped 4.9 per cent to $52.15 as Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on the company, which is focused on developing treatments for cardiovascular diseases, from “buy” to “neutral” .ZymoGenetics, a developer of treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases, added 6.1 per cent to $4.53 as the stock was raised from “neutral” to “buy” at UBS.Chimera Investment fell 3.7 per cent to $3.68 as the mortgage-debt investor run by Annaly Capital Management said it planned to offer up to 100m shares of its common stock.Annaly rose 1 per cent to $17.92.Jabil Circuit was the session’s best performer as it rallied 10.6 per cent to $15.03. The electronics manufacturer said third-quarter profits, excluding non-
recurring items, would be 40 cents per share, easily topping the average analyst estimate of 34 cents."
87;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2010-04-07T10:48:08Z;Macarthur rejects Peabody’s A$3.6bn bid;;Peabody Energy of the US’s late-stage plan to acquire Macarthur Coal hit a setback on Wednesday when the Australian group’s board rejected a revised A$3.6bn bid as inadequate and uncertain.Macarthur added it would forge ahead with an April 12 shareholder vote on a series of deals it has already agreed with Noble Group that, if passed, would hand the Hong Kong-based commodity supplier close to 25 per cent of the Australian miner’s shares.Shares in Macarthur fell 5 per cent to A$14.31 on Wednesday, higher than Peabody’s sweetened A$14 a share cash price. Peabody has days to consider its next move if it wants to delay the Macarthur shareholder vote.The US group said its bid was “superior” to the Noble deal. Noble is to be issued Macarthur shares worth A$9.70 each in return for selling its 88 per cent stake in Gloucester Coal, a business that will be then folded into an enlarged Macarthur.“We continue to engage Macarthur shareholders to reject the Gloucester transaction,” Peabody said. “Our bid is A$14 and it is conditional on limited due diligence, which we have not been able to undertake due to a lack of engagement from the Macarthur board.”The St Louis-based group, which last week made an initial A$13-a-share bid worth A$3.3bn, declined to comment on whether it would make a fresh offer. Analysts on Wednesday suggested Peabody may need to raise its bid to A$15 a share to win a recommendation.However, Keith De Lacy, Macarthur chairman, said the latest Peabody offer was highly conditional, did not fully value the group’s growth prospects and lacked an adequate control premium.The tussle for Macarthur comes as coal prices have surged by more than 50 per cent in the past year on the back of rising demand from China, the world’s largest consumer and producer of the commodity.Shares in Gloucester closed 26 per cent higher at A$11.70, a day after Noble said it would offer minority investors A$12.60 a share for their holdings. However, that offer lapses in the event Macarthur’s takeover of Gloucester goes ahead.Noble, which made an extraordinary attack on Peabody’s “last-minute opportunistic grab” earlier this week, issued another unusual statement in response to Peabody’s “long and convoluted” defence of its offer.“Their explanation of the merits of their deal went on for paragraph after paragraph and sure was hard to follow. It reminds us a bit of Shakespeare in Hamlet, act 3, scene 2: ‘Peabody doth protest too much, methinks’,” it said.Macarthur’s three big shareholders are China’s Citic Resources and steelmakers ArcelorMittal and Posco, which collectively own 47.4 per cent.Noble is 14.9 per cent owned by China Investment Corporation. The sovereign wealth fund last year paid about US$800m for its stake in Noble.
88;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2010-04-05T18:11:03Z;Hard task to offload North Sea assets;;"Billions of dollars of North Sea oil and gas fields have been left unsold as multinationals struggle to offload assets to cash-strapped independent explorers.Eni, the Italian energy group, pulled a $1bn (£650m) auction of four packages of North Sea assets after no bids were made matching the company’s asking price.Other operators that have put fields up for sale include Royal Dutch Shell; Noble Energy, which has mandated Scotia Waterous to sell UK assets valued at $400m; and GDF Suez, the French utility, which has hired Jefferies to sell gas fields in the southern North Sea estimated to be worth $100m.Suncor, the Canadian integrated oil group, has launched a formal process to sell the Dutch oil fields it took on with the acquisition of Petro-Canada in 2009, and is expected to start a similar auction for a portfolio of its UK North Sea fields.The difficulty in selling North Sea assets reflects problems independent oil companies have had accessing financing from banks. And the market has become flooded with ageing UK fields.Large decommissioning liabilities, which have to be transferred to buyers when they take control of an asset, have made capital-starved North Sea independents unwilling to make offers for many fields.Richard Slape, analyst at Canaccord Adams, said: “Five years ago you would have sold these assets more easily, but now many of the larger buyers’ strategies have moved on from the North Sea, while at the same time finance has become more difficult to obtain.“The natural buyers of these assets are companies that often do not have strong balance sheets.“There is a host of problems facing small North Sea explorers and, until something is done to fix this, the North Sea will decline faster than it should and it will be a loss to this country.”Endeavour International has begun a strategic review which could see the independent explorer sell its UK operations.Last week Hess, the US oil and gas operator, sold $423m of North Sea gas assets to Scottish & Southern Energy, including an 18 per cent stake in a BP-operated gas pipeline running from the central North Sea to a processing terminal in Teesside.Sumitomo, Japanese trading house, managed to sell a portfolio of North Sea assets to Idemitsu, Japan’s third-largest refiner, for an undisclosed figur in 2009.UK Oil and Gas, the association representing North Sea companies, has warned that Britain’s oil and gas reserves will cover only six years of production at the current rate of investment."
89;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2009-01-20T09:56:03Z;Israel’s energy boost;;"An old joke in Israel says that Moses turned left when he should have turned right during his desert wanderings. After all, he had the rotten luck of finding almost the only country in the Middle East virtually bereft of oil and gas.In a piece of news this weekend overshadowed by the ceasefire agreement in Gaza – but with perhaps equally important security implications – a major natural gas find was announced 90km off the coast of northern Israel. Noble Energy of the US, which owns a 36 per cent interest, called it the biggest in the company’s history, saying the lower bound of the reserve may be 3,000bn cubic feet.As sweet as such a discovery is for a small country whose right to exist is denied by most of the leading owners of global energy reserves, it is a bitter pill for BG Group and the Palestinian Authority. BG owned a major stake in the field and, reportedly against the objections of its country manager, allowed its rights to lapse without compensation three years ago. Instead, it focused on its holdings in Egypt and off the shore of the Gaza Strip, where it invested amid optimism over the peace process.Even after Hamas won an election in 2006 and took control of Gaza in 2007, BG’s negotiations over selling gas from Gaza to Israel, which seeks to plug a looming supply gap, continued. Hamas opposed the deal as an “act of theft”, both because Israel was the buyer and proceeds would have gone to the Palestinian Authority. Negotiations broke down over price late in 2007.Along with its disastrous December rocket barrage, this is another Palestinian own-goal. Noble’s new discovery could supply Israel for decades. BG, meanwhile, is left supplying gas-rich Egypt, a much less lucrative prospect. Perhaps Moses had a sense of direction after all.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

90;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2008-09-09T21:53:44Z;S&P 500 plunges in worst day this year;;American International Group led the fall-out from deepening uncertainty over Lehman Brothers’ ability to strengthen its balance sheet, amid fears it too could struggle to raise fresh capital if so required.The world’s biggest insurer, which has heavy exposure to the mortgage markets, suffered more than $12bn in writedowns and credit losses in the last quarter. The shares dropped 19.3 per cent to $18.37.The financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as concerns grew over asset sales ahead of banks’ third-quarter earnings season.Washington Mutual – also exposed to the mortgage market – sank 19.9 per cent to $3.30, a day after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and ousted its chief executive. Excluding Lehman, it was the biggest laggard on the S&P 500.Wachovia, among the biggest gainers in the previous session, tumbled 14.5 per cent to $16.24 on Tuesday after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “underperform” and its price target from $18 to $16, due in part to expected higher credit losses.Goldman Sachs slid 4.8 per cent to $161.67 after analysts at Ladenburg Thalmann cut their profit forecast.Visa which along with Chinatrust Financial will replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the Dow Jones Financial Services Titans index, lost 3.7 per cent at $67.49.The wider market reversed Monday’s gains as initial relief faded over the government bail-out of the mortgage guarantors.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index – a measure of investor anxiety of future volatility – reached its highest level since the credit facility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was announced and oil reached its peak in mid-July.By the close, the S&P 500 had fallen 3.4 per cent to 1,224.51, within sight of the closing low for the year hit in mid-July, led by an overall financial sector decline of 6.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent to 11,230.73. The Nasdaq was 2.6 per cent lower at 2,209.81.A steeper-than-expected drop in pending home sales also weighed on sentiment, prompting growing worries of a worsening housing slump.The National Association of Realtors index of pending home resales fell 3.2 per cent in July after rising 5.8 per cent the previous month.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse downgraded four homebuilders – Toll Brothers, Pulte Homes, DR Horton and KB Home – from “outperform” to “neutral”. The shares fell 8.4 per cent to $24.26, 8.9 per cent to $14.77, 9.1 per cent to $12.83 and 9 per cent to $21.42, respectively.Another fall in oil prices hit the energy sector as US crude fell more than $3 a barrel after Opec’s meeting in Vienna.The declines were led by Massey Energy, Noble Energy, Valero Energy and National Oilwell Varco, which fell 19.4 per cent at $38.90, 12 per cent at $57.14, 11.8 per cent at $30.51 and 11.5 per cent at $52.92.Material companies also suffered, hit by wider commodity price declines. Nucor and US Steel dropped 9.7 per cent at $42.15, and 13 per cent at $93.69, respectively. AK Steel dropped 16.2 per cent to $33.72 after hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, its largest shareholder, offloaded 3.1m shares.Amid the gloom, there was the odd bright spot. Oil’s continued retreat afforded at least some comfort to consumer stocks. Sears and Fortune Brands, for example, put on 0.9 per cent to $92.72 and 0.7 per cent to $61.65, respectively.McDonald’s rose 1.2 per cent at $63.19 after a positive August sales update from the fast-food chain.Hewlett-Packard edged up 0.6 per cent to $46.01 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the world’s largest PC manufacturer from “market perform” to “outperform”.However, that failed to lift technology stocks more generally – which have been badly hit in recent sessions – into positive territory. Dell fell 4.3 per cent to $19.30 even after it emerged that founder Michael Dell bought $100m of stock in the computer manufacturer last week.Meanwhile, UAL, parent of United Airlines, continued to suffer losses after a false report surfaced on the internet on Tuesday that the carrier had returned to bankruptcy. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $10.60.
91;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Mediterranean gas field fires Israel;;To many Israelis, the geology of the Middle East has always seemed more than a little unfair. While other countries in the region have been raking in hydrocarbon riches for many decades, Israel has searched for oil and gas largely in vain.More recently, however, thanks to oil prices soaring to more than $140 a barrel – although they have settled below $130 in recent days – and rising global demand for natural gas, the country’s fledgling oil barons have a spring in their step. Across the country – in the southern desert, around the Dead Sea and off Israel’s Mediterranean coastline – companies are exploring oil and gas projects.Both industry executives and the government stress there is little chance of Israel becoming a state flush with petro-shekels. They hope that the projects, combined with an effort to extract more oil and gas from existing fields, may cut Israel’s dependence on foreign fuel imports and give a significant boost to its domestic energy industry.The biggest excitement surrounds a spot in the Mediterranean Sea known as Tamar, about 90km west of Haifa. Here a consortium of Israeli and US companies has identified a deposit they hope may contain as much as 90bn cubic metres of natural gas. While small compared to some of the fields in the Persian Gulf, it is three times the size of the biggest Israeli find to date.Delek Energy, an Israeli group, and Noble Energy of the US plan to sink an exploration well into the sea later this year. At a cost of $140m (€88m, £70m), it will be the most expensive drill in Israel’s history.Gideon Tadmor, the chief executive of Delek Energy, says the steep rise in oil and gas prices has spurred on the companies: “The current level of commodity prices has a lot to do with justifying such an investment.”He cautions that so far most exploration wells in Israel have not translated into commercially viable finds, and puts the chances of success at the Tamar site at about 35 per cent. But that has done little to dampen the enthusiasm of both the industry and Israel’s government.“Our off-shore operations are on a high at the moment for two reasons,” says Yaakov Mimran, the government’s petroleum and mining commissioner. “First, you have the rise in the oil and gas price. Secondly, there is a tremendous expectation as we look ahead to the first drilling at Tamar. We hope it will be a breakthrough.”It has been a long wait. The country’s oil production reached a modest high of 4,000 barrels a day in the 1960s but soon tapered off. While the first – and so far only – major success in gas exploration came in the late 1990s, when Delek and Noble found a sizeable natural gas field in the Mediterranean Sea, close to southern city of Ashkelon. It now produces about 2.5bn cubic metres of gas a year.According to Mr Mimran, the boom in commodity prices has not only helped make expensive projects like Tamar worth the risk, it has also sparked renewed interest in the country’s lower-volume existing oil and gas finds. He cites the example of the Heretz field in the south, one of the country’s oldest oil finds that still produces a small amount of crude, and where the government recently awarded a new licence to exploit the field.Ginko Oil, another Israeli company, is pursuing a similar strategy at sites close to the Dead Sea, where it is re-tapping several shuttered oil fields. In addition, the company has become partners with Delek to exploit what Rami Kremien, Ginko’s managing director, describes as “the diamond in the crown” – a potential large oil find at Zuk Tamrur near the Dead Sea.“We found a very interesting reservoir that we believe contains 6.5m barrels of oil, worth about $900m,” says Mr Kremien.The site, however, lies within one of Israel’s natural parks, and so far the park authorities have refused permission to drill an exploration well there. If their objections can be overcome, Mr Kremien hopes to prove that Zuk Tamrur is just the start. “We believe the entire Dead Sea basin has a potential of 20bn barrels of oil, of which 5-6 per cent is recoverable. Our target is to find and extract 1bn barrels.”That would be enough to satisfy Israel’s total oil consumption for more than 12 years.It is, Mr Kremien admits, a long shot. But in these heady days for Israel’s small band of oil and gas executives, everything seems possible.
92;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2008-04-14T20:55:05Z;Financials lead Wall St lower;;Wall Street stocks fell on Monday as sagging financial stocks, depressed by news of unexpected first-quarter losses at Wachovia, overshadowed advances in the energy sector.After a downbeat morning session in which the S&P 500 fell as much as 0.5 per cent, markets found some positive momentum on the back of rising commodity prices.An index of energy stocks rose 1.8 per cent led by coal and oil companies.Consol Energy rose 4.8 per cent to $79.27 while Noble climbed 4.7 per cent to $55.25 and ConocoPhillips added 1.6 per cent to $79.81.Bad news from the financial sector, and expectations of worse to come, prevailed however, and the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,328.27. The S&P 500 has now fallen for four of the past five sessions.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,275.82 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2 to 12,302.06.Leading the way was Wachovia, which swung from a profit to a loss in the first quarter and took a writedown of $2.8bn. It said it would raise $7bn in capital and slashed its quarterly dividend in response. Shares in the bank tumbled 8.1 per cent to $25.55.Meanwhile, Federated Investors, the asset manager, said first-quarter earnings rose 10 per cent, but that still missed consensus estimates. Federated slipped 3.2 per cent to $33.09.The news dragged down other financial stocks, including National City and First Horizon, which fell 10.5 per cent to $7.56 and 11.1 per cent to $11.65 respectively.According to Thomson Financial, first-quarter earnings in the financial sector are expected to fall 64 per cent in the first quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth.Financials are likely to remain in focus as a number of major banks and brokerages, including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, report results towards the end of the week.Analysts have repeatedly cut their earnings expectations for Citi and Merrill, and the pair are predicted to report losses in the first quarter and writedowns of more than $10bn and $7bn respectively.Such results could further damage already fragile confidence in the sector. Financial stocks have now fallen 10 per cent from their highs after the rescue of Bear Stearns.Citigroup shares slid 3.6 per cent to $22.51, Merrill dropped 1.8 per cent to $42.88 while an index of financial stocks lost 2.5 per cent.The earnings season began last week with a lacklustre set of results from Alcoa, the aluminium producer, and has continued in that vein.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: “Early signs are awful . . . We expect generally disappointing results and a swathe of lowered profit guidance that will drive the S&P 500 lower in coming weeks.”After a downbeat report from United Parcel Service hit markets mid-week, on Friday General Electric delivered the coup de grâce, missing its targets for the first time in five years.GE shares tumbled 12.8 per cent, the most since the crash in 1987, and dragged the S&P to its lowest close in more than a month. GE fell again on Monday, edging down 0.9 per cent to $31.75.Still, pockets of good news helped the industrial sector hold its own. Eaton, the industrial manufacturer, raised its profit target for 2008 after first-quarter earnings beat expectations. It rose 1.4 per cent to $80.03.WW Grainger, the building supplies distributor, beat first-quarter estimates and raised its 2008 earnings forecast, sending its shares up 2.2 per cent to $81.73.Ryder System, the trucking company, also received a boost after it agreed to buy Gator Leasing, a Miami-based rival, for an undisclosed sum. Ryder climbed 2.6 per cent to $62.18.This week should fill out the picture as nine Dow components and 65 S&P 500 companies release results.Deal activity remains a potential bright spot for investors hunkering down for a stormy earnings season. On Monday, Blockbuster said it would take an unsolicited bid of up to $1.4bn for Circuit City Stores directly to shareholders.Circuit City shares jumped as much as 47 per cent before easing back to $4.97, up 27.4 per cent, as analysts questioned the logic of the deal. Blockbuster shares fell 10.2 per cent to $2.81.
93;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2008-03-31T20:38:16Z;US stocks rise on Treasury plan;;Wall Street stocks rose on Monday, breaking a four day losing streak as markets broadly welcomed the US Treasury’s plans to shake up the regulatory framework of the American financial system.All eyes were on Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary, as he unveiled a “blueprint” for overhauling the current system including giving the Federal Reserve increased powers to regulate investment banks and limit the risks they take.However, Mr Paulson said “more regulation” was not the answer, that the proposals would take many years to implement and the Treasury’s priority would be resolving the current market turmoil.The news provided a small boost to stock markets sold off as initial enthusiasm for the Fed’s extraordinary interventions two weeks ago began to wane.Downtrodden investment banks rallied with an index of their stocks adding 1.5 per cent. During the past year, the S&P 500 investment bank index has lost 26.6 per cent.Morgan Stanley shares rose 2.2 per cent to $45.70 while Wachovia climbed 3.9 per cent to $27.00.Energy stocks also moved higher thanks to sale and contracts news.Noble, the offshore oil and gas drilling contractor, said it could benefit from contracts with Brazil’s Petrobras worth $4bn, driving the shares up 3.4 per cent to $49.67.Rowan, another drilling company, said on Monday it would divest its LeTourneau Technologies unit and possibly buy back up to $400m of its own shares, which climbed 8.7 per cent to $41.18.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,322.70, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.8 per cent to 2,279.10.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 per cent to 12,262.89.The latest Chicago Purchasing Managers index data also lifted indices suggesting that manufacturing activity in the Midwest contracted in March, although by less than some had feared.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “Right now the market is grasping for any piece of economic news that that may suggest the economy has stopped declining.”Industrial stocks gained with General Electric adding 1.1 per cent to $37.01 while Fedex rose 1.5 per cent to $92.67.Consumer discretionary stocks, which came under heavy selling pressure last week after JC Penney cut its earnings forecast, bounced back on the news.Macy’s, another department store operator, rallied 5 per cent to $23.06 while JC Penney climbed 06 per cent to $37.71.For the most part, recent economic data have lent weight to fears that the credit crisis has tipped the US economy into a recession and that has weighed heavily on investor sentiment.Despite the day’s rally, those concerns, and the implication that corporate earnings estimates remain too optimistic, dragged markets down for a fifth month in a row. The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent over the month – depressed by poor performance in the health care, energy and financial sectors.During the month only the telecoms, industrials and consumer staples sectors have managed to find any consistent momentum.Bad news for leading drug makers Merck and Schering-Plough undercut positive sentiment Monday. A day earlier an expert panel said patients should use drugs other than Vytorin, the cholesterol drug jointly developed by the two companies, after a key study failed to show the drug worked better than cheaper alternatives at reversing heart disease.Lehman Brothers downgraded Merck from “overweight” to “equal-weight” and cut its price target on the stock from $35 to $20.The shares were among the leading fallers in the S&P 500, dropping 14.7 per cent to $37.95 per cent, while Schering shares tumbled 26 per cent to $14.41.Lehman came into focus after it filed a suit against Marubeni, one of Japan’s biggest trading firms, for $352m after the US bank fell victim to an alleged fraud by two former employees of the Japanese group.Lehman shares, already depressed by consistent but uncorroborated talk of liquidity problems at the investment bank, fell a further 0.6 per cent to $37.64.Meanwhile, shares in Citigroup advanced 2.8 per cent to $21.42 on reports that it intended to hive off its credit card unit and overhaul its consumer unit as part of a wide-ranging reorganisation to restore profitability.Citigroup shares added 2.8 per cent to $21.42.In other corporate news, Boeing, the commercial aircraft maker and a partner received a $10.4bn contract for the V-22 Osprey.Boeing shares added 1.2 per cent to $74.37.Fortune Brands stock climbed 8.8 per cent to $69.50 after the company said it would begin a share buyback after losing out in its bid for Vin & Sprit AB, the maker of Sweden’s Absolut Vodka, to Pernod Ricard.
94;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2008-03-11T20:41:27Z;Wall St enjoys best one-day rise since 2002;;US stocks enjoyed their best one-day advance in more than five years on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced a $200bn plan to boost liquidity at troubled financial firms.Banking stocks surged with financial firms chalking up gains of more than 10 per cent, as traders rushed to cover short positions. The central bank plan helped allay fears that liquidity pressures were spiralling out of control.Energy companies and other commodity producers were among the best performers as crude oil surged to another record.The S&P 500 closed up 3.7 per cent at 1,320.63 points, its best performance since October 2002. The Nasdaq Composite soared 4 per cent to 2,255.76 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6 per cent to 12,156.81 points.The co-ordinated central bank announcement was a welcome salve for equity investors alarmed at the pattern of recent selling.Until Tuesday the market had retreated for three successive sessions as investors were unnerved by reports of margin calls at hedge funds and soaring home foreclosures.Tobias Levkovitch, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, had warned that “hopelessness” was setting in.The Fed plan to lend up to $200bn of Treasury securities to primary dealers on a 28-day term soothed some of these worries. The plan allows dealers to park a variety of collateral, including mortgage-backed securities, which have declined rapidly in price and have become difficult to trade.The latest announcement brought to $400bn the total amount of new short-term funds made available by the Fed over the past week.Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said: “The Fed taking mortgages as collateral should help ease liquidity concerns. This is a way to really attack the problems at their route rather than just cutting interest rates.”After the announcement the futures market trimmed odds of a 75bp rate cut when the federal open market committee meets next week.Although the market reaction was very supportive some analysts were more sceptical.David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said: “We still believe today’s action is not nearly a large enough step to make a big difference.”Stocks moved sharply higher on the Fed news with gains concentrated in the financial sector. An analysis by Bespoke Investment Group suggested some of Tuesday’s rally was driven by traders closing out short positions.Among the big movers were Citigroup, up 9.1 per cent at $21.49, Lehman Brothers, 7.8 per cent higher at $46.31, and Countrywide Financial, up 17.2 per cent at $5.11.Washington Mutual rose as much as 25.5 per cent on speculation it could receive a cash infusion from an outside investor. It closed up 18.3 per cent at $11.88.Bear Stearns was particularly volatile, falling as much as 19 per cent from its intraday peak, amid persistent talk – which it denied – that it faced liquidity problems. Bear closed up 1.1 per cent at $62.97 on reports Joseph Lewis, the British billionaire investor, was looking to increase his stake.Investors were also cheered by a smaller US trade deficit increase than expected. The gap between imports and exports widened 0.6 per cent in January, excluding costly oil imports but the deficit narrowed to a five-year low, as the weaker dollar boosted exports.Energy companies moved higher as crude oil futures rose above $109. ExxonMobil put on 5.1 per cent to $86.68 and Noble, the rig operator, rose 7.6 per cent to $50.48.Citing “out of control” oil prices and rising costs, Credit Suisse downgraded the airline sector from “overweight” to “market weight”. NorthWest Airlines shed 0.8 per cent to $12.23.Also trading to the downside was chipmaker Texas Instruments, which cut its first quarter earnings and revenue outlook.The shares dropped 3 per cent to $28.76. In telecoms, Sprint Nextel, the troubled mobile phone operator briefly hit a 20-year low. The shares closed 8.2 per cent lower at $6.17.Health insurer WellPoint cut its 2008 earnings outlook because of high costs and the deteriorating economy. Its shares plunged 28.3 per cent to $47.26.
95;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2007-07-23T17:32:43Z;Transocean buys GlobalSantaFe for $18bn;;Transocean on Monday agreed to buy GlobalSantaFe in a complex deal worth $18bn that will unite the world’s largest offshore oil and gas drilling companies and could herald further consolidation in the sector.Amid high oil prices and record rents for deepwater rigs, the combined group will by far be the dominant force in its sector, with an order backlog of $33bn and 146 platforms stretching from the North Sea to the Gulf of Mexico and the Caspian Sea.The deal was billed as a merger of equals, although it is structured as an all-stock takeover by Transocean with no premium and an unusual debt-funded recapitalisation plan that will return $15bn in cash to shareholders of both companies. Robert Long, Transocean chief executive, will run the combined group while Jon Marshall, his counterpart at GlobalSantaFe, will be president and chief operating officer. The board will be evenly split.Wall Street investors reacted enthusiastically to the deal, which the two Houston-based companies said would create cost-savings between $100m and $150m per year by 2010. Transocean shares rose 5.7 per cent to $116.33, while GlobalSantaFe shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $78.88.The merger of Transocean and GlobalSantaFe was the largest of the day as takeover activity in the US, which had slowed amid worries about the health of the credit markets, rebounded with a string of medium-sized transactions.Deals in the oil and gas industry recently have been hampered by high valuations and the relative scarcity of private equity buyers. However, the oil services sector is considered ripe for consolidation, and analysts on Monday predicted that the takeover of GlobalSantaFe could trigger other combinations.”Scale does matter in this industry given the capital intensive nature of the business,” said Michael Drickamer, an analyst at the Memphis-based brokerage Morgan Keegan. ”We think that other oil rig companies might look at similar deals to keep up with the new group and because of pressure from shareholders for similar recapitalisations”.Shares in other US-listed oil services groups, including Noble, Diamond and Ensco, rose sharply on news of the deal. Halliburton, which reported a surge in second quarter earnings on Monday, rose 3.5 per cent in noon trading.Under the terms of the transaction, GlobalSantaFe shareholders will receive $22.46 in cash and 0.4757 shares of the combined group for each of their shares. Transocean shareholders will receive $33.03 in cash and 0.6996 shares of the combined group for each of their shares. The cash portion of the deal will be financed with a bridge loan provided by Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, which also advised on the deal. The combined group said it would use its first two years of free cashflow to repay the debt. Transocean received a fairness opinion from Simmons & Co. Lawyers at Skadden Arps and Banker Botts also worked on the deal.
96;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2006-04-04T19:41:45Z;Lack of staff and equipment hit oil output;;Efforts to boost global oil and gas production are being held back by shortages of equipment and staff and by soaring costs.The energy services sector, which provides everything from drills to submersible pumps, lacks the resources to meet the needs of oil and gas groups, forcing up price inflation in some parts of the sector to 100 per cent.Industry executives say the squeeze has become so acute that energy companies are being forced to scale back their production plans or put exploration projects on hold.“It’s going to be a challenge to get production up,’’ said James Day, chief executive of Noble, a leading oil services company. “It’s a challenge for us to respond to the demands of the marketplace.’’Those demands have increased with the rise in oil and gas prices in the past few years, which have given energy companies the cash to expand production to respond to growing global demand.But energy services companies are unprepared for the boom, having never fully recovered from the massive disinvestments in the 1990s. Now, as demand for their services outstrips supply, they are ramping up prices and setting longer equipment contracts.BP recently set a price record by agreeing to pay Transocean $520,000 a day for a rig. And Global Santa Fe was able to command a seven-year contract – expected to commence in 2009 – for a deep-water rig, up from the average of three years.Meanwhile, EnCana, the Canadian energy group, is to scale back exploration and production plans, cutting $300m or 5 per cent from this year’s budget.In Norway only 14 wells were drilled last year, well below the planned number of between 30 and 40, with high prices and lack of equipment and staff to blame, according to Alan Murray, a senior petroleum economist at Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy.Even Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, which plans to spend more than $30bn in new investment in coming years, has been “having difficulties in getting the equipment they need”, said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy.Nobody expects equipment and staff shortfalls to be made up soon. Service companies building new equipment and renewing efforts to recruit staff will take time to catch up with demand. In the offshore installation sector, there have already been reports of equipment sitting idle without staff to run it.Halliburton and Baker Hughes, oil service heavyweights, said they had been bombarded by so many requests for their services that they were being forced to turn some down.“I’ve been in the business over 30 years,’’ said Jim Renfroe, senior vice-president of production optimisation for Halliburton. “It’s as busy as I’ve seen it in my career.”
97;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2005-05-25T20:47:50Z;Higher durables orders fail to boost Wall St;;"Wall Street stocks fell in moderate trading on Wednesday as rising oil prices and increased signs of investor pessimism outweighed a bigger-than-expected rise in durable goods orders last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 45.88 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 10,457.80. The S&P 500 slipped 4.06 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 1,190.01 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 11.50 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 2,050.12.The slide came a day after the Nasdaq exchange said that short interest, or bets that share prices of companies listed on the exchange would fall, had reached a 12-month high. The New York Stock Exchange last week reported short interest at a 12-month high.One head trader for a big Wall Street bank said that the trend was a concern, given the low trading volumes of recent sessions. ""There is an old axiom: you never short a dull tape,"" the trader said. ""And this is about as dull as it gets.""The trader said the low volumes were being driven in part by the fact that many hedge funds had ""hunkered down"" to re-evaluate their opinions on the likely direction of the stock market. Some hedge funds are thought to be licking their wounds after credit downgrades sparked unexpected moves in share and bond prices for Ford Motor and General Motors earlier this month.The price of oil rose on Wednesday, boosting shares in energy groups and hurting steelmakers and other companies with oil price exposure. ExxonMobil, the biggest US oil producer, led the S&P 500 with shares up 1.1 per cent to $55.68. Noble Energy, the oil and gas explorer, rose 0.9 per cent to $71.61.US Steel fell 3.4 per cent at $38.64. Allegheny Technologies, the speciality metals producer, fell 4.6 per cent to $20.63.Durable goods manufacturers failed to get a boost from a report showing a pick-up in orders last month. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the increase was most likely due to the seasonal effects of the early Easter holiday this year.Maytag, the appliance maker that recently agreed to a $14-a-share takeover by a private equity group, fell 1.9 per cent to $14.78. Shares had risen as much as 10 per cent above the offer price on expectations of a counterbid.Network Appliance, the networking and data storage company, fell 4.9 per cent to $28.92 after it said sales and profit this quarter might miss estimates. Visteon, the auto components group, rose 14.4 per cent after it said it would sell some factories back to Ford, its former parent.Shares in American International Group, the biggest US insurer, fell 0.5 per cent at $54.08 after the FT reported the company was mulling a legal challenge to ousted chief Maurice Greenberg's claims to billions of dollars of charitable assets."
98;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Oil slide offsets inflation fears on Wall St;;A weak showing by heavy manufacturers dragged down blue-chips on Wednesday, quashing hopes of a tentative rally. But the broader market edged higher as Wall Street bucked inflation fears and cheered the falling price of oil.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 10,456.02. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both closed marginally higher at 1,172.51 and 1,190.22, respectively.Official data showed that prices for consumer goods rose by more than expected in February, adding to inflation concerns outlined by the US Federal Reserve as it raised interest rates by a quarter point on Tuesday.Arthur Hogan, chief US markets analyst at Jefferies, said the negative inflation data were countered by a sharp fall in crude prices, which fell by more than $2 after a report said crude inventories were at their highest levels in almost three years.The resulting tug-of-war held the indices locked in a tight range, as the focus turned away from economics and toward the Easter weekend.Heavy industry stalwarts took a beating as investors flocked to tech stocks in search of upward momentum. Honeywell, the aerospace group, fell 2.5 per cent to $37.28. Alcoa, the world’s biggest aluminium producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $30.39. Energy groups also fell. Noble Energy, the oil and gas explorer, fell 2.8 per cent to $66.07. XTO Energy, a rival, fell 4.8 per cent to $31.43.Carmakers continued to slide in the wake of General Motors’ profit warning last week. GM fell 3 per cent to $28.66 after it confirmed it was in talks to sell a stake in the commercial mortgage arm of its profitable GMAC finance division. Ford, GM’s biggest US rival, fell 1.6 per cent to $10.99.Semiconductors were among the day’s best performers. Volatile tech stocks are a frequent target of momentum-driven trades when markets edge higher.Intel, the world’s biggest computer chip maker, rose 1.6 per cent to $23.39. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose rose 1.2 per cent to 414.86. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s chief competitor, rose 1.8 per cent to $15.65.Oracle rose 0.1 per cent to $12.51 after it reported a drop in quarterly profit, due in part to charges arising from its recent acquisition of PeopleSoft, a business software rival.Among pharmaceuticals stocks, Bristol Myers Squibb rose 2.5 per cent to $25.32 after it said it would buy back up to $2.5bn in debt. Pfizer said it would close a factory in Michigan, sending shares up 2.4 per cent to $26.04.The battle between Qwest and Verizon for control of rival telecommunications group MCI continued. MCI rose 1.3 per cent to $23.27 as the company’s board met to discuss Qwest’s sweetened bid for the company. Qwest rose 0.8 per cent and Verizon rose 1.3 per cent.
99;NBL;Noble Energy Inc;2004-12-16T14:29:55Z;Noble to buy Patina Oil Gas for $3.4bn;;Noble Energy has agreed to buy Patina Oil Gas in a $3.4bn deal that will mark its expansion in the gas-rich Rocky Mountains region.Noble’s move represents the latest in a string of acquisitions made by energy companies seeking to take advantage of the surge in demand for natural gas in the US.In May, Pioneer agreed to buy Evergreen for $2.1bn in cash and stock - a deal that followed quick on the heels of Kerr-McGee’s $2.5bn all-stock deal to buy Westport Resources and Encana’s $2.7bn bid for Denver-based Tom Brown.The combination of Noble and Patina will create a company with initial production of about 61,400 barrels of oil per day and 602m cubic feet per day of natural gas.Under the terms of the deal, which includes the assumption of debt, Patina shareholders will be receiving $37.89 per share, the equivalent of an 18.7 per cent premium to the company’s closing share price on Wednesday.Noble shares were 4 per cent lower at $58.96 in morning trading in New York on Thursday. Patina shares jumped 13 per cent to $36.19.
