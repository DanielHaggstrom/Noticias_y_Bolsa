0;CPRI;Capri Holdings Ltd;2019-01-02T17:15:12Z;Ivy and Daphne’s shrug off restaurant gloom;Richard Caring’s collection of premium eateries report a 2% rise in sales;Buoyant sales at London’s The Ivy, Daphne’s and J Sheekey have helped Richard Caring’s Caprice Holdings to shrug off tough trading conditions that have caused several rivals to collapse in the UK’s restaurant sector.The owner of Sexy Fish and Scott’s in Mayfair reported like-for-like sales growth of 2.1 per cent for the year to December 31 2017, according to filings made by the company. This was driven by a “fantastic performance” from Daphne’s in Chelsea, which was “backed by great sales from J Sheekey and The Ivy”.Turnover was up slightly at £67.7m. But rising rents and business rates weighed on profits, while a rise in the national minimum wage in April also added to its costs.Mr Caring’s holding company reported pre-tax profits of £9.2m in 2017, up from £8.7m the previous year, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation fell from £12.4m to £11.1m.The board described the performance for the year as “satisfactory” amid tough market conditions. The group plans to add another restaurant to its portfolio by opening the Caprice Café — an informal offshoot of its high-end brasserie — in Mayfair later this year. This follows the expansion of its Ivy Collection to 30 restaurants.A spokesperson said: “Sales in our restaurants showed good growth with individual sites growing by up to an incredible 11 per cent, and an overall increase of 2 per cent on like-for-like sales across the group in what are very challenging market conditions.”The spokesperson added that “this year, we will continue to go from strength to strength . . . offering everything from casual to fine dining”.It has been a tough year for the UK’s casual dining market in particular. ln October last year Gourmet Burger Kitchen, the UK high street restaurant chain owned by South Africa’s Famous Brands group said it would start restructuring negotiations with creditors.Earlier in 2018, Argentine-style steakhouse Gaucho collapsed into administration, while Italian chain Carluccio’s in March went in search of a buyer after it appointed KPMG to examine options following a sharp drop in profits.
1;CPRI;Capri Holdings Ltd;2017-11-25T04:01:53Z;Portfolio: female winemakers gain prominence;Women are fighting centuries of prejudice to produce notable wines;The world of winemaking has not, historically, been welcoming to women. Even Barbe-Nicole Clicquot Ponsardin, who became the first woman to run a champagne house when her husband died in 1805, is defined by her marriage — she was Veuve Clicquot, the widow Clicquot.A combination of machismo and the physical challenges of winemaking were barriers to most women over the next two centuries but, in the past decade, the number of female winemakers has grown. The Women Winemakers of California website, for example, lists more than 300.In recognition of this, Daphne’s, a restaurant in Chelsea, west London, has launched a wine list with 40 wines made by women on it, including the storied Château Margaux.Guillem Kerambrun, group head sommelier at Caprice Holdings (the parent company of Daphne’s), says he wanted to promote wine made by women not just to appeal to Daphne’s clientele — Chelsea’s ladies who lunch — but to give these winemakers deserved recognition.On visits to vineyards he met many female winemakers, “but every time it was the man who spoke”. He met men who preferred to sell their vineyards rather than leave them to daughters — although he also sees the occasional Domaine XYZ et filles (and daughters).Isabel Ferrando’s wine — Domaine Saint Préfert in Châteauneuf-du-Pape — is on Daphne’s list. She says for the first few years of her career as a winemaker, in the early 2000s, she faced extra scrutiny, that men “smiled and laughed” and waited for her to fail. “They thought I was somebody not serious in the job . . . But four years later they didn’t laugh any more because slowly I became not a woman working but a professional winemaker.”Ms Ferrando (top) says she had to work “harder in the vineyard, in the cellar, in the men’s places”. There were physical tasks in winemaking which were more difficult for women — crushing the grapes, for example. But now there are crushers with electric wheels which mean anyone can extract the juice.“When I brought [the machine] to Châteauneuf-du-Pape, nobody else had one,” she says. “It is the same job with a new way of working.” This is what men need to realise, she adds.Federica Magrini (second photo from top) and her husband Lorenzo Mocchiutti produce a Pinot Grigio in northern Italy — Vignai da Duline — which is also on Daphne’s list. Ms Magrini says she too had to work harder than the men did to prove herself in the business.Once she became a mother, she says, people assumed she would leave the business. Their attitude was “now you have something more important to do,” she says. But being the boss of a relatively small producer — less than 30,000 bottles a year — gave her the flexibility to balance work and family.Mr Kerambrun says there is evidence that, as late as the 20th century, men would ban women who were menstruating from entering a cellar where wine was fermenting in case they chemically upset the process.Even if the wine industry is still some way from parity, at least a few of its more disturbing misogynist traditions have receded into the past.
2;CPRI;Capri Holdings Ltd;2013-05-10T22:49:49Z;Scottish seafood producers feel crabby after chill;;There are few more luxurious ways to dine than to tuck into a plate of luscious local lobster or langoustine – as long as you can find and afford such dishes.Yet this year’s terrible weather has played havoc with Scottish seafood catches, putting hard-pressed producers under further pressure and disrupting supply to some of the UK’s finest restaurants.Asked how he and the lobster and langoustine sector are faring, Alistair Sinclair, chairman of the Scottish Creel Fishermen’s Federation, is succinct: “Fair to hellish,” he said.Mr Sinclair’s catches of Scottish west coast langoustines, also known as prawn or Norway lobster, have slumped because of colder-than-normal inshore waters that makes crustaceans less active and less likely to venture into fishermen’s pots.West coast lobster fishermen have suffered the same problem, while those on Scotland’s east coast have been hit by repeated storms that kept them ashore and wrecked their gear, said Mr Sinclair.“There’s a lot of unhappy bunnies around,” he said of his peers. “It’s not that their pockets are empty – it’s that they have eaten their pockets.”The fisherman’s blues are being felt as far away as London by some of the capital’s leading restaurant groups. Tim Hughes, chef director at Caprice Holdings, owner of a string of eateries including The Ivy, said lobster had been off the menu at its British food-focused Rivington restaurants for the past six months.But Mr Hughes said that was not an option at Caprice’s more expensive J. Sheekey, considered one of London’s top seafood restaurants. It has been forced to rely on Canada for alternative crustacean supplies and to pay considerably more than usual – a cost the group does not pass on to diners. “I have to take it on the chin,” said Mr Hughes.Despite limited local supply, UK producers cannot rely on getting a higher price for the shellfish they do manage to trap in their pots.Catches in Cornwall are well down on last year’s exceptional haul – but despite the relative scarcity this year, prices are lower than in 2012.That reflects falling demand from Spain and France after shortages there last year that pushed up demand for Cornish lobsters. And in Scotland, traders say Spain’s economic woes are undermining what is a key export market.Lobsters and langoustines are hardly the only high-end produce with weather problems. Unseasonably cold fronts have held back the UK’s £22m asparagus crop, with some farmers predicting output could be down 40 per cent compared with a normal year.One Cambridgeshire farmer, Victor Aveling, who this week suffered a “fen blow” that scatters top soil like a desert sandstorm, says this year’s harvest is “the latest I can remember”.For lobster farmers, at least the worst may be over, according to Eddie Kwok of Eddie’s Seafood Market, a celebrated Edinburgh fishmonger. In recent weeks, Mr Kwok has struggled to meet demand, but on Friday he had 60 or 70 live lobsters swimming in his tanks. “Things have improved a lot,” he says.Mr Sinclair is less sanguine. During a recent 10-hour shift hauling in langoustine pots he was “lucky to get even a fry”, he says.
3;CPRI;Capri Holdings Ltd;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
