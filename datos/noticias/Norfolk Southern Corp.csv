0;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2019-07-22T12:44:34Z;US jobs growth bypasses railway workers;Once reliable source of blue-collar employment cuts back as wider labour market booms;US employment growth has bypassed the railroad industry, a provider of good wages for blue-collar workers across the country.Headcount at the largest US freight railroads was down 4 per cent on year to 141,000 in June, a lower number than in the financial crisis, government data show. The sum is set to fall further this year as managers streamline operations under pressure from investors.Last week Union Pacific Railroad, the largest listed US railroad, said it intended to cut payrolls by 10 per cent in 2019 as it reported a record second-quarter profit of $1.6bn.At CSX, whose web of tracks lies east of the Mississippi river, employee counts were down 5 per cent on the year in June after a 14 per cent reduction last year. Executives seek another 2.5 per cent reduction between now and 2020.The Norfolk Southern Railway, which reports results this week, has outlined plans to eliminate more than 500 positions this year.The prolonged cuts stand in contrast to robust hiring in the US labour market, where non-farm payrolls rose by 224,000 in June.Railroad jobs are becoming more scarce as managers try to boost profit margins, in some cases to placate activist shareholders. Most operators have in the past two years embraced principles known as “precision scheduled railroading,” which entail rigid timetables, longer trains, thousands of idled locomotives and less labour.Driving trains, maintaining right-of-way and dispatching cars are largely unionised jobs that do not require a university degree. The average employee at a large freight railroad earned $87,100 in wages and $38,300 of fringe benefits in 2017, according to the Association of American Railroads.The slackening rail employment picture has drawn scrutiny from Congress. A House transport subcommittee last month conducted a hearing on the state of the workforce. Lawmakers questioned the consequences of lower staffing.“While worker productivity has never been better and Class 1 railroads have enjoyed multibillion-dollar profits for many years, employment levels are headed in the other direction with thousands of rail employees furloughed,” Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union, told the subcommittee.Precision railroading was evangelised by Hunter Harrison, a renowned manager who introduced it first on Canadian railways. After he was hired in March 2017 from Canadian Pacific Railway to run CSX, he swiftly began transforming the 21,000-mile network.An acolyte continued to execute his vision after Harrison died in December 2017. Last week the Jacksonville, Florida-based company reported an operating ratio — operating costs as a percentage of revenue — of 57.4 per cent, its best for any second quarter.CSX’s headcount was 21,541 in June, down by almost 10,000 since 2014.“The whole objective [of precision railroading] is to remove all of the unnecessary touches and handling and steps throughout the process of moving freight. And as you remove those steps, it means that you require fewer people to do it,” CSX said.Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern — the other big listed US railroads — have since taken precision methods aboard. An S&P index of the four most valuable railroad stocks has risen 56 per cent since Harrison’s arrival at CSX, more than double the increase of the broader US stock market.In its latest quarter, Union Pacific said it had curtailed operations at two rail yards in Illinois and one in Texas and stored 2,150 locomotives.“We’ve taken a lot of work out of the network, and it’s being reflected now on our manpower,” said Lance Fritz, Union Pacific chief executive.One outlier is BNSF, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Headcount has hovered near 42,000 over the past few years at the railroad, which competes with Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern in the central and western US.BNSF’s former executive chairman, Matthew Rose, questioned the merits of precision railroading before he retired this year. Mr Buffett has more recently sounded open to the concept.“If we think we can serve our customers well and get more efficient in the process, we will adopt whatever we observe,” Mr Buffett told the company’s annual meeting in May.In a blow to efforts to preserve jobs, a regulator in May scrapped a proposal to require a minimum number of crew members on each train. Labour unions had sought at least two, but the Federal Railroad Administration found no evidence multiple workers made trains safer.Further, the agency said any requirement would “unnecessarily impede the future of rail innovation and automation.”
1;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2018-10-25T16:30:28Z;US railroads employ ‘precision’ principles to boost profit;Approach pioneered by the late Hunter Harrison is spreading;North American railroad executives facing pressure to boost results are embracing the principles of Hunter Harrison, an industry legend who died in December last year. The sector’s quarterly earnings season, which continued on Thursday with results from Union Pacific, revealed the extent to which Harrison’s “precision scheduled railroading” strategy has spread.Under Harrison’s trademark approach, railroads work to improve profitability by running longer trains, increasing car velocities, using fixed timetables and maximising the use of assets. The veteran executive successfully used the strategy at the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways before he was recruited last year to run CSX, the largest rail company in the eastern US. His successor, James Foote, has held fast to his vision and CSX doubled net income in the third quarter. CSX’s eastern rival Norfolk Southern disclosed Wednesday it would adopt precision railroading, meaning a majority of large North American freight rail companies has now embraced it. Union Pacific, one of the two biggest western US rail groups, launched its own precision plan on October 1 and said on Thursday that it had already cut 627 locomotives, about 8 per cent of its fleet.“There has been some speculation of what we’re doing as a ‘light version’ of PSR,” Thomas Lischer, Union Pacific’s executive vice-president of operations, told analysts on an earnings call Thursday. “I can assure you that is not the case.”Union Pacific, which has struggled with service problems this year, said it would phase in the changes starting with a route between Wisconsin and Texas.Introducing precision railroading has often upset labour and shippers. As trains run more efficiently, workers are made redundant. At CSX, average headcount fell 8 per cent even as volume rose 4 per cent year on year in the third quarter. In Harrison’s early months at CSX, service disruptions led to a government inquiry as shippers complained that their chemicals, grain and other bulk goods were not delivered. Performance has since bounced back, with train velocity up 28 per cent year on year in the third quarter. Some customers still report problems, said Jay Roman, president of Escalation Consultants, which advises shippers on transport matters. Citing the CSX ordeal, the Surface Transportation Board regulatory body has asked Union Pacific to hold weekly calls with its staff. “We trust that UP will work in a transparent manner to avoid similar disruptions to our nation’s rail system,” STB officials wrote. The strong US economy has been good for rail companies, which have suffered in recent years as coal volumes declined because coal-fired power plants were being retired. North American rail volume in 2018 to date is up 3.4 per cent from last year, according to the Association of American Railroads. But investors have demanded more as the precision approach paid off on the Canadian lines and at CSX. Norfolk Southern’s operating ratio — operating costs as a percentage of revenue — was 65.4 per cent in the third quarter, well above CSX’s 58.7 per cent. Union Pacific on Thursday reported third-quarter net income of $1.6bn, up 33 per cent on year, but its operating ratio was frozen at 61.7 per cent. “The analysts are asking them: ‘Why aren’t you adopting the same systems as CSX, because they seem to be doing it very successfully?’” said Daniel Sherman, analyst at Edward Jones.James Squires, Norfolk Southern chief executive, said on a conference call that his company would implement precision railroading principles “where they lead to a better result for customers and shareholders.” Its shares rose 2.1 per cent to $160.19 on Wednesday, buoyed by record quarterly earnings of $702m. “Certainly, we are looking to change the way we operate. That's necessary. The network has evolved over the years,” Mr Squires said.CSX shareholders paid Harrison $84m up front to leave his job at Canadian Pacific in a bet that his management skills were one of a kind. Mr Foote worked under Harrison at Canadian National and was familiar with the precision model. “Whether UP and NS can do it without someone like Harrison is an open question,” said Howard Green, the author of Railroader, a biography of Harrison. “Harrison was the passion. He was the bullheaded, relentless, uncompromising preacher. He created disciples, and enemies, wherever he went.”
2;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;"Norfolk keeps on chugging; profit rises on tax gain, higher traffic";;The rebound in demand for coal and strength in the US economy helped Norfolk Southern deliver fourth quarter results that handily topped analysts forecasts.The company, one of the biggest North American rail operators, reported a 7 per cent rise in revenues to $2.67bn for the three months to end of December, driven by gains in coal shipments and intermodal - or shipping containers and truck trailers - traffic.Net income came in at $3.96bn, compared to the $416m reported in the year ago period, thanks to a $3.48bn one off gain the company received from US tax reforms.Excluding this, adjusted net income was $486m, or $1.69 a share. The market had forecast revenue of $2.6bn and adjusted net income of $450.6m or $1.57 a share.Profits were also boosted by the cost savings initiatives Norfolk announced nearly two years ago when it was coping with falling commodity prices and demand.Indeed, low demand for coal amid softer natural gas prices, a strengthening US dollar and a weak global export market had weighed on coal shipments through 2016. But coal market revenues rebounded last year, rising 6 per cent in the fourth quarter, and 17 per cent for the whole of 2017.The robust US economy, which continues to benefit from strength in consumer spending, housing markets, and strong manufacturing activity levels, has also helped boost demand for cargo and truck transport. Revenue from intermodal traffic was up 14 per cent in the fourth quarter to $667m while general merchandise revenue climbed 5 per cent to $1.57bn.“Norfolk Southern is open for growth, and we are optimistic as we head into 2018 that the current economic environment will provide an opportunity for continuing growth,” said James Squires, Norfolk Southern chief executive.“We are laser-focused on execution of our strategy and are confident that we can achieve our targets by 2020 or sooner.”Shares in Norfolk, up by more than a third over the past 12 months rose another 2.2 per cent in pre-market trading.
3;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2017-10-25T12:30:51Z;Norfolk Southern results top estimates, coal revenues improve;;Norfolk Southern, one of the biggest North American rail operators, on Wednesday delivered better-than-expected third quarter results as coal shipments improved.The Virginia-based company reported profits of $506m or $1.75 a share, compared with $460m or $1.55 a share in the year ago period. That topped average analyst expectations of $1.64, according to Thomson Reuters dataNorfolk, which operates the most extensive intermodal network in the Eastern US, said its revenues rose nearly 6 per cent to $2.7bn, a touch above Wall Street expectations of $2.6bn, reflecting growth in coal and intermodal shipments, which involve two or more different modes of transporting goods.Indeed, the company’s coal revenues rose more than 13 per cent from a year ago to $449m. The figures are an improvement from those seen last year, when low demand for the commodity amid softer natural gas prices, a strengthening US dollar and a weak global export market had depressed shipments.“We are unwavering in our commitment to improve productivity as demonstrated by seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in our operating ratio,” said James Squires, chief executive. “Our balanced approach focuses on increasing efficiency and delivering a strong customer service product, giving us the ability to achieve our goals and deliver sustainable shareholder value.”Norfolk shares are up 23 per cent so far this year.
4;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2017-07-27T00:03:37Z;US railroads: deal coal bounce;Profits from the commodity are up for now but cannot be sustained;“Coal is not a long-term issue,” Hunter Harrison, the pricey, septuagenarian chief executive of US railroad company CSX said dismissively last week. How about a short-term one, then? CSX reported last week that second-quarter revenues from hauling coal were up 27 per cent year-on-year.On Wednesday, rival Norfolk Southern delivered similar results with quarterly coal revenues up 32 per cent. Despite President Donald Trump’s effort to aggrandise the black dust, power producers and utilities are still leading the shift towards natural gas and renewables. But while those long-term preparations are being made, coal is still being burnt in the US and exported abroad for steel production. These factors are a temporary panacea for beaten-down coal miners and transporters.The sector level data matches the rally at individual companies. The US Department of Energy forecasts that US coal exports will jump by nearly a fifth in 2017 to 72m tonnes. At the same time, natural gas prices in the US have slowly moved upward this year, although they are still historically low. The Energy Department predicts that the proportion of electricity generation from coal plants will inch up from 30 per cent to 31 per cent in 2017 and stay there in 2018.But this ultimately is a sucker’s rally. Coal producers have shrunk through bankruptcies and their new slimmer balances sheets fit the modest demand that now exists (coal was once responsible for half of US power production). Coal export capacity utilisation in the US is a measly 31 per cent or below at various terminals.Mr Harrison noted that while he’s happy to participate in the current rally in coal transport he was not planning to invest in building his coal transport business knowing that in 10 or 20 years coal demand may be effectively defunct. But with that decay path neither linear nor predictable, investors have a chance to wager on the variability.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

5;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2017-07-26T12:46:55Z;Norfolk Southern revenues jump as coal volumes rise;;Norfolk Southern, one of the biggest North American rail operators, on Wednesday delivered upbeat earnings and said its second quarter revenues jumped as coal volumes improved.The Virginia-based company said its profits climbed 23 per cent year-on-year to $497m, compared with $405m in the second quarter of 2016. On a per share basis, earnings rose 26 per cent to $1.71 and topped Wall Street expectations for earnings of $1.65 a share.Revenues rose 7.5 per cent to $2.64bn in line with estimates, as overall volumes grew 6 per cent reflecting growth within major commodity categories of coal and intermodal, which involves two or more different modes of transportation used to transport goods.Low demand for coal amid softer natural gas prices, a strengthening US dollar and a weak global export market had weighed on coal shipments last year. But coal market revenues rebounded in the second quarter, rising 32 per cent to $447m, following 20 per cent growth in the first three months of this year, while volumes rose 27 per cent in the second quarter.The company also said it would lift its share repurchase guidance by 25 per cent to $1bn as a result of “our achievements to date and the confidence we have in our outlook”.Norfolk shares are up 10 per cent so far this year.
6;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2017-04-26T12:36:53Z;Norfolk Southern profits top estimates, CFO to retire;;Norfolk Southern, one of the biggest North American rail operators, on Wednesday posted upbeat first quarter earnings and said its chief financial officer Marta Stewart would retire.The Virginia-based company said profits rose to $433m or $1.48 a share, compared with $387m or $1.29 a share in the year ago period. That eclipsed analysts estimates of $1.36 a share.Railway operating revenues of $2.6bn were up 6 per cent compared with the year ago quarter and were modestly ahead of forecasts.Norfolk became the third major rail operator to post upbeat results, following CSX and Canadian Pacific.Low demand for coal amid softer natural gas prices and a weak global export market had weighed on the industry’s fortunes. The first quarter results however showed that coal revenues rose 20 per cent from a year ago to $420m, though revenue per unit edged 1 per cent lower as coal units rose 21 per cent. The report also showed that demand for coal rose in the utility and export market, while slipping in the industrial market.Now, investors are also watching to see if softer regulations for the coal industry under President Donald Trump help revive demand for coal.Norfolk shares have advanced more than 8 per cent so far this year.
7;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Cost cutting helps Norfolk Southern deliver earnings beat;;Norfolk Southern gave a robust defense against the argument for consolidation in the rail industry on Wednesday after the company delivered fourth quarter earnings that easily topped expectations.Norfolk, the second-biggest rail operator in the eastern US by network size, saw net income for the three months to end of December increase 15 per cent to $416m. The gains come even as revenue slipped 1.1 per cent to $2.49bn thanks to the company’s aggressive cost cutting efforts, which helped it offset the slide in coal freight and general merchandise volumes.The market had forecast revenue of $2.5bn and net income of $398.8m. And earnings per share climbed 18 per cent to $1.42, topping estimates for $1.36.Shares in Norfolk have risen sharply since last week. The stock has gained more than 6 per cent since last Thursday after Canadian Pacific chief executive Hunter Harrison unexpectedly announced that he would step down five months earlier than planned, triggering speculation that the rail industry could be the focus of another attempt at consolidation.Mr Harrision said he is teaming up with activist investor Paul Hilal and the two are reportedly looking to shake up management at rival CSX, which operates the largest railroad network east of the Mississippi.Under Mr Harrison, CP unsuccessfully pursued mergers with CSX and Norfolk Southern.
8;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2017-01-19T19:42:28Z;CSX shares soar as rail industry veteran takes aim;Hunter Harrison quits as Canadian Pacific chief to pursue new rail opportunities;Shares of CSX, the biggest railroad in the eastern US, soared by the most on record after it emerged that an executive with a reputation for efficiency was laying plans to shake up the company.Hunter Harrison announced on Wednesday he was stepping down as chief executive of Canadian Pacific, the Calgary-based railroad he has led since 2012. Under Mr Harrison, CP unsuccessfully pursued mergers with CSX and Norfolk Southern, the other main network in the east.The Wall Street Journal later reported he was finalising an agreement to team up with Mantle Ridge, a New York hedge fund established last year by a former associate of activist investor Bill Ackman, to try to shake up CSX management. Mantle Ridge has raised more than $1bn with a five-year lock-up for a single stock position, said a person close to the firm.CSX climbed by nearly a fifth to an all-time high of $43.90 on Thursday, with Norfolk Southern up more than 4 per cent. CSX said its board and management supported the current strategy, but would “evaluate Mantle Ridge’s views” and looked forward to “discussing our core strategy” with the hedge fund. Norfolk Southern and Mantle Ridge declined to comment.Like other US freight railroads, CSX has been pummelled by declines in coal shipments as power plants burn more natural gas. Last year, the Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad’s coal revenue fell 20 per cent to $1.8bn.Mr Harrison, 72, is legendary in the railroad industry as an advocate of “precision railroading,” or moving trains to their destinations as quickly as possible rather than waiting for them to fill. He was brought to CP by Paul Hilal, Mantle Ridge’s founder, when Mr Hilal worked at Mr Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square.CP said he would forfeit C$118m (US$89m) in awards and benefits by stepping down and be replaced by Keith Creel, company president. Mr Harrison had approached CP’s board to discuss his retirement as he sought to “pursue opportunities involving other Class 1 railroads,” the biggest North American carriers, the company said, adding that “CP will have no role in Mr Harrison’s future endeavours”.Under Michael Ward, chief executive, CSX has improved performance, touting an operating ratio — or operating costs as a share of revenue — of below 70 per cent for two straight years. CP’s operating ratio was 58.6 per cent last year.David Vernon, analyst at Bernstein, said: “CSX continues to operate at an operating ratio in the high-60s, and based on Mr Harrison’s track record we think the market will dream about what could happen should the precision railroading approach and more aggressive change arrive in Jacksonville.”CSX, which originated around the coal fields of Appalachia, has a network stretching east from the Mississippi river between Montreal and Miami. CP extends from Vancouver to New York state. At CP, Mr Harrison argued the virtues of consolidation among North America’s largest railroads.Anthony Hatch of ABH Consulting, a rail analyst, said Mr Harrison’s move would not necessarily lead to further consolidation. “This is not a covert M&A attempt,” he said. He added that the company has dramatically improved operations since 2014. “Like Melville’s great white whale, CSX is not a weak fish,” Mr Hatch said.
9;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-06-16T15:24:03Z;Tradepoint Atlantic seeks to shake up US ports;Company aims to become main trade hub on eastern seaboard, with good links to road and rail;It would be easy to mistake the scene at Sparrows Point, a five-square-mile waterfront site just outside Baltimore, Maryland, for a case of simple post-industrial neglect. Weeds grow around the edges of many of the quays at the port on the site, which once employed 30,000 people and was home to a steel mill. The few surviving buildings stand amid a wasteland so desolate that even the slightest wind produces conditions like a desert dust storm.But the presence in the port of the STH Athens, a dry bulk carrying ship, testifies that the site is, slowly, coming back to life. Hilco Global and Redwood Capital, two US financial investors, are gradually turning the vast facility into a port, distribution and logistics facility named Tradepoint Atlantic.The project promises to be the only sizeable entirely privately-owned port development on the US east coast. The investors believe the availability of so much space on a site linked to sea, rail and road transport can transform how goods are distributed around the US north-east. They expect their investments, together with those of customers, to reach $1bn over the next 10 years.“It’s a global trade point, where we plan to do a great number of things for different industries,” says Kerry Doyle, vice-president for finance of the new venture.Some of Tradepoint’s plans will increase competition for the nearby Port of Baltimore, owned by the public-sector Maryland Port Administration. But James White, the MPA’s executive director, welcomes the potential for the facility to attract new capital to the area and generate extra maritime traffic.“That’s darn encouraging from where I sit — that you can grow maritime trade without having to invest government dollars,” says Mr White.The question, according to Neil Davidson, analyst at Drewry Shipping Consultants, is whether shipping lines and other transport companies will be prepared to scrap their current arrangements and move to Tradepoint.“There are an awful lot of very well-established container ports on the US east coast who will be very reluctant to allow any loss of market share,” he adds.The investors have taken the site on partly because they have re-evaluated the risks and rewards of a site with such a long, complex history. Sparrows Point was operated for most of its 124 years by Bethlehem Steel, a steel producer that left the site littered with potentially harmful substances when it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. A succession of subsequent owners tried and failed to make a success of the steel mill before production finally ceased with the bankruptcy of RG Steel in 2012.There are an awful lot of very well-established container ports on the US east coast who will be very reluctant to allow any loss of market shareUntil Hilco submitted its bid in 2014, investors interested in the site were deterred by the potential costs of mounting an environmental clean-up. Hilco was consequently able to buy the site, which was sold after the Bethlehem bankruptcy for $950m, for just $72m. Redwood joined the project subsequently.Bethlehem left behind some useful assets. For example, the yard on the site’s north side is currently hosting hundreds of rail tank cars that have no work because of the oil price fall.Michael Moore, chief executive of the project, highlights how Bethlehem built more than 100 miles of rail track, connected to both Norfolk Southern and CSX, the eastern US’s two biggest railroads, as well as the site’s port facilities.The transport connections are already producing new customers. Work is under way near the rail yard on a new logistics facility for FedEx, the express parcel service, which was attracted by the site’s direct connection to the US interstate highway network. This month, Tradepoint announced a deal with Pasha Automotive Services, which handles car imports for manufacturers, to start landing vehicles for Fiat Chrysler at Tradepoint from July.We can consolidate cars here [heading everywhere] from Virginia to Newark. That’s a huge differentiatorSpace at Tradepoint is so plentiful, according to Mr Moore, that it should allow companies like Pasha to cut out calls at other ports in the north-eastern US and run their distribution from Sparrows Point.“We can consolidate cars here [heading everywhere] from Virginia to Newark,” Mr Moore says. “That’s a huge differentiator.”There remains considerable uncertainty for the project. While the investors have not disclosed how much they have put into the project so far, Mr Doyle is only now embarking on raising the business’s first outside capital. It also remains uncertain, according to Mr Davidson, how traffic patterns on the US east coast will change once the Panama Canal expands to allow larger vessels later this month.The “$64,000 question”, Mr Davidson says, is whether US east coast ports gain market share from west coast rivals.Nevertheless, Mr Doyle predicts the project will not only transform goods movements in its immediate area but also provide a model for other, similar sites in the future.“We see this as an investment thesis,” he says. “We feel this can be replicated elsewhere.”
11;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-04-20T11:57:13Z;Canadian Pacific raises dividend, unveils stock buyback;;Canadian Pacific Railway shareholders got a big boost on Wednesday after the company raised its dividend by more than 40 per cent and announced a big share buyback.The company, which abandoned its pursuit of US rival Norfolk Southern earlier this month, is using the cash that it has once set aside to fund the acquisition to lift its dividend payment to 50 Canadian cents a share.It is also planning to buy back as many as 6.91m of its common shares. At the current share price of C$189.95, the move could cost more than $1.3bn.News of the shareholder windfall comes as CP reported a 69 per cent jump in first quarter net income to $540m. The earnings jump came despite a 4 per cent drop in revenues during the period to $1.59bn.Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, said:I am proud of what the team continues to produce quarter after quarter in these difficult times and we remain optimistic in our outlook given signs of stabilization within the Canadian economy and in key global markets.As market conditions improve and volumes increase, our team of professional railroaders will be ready. Furthermore, we are confident in our plan to deliver shareholder value, which includes the announcement of a new share repurchase program that demonstrates our continued confidence over the long-term.
12;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-04-11T16:46:25Z;Bill Ackman’s US rail bet hits the buffers;Collapse of Canadian Pacific’s bid for Norfolk Southern robs activist of ‘enormous additional value’;News that Canadian Pacific Railway had abandoned its pursuit of Norfolk Southern may have added almost $100m to the value of Bill Ackman’s stake in CP in a matter of minutes, but it robs Mr Ackman of what he expected would be “enormous additional value” over the longer term.The admission by CP that it sees “ no clear path to a friendly merger” with NS adds to a list of situations where companies and financial markets have proved impervious to Mr Ackman’s powers of persuasion.And it comes as the hedge fund manager is trying to shore up confidence among his outside investors following the worst losing streak in his career, including backfiring bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals and against Herbalife.Until last year, CP had been an investment success for Mr Ackman’s activist fund, Pershing Square. It first bought into the rail company in 2011 at around $55 per share and now holds about a 9 per cent stake. In early trading on Monday, it was up $6 to $141, but it remains below its 2014 peak of $215.After ousting the previous management and installing industry veteran Hunter Harrison as chief executive, Pershing Square pushed the company to make operational improvements that boosted margins, but revenue has stalled and a takeover of NS promised a new round of efficiency gains.Mr Ackman made his comments about the “enormous additional value” a merger would create in a conference call with investors in his publicly traded vehicle, Pershing Square Holdings, last week.He has also been a vociferous advocate of consolidation in the North American rail industry and of the CP-NS deal in particular. Last December, he joined Mr Harrison on a conference call with investors to criticise existing NS management. “They say, ‘Now we’re going to get it right’ after 20 years of failure,” he said.Mr Ackman’s reputation for creating value at the companies he targets and for his own investors has come under threat. While in 2014, he was the best performing major hedge fund manager, with a return of 40 per cent, he had lost all those gains by January of this year. His fund was down 21 per cent in 2015 and down another 25 per cent so far this year.CP was the third-worst performing investment for Pershing Square Holdings in 2015. The second worst was Herbalife, which Mr Ackman has argued for more than three years is a pyramid scheme that is worth zero. Herbalife’s shares rose in defiance of his short position.But his biggest debacle has been Valeant, an acquisitive drug company he compared to a miniature Berkshire Hathaway, legendary investor Warren Buffett’s holding company. It collapsed in value amid revelations of aggressive accounting and a hidden deal with one of its product distributors.Mr Ackman is scheduled to meet Pershing Square Holdings investors in London later this month for a question-and-answer session followed by “cocktails and canapés”. On last week’s conference call, he said Valeant exposed a “litany of mistakes” and added: “I describe ‘experience’ as making mistakes and learning from them.”
13;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-04-11T13:27:57Z;Canadian Pacific ends Norfolk Southern pursuit;Rail company accepts defeat for second time in attempt at rival takeover;Canadian Pacific, the rail company backed by Bill Ackman, the activist investor, on Monday accepted defeat for the second time in 18 months in an effort to take over a rival when it abandoned its pursuit of Norfolk Southern.CP said it was abandoning all its steps to merge with NS, the second-biggest rail operator in the eastern US by network size, including a motion at NS’s forthcoming annual meeting urging directors to consider CP’s approach.The pursuit of NS, which became public in November, followed a similar quest by CP in October 2014 to win over CSX, the biggest railroad in the eastern US. That was also abandoned.CP went on an intensive lobbying drive to attempt to force the NS board to consider seriously its offer, which offered NS shareholders $32.86 per share cash and 47 per cent of a new, merged company.NS valued the offer at $91.62 per share, or $27.3bn in total equity value, while CP insisted it was worth between $125 and $140 a share.“No further financial offers or overtures to meet with the NS board of directors are planned at this time,” CP said on Monday.The company also appeared to rule out further attempts at consolidation among the seven large railroads — known as Class Is — that dominate the rail industry in the US and Canada.CP argued in its pursuit of NS and CSX that further consolidation was vital to ease congestion on the network, which carries about 40 per cent of the two countries’ interurban freight movements.Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, said the company had “long recognised” that consolidation was necessary for the rail industry to “meet the demands of a growing economy”.But he went on: “With no clear path to a friendly merger at this time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our customers and creating long-term value for CP shareholders.”NS issued a statement trumpeting its progress on making cost savings to improve profitability — a point on which CP had criticised the company.“We thank our shareholders for their input and support throughout this process and our employees for their hard work and dedication to strengthening Norfolk Southern as a critical component of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.”Pershing Square, Mr Ackman’s fund, was until recently the biggest shareholder in CP and installed Mr Harrison — a former chief executive of Canadian National Railway — after ousting the previous CP management in a proxy battle in 2012.With no clear path to a friendly merger at this time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our customers and creating long-term value for CP shareholdersCP has said a merger with either CSX or NS would allow for smoother rail movements across all of the US and Canada by eliminating large numbers of interchanges between companies around Chicago, where all Class Is’ networks meet.Mr Ackman had personally argued vigorously in favour of a merger. The deal’s abandonment marks a further setback for the activist investor following his backing of Valeant, the indebted drug company.Both NS and CSX have insisted that the Surface Transportation Board, the industry regulator, was so unlikely to approve a merger that it was not worth considering. The industry’s last significant merger took place in 1999, when NS and CSX jointly took over Conrail, the formerly-nationalised operator in the eastern US, and divided its assets between them.Mr Harrison, one of the North American rail industry’s most respected figures, has argued that he could significantly improve operations at other railroads by applying the methods he used to turn round CP and, previously, CN.NS shares were down 1.2 per cent in pre-market trading, at $80.51.
14;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-04-11T11:39:43Z;Canadian Pacific ends pursuit of Norfolk Southern;;Canadian Pacific has thrown in the towel on its pursuit of US rival Norfolk Southern after the latter rejected three takeover offers from the Canadian railway operator.Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, said in a statement:We have long recognized that consolidation is necessary for the North American rail industry to meet the demands of a growing economy, but with no clear path to a friendly merger at this time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our customers and creating long term value for CP shareholders.As a result, it will withdraw a resolution asking NS shareholders to vote in favour of good-faith negotiations between the two companies. It has no plans to make any further offers or make overtures to meet with the NS board of directors.CP, the number two rail company in Canada, has long argued that consolidation in the railway industry is needed in order to reduce the congestion that is slowing service all over the US and Canada.It first made an approach for Norfolk Southern last November and subsequently raised its offer two times. Its last offer, which was made in December, included$32.86 per share in cash and 0.451 of a share in the new combined company. The offer also had a so-called contingent value right, which would have had a maximum value of $25. A CVR is an option that represents additional value to NS shareholders should future performance targets be reached.
15;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-03-01T23:15:38Z;CSX shares jump on Canadian bid hopes;;Shares in US railway operator CSX spiked by as much as 8 per cent following a report that rival Canadian Pacific Railway has revived its failed attempt to buy the company.CSX, which operates the largest railroad network east of the Mississippi, had rejected an earlier approach from Canadian Pacific back in October 2014. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the Canadian rail operator, which is currently in talks to try and take over Norfolk Southern, has recently made another approach for CSX, which the latter has also reportedly rebuffed.Both CSX and NS have resisted Canadian Pacific’s approach, citing regulatory concerns and potential severe service disruptions.With a market capitalisation of C$25.56bn ($19bn), Canadian Pacific is smaller than both CSX ($23.6bn) and Norfolk Southern ($22bn).A spokesman for CSX told the FT the company would not comment on merger speculation.
16;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-02-26T23:44:14Z;Transport delivers hope for equities rebound;Dow barometer records sixth consecutive weekly gain;One of Wall Street’s leading barometers of the US economy suggests a gloomy outlook may be misplaced, bolstering expectations of a stronger rebound for the broad equity market.The Dow Jones Transportation Average achieved its sixth consecutive weekly gain on Friday, repairing a bruising start to the year when the barometer fell some 12 per cent by mid-January.The rebound for the closely watched average, which includes 20 companies such as UPS, railroad Norfolk Southern and Delta Air Lines, is seen as a sign that the broader US equity market can gain further momentum in the coming weeks. Dow Transports have trimmed their loss for the year down to around 1 per cent, leading a recovery being seen in broader measures such as the S&P 500.“We feel as if technically the transportation average appears to have put in a strong bounce and could lead the market up as it did on the way down,” said John Brady, of RJ O’Brien and Associates. “It at least bears watching.”Global stocks were hit hard early in 2016 on concerns about the global economic outlook led by uncertainty over the extent of the slowdown in China. But as March approaches — ahead of crucial central bank meetings in the US and Europe — key market sectors have bounced off their lows recorded earlier this month, fanning hope of a turning point.In the wake of plumbing two-and-a-half-year lows on February 11, global stocks as measured by the FTSE All World index are up 6 per cent, while the S&P 500 is nearly 7 per cent higher.Some, however, are reluctant to call an inflection in market sentiment just yet.“We have had a nice rebound in the industrials, but I think the jury is still out,” said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments.This week, implied volatility as measured by the CBOE’s Vix has traded around a reading of 20, its long-term average, with this closely watched barometer of investor fear well below this month’s peak of 31.“After periods of volatility like we just had, it doesn’t just go away,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “We have to let the volatility play out through the system and that may take us to the beginning of the summer.”He said the financial sector also will be crucial to a market rebound after having fallen sharply this year as expectations for rate hikes diminished with the market turmoil and fears about the European banking sector flared.With a 10.9 per cent drop, financials are the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 so far this year.
17;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-01-27T20:06:48Z;Norfolk Southern to cut jobs, routes and locomotives;Drop in coal demand hits rail operator stalked by Canadian Pacific;Norfolk Southern, the US railroad being stalked by Canadian Pacific, on Wednesday outlined plans to cut staff, close routes and mothball locomotives amid a series of measures aimed at cutting annual costs by $650m by 2020.The company revealed the plans after publishing fourth-quarter figures showing net income down 29 per cent year on year to $361m, following a 20 per cent slump in coal revenues. Demand for high-quality metallurgical coal from the Appalachians — which makes up a high proportion of NS’s coal business — has been badly hit in particular by the worldwide fall in steelmaking.Announcement of the plan boosted NS’s shares 1.4 per cent in New York to $69.89.The savings plans elaborate on the company’s announcement on December 4 that it intended to make significant savings to cope with the challenges posed by sharp traffic declines across a range of commodities. The company has stepped up its efforts to cut costs since CP in November proposed a merger between the two companies designed to cut overheads and improve the two companies’ operations.NS has rejected the overtures from CP — whose biggest shareholder is Bill Ackman, the activist investor — by saying that regulators would bar a tie-up.Jim Squires, chief executive, said the company’s senior executives had already taken “significant steps” to improve financial and operational performance.“While Norfolk Southern’s fourth-quarter results do not yet reflect the initiatives under way, we believe we have the right strategic plan to streamline operations, accelerate growth and enhance value for shareholders,” he said.The company said it planned to reduce its staff — currently 30,000 — by 2,000 by 2020. It also planned to dispose of or downgrade 1,500 miles of secondary routes — including 1,000 miles this year — by the end of the decade. Some of the lines may be hived off to “shortline” operators— smaller rail companies that face less onerous operating standards than big Class I railroads like NS.The company said it would reduce its active locomotive fleet by 300 this year and another 100 by 2020. It will replace the oldest, least efficient locomotives and step up a programme of fitting more modern, efficient traction motors.NS’s revenue decline follows the announcement last week by Union Pacific, operator of the US’s biggest rail network, that its fourth-quarter net income had fallen 22 per cent following a 31 per cent fall in coal revenue.NS’s coal revenue for the quarter fell to $433m against $543m in the fourth quarter of 2014, while general merchandise revenue fell 9 per cent to $1.52bn. Revenue from intermodal traffic — shipping containers and truck trailers — fell 13 per cent to $563m. Overall revenues fell 12 per cent to $2.52bn.The coal declines were particularly sharp in the domestic metallurgical coal market, where sharp falls in US steel production sent traffic down 14 per cent year on year in the quarter.
18;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2016-01-21T17:32:33Z;Train groups derailed by commodities slump;Shares in Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific tumble as quarterly net income drops;Two of North America’s biggest rail companies confirmed the gloomy prospects for the sector on Thursday when they reported fourth-quarter results that sent their shares tumbling.Shares in Union Pacific, operator of the US’s largest rail network, fell 5 per cent to $69.92 after its fourth-quarter net income fell 22 per cent to $1.11bn and operating revenues dropped 15 per cent. Canadian Pacific — one of Canada’s two big railways — fell 3 per cent in New York to $101.01 after its fourth-quarter net income dropped 7.1 per cent to C$319m on revenue down 4.1 per cent.The results reflected significant falls in movements of a wide range of commodities, particularly coal and crude oil. UP’s coal revenue tumbled 31 per cent against the same quarter last year, to $745m. CP’s revenue from moving crude oil fell 19 per cent to C$105m.Lance Fritz, UP chief executive, said the past year had been “difficult”.“Economic conditions, uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices, and the strength of the US dollar will continue to have a major impact on our business this year,” he said.Hunter Harrison, CP chief executive, said the company had matched its record low operating ratio — the proportion of revenue eaten up by costs — of 59.8 per cent. “While the North American economy braces itself for more headwinds, we remain optimistic about the future,” he said.Both companies are suffering from the rapid reversal of trends that a little over a year ago were leading rail executives to warn of looming gridlock on US rail networks. Operators were struggling to cope with a mix of booming crude oil movements, bumper grain harvests and strong demand for coal, the biggest commodity for many operators.The sharp fall in the oil price has made natural gas far more attractive than coal for producing electricity, while China’s economic weakness has slashed demand for high-quality metallurgical coal. Movements of grain and other agricultural products have also fallen sharply — UP’s agricultural revenue was down 12 per cent to $895m.Eric Butler, UP’s head of sales and marketing, said nearly all commodity types faced a difficult year but promised to cut costs and seek new business to bolster results.“With our growth dependent on both the national and global economy, we will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise,” he said.The results come as CP pursues a merger with Norfolk Southern, the number two rail operator in the eastern US. CP has demanded the US justice department act over Mr Fritz’s comment that UP would do everything in its power to stop mergers among the seven Class I rail companies that dominate the sector in the US and Canada.Mr Fritz said on Thursday that UP opposed mergers and it was “paying close attention to the situation”.
19;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-12-23T13:51:22Z;Norfolk Southern rejects ‘grossly inadequate’ bid;;It’s deja vu. Norfolk Southern has rejected a takeover offer from rival railroad operator Canadian Pacific, calling it “grossly inadequate.”Canadian Pacific earlier this month sweetened its bid for Norfolk. However, in a letter released on Wednesday, Norfolk’s chief executive Jim Squires said the railroad operator’s board judged the deal would not be in the best interest of shareholders.Mr Squires said the tie-up would create “regulatory risks and uncertainties that are highly unlikely to be overcome.” A concern Norfolk has cited repeatedly is whether anti-trust regulators would allow the big US and Canadian companies to combine, given the industry is already highly concentrated.Mr Squires also threw the down the gauntlet on Canadian Pacific to “seek a declaratory order” in advance from the US Surface Transportation Board to see if the proposed merger between the two companies could work.“Your decision not to seek an order shows a lack of confidence in your proposed structure,” Mr Squires said in his letter to Canadian Pacific.Canadian Pacific’s offer values Norfolk’s equity at about $27.3bn.
20;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-12-16T17:32:52Z;Norfolk Southern will “carefully consider” CP offer;;"Some potentially encouraging comments from Norfolk Southern on a fresh takeover offer tabled by rival railway operator Canadian Pacific earlier on Wednesday.Having dismissed CP’s previous two approaches as “grossly inadequate”, NS said it would “carefully consider” the latest, sweeetened offer.Earlier on Wednesday, CP unveiled a new bid for NS that includes a so-called contingent value right, which will have a maximum value of $25. The cash and stock components – $32.86 per share in cash and 0.451 of a share in the new combined company – remain unchanged from CP’s previous proposal.NS remains sceptical whether the tie-up would receive regulatory approval, however. It noted that CP still:did not address the substantial regulatory risks and uncertainties inherent in the proposed combination.As Norfolk Southern previously stated, if Canadian Pacific is confident that its proposed voting trust structure works, Canadian Pacific can seek a declaratory order to that effect from the STB now. The STB has clear, statutorily-established authority to issue declaratory orders to remove uncertainty, and there is precedent for it doing so in the voting trust
context."
21;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-12-16T17:22:31Z;Ackman pressures Norfolk Southern board on CP rail deal;Activist investor says railroad industry is warming to consolidation;"Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has laid out plans to put further pressure on Norfolk Southern to consider a merger with Canadian Pacific, as CP announced the latest adjustment to its offer for the US’s fourth-biggest railroad.Mr Ackman, whose Pershing Square fund is CP’s biggest shareholder, was speaking in a conference call where he portrayed the US and Canadian rail industry as warming to his plans for a new, highly controversial round of consolidation.However, he said that if NS continued to reject CP’s offer, shareholders’ first chance to force the company to consider CP’s offer would come at its annual meeting, due in May. He suggested shareholders could either pass a motion demanding the board consider CP’s offer or propose alternative directors.“I think the annual meeting is the most likely timeframe — and the simplest one — for getting a transaction done,” Mr Ackman said.CP is offering a mix of cash and shares for NS that the target company values at $91.62 per share, valuing the company’s equity at $27.3bn. CP contends that the offer is worth between $125 and $140 a share.NS said it would “carefully consider” the revised offer, which, in addition to terms announced last week — $32.86 cash per share and 0.451 of a share in the new, merged company — would offer shareholders a “contingent value right” in the new company. The CVR would offer shareholders up to $25 a share if the new company’s shares are below $175 a share in October 2017. CP projects that the shares will be worth between $204 and $237 each, depending on whether the deal wins regulatory approval.NS said that, other than the CVR, the deal changed nothing compared with the previous offer that NS’s board unanimously rejected.NS’s shares had fallen 1.8 per cent to $89.39 by lunchtime in New York. CP’s shares rose 0.4 per cent in New York to $125.56.NS has consistently dismissed the idea of further consolidation among the seven Class I railroads in the US and Canada, saying it would be impossible to gain approval from the US’s Surface Transportation Board. A series of mergers in the 1990s left just Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe in the western US; Norfolk Southern and CSX in the eastern US; CP and Canadian National in Canada; and Kansas City Southern operating north to south.Mr Ackman portrayed the transaction as having two parts. CP would first take management control of NS, as early as May next year, and put Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, in charge of improving NS operations. The second stage — after at least 18 months of working for regulatory approval — would involve merging the companies’ operations.Mr Ackman suggested other railroads were also warming to the idea of new mergers. He said CSX, which CP approached last year, had put itself up for sale. CSX denied having done so. He also suggested that BNSF was considering participating in mergers, although the company — like Union Pacific — has stressed it opposes new mergers."
22;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-12-16T14:28:45Z;Canadian Pacific sweetens bid for NS;;Will third time be the charm for Canadian Pacific?The Canadian railway operator has unveiled a fresh offer for US rival Norfolk Southern (NS) as chief executive Hunter Harrison looks to convince the latter’s investors of the merits of creating a transcontinental railroad network.The new offer includes a so-called contingent value right, which will have a maximum value of $25, CP said in a statement on Wednesday. The cash and stock components – $32.86 per share in cash and 0.451 of a share in the new combined company – remain unchanged from CP’s previous proposal. NS rejected that last week.A CVR is an option that represents additional value to NS shareholders should future performance targets be reached. CP officials described it as “an insurance policy against the level of the future share price” during a conference call with analysts Wednesday morning.NS shares were unchanged in pre-market trading in New York.
23;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-12-08T23:08:13Z;Bill Ackman calls on Norfolk Southern to accept CP’s revised bid;Canadian group is attempting first merger between large North American railways since 1999;Bill Ackman stepped up pressure on Norfolk Southern’s board to reconsider its rejection of Canadian Pacific’s takeover proposal when the activist investor fiercely criticised the US railway’s management.Mr Ackman, whose Pershing Square fund is CP’s biggest shareholder, compared the stance of NS’s board to that of CP’s before he won a proxy fight that installed Hunter Harrison, one of North America’s most experienced rail executives, as chief executive in 2012.However, investors proved resistant to the revised terms announced on Tuesday — which NS said would provide less value than CP’s initial proposal— and the company’s shares closed down 5.7 per cent at $86.31 in New York.The revised terms reduce the cash on offer to NS shareholders to $32.86, from $46.72 in the original offer put forward last month. However, they increase the proportion NS shareholders would receive in a post-merger company to 47 per cent, from 41 per cent previously.CP said that the new offer would give NS shareholders between $125 and $140 per share at the likely close of the transaction in May 2016. However, NS dismissed the latest bid, saying it would yield only $91.62 per share, against $92.06 previously.At $91.62, the offer values NS’s equity at $27.3bn.CP proposes putting itself into a “voting trust” that would keep its management separate from that of NS during the lengthy regulatory process.On a conference call, Mr Ackman compared the objections of NS’s board to the takeover to those that CP’s management raised during the proxy fight.At the time, CP’s board said that Mr Harrison would be unable to meet targets for improving operations that he has since achieved faster than expected.“It seems familiar to me,” Mr Ackman said.Mr Ackman also questioned whether NS, which has the worst ratio of operating costs to revenues of any of the seven big Class I US and Canadian railways, would meet the targets it has set since CP’s interest became known.“They say, ‘Now we’re going to get it right’ after 20 years of failure,” Mr Ackman said.Jim Squires, NS chief executive, said the revised terms were “even more uncertain and risky” than the previous proposal. He also reiterated NS’s stance that the Surface Transportation Board, which must approve any big US railroad mergers, would strike down any deal. CP has substantial US operations, as well as running Canada’s second-biggest rail network.Most industry observers in recent years have dismissed the idea that big US and Canadian railways would be allowed to merge since the sector is already highly consolidated.NS on Monday evening released a report by two former chairs of the STB, stressing the difficulties that any deal would face in gaining approval.The last merger between Class I railroads was completed in 1999, when NS and CSX together bought Conrail and split its assets between them.
24;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Railway wars: crazy train;Bill Ackman has developed a taste for complicated deal structures;Perhaps convoluted deal structuring, not stock picking, is Bill Ackman’s true forte. Last year he formed an investment vehicle with Valeant Pharmaceuticals to facilitate a combination between Valeant and rival Allergan. The gambit failed. Allergan ended up selling out to Actavis, while Valeant’s fortunes have gone in the opposite direction. For added humiliation, Mr Ackman and Valeant now face a lawsuit over their arrangement.Undaunted, Mr Ackman has devised another contraption to get a recalcitrant company to yield to his wishes. He owns 9 per cent of Canadian Pacific, which has made a hostile bid for US rival Norfolk Southern. Norfolk’s key defence is that the US Surface Transportation Board could take up to two years to sign off on the deal.To speed things up, Mr Ackman and CP’s boss, Hunter Harrison, have proposed a “voting trust” arrangement whereby the acquisition can be quickly closed and shareholders can get the cash and stock they have been promised (now worth $41bn). The trustee can independently manage Norfolk until STB approval is received, whereupon the two can be fully combined. How exactly this separate company will be managed and why CP shareholders themselves will benefit from the limbo is unclear.On pure economics, combining the two seems reasonable. CP’s all-important ratio of operating costs to revenue is 60 per cent, about 10 points better than Norfolk’s. Shippers, whose views are important to regulators, may be warming to consolidation. According to a Cowen survey, 58 per cent of shippers oppose a tie-up among the big seven North American railways — still a majority, but down from 70 per cent recorded in recent quarters.Norfolk believes it can achieve the mooted cost savings on its own. Even so, if Norfolk shareholders think they can get a premium (currently worth 26 per cent) they may be attracted by Mr Ackman’s gymnastics. But as the hedge fund manager has discovered, there are no extra points awarded for degree of difficulty.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
25;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-12-04T22:54:35Z;GoPro shares retreat after broker downgrade;Near-term headwinds face wearable sports market;Investors soured on shares in GoPro on Friday after Baird downgraded the wearable camera maker loved by sports enthusiasts and thrill seekers.The shares fell 4.91 per cent to $18 after analysts downgraded from “outperform” to “neutral” and cut their price target from $36 to $18.“Our checks have not suggested a meaningful pick-up in GoPro camera sales,” said William Power, an analyst at Baird.This seemed to be confirmed by disappointing fourth-quarter sales guidance from Ambarella, a chip supplier, he added.Citing “near-term headwinds in the wearable sports market”, Ambarella said late on Thursday it expected revenue in the range of $65m to $67.5m, below Wall Street estimates for $76.3m.Shares in GoPro, which made its trading debut in 2014 amid fanfare about wearables, have declined 71 per cent this year as enthusiasm has waned.The Hero4 Session camera received a tepid welcome when it launched this year and the company has lowered its price.Gap rebounded to close at $26.20, after declining as much as 3.3 per cent to $25.25 after the retailer said net sales had fallen 9 per cent to $1.57bn in November from a year ago, when they rose 6 per cent. Comparable sales, an important industry metric, fell 8 per cent.Same-store sales at its Banana Republic brand tumbled 19 per cent, compared with growth of 2 per cent during November 2014.Dorothy Lakner, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, said the retailer’s stores were usually busy the day after Thanksgiving, “even if customers were looking for clearance bargains”. However, “this Black Friday, they simply didn’t show up”.Same-store sales at the Gap brand fell 4 per cent, on top of a 4 per cent decline the previous year, while Old Navy sales declined 9 per cent, following 18 per cent growth last year.Ms Lakner said the Old Navy model was “being implemented at Gap and Banana as we move into 2016 and should lead to turns there”.Barnes & Noble fell 16.68 per cent to $10.04 after the US bookseller swung to a loss in the fiscal second quarter and said sales of Nook, its ereader, had tumbled.The New York-based company reported a loss of $39.2m, or 52 cents a share, in the three months ended in October, compared with a profit of $12.3m, or 12 cents a share, in the period a year ago.

26;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Norfolk Southern rejects $29bn Canadian Pacific bid;US rail operator sets out earnings-growth plan after saying takeover offer is ‘grossly inadequate’;Norfolk Southern, one of the largest US railway operators, has rejected a $29bn takeover approach from rival Canadian Pacific as “grossly inadequate,” and creating “substantial regulatory risks”.On a call with analysts on Friday, James Squires, Norfolk Southern’s chief executive, set out a plan that he said would create double-digit annual earnings growth to 2020, and deliver “substantially more value” to shareholders than accepting the offer that Canadian Pacific proposed last month.Norfolk Southern said its board, on which 11 of its 13 directors are independent, had unanimously rejected the approach.The company also published an open letter from Mr Squires to Hunter Harrison, his opposite number at Canadian Pacific, arguing that the proposed deal “would be detrimental to Norfolk Southern’s customer base”, which is “service sensitive”.The letter adds that a takeover could cause “harm to vital transportation infrastructure and the communities we serve”.Canadian Pacific responded with an equally strongly worded statement, saying it took exception to the “claims, misdirection and mischaracterisation of its offer and the benefits such a combination would provide to customers, shareholders, the industry and the public.”Canadian Pacific, the second-largest railway company in Canada, argued that combining its business with Norfolk Southern would create an end-to-end North American rail network “that would enhance competition and generate significant shareholder value.”Norfolk Southern’s shares fell after the initial statement was released but later regained some of their losses as the market rose, and closed 1.1 per cent down at $92.06.Canadian Pacific confirmed last month that it had approached Norfolk Southern about a possible deal, saying that it was offering a sizeable premium to its target’s share price, and that the two companies together could achieve faster earnings growth than either could on their own.Norfolk Southern gave an immediate negative response to that approach, describing it as “unsolicited, low-premium, non-binding and highly conditional”, but said its board would nevertheless consider the merits of the proposal carefully.As well as arguing that the Canadian Pacific offer undervalues its business, Norfolk Southern on Friday said a deal would be likely to run into trouble with the Surface Transportation Board, the US regulator.Mr Squires said in a statement there was a “high probability” that the board would reject the proposed takeover, “after years of disruption and expense”. Even if the deal were allowed to go through, he added, “it would be subject to a wide range of onerous conditions” that would reduce the value of the stock component of Canadian Pacific’s offer.[Takeover could cause] harm to vital transportation infrastructure and the communities we serveSpeaking to analysts, Mr Squires said the North American rail industry was facing challenges such as the decline in coal transport as coal-fired power plants shut down in the face of competition from cheap natural gas and tightening environmental regulations.As a result, he said, the company was cutting capacity and rationalising networks, “to minimise energy market-related risks to revenue”.The US industry has also suffered from the strength of the dollar, which has hit exports and hence rail traffic.However, Mr Squires added, Norfolk Southern was also pursuing growth opportunities in the US and international markets, as well as improving efficiency, to deliver its prospective double-digit annual earnings growth.Mr Squires also said the company planned to be “optimising pricing to reflect the value of our superior service”.He added: “We do not want to become just a commodity railroad”.Canadian Pacific said it would hold a conference call next week, on December 8, to give further “context and detail” on its offer, to address the concerns about regulatory approval raised by Norfolk Southern, and to “correct every inaccuracy”.It added that it was committed to the deal, and looked forward to engaging with Norfolk Southern’s management, board and shareholders.
27;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-11-17T23:24:36Z;Norfolk Southern criticises ‘highly conditional’ bid from CP;US railroad says offer values it about $28.3bn, less than 10 per cent premium to trading price;Norfolk Southern on Tuesday criticised an “unsolicited, low-premium, non-binding and highly conditional” potential bid from Canadian Pacific that would value the US’s fourth-biggest railroad network at around $28.3bn.But the US railroad said it would “carefully evaluate and consider” the bid from Canada’s number two railroad, aimed at creating the first railroad able to operate all the way across the US and Canada from the Pacific to the Atlantic.NS was reacting to CP’s confirmation hours earlier that it had formally written to NS to express interest in a merger. CP had said in its statement — which followed speculation on November 9 that it was considering a bid — that its offer would offer “a sizeable premium in cash and stock for NS shareholders”. CP had not disclosed the precise price it was offering.NS said CP was offering $46.72 in cash and 0.348 CP shares for every NS share. At Tuesday’s $135.58 closing price for CP in New York, the deal would offer a combined $94.94 per share, valuing the whole company at $28.3bn. NS’s shares closed at $86.97 on Tuesday in New York. They initially surged more than 6 per cent in after-market trading on CP’s confirmation of its approach. But they later pared those gains on news of the exact proposed terms and were 3.4 per cent up at $89.90 at 7pm.NS said the price offered a premium of less than 10 per cent to Tuesday’s share price — although the shares stood at only $79.90 before news of a possible approach first emerged.NS said it would consider the approach in the context of NS’s “strategic plans, and its ongoing review of opportunities to enhance stockholder value through strategic, financial and operational measures and pursue the best interests of the company and its stockholders.”CP had said in its statement that it would offer other railroads access to its network if its service levels declined or prices rose following a merger. The provision is designed to short circuit expected opposition from regulators and customers to a merger, which would be the first between the big Class I railroads in the US and Canada since 1999.NS nevertheless expressed doubt about the potential for winning approval. The industry’s current structure— with CSX and NS in the eastern US, Union Pacific and BNSF in the west, CP and Canadian National in Canada and Kansas City Southern operating north-south — is widely regarded as highly consolidated.“Any consolidation among Class I railroads in North America would face significant regulatory hurdles,” NS said.Tony Hatch, an independent railroad expert, said CP’s access suggestion was a surprise.“It has been expected that this would be the response by regulators [to a merger proposal],” Mr Hatch said of the proposal to open up the network. “It is, I will have to admit, a surprising tactic to put it out there at first.”An opening up of the combined company’s network to competitors could help to counter objections from shipper groups that customer service at CP under Hunter Harrison, chief executive since 2012, has worsened. Mr Harrison — one of the industry’s most admired executives, a former chief executive of Canadian National — has vastly improved the network’s efficiency but irritated some shipper groups who thought their needs had been neglected.The NS bid is CP’s second for another North American railroad under Mr Harrison. The company last October approached CSX but was rebuffed..
28;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-11-16T13:15:28Z;Canadian railroad merger efforts separated by a year of change;After being spurned by CSX, Canadian Pacific turns to Norfolk Southern;They are, ostensibly, strikingly similar events. In October last year, Canadian Pacific, one of Canada’s two main railroads, approached CSX, one of the two big railroads in the eastern US, about a potential merger. Talks quickly broke down. Then, on November 9, it emerged that CP had made a similar approach to Norfolk Southern, the other big railroad in the eastern US, in the hope that transaction might fare better.The 13 months between the two approaches have nevertheless transformed the commercial picture on the railroads in the US and Canada, which carry more than 40 per cent of interurban freight. The system a year ago was struggling to cope with surging traffic in coal, grain and oil. Traffic so far this year in the US is down 1.5 per cent, with coal — the most important single commodity — down 9.7 per cent, according to the Association of American Railroads.The question is whether the change in the industry’s fortunes will make the outcome of the current, early-stage talks between CP and Norfolk Southern different from those between CP and CSX.Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, said last year the rationale for a merger was to eliminate some of the many handovers between the seven big railroads — known as Class Is — that dominate the US and Canadian railroad systems. Those handovers — many of which occur around Chicago — contribute significantly to the system’s congestion.The appeal of a merger this year, according to Charles Cloutis, managing director for global trade and transportation at IHS Global Insight, could be to alleviate the financial effects of the traffic slowdown. Norfolk Southern’s traffic has suffered particularly heavily — its revenue ton-miles of traffic were 26 per cent down for the first nine months this year against last year. Coal traffic by ton-miles fell 36 per cent.Crude oil traffic, while far less significant for railroads than coal, was down 23.5 per cent year-on-year for US Class Is in the third quarter than in the same quarter last year.“I do think the revenues that have been lost have made some railroads think, ‘Should we think about merging with another railroad or consolidation?’” Mr Cloutis says.Tony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, says Norfolk Southern has suffered disproportionately because it handles large quantities of high-quality, exported Appalachian metallurgical coal, demand for which worldwide has plummeted.The aggregate 15 per cent year-on-year decline in tons of coal handled on its network in the third quarter included a 37 per cent decline in export metallurgical coal. Utility coal for power stations — which has suffered from low natural gas prices — declined only 10 per cent.“Norfolk Southern is now the outlier,” Mr Hatch says of how the company has suffered compared with others.Yet the changes in traffic levels may not be sufficient to change the two biggest barriers to a merger — Norfolk Southern’s expected resistance to a change or the regulatory hurdles.Norfolk Southern’s leadership was particularly adamant following CP’s approach last year to CSX that it was strongly opposed to further mergers, particularly because previous consolidation has disrupted services.Mr Hatch predicts that the company’s distinctive, inward-looking, operationally focused culture will make executives resistant to the idea of merger, despite a change of leadership in the last year. Wick Moorman, chief executive, stood down in March in favour of Jim Squires.“NS is the railroaders’ railroad,” Mr Hatch says.A still more formidable barrier could well be the US’s Surface Transportation Board. The board has shown little interest in further consolidation since a wave of mergers in the 1990s created the current, highly consolidated structure. NS and CSX dominate the eastern US, Union Pacific and BNSF — part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — the west and Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Canada and some lines in US. A seventh — far smaller — Class I, Kansas City Southern, operates north-south from Canada down into Mexico.A CP-NS merger would face a lengthy approval process and would involve the STB for the first time approving a Class I able to carry goods from coast to coast across North America. Few observers believe it has the appetite to do so.But the experience of the two merger approaches in two years shows that Mr Harrison — the most admired railroad operator of his era — is likely to keep trying. Having previously transformed the performance of Canadian National, Mr Harrison has done the same with every aspect of CP’s performance since Bill Ackman, the activist investor, installed him there in 2011.Mr Hatch says the primary driver for the mergers is that Mr Harrison thinks he can do anything better than a railroad’s current managers.“He does believe he can operate better,” Mr Hatch says. “He can effect a merger that will be good for the entire industry.”
29;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-11-10T00:15:35Z;Canadian Pacific makes second US rail play in 13 months;Early stage talks to buy rival Norfolk Southern, after failed CSX approach;Canadian Pacific Railway is in early stage talks with Norfolk Southern, the number two network in the eastern US, in its second effort in 13 months to gain scale by taking over a US-based rival.CP had hired bankers and was seeking financing for the transactions, those informed about the talks said. Norfolk shares closed up almost 11 per cent to $88.62 after Bloomberg News reported the approach, giving the company a $23.85bn market capitalisation. Shares in Toronto-listed CP closed up 5.69 per cent to C$188.79.CP said in a statement that there was “no material news pending at this time”. Norfolk declined to comment.The deal is the latest effort by Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive since 2012, to increase its reach by buying a larger rival.CP is the sixth biggest of the seven big Class I railroads in the US and Canada by revenues. The company last year sought to buy CSX, Norfolk’s bigger rival in the eastern third of the United States but abandoned the effort.Mr Harrison argued strongly, after abandoning the CSX talks last October, that greater railroad consolidation was vital to reduce the then-severe congestion across US and Canadian railroads. A merger would reduce the number of time consuming, congestion-causing handovers between different railroads in hubs such as Chicago, he said.The congestion has considerably improved as the previously sharp growth in coal, oil and grain movements has gone into reverse.Mr Harrison said after abandoning the bid for CSX that there had been little to choose between CSX and CP as takeover targets.Norfolk shares had slid 31 per cent over the past year before the spike on Monday. The company has suffered more than any other US railroad from sharp declines in coal volumes because exports from the Appalachian coal fields that it serves in Kentucky and West Virginia have fallen so sharply.Two people familiar with the matter said talks were at an early stage, but stressed that a deal was not certain.Tony Hatch, an independent rail analyst, said Norfolk was perceived as struggling in the present market conditions.Norfolk’s third-quarter net income — reported on October 28 — was down 19 per cent from the third quarter of 2014, at $452m, on revenues down 10 per cent to $2.71bn.Mr Hatch said he doubted a deal — which would need to undergo a lengthy clearance process with the US’s Surface Transportation Board — would go ahead. It could also lead to a damaging reassessment of the industry’s current, relatively relaxed regulation, he said.There have been no mergers between US or Canadian Class I railroads since 1999, when Norfolk and CSX took over Conrail, a large rival in the eastern US, and split it between them.“I think rail shippers and regulators and government folks on both sides of the border would either be in opposition or see this as an opportunity to achieve their agendas, which would not be in railroads’ best interests,” Mr Hatch said.
30;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-11-10T00:10:25Z;Railroad M&A: off-track;Bill Ackman’s troubles are not so easily soothed;With calamity consuming his long wager at Valeant Pharmaceutical and his short bet at Herbalife, it is easy to forget Bill Ackman’s savvier gambits. In 2011, the hedge fund investor acquired a 14 per cent stake in Canadian Pacific Railway and helped install Hunter Harrison, a respected railroad operator, to engineer a turnround.From late-2011 to late 2014, the shares rocketed 350 per cent. Mr Ackman’s stake (whittled down to 9 per cent after taking some profits in the interim) got another boost late on Monday when news broke that Canadian Pacific was pursuing a deal with a rival south of the border, Norfolk Southern, whose market value is $24bn. The potential tie-up sent Canadian Pacific shares up 6 per cent. The problem for Mr Ackman is that those gains may be shortlived.After decades of consolidation, the North American railroad industry is down to seven “Class I” operators — two in Canada, two in the eastern US, two in the western US and a skinny one in the middle. Mr Harrison remains a believer in mergers, with the goal of creating an efficient transcontinental provider. Last year he made an unsuccessful run at another big rival, CSX.But, since April, Canadian Pacific shares are off a third as the crash in commodity demand has reduced transport volumes. Over roughly the same period, Norfolk Southern shares are down about the same as coal accounts for a fifth of its transport volumes.A premium offer from Canadian Pacific would seem like a gift to Norfolk Southern shareholders as coal prices do not seem likely to improve soon. But as tempting as it may be to engage with Canadian Pacific, Norfolk Southern should stay wary. This is no quick path to cashing out: paying in shares means investors would have to stick around for the difficult integration with a similarly large competitor (Canadian Pacific’s market value is $22bn). Any deal would also require approval from the US Surface Transportation Board, which is unlikely to wave through further consolidation.Given his other troubles, Mr Ackman can be forgiven for looking to Canadian Pacific for some more cheer. But the light at the end of the tunnel is not always good news.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
31;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2015-09-14T16:33:57Z;US rail: off track;A mismatch between depreciation and capex mean the railroads are not in value territory yet;The US has, arguably, the healthiest large economy in the world. Railroads are a crucial part of its circulatory system. Yet shares in the biggest rail companies — Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern — are down by about a quarter so far this year. Relative to expected earnings, the shares are the cheapest they have been in two years. Surely, then, the value train is pulling into the station?No. The problem is an industry-wide gap between depreciation (the item on the income statement reflecting consumption of fixed capital) and capital expenditure (the cash the companies spend on fixed capital). When depreciation is less than capex, cash generation lags behind reported earnings (because capex is a cash expense and depreciation is not). For the railroads, the gap is longstanding but has widened notably over the past decade. This makes a certain amount of sense, given the industry’s solid growth: capex rises first when companies expand. But in general, depreciation and capex should converge as growth normalises.And growth is normalising, to put it kindly. Coal shipments have fallen badly, agricultural volumes are soft and a strong dollar does not help shipments to the country’s ports and borders. Sales at the big four are expected to fall this year, earnings will be flat to down. The market took lagging cash in its stride while the industry was expanding. But as growth investors and momentum-chasers look elsewhere, and value investors start assessing the stocks, the question is going to be asked: when is capex going to come down? Because at 30 or more times free cash flow, value investors are not going to consider these stocks cheap. And, with the exception of Kansas City Southern, capex has risen in the first half of this year.Last year, all four companies spent more on dividends and share buybacks than they generated in free cash. So they are adding leverage, too. Their debt loads are not too heavy but adding debt to please investors can only go on for so long. Increasing cash flow then becomes even more crucial.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
32;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Coal slump weighs on Union Pacific;Revenues drop 10 per cent as natural gas trumps coal;Union Pacific, the US’s largest rail network, on Thursday became the latest rail company to reveal the impact of sharp declines in coal traffic when it announced net income fell 7 per cent to $1.2bn after a 31 per cent drop in coal revenue.The fall in coal revenues compared with last year’s second quarter, to $679m, helped to push group revenue down 10 per cent to $5.43bn.The decline reflected the falling price of natural gas, which has pushed out coal as a fuel for generating electricity, weak demand for export coal and weather disruptions that closed some tracks. The volume of coal carried fell 26 per cent, pushing overall volumes down 6 per cent.Shares in the company fell 5.7 per cent by close of trading in New York at $92.12.The reversal in coal has ended a period when the US’s big railroads were scrambling to add capacity to cope with strong growth in movements of oil, agricultural products and shipping containers to head off growing congestion on their networks. On July 14, CSX, the main railroad in the eastern US, reported an 11 per cent second-quarter fall in coal revenues and a 15 per cent decline in traffic.UP, which operates in the western two-thirds of the US, suffered particularly heavily because its main coal traffic is low-quality coal from the Powder River Basin, which is used mainly for electricity generation. Much of the coal traffic for CSX and Norfolk Southern, which operate east of the Mississippi, is high-quality metallurgical coal used in steel production.Lance Fritz, UP chief executive, said that gains from price increases in the quarter had not been enough to overcome a “significant decrease” in demand.Industrial products — where revenue fell 14 per cent to $970m — and agricultural products — where revenue fell 7 per cent to $867m — also produced what Mr Fritz called “significant volume decreases”. Earnings per share fell 3.5 per cent to $1.38.However, he added that the company had made “meaningful progress” in “right sizing” its resources to the current volumes.Many of the challenges facing UP reflect the reversal in the high oil price, which significantly benefited railroads in recent years. The companies benefited not only from a boom in movements of domestically produced crude oil and supplies for new oil and gas wells, but also from strong movements of coal encouraged by the high price of natural gas.Intermodal traffic — shipping containers and truck trailers — benefited from pressure on companies to convert truck movements to rail to exploit rail’s greater fuel-efficiency.UP’s crude oil traffic for the quarter declined 29 per cent to 25,200 carloads. Intermodal volume was down 5 per cent to $1.09bn, despite a 2 per cent increase in volumes. International intermodal traffic — containers going to and from ports — grew only 1 per cent as US west coast ports continued to grapple with the effects of a months-long labour dispute. Domestic intermodal grew 3 per cent.Mr Fritz said the volume outlook remained “uncertain” but the company was “laser focused” on operating safely and efficiently.“We will continue to reduce costs and improve productivity as we further align resources with demand,” he said.
33;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Union Pacific growth held back by weaker coal and oil traffic;Rail operator hit by labour disruption at ports on US West Coast;The months-long disruption in US West Coast ports and falling traffic in coal and crude oil held back first-quarter profit growth at Union Pacific, operator of the US’s biggest rail network.The figures initially sent shares in the company, which operates in the two-thirds of the US west of the Mississippi, down 3 per cent in New York. By the close they were down 2.11 per cent at $108.39.Lance Fritz, chief executive, said that 9 per cent growth in earnings per share to $1.30 had been offset by a “sharp drop in volume”.Overall traffic declined 2 per cent. Coal, which suffered from mild winter weather in the western US, low natural gas prices and weak export demand, was down 7 per cent by volume and 5 per cent in revenue.Intermodal — shipping containers and truck trailers — fell 3 per cent by volume and 5 per cent by revenue. Domestic movements within the US grew 9 per cent but international volumes heading to and from ports fell 12 per cent because of severe disruption at ports hit by a labour dispute.Chemicals traffic was down 1 per cent by volume but the figure concealed a 38 per cent decline in movements of crude oil after sharp oil price declines made expensively produced US crude oil less attractive.“While we took actions during the quarter to adjust for the volume decline, we did not run an efficient operation,” Mr Fritz said.The company’s operating ratio, the proportion of revenue eaten up by expenses, shrank from 67.1 per cent in last year’s first quarter to 64.8 per cent. But the company attributed the improvement mainly to above-inflation price increases and the beneficial effects of a 38 per cent decline in the company’s average fuel price. The network had still suffered from “operational inefficiencies” as declining volumes left assets such as locomotives underused.UP is the second big US railway to announce disappointing figures for the first quarter. On April 13, Norfolk Southern, one of two big railways in the eastern US, warned that its first-quarter earnings per share — due to be announced next week — would be 15 per cent down on the same period last year. Norfolk Southern depends heavily on moving coal from the Appalachian coalfields.38%Decline in movements of crude oil at Union PacificRailways had until last year been among the biggest corporate beneficiaries of the US’s economic recovery. Movements of automotive products — which were up 7 per cent by volume year-on-year in the first quarter for UP — and agricultural goods — which were up 3 per cent — remain strong.However, the railways are heavily dependent on coal and intermodal traffic and had been growing fast in crude oil. Many of the railroads — particularly Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the second-biggest, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — have had to invest heavily to relieve congestion.UP’s net income rose 6 per cent to $1.15bn, on revenue down 0.4 per cent to $5.61bn.
34;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Earnings alert sends Norfolk Southern off-track;Shares in US railroad operator fell 5 per cent;Investors soured on Norfolk Southern as the second-largest US railroad operator in the eastern US warned that profits for the first quarter will fall.The Norfolk, Virginia-based company said it expects first-quarter earnings of $1 per share, shy of the $1.26 a share that Wall Street analysts had forecast. The company made $1.17 a share in the same quarter a year ago.The operator was squeezed by an ongoing drop in coal shipments, which helped lower revenues to $2.6bn. This was short of Wall Street’s forecasts for $2.7bn.Norfolk Southern said the decline in revenue also reflected lower fuel surcharges, which it levies on customers.Norfolk Southern’s fuel surcharge, which it negotiates with clients, is in part dependent on the price of West Texas Intermediate oil, which fell 10.7 per cent in the first quarter.“Norfolk Southern’s rail network was underperforming from a productivity standpoint heading into the first quarter, and conditions worsened due to challenging weather conditions during the quarter,” said Fadi Chamou, an analyst at BMO. “We sense that this is largely a transient issue and should gradually abate over the medium term.”Shares of Norfolk Southern, which have gained nearly 6 per cent in the past year, fell more than 4 per cent to $100.49, making the stock the biggest faller on the S&P 500.The S&P 500 railroads sub industry index declined 0.9 per cent, as Norfolk Southern’s pre-announcement struck a cautious view for the rail sector.“Norfolk Southern’s shares should decline materially on Tuesday and pressure other rail stocks (although we do not believe the earnings downside for other carriers will be as great as NSC’s due to differences in fuel programs),” said Jason Seidl, an analyst at Cowen and Co.JC Penney shares fell nearly 3 per cent to $9.15, after the retailer said a senior official at the company accidentally disclosed first-quarter same-store sales figures, a key industry metric, to an analyst.The company said the executive indicated in an email that to date same-store sales are up about 6 per cent because of the early timing of the Easter holiday. The Texas-based company expects comparable sales in the range of 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Wall Street analysts had forecast a 3.1 per cent rise in JC Penney’s same-store sales.A 12 per cent rise in first-quarter profits boosted shares of JPMorgan Chase. The lender said profits rose to $5.9bn, or $1.45 a share, from $5.3bn, or $1.28 a share, in the same period a year ago.Revenue climbed nearly 4 per cent to $24.8bn, just ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts for $24.5bn. JPMorgan shares rose 1.6 per cent to $63.04.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo shares fell 0.7 per cent to $54.19, after the lender reported a drop in first-quarter profits.US stocks were mixed, with the S&P 500 closing 0.2 per cent higher at 2,095.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 18,036.70 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.2 per cent to 4,977.29.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
35;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink.

Shares of UPS, Avis and Kansas City Southern have all fallen more than 10 per cent, while two-thirds of the Dow Jones Transportation Average members have declined since the start of the year.The Dow Transports retreat casts a cloud over the broader equity market as a bullish or bearish trend is flagged whenever the benchmark rallies or declines sharply. This is based on the notion that transport stocks reflect the underlying economy far better than the average company and thus foreshadow prospects for economic growth.Analysts with JPMorgan said a stronger dollar has crimped export activity, which is a key component of the rail business. Credit Suisse, which remains bullish on the rail industry, noted that a slide in energy prices has weighed on deliveries of coal and crude oil products.“We have witnessed the impact in the past few weeks during which CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern have each experienced notable year-over-year declines in coal,” said Allison Landry, an analyst with Credit Suisse.She added: “This, in conjunction with a step down in shale-related volumes relative to the beginning of the quarter, potentially leading to extra costs related to a mismatch in the resource-to-demand equation, will likely result in downward first-quarter earnings revisions.”That left Dow Transports on course for lagging its namesake counterpart for a fifth consecutive day on Thursday. The benchmark has registered a fall of almost 5 per cent this year, reflecting in part investors increasing bearish or so-called short positions in transport companies after two years of double-digit gains.Shares of SPDR S&P Transport ETF constituents, which includes CSX, FedEx and Avis Budget, on loan to short the underlying stock have climbed 33 basis points from a low touched in January. At 3.4 per cent, the figure was the highest since the middle of November, according to data provider Markit.The case for transport stocks rests largely on wider US and global activity as the rail and shipping behemoths depend on increases in trade to fill rail cars and cargo holds.Retailers have warned that port disputes on the US West Coast have stunted supply chains, prompting companies including Union Pacific to forecast first-quarter volumes that will be flat to slightly down as it takes weeks to clear inventory backlogs.The strength of the dollar is also weighing on export-heavy industries, including semiconductors, as big corporations put systems upgrades on hold.“Foreign demand should be cut as long as [the] dollar stays in this area,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Until we have consistent strength in the economy, domestic companies may say, ‘Let’s hold off a little bit’.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
37;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2014-11-21T20:41:50Z;Rail chief apologises for ‘lousy’ service;Freight investment ‘will slow’ if regulators tighten rules to curb returns;US railroads will slow badly needed investment to improve their “lousy” service if regulators tighten rules to restrict the returns they can make, Matt Rose, one of the industry’s most respected executives, has said.Mr Rose, executive chairman of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, operator of the US’s second-biggest rail network, was speaking after his company – part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway – pledged to invest a record $6bn in capital expenditure next year.BNSF and other railroads urgently need to spend on increasing track capacity after a surge in traffic growth has overwhelmed parts of their networks that were previously lightly used. The resulting congestion has slowed rail service across much of the US and prompted the industry’s regulator – the Surface Transportation Board – to hold hearings on deteriorating service at which there have been calls for restrictions on railroads’ charging power and other tighter rules.In a speech at the annual Rail Trends conference in New York, Mr Rose apologised to customers for recent service on his company’s network. BNSF’s trains slowed down from last October as the company experienced surging grain, crude oil and intermodal – container and trailer – traffic.BNSF has been a big beneficiary of the surge in movements from new US crude oil producing regions, as well as movements of “fracking sand” and other goods associated with the business. BNSF last year attracted 50 per cent of all growth on the US rail freight network.“It’s been a lousy year, two years, from a service point of view,” Mr Rose said. “I want to apologise for that.”However, he warned that new, tighter rules on returns would form a “regulatory headwind” for the industry if implemented.“With regulatory certainty, we can and will build the capacity,” Mr Rose said. “If the headwinds occur, railroads like ours will slow that investment.”With regulatory certainty, we can and will build the capacity. If the headwinds occur, railroads like ours will slow that investmentMr Rose also criticised the idea that mergers could improve the situation. Canadian Pacific, Canada’s second-biggest railroad, in October briefly held talks about a potential merger with CSX, the main railroad on the US east coast. Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, has also floated the idea that it could merge with Norfolk Southern, the eastern US’s number two railroad.Mr Harrison had argued that a CP-CSX merger would cut out a large number of interchanges in Chicago, the hub of Canadian and US rail networks which has become seriously congested.Mr Rose said railroads should merge only where one of the two parties was in financial distress or a railroad had insufficient capital to invest in its network. “I don’t believe either of those is in play today,” he said.Among BNSF’s projected $6bn capital expenditure is $1bn of spending on the company’s Northern Corridor route across the northern great plains. The company is double-tracking hundreds of miles of the route to cater for the sudden growth of traffic.It was the growth in such previously lightly used routes that had caused the recent congestion, Mr Rose said. He pointed out that overall traffic volumes had not yet reached the previous peak in 2006.“We’re using different parts of our network,” Mr Rose added. “The last peak didn’t even include crude oil, fracking sand and all that other traffic we’re handling related to energy production.”
38;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2014-10-21T20:37:49Z;Rail boss says worst ever gridlock looms;Canadian Pacific chief warns as quarterly net income rises 23%;North America’s rail industry cannot continue on its current path and avoid unprecedented gridlock, Hunter Harrison, Canadian Pacific chief executive, warned on Tuesday, after abandoning talks over a potential merger with CSX.Mr Harrison, one of the industry’s most respected figures, had argued that a merger between CP, the number two rail company in Canada, and CSX, the US east coast’s main rail company, would reduce congestion that is slowing service all over the US and Canada.However, the company’s proposals have provoked widespread scepticism, with many in the industry arguing that a merger was unlikely to receive regulatory approval and that a deal might initially make congestion problems worse. There have been no significant mergers in US rail since 1999, when CSX and Norfolk Southern, its rival on the US east coast, took over Conrail, the formerly government-owned rail company, and split it up between them.Congestion started with the rapid growth of grain and oil traffic in plains states such as North Dakota and has gradually spread to the whole of the US and Canada, partly because of the backlog’s effects on a few bottlenecks. Some of the worst problems are in Chicago, where all seven big North American railroads – known as the Class Is – meet and exchange trains.CP announced on Monday that it was abandoning its talks with CSX.Mr Harrison made his comments on the same day CP announced third-quarter net income up 23 per cent to C$400m because of the rapid growth in grain and oil traffic that is contributing to congestion.“We’re quickly approaching a time where none of this works,” Mr Harrison said of the combination of rapid traffic growth and slowly tightening regulation that the industry faces.“We cannot continue to go down the road that we’re going down and be successful and not have gridlock beyond anything we’ve experienced before,” Mr Harrison told analysts and reporters on a conference call. “So I think that’s something we should all take under advisement.”Mr Harrison said that a merged CP-CSX would have moved much of its cross-border traffic away from Chicago and instead moved through Buffalo or Albany in upper New York State.He also revealed that there had not been “a great deal of difference” between CSX and Norfolk Southern as potential merger targets.“There were some issues that pushed one a little bit ahead,” he said.Norfolk Southern reports its third-quarter results on Wednesday.CP’s shares were up 1.9 per cent in New York at $200.18. CSX’s shares were up 2 per cent at $34.19 and Norfolk Southern’s up 2.4 per cent at $109.64.Mr Harrison said that, if other companies in the industry thought they had other means of addressing current service backlogs without new mergers, he was happy to hear them.The company hauled 6.79bn revenue ton-miles (RTMs) of Canadian-grown grain for the quarter, up 27 per cent on the same period last year, and 3.01bn RTMs of US-grown grain, up 20 per cent. Crude oil shipments also increased 60 per cent to 4.63bn RTMs.Canada’s government in March said it would fine both CP and Canadian National, its bigger rival, if they failed to meet set targets for the amount of grain they handled weekly. CP said on Tuesday it was meeting the targets.The US’s Surface Transportation Board has held hearings on the performance of CP and BNSF in moving last year’s record grain harvest amid a surge in traffic in the great plains.CSX declined to comment on Mr Harrison’s remarks.
39;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2014-10-13T17:26:15Z;CSX/Canadian Pacific: railway to heaven;Both railroads have gone through turnrounds;Cable companies and railroads are not dissimilar. Both have capital-intensive networks snaking through their home regions. Within those regions, they face limited direct competition. So if one industry can attempt consolidation across geographies, perhaps the other can as well. Thus Canadian Pacific has reportedly approached CSX, one of two railways in the Northeastern US, following a track laid by Comcast in its pursuit of Time Warner Cable.Big railroad deals come with big regulatory risk. North America has shrunk to seven large regional railroads, with two in most regions (CSX shares the east coast with Norfolk Southern). Regulators quashed the merger of Canadian National with BNSF in 1999.CSX has transformed its operations in the past decade. Its operating margin has gone from 10 to 30 per cent, as the company has squeezed labour and other costs. That is all the more remarkable given that its coal volumes have dropped nearly a third in the last decade. Coal now accounts for just a quarter of CSX’s total volumes.An even starker turnround has taken place at CP. Since investor Bill Ackman and new CEO Hunter Harrison arrived in 2012, CP shares are up 200 per cent. Mr. Harrison is widely considered the best manager in rail. He has taken CP’s operating margin from 20 to 35 per cent. Last week, he said CP would double its earnings per share in the next four years.The rationale of creating a transcontinental railroad is compelling. Connecting CP and CSX could ease the bottlenecks at the Chicago rail exchange where many North American lines meet. Crude oil could flow more easily from the Western continent to Eastern refineries.The deal maths lines up nicely as well. Both have equity values of just above $30bn. CP trades at 20 times earnings. With CSX trading at only 15 times before the rumours, CP has some room to pay premium. The bigger negotiating challenge: where to allocate the antitrust risk.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
40;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2014-04-23T16:54:17Z;US airline industry gathers speed on strong results;;The US airline industry, which has outperformed a broadly turbulent market this year, gathered further speed on Wednesday after results from Delta and Boeing topped Wall Street profit forecasts.Shares in both companies advanced in early-afternoon trading, as Delta shrugged off severe winter weather and Boeing reported robust global demand for commercial jetliners.Delta, the third-largest US airline, said net revenues grew 5 per cent from a year earlier, to $8.9bn, as it flew more densely packed flights in the US and expanded domestic and Latin American service.Profits in the quarter rose to $213m, or 25 cents per share, compared to $7m a year earlier. When adjusting for restructuring and other expenses, earnings per share rose to 33 cents, ahead of expectations. Analysts at Goldman Sachs called the results “solid”.Boeing also surprised Wall Street as it reported an 18 per cent rise in deliveries of its passenger jets and increased earnings guidance for the current year.Revenues at its commercial aeroplane division rose by almost a fifth to $12.7bn in the quarter, while operating margins firmed to 11.8 per cent from 11.4 per cent. Boeing reported a commercial order backlog of $374bn, which included 235 net new orders during the quarter.“Despite some variation in emerging market growth rates, we see no softening of demand for commercial aeroplanes,” Jim McNerney, chief executive, said on a call with analysts. “In fact, underpinning the strength of the cycle relative to past ones is a sustained high level of replacement demand.”The results from Delta and Boeing come a day ahead of earnings from airlines representing more than half of US domestic passenger air capacity and revenues. They include United Continental, American Airlines, Southwest and JetBlue.Four of the five top-performing members of the Dow Jones Transportation Index, which also includes rail and freight shipping companies, have been airlines. The index itself has climbed 5 per cent this year, compared to a small dip in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Shares in Boeing rose 2.41 per cent on Wednesday to end at $130.62 while Delta climbed more than 6 per cent to close at $37.07, putting it among the top performers on the benchmark S&P 500.Gilead Sciences said sales of Sovaldi, the $1,000-a-day hepatitis C drug at the centre of a political row, tallied $2.3bn during its first full quarter on the market. The debut helped lift Gilead’s net sales 97 per cent from a year earlier to $5bn, while profits tripled to $2.2bn, or $1.33 per share.Both sales and profits easily topped Wall Street forecasts. Shares in the company climbed 3 per cent before settling back to finish 1.39 per cent higher at $73.87.Analysts at Citigroup estimate the hepatitis C treatment could enjoy sales of more than $12bn at its peak in 2016.Despite the better than expected earnings from Boeing, Delta and Gilead, as well as Dow Chemical, Procter & Gamble, and Norfolk Southern, stock markets slid. The benchmark S&P 500 broke a six-day winning streak, slipping 0.22 per cent to close at 1,875.39 after new home sales showed a second consecutive month of decline.“The trend in the data has been soft for a while now, and separate reports on mortgage purchase applications and homebuilder sentiment as well as figures related to the existing home sales market are indicative of weak conditions in the housing market persisting for the time being,” JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.08 per cent to 16,501.65 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended 0.83 per cent lower at 4,126.97.Intuitive Surgical led the declines on the Nasdaq 100, home to the largest companies on the wider Nasdaq index, after cutting forecasts for sales of its surgical robots.First-quarter profits slid 77 per cent to $44m, with procedure growth on Intuitive’s da Vinci systems expected to rise 2 to 8 per cent this year, compared with as much as 12 per cent earlier. Its shares fell 11.46 per cent to close at $373.93.
41;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2014-02-26T21:19:34Z;Keep working at oil safety, rail chief says;;North American freight railways “have to continue to work” at improving safety of crude oil movements, one of the industry’s most respected executives has said in the wake of a spate of spectacular crashes, including one that killed scores of people.Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, was speaking after federal regulators on Tuesday announced the fourth emergency safety order in the past seven months on movements of crude oil by rail. The order required shippers sending crude oil by rail from the Bakken shale oil region of North Dakota and Montana to check its composition before loading it.Bakken crude has turned out to be far more volatile and prone to explosion than other crude oil and there have been suspicions that some of the region’s crude may contain high levels of particularly dangerous gases.Tuesday’s emergency order – from the federal Department of Transportation – comes after the DoT last week announced a memorandum of understanding with the rail industry’s main players on implementing a series of safety improvements. Crude oil trains will move more slowly, consideration will be given to whether movements could be rerouted away from urban areas, and track inspections will be stepped up.Mr Moorman said there had been a “thoughtful and rational discussion and analysis” of the safety issues between rail executives – including himself – and the DoT over crude oil safety. The industry had stressed in discussions how rapidly its safety record had improved in recent decades, following the industry’s 1980 deregulation.But he went on: “While we have done very well, we know that we have to continue to work and get better.”Mr Moorman insisted railroads were not lax about safety. “They’re both very expensive and very disruptive to railroad operations,” he said of accidents. Norfolk Southern suffered a severe crash in 2005 when a train hauling chlorine gas derailed and the fumes killed nine people.“It’s not like we’re not totally focused on preventing any incident of any kind involving any kind of train,” he said.The current concerns started when a poorly parked train of Bakken crude ran away in July in Quebec and crashed and exploded in the town of Lac-Mégantic, killing 47 people. There have since been several other spectacular incidents, including a crash on December 30 in Casselton, North Dakota, in which a crude oil train hit a derailed grain train and the oil train cars blew up.Mr Moorman said the recent incidents had shown the need for better thermal insulation of tank cars to prevent their blowing up so readily if other cars caught fire, and for better pressure relief systems.Many of the recent safety efforts have been aimed at improving the robustness of tank cars and phasing out or upgrading the less robust cars that make up most of the existing fleet.NS, which operates in the eastern US, mostly handles crude oil movements to refineries in the US northeast.It would take “two or three years” to introduce new, safer rail cars, Mr Moorman said.He added: “I’m comfortable that we can do this safely and it’s a business opportunity.”
42;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2014-01-23T18:45:25Z;Union Pacific defies coal declines to beat forecasts;;Union Pacific on Thursday became the second rail freight network in two days to announce far stronger than expected full-year results as strong agricultural and automotive demand allowed it to defy falling coal and oil volumes.Fourth-quarter net income for UP was up 13 per cent to $1.17bn, on revenues up 7 per cent to $5.3bn. The earnings per share figure – up 16 per cent to $2.55 – was 6 cents better than consensus forecasts.The results sent shares in UP, operator of the US’s biggest rail freight network, up 3.3 per cent to $174.12 by the close of trade.UP’s results came the day after Norfolk Southern, the US’s fourth-biggest operator, announced fourth-quarter net income up 24 per cent to $513m, on revenues up 7 per cent to $2.9bn.The results illustrate how US railroads continue to be able to increase prices and improve returns, despite declines in coal volumes– traditionally the biggest single commodity for railroads. US power stations have been using far less coal as the country’s shale oil and gas boom has sent natural gas prices tumbling.UP’s fourth-quarter coal volumes fell 10 per cent and its coal revenue declined 1 per cent to $985m, while NS’s coal volumes fell 8 per cent and its coal revenues fell 2.4 per cent to $641m.UP also defied a 22 per cent fourth-quarter decline in shipments of crude oil, which has been one of the fastest-growing areas for the industry.Eric Butler, UP’s head of marketing and sales, said greater supplies of imported oil at Gulf Coast refineries had depressed shipments from West Texas and Oklahoma. Changing price differentials had also prompted shippers to send less oil from the Bakken Shale in North Dakota to Louisiana refineries, which UP is best placed to serve.Jack Koraleski, chief executive, said 2013 had been a “terrific year” for UP.“For the first time in six quarters, we reported overall volume growth despite significantly weaker coal shipment, which highlights the strength of our diverse franchise, the extensive network reach we have to various markets and a strong grain harvest,” he said of the fourth quarter.The company had improved its operating ratio – the proportion of its revenues consumed by operating costs – to 65 per cent for the quarter. The figure was above 70 per cent as recently as 2010.Mr Koraleski said UP now expected to return a full-year operating ratio below 65 per cent before the target date of 2017, but he could not be sure when. The 2013 full-year figure was 66.1 per cent.UP attributed its improved profitability in the quarter mainly to a 3.5 per cent increase in “core pricing”, its average price per unit shipped. NS also succeeded in raising its core prices.UP’s agricultural traffic in the quarter rose 13 per cent, while revenue grew 19 per cent. Automotive traffic – both completed cars and parts – rose 10 per cent, with revenue up 17 per cent.

Profits of $513m, or $1.64 a share, topped Wall Street expectations by more than a dime.“We’re seeing the results of our investments in network capacity and technology enhance our ability to offer superior service to all of our customers,” chief executive Wick Moorman said.Shares in Apple rose 0.44 per cent to $551.51 after billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn took to Twitter on Wednesday to attack the company’s board for a “great disservice” in not increasing the company’s share buyback programme.Since starting to buy Apple shares in August, Mr Icahn, a veteran activist investor, has been urging chief executive Tim Cook to lift the size of the share buyback programme. Mr Icahn said his investment in the iPhone maker topped $3bn on Tuesday, after purchasing $500m worth of shares over the past two weeks.In December, Mr Icahn scaled back his demand that Apple return $150bn after finding little support among fellow shareholders, people familiar with the matter said.The Silicon Valley company has been under pressure to return more of its cash pile to investors since Apple shares began falling from a record high in September 2012.Entry-level handbag maker Coach continued to face pressure from rival Michael Kors, with shares falling almost 6 per cent to $49.41 after reporting a 6 per cent decline in overall sales in its fiscal second quarter, which includes the important holiday selling period.Same store sales in North America dropped 13.6 per cent in the three months to December 28, worse than the 6.8 per cent decline expected by Wall Street analysts.Chief executive Victor Luis blamed lower traffic in its stores for the declines. For the quarter, profits at Coach dropped to $297m, or $1.06 a share, from $353m, or $1.23, a year earlier.Investors sold off positions in US chipmaker AMD after the company forecast sales would slow at a steeper rate than analysts expected, after market close on Tuesday.AMD said it expected sales would fall 16 per cent, plus or minus 3 per cent, in the current quarter. Sales of the company’s chips used in PCs, once its largest business, declined 13 per cent from a year earlier to $722m, while overall sales rose 37 per cent to $1.59bn.“AMD quarterly calls never seem to be without controversy,” Citi analyst David Phipps said. “The [fourth quarter] results were ahead of expectations for sales and ebitda, but the sales guidance was below consensus by about 3 per cent.”The company has faced similar pressures as rival Intel, as consumer buying habits shift away from traditional laptops and PCs to tablets and smartphones.Shares in AMD ended 12.23 per cent lower at $3.66.International Business Machines fell 3.21 per cent to close at $182.39.The company, which is grappling with a slowdown in some of its once fast-growing emerging markets, said fourth-quarter profits fell 1 per cent from a year ago to $16.5bn. Revenues dropped 5 per cent to $27.7bn, missing Wall Street forecasts.Analysts at JPMorgan, Sanford Bernstein and Barclays lowered their price targets on the company following its results on Tuesday after markets closed.“We recommend that investors take profits in the stock after the disappointing earnings results and outlook,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz said. “Given the string of eight quarters of mixed performances, we think the IBM model is not nimble enough to jump-start the revenue and growth profiles.”US markets ended the day relatively unchanged, with the S&P 500 edging up 0.06 per cent to 1,844.85. The Dow declined 0.25 per cent to 16,373.34 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.41 per cent to finish at 4,243.00.
44;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2013-12-02T13:09:49Z;Rail chiefs at odds with watchdog after Quebec oil train crash;;Two of North America’s most senior rail executives have exposed big differences with regulators over the response to July’s multiple-fatality Quebec oil train crash by questioning the need for tightened safety rules.Hunter Harrison, chief executive of Canadian Pacific, and Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, said it would make more sense for the industry to focus on enforcing existing rules rather than introduce new ones following the tragedy.However, Joseph Szabo, administrator of the US Federal Railroad Administration, insisted it made sense to review rules in light of the growing traffic in “volatile” liquids, including crude oil, as the US experiences a shale oil boom.The three were addressing the annual Rail Trends conference in New York following the crash in July of a runaway crude oil train that killed 47 people and obliterated much of the town centre of Lac-Mégantic in Quebec.Rail has emerged as a vital means of transporting US and Canadian-produced crude on routes not well served by pipelines. Volumes have returned to growth after a brief dip in the third quarter and some railroads expect to carry twice the volume of oil this year as last year.Both Transport Canada, the Canadian regulator, and the FRA have rushed to introduce more prescriptive rules– particularly for parked trains – since July’s crash.Mr Harrison said new rules would not help if existing rules were being ignored. “If they don’t live up to one, two and three [rules], why are they going to live up to four, five and six?” he said.If they don’t live up to one, two and three [rules], why are they going to live up to four, five and six?The Lac-Mégantic crash occurred after a driver left a train of crude oil cars unattended with too few handbrakes applied. It broke away after firefighters extinguishing a small fire on the locomotive turned off the engine, which had kept the separate air brake system working.The driver’s behaviour appears to have breached the existing rules of the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway, the operator.“You can put any number of rules in that you want,” Mr Moorman said. “If you don’t create a culture of rule observance and safety, they are not going to be a safeguard.”However, Mr Szabo said it was vital the FRA learned from accidents by examining whether present rules were adequate. “The first place we’re going . . . is to review existing rules and understand are they still appropriate, given that you could argue the level of risk has increased on our network with more volatile products being involved,” he said.
45;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2013-05-14T23:03:27Z;Transport: Virginia port shows transport pressures;Investment in extra capacity and rate changes illustrate the continuing potential of coal, oil and gas, writes Robert Wright;On the waterfront in the port of Lamberts Point, Virginia, the activity is more intense than for several years. Two machines, owned by Norfolk Southern (NS), one of two big railroads in the eastern US, haul railcars two at a time up to a big rotating drum. With a sudden twist, the drums turn, tipping out coal from the cars on to a conveyor belt that leads to a waiting ship. A plume of coal dust fills the air.The activity at Lamberts Point, a dedicated coal port that NS owns, reflects the state of the US coal market. Faced with slumping domestic coal demand, NS, according to Wick Moorman, its chief executive, has cut its prices for handling export coal to boost volumes.It is one of many examples of how transport providers’ investments in new capacity and changes to rate structures have helped to facilitate and smooth the big changes under way in US energy markets. NS and CSX, its bigger rival in the eastern US, have both sought to boost coal export volumes to make use of their extensive networks in the coal-producing parts of the Appalachians and Illinois River Basin.In the western US, the two big railroads – Union Pacific and BNSF – have invested heavily in the region’s booming oil production. Railroads across North America increasingly handle sand and other material going to wells that produce natural gas by hydraulic fracturing. The question is whether the recent big changes are likely to become permanent, with coal traffic depressed and significant oil traffic by rail, or whether coal volumes will rebound and oil revert to pipelines.For NS the price cuts in the first quarter produced a 21 per cent increase in export coal volumes that slowed the overall decline for all coal traffic – including domestic volumes – to 4.4 per cent. Revenues from transporting coal, however, fell 17 per cent to $635m.“There’s some US coal that just doesn’t compete in the global market that well,” Mr Moorman says.The company has changed its rate structures to improve such coal’s competitiveness. “It’s still a good business,” Mr Moorman says. “But the rates are down 25 or 30 per cent.”At the heart of NS’s coal conundrums and energy transport in North America lies the question of how most cost-effectively to bring products to the markets that will deliver the highest prices. The effect has been particularly marked, according to Jonathan Garrett, an upstream analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy, for producers of oil from the vast Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana.Wood Mackenzie estimates that although it costs about 60 per cent more to move crude oil by rail than by pipeline, the benefits have more than outweighed the costs. Producers moving the Bakken’s light sweet crude by rail have been able to sell it to coastal US refineries at the international benchmark price of Brent Crude.If they had moved it by pipeline, it would have sold at the price at the inland pipeline junction of Cushing, Oklahoma, which has been consistently running $13/bbl lower than Brent. Wood Mackenzie calculates that Continental Resources, the biggest holder of Bakken production and exploration acreage, has boosted the PV10 value – an industry standard measure – of its holdings by $574m by using rail to reach coastal refineries, rather than only pipelines. PV10 measures the net present value of an area’s future revenues, discounted by 10 per cent annually and net of production expenses. “If you can rail your barrels to markets where you get premium pricing, then you see a premium over what you’ve been receiving in the past,” Mr Garrett says. “Now you’re getting $85 a barrel, rather than $75.”Similar calculations lie behind changes in coal movements by rail, according to Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer of CSX. Coal from the Illinois river basin, which CSX serves, can compete with natural gas for power generation when natural gas prices are about $3.50 per million British thermal units (mBTUs).Appalachian coal competes only from about $4.50 per mBTU. A recent rise in gas prices has taken rates only up to around $4.10 per mBTU, compared with $13 at their summer 2008 peak.The best hope of finding a profitable market for more expensively-produced coal lies outside the US – although CSX still experienced a 3 per cent decline in its coal export volumes for the first quarter against last year. Its domestic coal volumes fell 14 per cent.“While the US is going through this big energy renaissance as a result of fracking and horizontal drilling, the rest of the world isn’t going through that energy renaissance,” Mr Eliasson says. “Coal is still the baseload capacity in most countries for electricity generation.”In the longer term, both Mr Moorman and Mr Eliasson express hope that rising gas prices and the gradual running down of big coal stockpiles at power stations should mean demand for their domestic coal services has at least hit bottom.For railroads in the western US, meanwhile, the outlook in energy is more positive.Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive. says there is no immediate prospect that, even if some rail volumes move to new pipelines, a pipeline will be built to move crude oil from North Dakota to the US east coast.“Our markets will move around a little bit,” Mr Rose says. “We don’t see at all that our business is going to go away.”
46;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2013-04-14T14:20:07Z;US rail operators divided over LNG future;;The US rail industry has reached a crossing point in its debate over making a transition from running diesel fuel to adopting liquefied natural gas.Natural gas power could slash costs for US railroads, which operate the world’s largest and busiest rail freight network, compared with existing diesel fuel. Despite a recent increase in prices, US natural gas prices remain historically low at a time when oil – and diesel fuel – prices are near record highs.Matt Rose, chief executive of BNSF, the US’s second biggest rail network by route miles, is one of the most enthusiastic exponents for a potential switch to LNG. BNSF could convert on its own to using LNG if necessary, Mr Rose said.“We don’t change a lot in our industry,” Mr Rose said. “There was a big change from steam to diesel. This is that kind of change.”However, Jack Koraleski, chief executive of Union Pacific, operator of the biggest network, Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, operator of the fourth-biggest, and Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer for CSX, the number three, have all expressed reservations.Mr Eliasson said it was “pretty clear” the economics of operating on LNG would work. But a switch at one railroad could jeopardise the smooth running of locomotives between different railroads.“It’s much more a question of how much and how quickly will the industry convert small portions, large portions or all of their fleet over to utilise LNG,” Mr Eliasson said.Mr Moorman called LNG conversion “an extraordinarily interesting opportunity”. But he queried whether gas-powered locomotives would generate the power of diesels.Mr Koraleski acknowledged it was undoubtedly possible to run a locomotive on natural gas, but he added: “The question is, can you do it economically, can you do it safely and can you do it on a consistently reliable basis?”The LNG, which is generally regarded as cleaner than diesel, would be carried in supercooled liquefied form either within the locomotive itself or an adapted freight car. Both GE Transportation and Caterpillar are co-operating with railroads in trials of the new technology due to start later this year.Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE Transportation, the General Electric business that is one of the US’s two big locomotive builders, said his company was developing LNG power in response to customers’ demands. He added that the company’s intended LNG locomotives should produce at least the same power as existing ones running on diesel. The locomotives might also be able to run further than existing ones between fuelling stopsGE’s main rival, the EMD unit of Caterpillar, said locomotives were likely to be able to carry substantial quantities of fuel within existing locomotive bodyshells, even without a neighbouring car to carry additional stocks.
47;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2013-04-07T19:41:18Z;Coal’s decline comes as oil booms;;The boom in rail-borne crude oil movements from windswept North Dakota has run parallel with a downturn in the fortunes of another area that was once North American rail’s new energy frontier: Wyoming’s Powder River Basin.US utility companies turned to Powder River Basin coal in the 1970s and 1980s because its low sulphur content helped them meet the era’s strict new energy requirements.The area provides most of the coal that both Union Pacific and BNSF move.Capacity on rail routes to and from the area was very tight until recently.However, low natural gas prices after the US shale boom have prompted many utilities to drop coal where possible, pushing BNSF’s coal traffic down 6 per cent last year and Union Pacific’s down 14 per cent.Coal’s decline poses even greater problems for the main railways in the eastern US– CSX and Norfolk Southern – which rely heavily on carrying more expensively mined coal from the Appalachians, Pennsylvania and the Illinois basin.Neither of the big eastern railways are benefiting as much as the western railroads from fresh energy sources, yet there is little doubt that every big US railway would appreciate some revival in the coal business.Even after last year’s decline, coal accounted for 24 per cent of BNSF’s freight revenues last year and 20 per cent of Union Pacific’s.Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, says even the breakneck growth in oil and gas-related movements is still only halfway to making up for the revenue lost because of declining coal volumes.Nevertheless, Jack Koraleski, Union Pacific’s chief executive, expresses optimism that better times are approaching.Natural gas prices are expected to rise – and cheap PRB coal will compete after even a modest price rise.Both Union Pacific and BNSF are also working on plans for providing new coal export facilities in Washington State that could take PRB coal to Chinese power stations.“We’re cautiously positive [about the] outlook for our coal business,” Mr Koraleski says.
48;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Norfolk Southern chief promises to invest;;The chief executive of the big US rail network operator most vulnerable to changing energy consumption in the country has vowed to resist price-cutting and invest in new traffic flows as coal transit suffers.Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, was speaking to the Financial Times after the railroad reported coal volumes down 13 per cent in 2012, compared with the year before, and coal freight revenues down 17 per cent. The declines were continuing this year, he said.Coal accounted for more than a quarter of NS's revenues last year – a higher proportion than any other big North American rail operator. The company, which operates in the eastern US, has more limited access than western railroads to new crude oil traffic, much of which originates in North Dakota.NS’s net income declined 8.7 per cent to $1.75bn last year, compared with 2011, on revenues down 1.2 per cent to $11bn.However, Mr Moorman vowed that the company – which like other rail operators in the past decade has increased prices sharply – would resist cutting rates to seek new traffic.“The rail industry has enjoyed a very good run on pricing and to the extent possible we want to preserve that run and, when we can, carry [it] forward,” Mr Moorman said.Volumes in coal for power stations fell particularly sharply – 17 per cent – as utilities switched to cheap natural gas. Domestic demand for metallurgical coal for steelmaking slipped 5 per cent, while demand for export metallurgical coal fell 2 per cent.He said the company would strike a balance between profit margins and growth by further developing the intermodal business – carrying trailers and shipping containers by rail.“Coal is really important but it’s not the be all and end all,” Mr Moorman said.The intermodal business – which competes with low-margin trucking– commands thinner margins than NS’s traditional coal mainstay. But it remained flat, rather than shrinking, in the 2009 and 2010 downturn and enjoyed volumes 4 per cent up in 2012 compared with the year before, and revenues up 5 per cent.The company has invested heavily in raising tunnel roofs and bridges to allow trains to carry containers stacked two-high, which is more efficient.“Intermodal is a growth story,” Mr Moorman said. “It will continue to be a growth story and we’re very bullish about it.”Mr Moorman also remained optimistic that NS could pick up some benefit from carrying crude oil produced in the western US to refineries it serves in the east. There is also substantial demand to move the fine “fracking” sand needed for gas wells being drilled through shale rock and gas pipelines.Such traffic would be important for NS, but would never replace coal in volumes or revenues, Mr Moorman said.“There’s a lot of energy to be exploited in the eastern US – and that’s where most of the people are,” Mr Moorman said. “It’s going to be very good for us.”
49;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2013-01-22T23:28:02Z;Shift away from coal hits US rail groups;;Both large rail operators in the eastern US reported lower fourth-quarter profits as plummeting demand for utility coal outweighed price and profitability improvements for the wider industry.The announcements from CSX and Norfolk Southern came as Canadian National, one of North America’s most respected rail operators, said it planned to double its crude oil traffic this yea r compared with last year. Kansas City Southern, smallest of the seven Class I rail companies that dominate North America’s rail industry, also reported a quadrupling of its crude oil volumes for the fourth quarter, alongside a 23 per cent fall in utility coal traffic for power stations.All four companies are experiencing the effects of a sudden shift away from coal use in US power stations, in favour of newly cheap and abundant natural gas. All are seeking opportunities to ship the fine fracking sand used to release gas and oil and to move the crude oil that emerges.CSX, operator of the main rail network east of the Mississippi, said net earnings for the quarter to December 28 fell 3 per cent to $443m on revenue down 2 per cent to $2.88bn. Full-year earnings rose 2 per cent to $1.86bn on revenue flat at $11.8bn.Norfolk Southern, the other big eastern network, announced fourth-quarter net income down 14 per cent to $413m on revenue down 4 per cent to $2.68bn. Its full-year net income fell 8.7 per cent to $1.75bn on revenue down 1.2 per cent to $11bn.CSX’s coal volumes declined 19 per cent for the quarter over last year’s fourth quarter, dragging coal revenue down 18 per cent to $747m. NS’s coal volume for the period fell 13.2 per cent, while revenues fell 23 per cent to $657m.Michael Ward, CSX’s chief executive, said the company continued to demonstrate the ability to respond quickly to significant events in the marketplace. Wick Moorman, NS’s chief executive, said that, despite the declines in coal shipments, it had seen steady gains in intermodal traffic – carrying containers and trailers – chemicals, automotive and materials for housebuilding.“We remain focused on controlling costs and improving productivity while continuing to provide high service levels for our customers,” Mr Moorman said.CN gave its commitment to double crude oil volumes over the current year, as it reported petroleum and chemicals volumes for the last quarter of 2012 up 19 per cent on the previous year and revenues up 13 per cent.CN – which mainly caters to the growing market for export coal, rather than the utility coal that CSX and NS mainly carry – also reported coal volumes for the fourth quarter 23 per cent up year-on-year and revenues up 15 per cent.CN’s net income for the fourth quarter rose 3 per cent to C$610m ($616m) on revenues up 6 per cent to C$2.53bn ($2.55bn). Net income for the year rose 9.1 per cent to C$2.68bn on revenue up 9.9 per cent to C$9.92bn.
50;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Norfolk Southern rail hit by fuel switch;;Norfolk Southern, one of the two main railroad operators in the eastern US, broke the industry’s run of robust results when it announced third-quarter net income down 27 per cent as natural gas displaced its coal traffic.NS, which handles coal moving from the Pennsylvania and Kentucky coalfields to power stations, steel mills and ports, also warned the fourth quarter was likely to reflect the weak trends of September.The company, which more heavily depends on coal than any of the eight Class I North American railroads, said on September 19 that its third-quarter figures would be at least 25 per cent down year on year.Wick Moorman, chief executive, said the figures reflected weak market conditions, which had led to falls in shipments of coal and general merchandise.“We remain focused on controlling costs while continuing to provide high service levels for our customers and invest in projects that will support future growth,” he said.Net third-quarter income fell to $402m, from $554m last time, on revenues down 7 per cent to $2.7bn. Earnings per diluted share fell 27 per cent to $1.59.Both CSX, NS’s rival in the east, and Union Pacific, operator of the largest network, have reported significant falls in coal volumes in the third quarter as generators switch to cheap natural gas and Chinese coking coal demand falls. But both CSX and UP largely made up for this in other areas, particularly movements of crude oil from new shale oilfields.However, as well as recording a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in coal volumes, NS suffered from the 27 per cent decline, brought on by low natural gas prices, in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale area in Pennsylvania and New York. Drilling activity generates demand for fracking sand and pipeline parts.Demand for utility coal fell 15 per cent to 225,100 carloads, while demand for export coal, which had been supporting NS’s coal volumes, was down 7 per cent year-on-year and 28 per cent on the second quarter. Coal revenue fell 22 per cent to $701m.Volumes in intermodal services – movements of containers and truck trailers by road – increased 5 per cent, while revenues grew 3 per cent to $567m. Revenue in general merchandise fell 1 per cent to $1.4bn, on traffic down the same amount.The results emerged after close of trading. The shares fell 2.3 per cent in after-market trading to $64.50.
51;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2012-10-16T22:46:11Z;CSX shrugs off falling coal traffic;;CSX, operator of the largest rail network in the eastern US, illustrated the robustness of the sector’s earnings when it announced third-quarter net income down just 2 per cent, despite a 29 per cent fall in domestic coal traffic.The railway, first of the North American Class I operators to report for the third quarter, also said agricultural traffic – which fell 8 per cent against last year’s third quarter – had suffered from this year’s record drought in many agricultural areas.However, CSX benefited from the strong rebound in the US’s motor industry– automotive traffic was up 17 per cent year-on-year. Intermodal traffic – shipping containers and truck trailers – was also up 8 per cent, as the segment benefited from continuing transfers from trucks amid high fuel prices.Net earnings fell to $455m, from $464m for 2011’s third quarter, while revenue also fell 2 per cent to $2.89bn. Earnings per share, however, rose 1 cent to 44 cents, a result of a share buyback programme over the past year.Michael Ward, chief executive, said the company continued to respond well to “moderating economic conditions” and domestic coal business challenges.“The company is driving strong safety, customer service and productivity results while building its capabilities for the long term,” he said.Tony Hatch, an independent rail analyst, said there had been concern after Norfolk Southern, CSX’s main rival in the eastern US, warned that declining coal volumes could push its third-quarter earnings down as much as 25 per cent on 2011.“Coming in with a solid result was pretty good given the circumstances,” he said.The falling coal volumes reflect generators’ increased reliance on the US’s newly-abundant natural gas supplies to produce electricity, as well as the high levels of coal stockpiles after the last, mild winter.CSX’s domestic utility coal volumes – traffic heading to power stations – were down 30 per cent to 19.9m tons, while other domestic coal shipments, to customers such as steel mills, were down 19 per cent to 3m tonnes. International coal traffic, mostly heading to emerging markets such as China, rose sharply. Export coal volumes rose 25 per cent to 11m tonnes. Overall coal volumes fell 16 per cent to 36.3m tonnes.In common with other railroads, CSX recovered some of the lost coal revenue carrying products associated with coal’s new rivals. CSX attributed a 2 per cent rise in chemicals traffic partly to business hauling fracking sand and other products used to open shale oil and gas wells.CSX’s shares rose 1.25 per cent in after-hours trading to $21.90.
52;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2012-09-23T18:18:12Z;Romney and the big global economic risk;;Mitt Romney’s excoriation of the “47 per cent” of the US population who pay no federal income tax is alarming. It is a symptom of perhaps the greatest risk now facing the world economy.US politics always have a profound impact on business throughout the world. This year, however, the effects are not quite as might be expected. Even if, individually, many powerful investors loathe President Barack Obama, the collective result of their investment decisions suggests that his policies have not troubled them. Neither does the prospect of his re-election.The US stock market has doubled since it hit bottom only weeks into the Obama presidency. That rally has proceeded this year – even as the odds on an Obama victory have risen, recently topping 70 per cent, according to prediction markets.Looking at the most politically sensitive stocks, the bet has been on for a while that the president will get another term. According to S&P 500 sub-indices, healthcare facilities (a sector with much to gain from an Obama victory) has beaten coal and consumable resources (a prime beneficiary of his defeat) by 136 per cent since December last year.So Mr Romney’s offensive comments need not in themselves worry investors. The critical question is the so-called “fiscal cliff”– the package of tax rises and spending cuts that will come into force in January, unless a “lame duck” Congress can thrash out a deal with the White House between the election and Christmas.If everyone plays brinkmanship and loses, those measures would probably provoke a recession. Business’ concern is that some deal is struck. Ideology is secondary.Brokers’ research departments are producing research on the game theory of different electoral combinations – and tending to hold that the status quo, with the Democrats holding the Senate and Republicans the House, would make it relatively hard to thrash out a deal.But this now seems the likely outcome. Having once been confident that the Democrats would lose, the Intrade prediction market puts their chance of victory in the Senate at about 80 per cent – much the same as the GOP’s chance of holding the House.And, even if this has not dented asset prices, the uncertainty caused by the cliff is having an effect.Companies are talking down their prospects ahead of the next quarterly corporate reporting season at a rate not seen since 2001. Bellwether logistics groups such as Norfolk Southern and FedEx this week announced gloomy profit outlooks. Uncertainty is affecting activity.This is why Mr Romney’s now notorious gaffe is concerning. The philosophy he espoused is symptomatic of an intolerant strain that has taken over US politics in the last two decades – and could vitiate any chance of a sensible deal on the “cliff”.Mr Romney’s statistic was roughly correct. About 47 per cent of Americans do not pay federal income tax, although most of them do pay other taxes – on payrolls or on sales, for example – which tend to be more regressive. What is startling is his implication that this is unhealthy.That so many Americans do not need to trouble the Internal Revenue Service is down in part to victories by previous generations of Republican tax-cutters. The Earned Income Tax Credit– which helps many poorer working Americans to avoid paying any income tax – was introduced in 1975 under Gerald Ford. It was widened in 1986, as a central element in the “grand bargain” on simplifying the tax code that President Reagan thrashed out with Democrats in Congress.Reagan called it “the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress.”It was not just good politics. It satisfied demands for both equity and economic efficiency, by creating greater incentives to work for the poorest. As the poor are more likely to spend extra income than the wealthy, it also provided more of a Keynesian-style boost to the US economy.Using allowances to lift more people out of tax altogether is good economics and politics, and is not unique to the US. The UK’s Conservative governments of the last two decades have also followed this policy.Ultimately, the “47 per cent” statistic is testament to a sensible compromise that emerged from tough bipartisan negotiations – in which principled taxcutters took a leading role. Such negotiations are needed again in the next months to avert falling over the fiscal cliff.But Mr Romney’s comments suggest that this will be difficult. A dominant faction within the Republican party, it appears, believes that lifting the working poor out of income tax cultivates dependency.This dogmatic tendency is strong. While such ideas persist, it will be hard for the US to reach a sensible “grand bargain” on tax like the one that President Reagan oversaw in 1986.How sad. And how alarming.john.authers@ft.com
53;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US transport stocks signal deeper slowdown;;A downturn in US transportation stocks is indicating a deeper slowdown in the global economy and suggesting that the broader market rally has more to do with central bank action than fundamental strength from corporate America.While the S&P 500 is up 16.4 per cent so far this year, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, whose constituents are viewed as a harbinger for the health of the economy, just suffered its steepest weekly decline for the year and is now down 2.2 per cent since the start of January.Historically, investors have closely watched divergences between the broad market and Dow Transports, but that relationship for now appears overshadowed by the Federal Reserve’s efforts to lower bond yields and indirectly boost equity prices.“The Dow Transports is a critical gauge,” said Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services. “While it is not the only one, it is a very important measure because of its deep connection with economic activity, and it is telling us is that there are plenty of reasons to be concerned.”Concerns are growing that share prices are vulnerable to a pullback given the backdrop of a weakening global economy and uncertainty associated with the US election and the “fiscal cliff”.“It’s a strange moment in the market,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. “Usually after a run in the S&P 500 like this, more people would be saying there’s room for stocks to move higher, instead investors are wondering when the pullback will come.”Not helping matters are downgrades of corporate profit forecasts, with analysts predicting that the upcoming third quarter reporting season will be the weakest since the height of the financial crisis.These worries have been exacerbated by a deterioration in expectations from companies in the Dow Transports, which are highly sensitive to developments in the global economy.A profit warning last week from Norfolk Southern, the second-largest railroad company in the eastern US, cemented those concerns and reverberated across the sector. The company said falling coal demand and decreased shipments of completed merchandise hurt its business in the third quarter.The statement echoed worries expressed by FedEx, the global delivery company, which lowered its full-year outlook last week and said demand for its premium shipment service has slipped as macroeconomic conditions have hit its customers.Even a fall in oil prices, which touched their lowest levels in six weeks last Thursday, failed to boost the Dow Transports, which includes several major US airlines.“If people aren’t moving stuff globally, it’s going to show up in their results,” Michael Gapen, senior US economist and asset allocation strategist at Barclays.Still, some analysts say that even when weak earnings are factored, US stock valuations remain attractive to investors. In addition, they said the Fed’s measures may push interest rates even lower, further limiting the appeal of other asset classes that have been popular with investors this year, such as corporate bonds.
54;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2012-09-20T21:11:17Z;Wall Street flat on downbeat data;;JC Penney shares tumbled 11.2 per cent to $25.83, making it the worst performer on the S&P 500 index on Thursday, as investors appeared unconvinced by the retailer’s presentation of its revamped stores. The retailer’s comments that the second half of the year would be similar to the first were also discouraging.“Given the stock run over the past month, we believe the stock reflects more optimistic near-term assumptions than are likely,” wrote analysts at Atlantic Equities.“While we expect the JC Penney stock to be volatile over the near-term (partly due to the 40 per cent short interest), we remain ‘neutral’ and will look for clearer direction heading into the new year.”Bed Bath & Beyond was also among the laggards on US equity markets, falling 9.7 per cent to $62.09 after the home-furnishing chain reported second-quarter results below Wall Street’s expectations.By contrast, ConAgra Foods rose 6.2 per cent to $27.24 after the quarterly profits beat analysts’ expectations and the company raised its guidance and increased dividends.In the wider market, stocks recouped earlier losses and major indices were little changed on Thursday amid a batch of disappointing economic news from the US, Europe and China.Initial claims for US jobless benefits fell less than expected with the less volatile four-week average reports trending upwards, the eurozone private sector contracted sharply, and manufacturing in China continued to slow.“We are in a period when euphoria from the actions of the largest central banks has faded,” said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial.Mr Canally added that investors are now waiting and wondering why China had not acted yet. “While immediate risks from Europe are off the table, macro risks are still there. Investors are concerned about economic and company-specific fundamentals heading into the third-quarter earnings season.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed virtually flat at 1,460.27 after falling as much as 0.6 per cent in the morning. Industrials and financials sectors were the main laggards, down 0.9 and 0.6 per cent respectively.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent up at 13,597.16 after trading in narrow range, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 3,175.96.United States Steel and Union Pacific Corporation were hit hard, down 3.5 per cent to $20.13 and 3.3 per cent to $120.95 respectively. Norfolk Southern, the railroad operator, tumbled 9 per cent to $66.11 as the company’s forecasts came in below analysts’ expectations. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, seen as a barometer of the economic health fell 2.7 per cent.Banking stocks were also in focus after reports that regulators were seeking more time to complete their investigations of banks allegedly involved in manipulation of Libor and other key interest rates.Meanwhile, UBS cut its ratings on Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to “neutral” from “buy”, saying these banks had fully participated in the sector’s rally.Citigroup lost 1.1 per cent to $33.81, Goldman fell 1.2 per cent to $117.63 and Morgan Stanley slid 2 per cent to $17.21.JPMorgan, the largest US bank by assets, also fell 0.2 per cent to $41.25.Bank of America fell 1 per cent to $9.19 amid reports that the bank was speeding up a planned reduction of 30,000 staff to counter falling revenues by cutting costs. The bank was said to be planning to cut more than 15,000 jobs by the end of the year.In earnings news, Jefferies, the midsize investment bank, reported higher third-quarter profit as revenue from trading activity more than doubled. The stock, however, fell 7.3 per cent to $14.52, as some investors expressed concerns over the company’s long-term growth trajectory.In the technology sector, Oracle shares closed 1.6 per cent lower at $32.26, but continued to fall in after-hours trading following the release of quarterly earnings. The software maker’s revenues and earnings came in below analysts’ expectations.Oracle’s results are closely watched by analysts, who expect the company to provide some clues as to whether corporations will increase spending on technology at the end of the year.Adobe rose 4.3 per cent to $34.53 as analysts at RBC Capital Markets upgraded it to “outperform”, even after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software issued a lower outlook for the current quarter. The company said its customers’ faster-than-expected switch to its new subscription-based model will dent its earnings.AOL shares fell 0.3 per cent to $34.48. The internet company appointed Karen Dykstra, a former hedge fund executive, as chief financial officer on Wednesday.Sprint Nextel fell 2.2 per cent to $5.44 even after the fourth-largest mobile provider said it had sold 1m phones that support LTE, a high-speed wireless technology it is building into its network.Nike said its board had approved to use cash to buy back $8bn in shares over four years on top of an existing $5bn share buyback programme. Its stock fell 1 per cent to $96.72.General Motors shares fell 1.3 per cent to $24.42 as talks between the Canadian Auto Workers union and the carmaker stalled, with a CAW official calling a quick breakthrough on an overall deal “unlikely”.GM will also this week begin to bid for Ally Financial’s auto-lending operations in Europe and Latin America.
55;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2012-09-19T22:54:12Z;Falling coal demand hits Norfolk Southern;;Norfolk Southern, the number two rail operator in the eastern US, became the latest to show the effects of changing energy consumption when it warned third-quarter profits could be more than 25 per cent down on last year.The announcement, made after the New York market close on Wednesday, sent shares in Norfolk Southern down 5.1 per cent in after-market trading to $68.99.The effects of decreased coal traffic and shipments of completed merchandise, partly offset by shipments of containers and trailers, would reduce revenues by $120m from the $2.9bn in last year's third quarter, Norfolk Southern warned. Changes in fuel surcharges as a result of fuel price falls would cut revenue a further $80m.Earnings per diluted share were expected to be between $1.18 and $1.25 against $1.59 in last year’s third quarter.Norfolk Southern, which serves the coal fields of Pennsylvania and Kentucky as well as handling coal heading for power stations from western coal fields, has traditionally been one of the most reliant of the large US railways on coal. The commodity accounted for 31 per cent of last year’s third-quarter revenues.Increasing use of cheap natural gas and last winter’s mild weather have pushed down demand to move coal sharply. Norfolk Southern reported coal volumes down 12 per cent in the second quarter on last year.US railways’ energy traffic has been transformed in the last two years by decreasing demand to move coal and surging demand to move crude oil emerging from shale formations, sand to release gas and oil from shale, and pipes for new pipelines.Norfolk Southern has narrower exposure to the new energy traffic than some other operators, including BNSF, the number two operator in the western US, which serves the fast-growing Bakken oilfield in North Dakota.CSX, the larger of the two big eastern rail operators, has announced still sharper coal volume declines in the past year. It said in July domestic utility coal volumes had been down 35 per cent in the second quarter against the previous year.Norfolk Southern and CSX are benefiting from investments to allow containers stacked two-high to travel to and from some of the most important east coast container ports. Both have invested heavily in the networks in the hope of gaining new traffic ahead of the 2014 widening of the Panama Canal, which will bring new, bigger ships from Asia to the US east coast.
56;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2012-03-14T20:56:29Z;US stocks steady after bank stress tests;;The leading US banks dominated market attention for a second straight day as investors digested the results of the Federal Reserve stress tests.Citigroup and MetLife – two of the four banks that failed the stress tests – were among the main losers on Wednesday.Goldman Sachs finished down 3.4 per cent to $35.21 after being thrust back into the spotlight as a derivatives trader resigned on Wednesday and published an opinion piece in The New York Times that criticised the bank’s culture as “toxic and destructive”.Overall, the financial sector index on the S&P 500 edged up fractionally after leading the benchmark US index to its best day since November 30.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, said: “Typically, after a big run like we had yesterday, it’s natural to see some profit-taking the next day.“You are starting to see investors discriminate between large banks and between regional banks,” she added.Large banks soared in late trading on Tuesday as JPMorgan announced that it would return $15bn to shareholders and increased its dividend after passing the Fed’s tests.JPMorgan, one of 15 institutions that met the Fed’s capital requirements, added 0.5 per cent to $43.58 and is up 7.5 per cent in the past two days of trading.Citigroup, the biggest of the four banks to fail the tests, dropped 3.4 per cent to $35.21 and has lost more than half of its gains from Tuesday’s surge.Vivek Juneja, analyst at JPMorgan, downgraded shares in Citigroup from “buy” to “hold” on news that the bank would be unable to return money to shareholders under the Fed’s restrictions for banks that fail the stress tests.“Increased capital return in 2012 has been one of the key tenets to our ‘buy’ rating on Citigroup …Valuation remains attractive but we see limited upside in the near term until Citigroup can begin to return capital,” he said.MetLife, another of the banks to fall foul of the Fed’s tests, was the leading loser on the financial sector index, down 5.83 per cent to $37.16.Jay Gelb, analyst at Barclays, said: “This outcome [of the stress tests] was not expected, particularly after we met with MetLife last week and is challenging for the company.”SunTrust, which also failed the tests, climbed 4.6 per cent to $23.61. The bank said in a statement that it expected earnings for the first quarter of 2012 to beat initial estimates.Zions Bancorporation soared 10.5 per cent to $21.58 as the bank said it planned to issue $600m in senior debt to help repay $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,394.28, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 per cent to 13,194.10, led higher by Bank of America.The bank, which passed the tests but said it would not return money to shareholders at present, climbed 4.1 per cent to $8.84 with its shares now up more than 59 per cent in the year to date.American Express was the second-leading gainer on the index, up 3.5 per cent to $56.15. The world’s third-largest payment networks company said it would boost dividends by 11 per cent to 20 cents and buy back up to $5bn of shares.The Walt Disney Company was leading the fallers, down 1.2 per cent to $43.48. Earthmover Caterpillar dropped 0.9 per cent to $112.27.The Dow Jones Transportation Average was down 1.4 per cent to 5,180.39 as gas prices hit a record for 2012. The average price of regular unleaded gas struck $3.81 with its impact taking a toll on airlines and rail companies.Southwest Airlines was the worst off among airlines, down 2.7 per cent to $8.18. United Continental Holdings, the parent company of United Airlines, fell 2.1 per cent to $19.42, and Delta Air Lines shed 0.1 per cent to $9.30.Norfolk Southern Corporation, the Virginia-based railroad company, dropped 3.1 per cent to $64.95. Rail-based transportation supplier CSX Corporation fell 2.9 per cent to $20.20.The Nasdaq Composite index was up fractionally to 3,040.73 as Apple continued to add to its gains.The most heavily weighted stock on the index climbed again into record territory, gaining 3.8 per cent to $589.58. David Evanston, analyst at Canaccord, raised the 12-month price target for Apple to $710.“Since we attended the iPad launch last week, our checks have indicated record pre-orders with wait times for shipping iPad models now reaching 2-3 weeks …Apple remains a top pick,” he said.Netflix, the streaming and home DVD delivery provider, fell 2.3 per cent to $103.90. Its shares were hit by news that Walmart would let customers buy online access to movies they have already purchased.
57;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2011-10-19T22:46:52Z;Record CSX earnings show strong outlook for US rail;;CSX, the biggest railroad on the US’s eastern seaboard, reported record third-quarter earnings late on Tuesday with revenue growth in all its main traffic areas, in the first sign that US railroads’ strong performance has survived the US economy’s recent weakening.Strong growth in metals traffic and resilient revenue in both coal and container traffic helped to drive net earnings up 12 per cent to $464m, on revenues up 11 per cent on the same quarter last year to $2.96bn.CSX’s results are closely watched because it is the first of the seven large Class I North American railroads– which also include Union Pacific, Burlington Northern & Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern – to announce financial figures.The railroad industry has produced its strongest financial results in decades in recent years as rationalisation in the 30 years since deregulation has combined with strong commodities demand and a shift in traffic from trucks to rail to boost the system’s earning power.Michael Ward, chief executive, said that even as the US economy had moderated, CSX had produced strong financial results while investing in additional resources to strengthen customer service.“This helped position our business, our customers and our communities for growth in the near and long-term,” he said.In intermodal or container traffic, which accounts for 36 per cent of volumes, there was only modest traffic growth because declining traffic to and from ports offset domestic traffic increases. However, it recorded 16 per cent growth to $369 in revenue per unit. Domestic intermodal traffic has benefitted from US truckers’ growing struggles with high fuel prices and driver shortages, which have prompted customers to shift from truck to rail.Volumes of coal, which accounts for 24 per cent of traffic, declined 1 per cent, although revenue per unit increased 16 per cent.The company forecast that growth would continue in the fourth quarter and into 2012 and that demand for export coal would continue to offset declining demand from US electricity generators.“The underlying fundamentals of the business continue to support our aspirations for the future,” Mr Ward said. “The outlook for freight rail transportation remains attractive.”CSX’s operating expenses rose 13 per cent to $2.09bn for the quarter, largely because of a 48 per cent increase to $412m in fuel costs. Earnings per share rose 19 per cent to $0.43.
58;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2011-09-21T23:21:57Z;Alpha sparks fears of coal demand slowdown;;Fresh signs of a slowdown in demand for natural resources emerged as a leading US coal producer warned that it was likely to ship less coal than previously forecast this year because of “unexpectedly curtailed customer activity levels”.Shares in Alpha Natural Resources, which issued the statement, and other US miners, including Arch Coal and Cliffs Natural Resources, fell sharply on Wednesday.Walter Energy, another metallurgical coal producer, was also hit after warning of production delays that meant its output would be lower than expected in the second half of 2011.Metallurgical, or “met”, coal, an essential raw material for steelmaking, is often seen as an indicator of the health of the economy, both globally and specifically in China, which last year accounted for 44 per cent of total world steel production.Indicators of Asian demand for raw materials have generally remained robust. Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest natural resources companies said on Tuesday that markets were “somewhat weaker” and a few customers were asking to reschedule deliveries, but said the slowdown was not spreading into Asia.However, Virginia-based Alpha on Wednesday revised down its guidance for 2011 shipments to 102.5m to109.5m tonnes, compared with its previous range of 104m to112m tonnes, in part because of weaker than expected demand.It also cited other factors, including lower than expected production from some of its mines, including some brought in with the $8.5bn acquisition of Massey Energy agreed at the start of the year.Alpha’s shares dropped 17 per cent to $22.30. Arch fell 11 per cent to $16.12 and Cliffs Natural Resources, which exports coal as well as iron and other materials, was down 13 per cent to $61.55. Walter was down 12 per cent at $66.25.However, some analysts said they did not see any evidence of a general slowdown in demand for raw materials.“All of the metrics that we have show solid demand for metallurgical coal,” said Brandon Blossman, energy analyst at Tudor, Pickering & Holt.Metallurgical coal shipments from US ports were up 7 per cent year-on-year in July, and vessel queues at US coal terminals remain high.The mere hint of a Chinese slowdown was enough to move any stocks related to raw materials. Joy Global, the mining equipment manufacturer, fell 7 per cent to $70.44.Stocks in railroad companies, which transport US coal to ports for export, were also buffeted. Norfolk Southern and CSX were both down 8 per cent, and Union Pacific fell 6 per cent.All three companies have benefited from strong demand for coal, by negotiating individual contracts with miners.James Squires, chief financial officer of Norfolk Southern, said at a conference on Wednesday: “We are getting no such indications that across the board demand is softening for export metal coal.”He added: “We are very bullish on the long-term outlook for US export coal based on the feedback that we have got from our customers and information about global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer
59;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2011-09-21T21:04:08Z;US stocks fall after Fed announcement;;The S&P 500 plunged 30 points, or 2.5 per cent, in the last 30 minutes of trading, as investors reacted with alarm to the much anticipated monetary policy announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC said it would buy $400bn of long-dated Treasuries and sell the same amount of shorter-dated government bonds to drive down the long-term interest rate. It also said it would reinvest any early repayments from mortgage securities back into debt issued by mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae, to reduce household mortgage rates.“I don’t know if I want to use the word desperate, but it feels like the Federal Reserve is out of bullets,” said Scott O’Neill, portfolio manager of MarketSmith.The S&P closed down 2.9 per cent at 1,166.72, its lowest level in a week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.5 per cent to 11,124.84 and the Nasdaq was off 2 per cent at 2,538.19.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 4.9 per cent after Moody’s downgraded its credit ratings for Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, arguing the government would be less likely to rescue the big lenders if they face failure, following banking reforms.BofA shares fell 7.5 per cent to $6.38, Citigroup fell 5.2 per cent to $25.52 and Wells Fargo dropped 3.9 per cent to $23.71.Wall Street’s worries were compounded by concerns about falling demand from Asia for raw materials. A broad swath of material, industrials and transport stocks fell after Alpha Natural Resources warned it would ship less coal than expected this year due to falling demand.ANR dropped 17.2 per cent to $22.30, a two-year low, after it said it would ship between 102.5m and 109.5m tonnes of coal this year, down from a previous estimate of between 104m and 112m tonnes.Cliffs Natural Resources was down 12.8 per cent to $61.55 in sympathy. Joy Global, which manufactures coal mining equipment, fell 7.2 per cent to $72.29. Transport groups CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern, which transport coal to ports for export, both fell. CSX was down 8.1 per cent to $18.59, and Norfolk was down 8.3 per cent to $61.93.That pushed the Dow Transport Index, which analysts watch closely as a forward indicator of demand for goods and materials, down 3 per cent by lunch. But the index ended down 5.6 per cent for the day, after a further slump following the FOMC announcement.Software developers rallied strongly, however, as investors reacted to better than expected quarterly results posted by Oracle.Hardware sales declined, but software sales were up for the San Francisco-based company. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, software sales grew more than 50 per cent year-on-year, confounding fears that Europe’s debt crisis would hurt demand. Oracle also predicted revenues would grow 4 to 8 per cent in the current quarter. Its shares closed up 4 per cent to $29.49.“What we’re seeing is a relief rally,” said Richard Davis, software analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “People were scared out of their wits about what these results might be, given the weak macro data.”Adobe shares were up 1 per cent at $24.89, as it was caught up in the software relief rally despite posting quarterly earnings that were below expectations.Shantanu Narayen, chief executive, said the company could still deliver 10 per cent revenue growth for the year, based on a strong fourth quarter.But Steven Ashley at Baird pointed out “guidance assumes normal fourth-quarter economic activity, which might raise eyebrows with some investors”.A key differentiator among software companies may be the level of exposure to businesses, which have stronger balance sheets than consumers.With 55 per cent of Adobe revenues coming from creative professionals, Mr Ashley said this could be a problem. He expects Adobe to deliver 7 per cent growth in revenue from sales to creative professionals this fiscal year.Hewlett-Packard jumped 8.7 per cent to $23.98 on reports it may replace Léo Apotheker, chief executive.Microsoft shares were down 3.7 per cent to $26.35 after the company announced a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend late on Tuesday. Microsoft will increase quarterly dividends by 4 cents to 20 cents.At close to 3 per cent, Microsoft’s dividend is one of the highest among tech companies on the S&P 500, but the company is under pressure to compensate investors for a stagnant share price.Shares in Range Resources, an independent oil and gas explorer, were up 4.7 per cent to $67.96 on buy-out speculation.
60;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2011-08-30T17:46:58Z;Panama Canal upgrade sparks US ports battle;;Beyond the berths at Seagirt Container Terminal in the port of Baltimore, tamping machines pound the earth and bulldozers clear space for a long stretch of new quay. When the work is done, Seagirt will be able to handle some of the largest container ships in the world.At the moment, barely any of the vessels that sail up Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore need such a facility. But that could change in 2014 when the $5.25bn project to build larger locks along the Panama Canal is due to be completed.The project will remove a bottleneck that has prevented the large ships on many major trade routes sailing direct to the US east coast from Asia. The new vessels are expected to have up to three times the capacity of the biggest ships currently on the route.Scenes like the one at Baltimore are being played out all along the east and gulf coasts ahead of what promises to be the biggest shake-up in US distribution since the advent of shipping containers 50 years ago.Ports, terminal operators, rail companies and state governments are jostling to win the new traffic they expect to be generated by the bigger ships.Billions of dollars are being spent to build new quays, deepen channels and expand rail tunnels.Consumers, manufacturers and retailers in the US mid-west and inland eastern cities could all benefit.Containers heading to these areas will have the option of going via east- coast ports then heading west on trains. Their traditional route has been eastward from California, where larger ships free of Panama Canal restrictions already dock.Seagirt should emerge a winner, says Bayard Hogans, a manager at the facility, part of the Ports America group.“We feel we’re going to be one of the ports that’s prepared when the Panama Canal expands, for these new opportunities,” Mr Hogans says.Yet it remains unclear how many of the projects will generate enough traffic to justify the investments.Bill Clement, president of the container-handling division of CSX, the largest eastern US railroad, says it will take some time for new trade flows to establish themselves.He adds: “Our experience has been that whenever new capacity is built in a global transportation system, people find a way to use it over time.”The Port of New York and New Jersey, the US east coast’s busiest container port, faces the most acute physical challenges.The area’s vast consumer market is certain to keep attracting shipping lines. But the largest vessels will have difficulty reaching four of the port’s five container terminals before 2016, when the $1bn raising of the Bayonne Bridge over an approach channel is completed.Brian Clark, a senior manager at APM Terminals Elizabeth, across a bay from the bridge’s troublesome low steel arch, insists that, since many ships call at New York first on leaving the Panama Canal, the port will be able to bring goods to mid-western customers quicker than rivals.“It would make sense to handle that cargo out of New York, provided that the costs were comparable,” Mr Clark says.Executives at the Virginia Ports Authority, operator of the port of Norfolk, insist their port’s strategic location on the mid-Atlantic coast – in convenient rail reach of many large cities – will attract more new traffic.“We think it makes sense that you could serve so much of the population east of the Mississippi by making a port call here in Virginia,” Jeff Keever, the port’s senior deputy director, says.Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, CSX’s main rival in the eastern US, points out that many key factors – including future fuel costs, canal tolls and railroad charges – remain uncertain.Most experts consequently avoid predicting which new cranes will be well used and which will lie idle. “The best answer that we seem to receive is a qualified, ‘I don’t know’,” Mr Moorman says.
61;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2011-08-22T17:24:21Z;The biggest North American railroads;;The US and Canadian railroad industry is dominated by the seven “Class I” railroads, most of them formed as a result of a wave of consolidation in the 1980s and 1990s.In order of 2010 operating revenue, they are:1. Union Pacific: $17bnStill operator of the largest route network of any Class I, Union Pacific is also the only one able to trace its history back to the earliest years of the US railroads, having been formed in 1862 to build the eastern end of the historic Iowa to California trans-continental railroad. It was transformed, however, by its 1996 merger with Southern Pacific. Operating west of the Mississippi, UP depends heavily on hauling containers from west coast ports, on hauling coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin and transporting mid-western grain and other bulk products.2. BNSF: $16.8bnThe Burlington Northern and Santa Fe is currently most famous for being owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle, which bought it in 2009. However, the railroad, product of a 1995 merger between Burlington Northern and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads, was already well-known in the industry for running a highly efficient railroad – which now rivals Union Pacific in revenue despite having a smaller network.3. CSX: $10.6bnCSX, operator of the largest railroad network east of the Mississippi, depends heavily on the region’s industrial base for its traffic. The company divided Conrail, the formerly government-owned railroad company, with Norfolk Southern in a 1997 merger.4. Norfolk Southern: $9.5bnOne of the most efficient railroads, Norfolk Southern has the smaller network of the two east-of-the-Mississippi Class Is but has routes more tightly focused on the main sources of traffic and has long generated better returns than its rivals. It is the most reliant of the Class Is on coal, handling coal produced in the Appalachians, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Much of it is exported through the company’s dedicated coal facility at Lamberts Point in Portsmouth, Virginia.5. Canadian National: $8.38bnCanadian National operates a substantial network in the US, as well as its core trans-continental line linking Vancouver and Calgary to the main eastern Canadian population centres.6. Canadian Pacific: $5.05bnCanadian Pacific, operating a network parallel to CN’s, is less profitable than its larger rival but gradually improving.7. Kansas City Southern: $1.81bnSmallest of the US and Canadian Class Is, Kansas City Southern markets itself as “the Nafta railroad”, since its main routes run north to south, linking Canada to Mexico. It also has extensive operations in Mexico and operates the Panama Canal Railway in Panama.
62;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2011-08-22T16:20:42Z;Union Pacific crosses profitability threshold;;The operator of the US’s largest railway network has crossed a key profitability threshold for only the second year in its 149-year history, amid a rebound that has vindicated Warren Buffett’s 2009 gamble on the sector.Rob Knight, finance director of Union Pacific, told the Financial Times that its 2010 returns on invested capital exceeded its cost of capital – a key test that the industry’s regulators and investors consider when deciding how much railways can reasonably charge their customers.UP had until recently been slower than other big railways to catch up to its cost of capital threshold – a mark most railways started missing before the second world war. Last year might therefore have been the first in many decades when nearly all big industry players earned returns strong enough to cover their investment costs.Executives at all four of the biggest US-based railway companies – UP, Burlington Northern & Santa Fe, CSX and Norfolk Southern – told the Financial Times that high road fuel prices were pushing increasing numbers of containers on to rail from road. Some export commodities – including grain heading to China – are also performing well.Mr Buffett, the billionaire investor, earlier this year told shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway investment vehicle that his bet on the industry – his $44bn November 2009 acquisition of BNSF – was working out even better than he had expected.Find out the shunting order of the seven Class I railroads on the continentUP, founded in 1862 to build the US’s first trans-continental rail link, said in its annual filing to the Surface Transportation Board watchdog – which uses different methods from published company results to calculate what rail operators can charge – that it generated returns on invested capital of 11.5 per cent for 2010. Since the STB is all but certain to declare the industry’s cost of capital last year was below 11 per cent, UP will comfortably clear the hurdle.The company, which endured several bankruptcies in its chaotic early years, previously earned its cost of capital only in 1995, the year before its takeover of the financially-troubled Southern Pacific.“In our 150-year history, we’re just now getting close to earning our cost of capital on a book value basis,” Mr Knight said.Anthony Hatch, an independent analyst, said the other big US-based operators had also probably either met or come close to meeting the cost-of-capital test.Mr Knight promised the company would not rest on its laurels, however. Like other railways, UP argues the STB’s calculations overstate its returns, meaning that it still has room to improve.“We’ve got to continue to move the business forward, which is where we’re headed,” Mr Knight said.
63;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Texas rail yard highlights growth challenges;;Beneath the scorching Texas sun at Burlington Northern & Santa Fe’s Alliance intermodal yard outside Fort Worth, orange mobile cranes straddle container trains so long they seem to stretch into infinity. The cranes swing containers from trains to waiting tractors then move on swiftly, reflecting the pressure on a yard whose management is stuggling to cope with 13 per cent year-on-year traffic growth so far this year.There is a similar sense of bustle at many key facilities across the US’s railroad system, still the world’s largest by route miles. US railroads’ container traffic – traffic in boxes that can carry anything from Chinese-manufactured toys to food or chemicals – was up 7.8 per cent in the first half of this year, to 421,241 units, against the same period last year, amid only 1 per cent first-half growth in US GDP. Maru Iabichela, the Alliance yard’s manager, says that there have been instances this year where have been held outside the yard, obstructing a main line, for lack of anywhere to put them.The rows of white trucks belonging to JB Hunt, one of the US’s biggest trucking companies, in the Alliance yard’s truck park illustrated one of the main reasons for the robust growth. Many US trucking companies, suffering from high fuel prices, driver shortages and road congestion, have shifted many long-haul trips to rail, and opted instead to handle only the short-haul trips to and from yards such as Alliance.Railcars carrying some of the in-demand commodities that are also contributing to growth – including grain, soya beans and ethanol – are handled at a neighbouring yard.Ms Iabichela’s most pressing concern is to extend the yard’s truck parking area for the fifth time this year – and to find more workers.“We’ve had to hire more aggressively,” Ms Iabichela says. “With these volumes, we need to be flooding those tracks with people, getting cranes up to trains . . . It’s good times.”Yet the good times for BNSF and other railroads are not solely a result of rising traffic. Rob Knight, finance director of Union Pacific, owner of the largest US rail network, is one of many executives to highlight the importance of efficiency improvements since industry deregulation in 1980.A programme to tackle yard congestion and other productivity problems reduced the proportion of UP’s revenues used up by costs from 81.6 per cent in 2006, to 70.6 per cent in 2010, he says. “It’s really unlocking the motivation of all of our employees,” Mr Knight adds.Investment is also sharply up. Norfolk Southern, the second-largest network in the eastern US, has spent heavily on upgrading its Heartland Corridor between Virginia and Chicago to handle new traffic arriving at eastern seaports. Traffic is expected to grow after 2014, when the expanded Panama Canal will allow shipping lines to introduce new, bigger ships on services from Asia.“We’re willing to make those investments in a way that, 20 years ago when every dollar was tight, we would hold back,” Wick Moorman, NS’s chief executive, says.Uncertainties remain, meanwhile. If expansion to the Panama Canal encourages shipping lines to send more goods to US east coast ports, that could cut out some lucrative, long-distance train journeys eastwards from southern Californian ports for BNSF and Union Pacific.“I think our view is that the Panama Canal will change things, certainly in ways that we’re not sure of,” Mr Moorman says. “But our traffic is going to continue to grow from both directions.”Mr Knight also sounds a cautious note about the growing traffic in “ag” commodities such as grain and soya beans that he acknowledges have boosted both UP’s and BNSF’s traffic this year.“Ag markets have tended to come and go, particularly export markets,” he says.Regulators could also step in if market conditions remain favourable. Hearings this year of the Surface Transportation Board – the industry regulator – have investigated customers’ claims that some railroads are exploiting current conditions to overcharge.Mr Knight of UP, which plans $3.3bn capital expenditure this year, says railroads would reduce expenditure on improving capacity and buying new locomotives if regulators capped returns.Yet there remains a powerful sense that today’s railroads face fundamentally different circumstances from 30 years ago.“They’ve changed from inwardly-focused slow or no-growth engineering companies, to companies who have offices globally,” Anthony Hatch, a veteran industry analyst, says. “[They] look to see where manufacturing changes in Asia, how that’s going to impact trade flows.”The US’s clogged highways, poor public finances and truck driver shortages should ensure the growth that has facilitated that transformation continues, according to Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive.“There’s going to be such a shortage of transportation on the highway side of the sector that the railways are going to have to continue to step up and provide more and more capacity,” he says.
64;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2011-02-03T20:42:11Z;US asked to follow ultra-long bond trend;;When the US reintroduced a 30-year bond five years ago, demand was so great that traders likened the reaction to “being on steroids”.Now the US Treasury has been asked to consider issuing bonds that will not mature for at least 50 years, and as long as 100 years, putting the “long bond” nickname for its regular 30-year offerings at risk of being a misnomer.The request, from at least one executive on an advisory committee of banks and other investors active in Treasury trading, is the latest in a series of demands for such ultra-long-dated paper.A member of the US Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee estimated that demand for US long-term bonds could reach $2,400bn during the next five years as a sweeping programme of financial and pensions regulation is implemented.It comes as institutional investors try to make their assets match the long-term liabilities of pensions and annuities they are committed to paying out decades into the future.The market in ultra-long bonds is growing. Since 2005, the UK has regularly sold 50-year gilts and France has issued similarly long-dated paper.More exotically, Mexico last year sold $1bn in 100-year debt and Peru issued its first 40-year bonds.Companies have joined in. Rabobank, the Dutch mutual, and Norfolk Southern, the US railways operator, sold “century” bonds last year. Goldman Sachs recently sold $1.3bn in 50-year debt.For companies issuing the debt – and very few have a genuine need for 50-year finance – such bond sales amount to a show of faith in the borrower.Some deals are to a degree the result of “reverse inquiries”, where investors call banks asking for particular types of debt and bankers find borrowers willing to step up.The scale of interest depends less on the certainty of getting the original investment back in 100 years than on “duration”, a concept that measures the time until cash flows from interest payments cover the nominal price of the bond.For pension and annuity providers, the longer the duration, the better.The average duration on many ultra-long bonds is only slightly higher than on more common 30-year debt, but investors are happy to take what they can.This explains why Mexico’s 100-year bonds offered a 6.1 per cent coupon, compared with the 7.1 per cent yield available on its 30-year debt.Ben Bennett, a credit strategist at Legal & General Investments, says: “Actuaries tell us when people are going to die and we know how much the fund needs to pay out. We then have to match those outgoings with bond cash flows, and some of those liabilities are 50 years-plus in the future.“You can’t cover that with 30-year bonds. Without 50-year debt, that’s a risk we’d have to wear.”Governments in countries such as the US, whose bonds form globally accepted benchmarks, do not really have the freedom to randomly issue one-off bonds.The benchmark status of those countries lowers their borrowing costs, but requires them to maintain an active yield curve, that is, bonds regularly issued at different maturities to provide reference prices for other borrowing rates, from corporate debt to individual mortgages.In practice this means that, before they commit to issuing, they have to be sure demand will be consistent and will not cannibalise the market for their existing debt.The yield curve gives other borrowers more comfort in pricing their own debt off the benchmark rates, especially for longer-dated bonds, where predictions of growth, inflation and other factors are harder to make with confidence.“Companies looking to do very long-dated funding will first look to the sterling market before looking to the US,” Chris Tuffey, co-head of European credit capital markets at Credit Suisse, says.This, he says, is because of the depth of UK investor demand for long-dated assets, which itself is largely due to regulation and pensions accounting as well as the now established market for 50-year gilts.“Other markets, such as the US, are heading the same way as the UK, but no one is as developed yet. On that basis, demand for ultra-long paper in the US is only going to grow.”Driving this week’s call for a US ultra-long bond issue is a recognition that the move would enable the US government to expand the investor base of the market in Treasuries, which is heavily weighted towards overseas ownership, and cut borrowing costs over time.Appetite for 50-year gilts has meant the UK usually pays less to borrow for 50 years than for 30, even though, in theory, investors should demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the greater risk implicit in an extra 20 years.A Treasury official downplayed the need for a 100-year issue on Wednesday, but the idea of a 40-year or 50-year bond would please pension and insurance funds.Investors hoping for ultra-long T-bonds will have to wait, however, at least until May, when the TBAC and Treasury next meet.Only then might they be able to gauge the government’s view.

How robust will the public finances of Mexico be in 2110?These, and other equally imponderable questions, are among those being posed to investors amid a flurry of high-profile very long-dated bond issues.Alongside 100-year Mexican debt and 50-year Goldman paper, investors have been offered, and readily accepted, 50-year issues from utility group GDF Suez, railroad operator Norfolk Southern, Rabobank of the Netherlands and the Italian government.To some, a willingness among investors to take on the often extreme inflation, interest rate, credit and sovereign risk embedded in these securities, in exchange for a modest uptick in yield, is a surefire sign of an overheated bond market.“We are definitely at the early stages of a corporate bond bubble. Companies and governments are taking advantage of it by issuing long-dated debt,” says Stuart Ratcliff, chief investment officer of the Matrix Credit Opportunities fund.“I think it’s akin to covenant lite [which arguably signalled the top of the bull market in credit in 2007]. The fact that investors are prepared to invest for 50 or 100 years shows they are desperate for yield and are buying anything.”Horacio Valeiras, chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors, raises his eyebrows at the deals, given how few companies survive 50 years and the fact that, during the past century, sovereign bond investors in countries such as Argentina, Germany and Russia have suffered heavy losses.“The Mexico one was just puzzling to me, but somebody bought it,” he says. “The issuers are just taking advantage of a low interest rate environment.”However, data from Dealogic suggest that, despite the media attention recent deals have attracted, issuance of long-dated bonds is not running at elevated levels.Admittedly $7.8bn of 50-year plus sovereign paper has been issued so far this year, a figure exceeded only in 2005 and 2009, according to Dealogic, whose data stretch back to 1995.But 50-year plus issuance by financial institutions has reached just $894m so far this year, the lowest figure for five years and well down on the $10.3bn of such paper issued in 2007.For other corporate investment-grade companies, long-term issuance has been $1.3bn in 2010, against a peak of $14.9bn in 2007.“For non-financial corporates we have had quite low issuance. A lot of them were just making sure last year that they had lots of credit in place.“They rushed towards the bond market to issue more than they needed,” says Willem Sels, head of investment strategy for HSBC Private Bank, UK.“That issuance has collapsed but banks and sovereigns continue to issue.“The demand for long-dated issuance is reasonably high from institutional investors and even from private clients as well. People are looking for yield.”From a corporate treasurer’s perspective, it is widely perceived to be a good time to issue long-dated debt, with investors happy to accept historically low yields.But some argue this should ring alarm bells.“If it’s a very good time to issue debt it’s not a very good time to buy debt,” says Mr Ratcliff. “Smart companies are taking advantage of the very low yield environment to secure financing whether they need it or not. Yields probably will rise in the next year or so.”Mr Sels warns: “When corporates start to feel that they should lock in yields, that is a signal that we are close to the turn in the bond market.”With 30-year US Treasury yields now around 4.2 per cent, he believes the 3.9 per cent yield seen earlier in November may prove to have been “very close to the lows,” potentially limiting further long-term bond issuance.“If you start to have really significant inflation fears and the Fed[eral Reserve] doesn’t manage to lock the 30-year yield where it is now, then issuance is going to drop,” he argues.The Fed’s latest $600bn quantitative easing programme has bolstered inflation expectations, pushing up long bond yields; the Mexican century bond issued in October with a 6.1 per cent coupon fell below 90 per cent of par on November 16, before edging up to 92.5 last week.This aptly demonstrates one of the risks to long-term nominal bonds. “Our view is that this is not a deflationary environment. If it was then we would be buying,” says Mr Valeiras.With corporate spreads over government debt relatively tight – Goldman’s 50-year bond was priced at 6.125 per cent, Rabobank’s 100-year paper at 5.8 per cent – these bonds are also vulnerable to interest rate risk.“When spreads are very tight [corporate bond yields] just move up and down one for one with the relevant government benchmark,” says Mr Ratcliff.However, the greatest concern at present, for corporate as well as government debt, could be the risk of a eurozone sovereign debt default.“In 1997/98 people started to feel less comfortable about corporate risk. This time around the sell-off risk comes more from sovereign bond yields rather than corporate bond spreads widening,” says Mr Sels.However, some are more upbeat. Suki Mann of Société Générale points out that investors in the Rabobank bond, for instance, will get their money back (in nominal terms) in dividends after just 17 years of the instrument’s 100-year life.And Jim Cielinski, head of fixed income at Threadneedle, says the historically low yields on long-dated bonds could simply be a sign of confidence that interest rates will remain low for a long time to come, rather than necessarily being a harbinger of doom.“We have opportunistically participated in some of these bonds,” he says."

67;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2010-10-06T17:56:55Z;Mexico’s sale of the century;Country joins elite list of issuers of new 100-year bonds;"In the past 100 years, Mexico has undergone revolution, bloody civil war, a four-decade economic miracle and more than its share of economic crises, many of which are within living memory.Should any investor be prepared to bet on its next 100 years – or that of any country? That, in theory, is what investors have just done, buying $1bn in so-called century bonds this week.Mexico joins an elite club of century issuers, including recently Rabobank and Norfolk Southern railway.Ultra long-dated bonds are not new; the UK, for example, has still outstanding some undated war bonds and 19th century consols. It also now regularly issues 50-year gilts.For Mexico, this deal looks very smart and will bolster its reputation as an innovative debt manager. But what is really in it for investors?The most common answer is the higher yield holders obtain for the extra risk. But buying Mexico’s 30-year bonds yielded 7.1 per cent on Wednesday. The coupon on the new century bonds was 6.1 per cent.The second answer is the need for insurers and pension funds with long-dated liabilities to find assets to match these. Century bonds would do this on paper, but for them to meet these faraway pay-outs, they will still have to retain real value.Cynics suggest no one buys a century bond thinking further away than their next job move since it won’t be their problem when it does come due. But designing securities to meet investors’ immediate needs – in this case to apparently cover long-term liabilities – without having a case to justify their existence is the sort of thinking that produced many of the structures associated with the credit crunch.Those with long-term liabilities will of course want assets to match. But securities without a fundamental investment rationale are no real help to anyone.James Mackintosh is away"
68;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2010-10-06T01:30:10Z;Mexico sells $1bn of 100-year bonds;;The Mexican government has sold $1bn in bonds with a maturity of 100 years in what is the first century bond issued by a Latin American sovereign.The decision to sell the bonds on Tuesday came as Latin America’s second-largest economy took advantage of investor demand for higher-yielding investments against a backdrop of record-low interest rates in Europe and the US.Emerging-market debt has been popular with investors who have fled to the safety of bonds, but who are looking for greater returns than those offered on debt issued by developed markets.About $40bn of investors’ money has flowed into emerging markets debt funds in the first nine months of the year, four times the previous record for a full year, according to EPFR, a data provider that monitors fund flows.That level of demand helped push Mexico’s benchmark 10-year bond to a record-low yield this year.Tuesday’s issue was priced to yield 6.1 per cent. Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs arranged the sale. Goldman officials said Mexico’s deal was the largest ever for century bonds and only the second one bigger than $500m.Richard McNeil, head of Latin American capital markets at Goldman, said more century bonds from Latin America were “quite possible. The appetite among investors for investments in Latin America is very strong.”Mexico is the third emerging market sovereign to tap the century bond market, joining China and the Philippines, according to Dealogic. It is the third issuer this year, after railroad operator Norfolk Southern and Rabobank of the Netherlands reopened the market after several years.Analysts said that the bonds were an opportunity for Mexico to reassert and consolidate its positive reputation with investors.Enrique Alvarez, head of research for Latin American financial markets at IDEAglobal in New York, said: “They are establishing a far-reaching point on a curve that simply says that investors are very willing to take in the Mexican name.”Behind that ability is a startling transformation in the country’s public-debt profile compared with the mid-1990s. In 1994, at the time of the so-called Tequila crisis, the country’s federal government external debt was equivalent to 16.5 per cent of gross domestic product. On Wednesday, it is 4.8 per cent of GDP, just less than 20 per cent of the total debt.But not everyone was excited. “I’m not seeing investor interest yet in 50-100 year bonds. This might create a market, but I’m sceptical,” Pierre-Yves Bareau, global head of emerging market debt at JPMorgan Asset Management, told the Financial Times. “Given the illiquidity, there are better uses for investors’ cash.”The majority of the bonds were sold to US institutional investors, with the greatest demand from insurance companies.Additional reporting by Stacy-Marie Ishmael in New York
69;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2010-09-22T21:28:30Z;Return trip to top levels of UK transport;Tim O’Toole elevated to the leading job at First Group;Tim O’Toole’s elevation to the leading job at First Group represents a remarkable return to the top levels in British transport, less than 18 months after he announced his departure from the UK to return to his native Philadelphia.Mr O’Toole had spent six years in London as managing director of London Underground, operator of the capital’s tube. He left in April last year saying he wanted to spend more time with his family, amid rumours of rows over future funding for underground upgrades.He had become one of the most respected figures in UK transport and brought new discipline to London Underground’s operations.He never fully left the UK. He became a non-executive director of FirstGroup in May 2009 and, this March, was approached by Tube Lines, the private contractor upgrading three London tube lines, to be its chief executive. That offer lapsed after London Underground announced in May it was taking Tube Lines over.Instead, in June he became FirstGroup’s chief operating officer and deputy chief executive, a move that can now be seen as preparation for his elevation to the top job.Mr O’Toole, who has a reputation as an intense, methodical man with an eye for operational detail, has previous experience as chief executive of a major company. He was the last chief executive of Conrail, one of the US’s biggest railroads, before it was split up between CSX and Norfolk Southern, two rivals. He is still a non-executive director of CSX.However, he is likely to need both his operational expertise and his skill at operating with the public sector in his new task. FirstGroup both needs to maintain a tight grip over complex operations such as its First Great Western rail franchise and do its best to avoid losing out from looming cuts in UK public spending.
70;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investors turn to century bonds in the hunt for yield;;Taking the “long view” has just acquired a new meaning. Amid record low interest rates and fears about a double-dip recession, many yield-hungry investors had already turned to long-dated bonds to generate returns. Now, a far-sighted few have taken the opportunity to lock in an income stream for 100 years.Tying up your money for a century might sound a dull option, even for investors fearful that the effects of the financial crisis could last several years yet.But, with official interest rates close to zero and absolute yields on nearly everything from long-dated US and European government debt to emerging market corporate bonds at historic lows, more investors are turning to extremely long-dated debt.Recently, a small number invested $600m in bonds that mature in 2110. Rabobank, the Dutch lender, sold $350m of 100-year bonds this week. US rail company Norfolk Southern last month sold $250m of century bonds. Buying such debt makes sense to insurance companies or pension funds that have to pay out set amounts over long periods of time. Institutions that have long-term liabilities to meet over the coming decades tend to match them with assets that will pay a steady amount over similar periods.Not only are people living longer and liabilities being extended, but these investors are having to look even further along the yield curve to generate the returns they need. Jonny Fine, head of syndicate at Goldman Sachs, which managed the sales of both bonds, predicts more 100-year launches this year.“It is difficult to get the yield folks are trying to generate,” he says.This week’s 100-year bond from Rabobank paid 5.8 per cent, slightly below the average yield paid on 30-year US Treasuries in the past 20 years.The search for yield is hardly a new story. Indeed, it was at the centre of the financial crisis as investors around the world flocked to complex structured finance securities, which offered generous returns but still had triple A credit ratings.Before the crisis, there was a perception that the yield pick-up was available for little extra risk. As it turned out, the risks were simply mispriced and many of these once top-rated securities backed by risky US mortgage payments proved to be worth much less than anticipated or nothing at all.With faith in credit ratings shattered, investors are doing more fundamental research about companies and opting for simpler investments.There are two common avenues that investors usually pursue to pick up yield. Either they can accept more interest rate risk by extending the maturity of government bond holdings and corporate debt. Or they can take more credit risk by buying bonds from riskier sources, such as companies with junk ratings.The move to riskier corporate credits has already led to a record year of junk bond sales in 2010. This week, junk bond issuance marketed in the US so far this year reached nearly $168bn, according to Dealogic. This is more than for the whole of 2009, when the $164bn junk bond total set an annual record.So great have been the inflows into junk-rated debt that some investors are passing on deals, feeling that yields are no longer high enough.Rod Davidson, head of fixed income at Alliance Trust Asset Management, is holding no high yield bonds, even though he could invest 20 per cent of his fund in such debt. “High yield has been a fantastic performer. But there is only so far that it can go. We feel at the moment that the additional yield isn’t sufficient for the additional volatility you take on,” he says. He obtains yield by owning longer-dated, investment-grade corporate debt of between five and 15 years.Longer duration bonds can also provide a yield uptick, but in the current zero interest rate environment the relative gain over holding shorter-dated debt has diminished.Even though the yield gap between 10 and 30-year US government debt is the biggest it has been for a long time, the low level of actual interest rates, even for 30-year debt, means investing in government debt with longer maturities may not generate enough extra return for investors. Hence the growing interest even further along the yield curve and in corporate issuance such as Rabobank’s bond.“Absolute yields on long-dated Treasuries are so low that it is no longer a balanced bet,” says Ashish Shah, co-head of credit at Alliance Bernstein.“Investors get a better yield pick-up by moving into corporate bonds, rather than increasing duration in government bonds.”Moreover, with uncertainty about the strength of the economic recovery, the risk of a eurozone sovereign debt default and the outlook for interest rates continuing to cause jitters in financial markets, there is particularly strong interest from investors to find ways to hedge against extreme outcomes, or “tail risks”.“Many investors are still expecting a reasonable amount of volatility,” says Mr Shah.The question is when the turning point for long-dated debt will arrive. That will be the moment when investors have decided yields have fallen so low, even on the longest dated bonds, that it makes little sense to put more money into fixed income despite the attraction of a guaranteed income stream.“If a company issues a 100-year bond, that is maybe the point in the cycle that an investor might think, it is not the time to invest,” says Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income research at Evolution Securities. “Either we are going to have to get used to lower returns or people are going to have to take more risk.”
71;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2010-08-23T23:07:47Z;Norfolk Southern in 100-year issue;;Norfolk Southern, a railway operator, sold 100-year bonds as companies seized upon rock-bottom interest rates to borrow for the long term.The company sold $250m in the bonds, more than twice the $100m minimum announced, with a yield of just 5.95 per cent by reopening an existing century bond that it sold in 2005. It is an attractive rate for a company that is rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors Service and triple B plus by Standard & Poor’s.Uncertainty about economic growth has prompted a rally in US Treasury bonds, sending benchmark yields near all-time lows. Investors have also flocked to corporate bonds since the financial crisis as a middle ground between low yielding government debt and stocks.That combination has enabled some companies, such as IBM and Johnson & Johnson, to sell bonds at the lowest rates ever.“We decided to [sell the bonds] because rates are so low and there is strong appetite for 100-year bonds,” said Robin Chapman, a spokesman for Norfolk Southern.Norfolk is believed to have achieved the lowest yield for 100-year debt, a person familiar with the deal said.Its 2005 century bonds were also the last marketed in the US, according to Dealogic. Other issuers have included Coca-Cola, Federal Express and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but such bonds are not commonplace.They are a good match for insurance companies who have long-term liabilities that they need to balance with long-term assets, but other investors were sceptical.“You are giving a company money for a long period of time with no ability to foresee the conditions in that period of time and for a very low interest rate,” said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.Investors who bought Ford’s century debt at a higher rate in an issue from 1997 saw their bonds fall to less than 15 cents on the dollar when the US car industry was in crisis over the past few years, Mr Brady said. They have since recovered, but still trade at less than 90 cents on the dollar. The price of bonds also falls when rates rise.
72;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2010-01-20T22:18:54Z;CSX boss warns on US rail legislation;;Investment in US freight railways will fall if proposed federal rail legislation is passed in its present form, the chief executive of the sector’s third-largest company has warned after announcing improved fourth-quarter net earnings.Michael Ward was speaking on Wednesday after CSX, the larger of two big railways in the eastern US, became the first major US-based rail company to announce 2009 results.CSX reported net earnings for the three months to December 25 up 23 per cent over the same quarter of 2008 to $305m on revenue down 13 per cent to $2.32bn. Full-year net earnings fell 16 per cent to $1.15bn on revenue down 20 per cent to $9.04bn.CSX had demonstrated its operating capability by withstanding the worst economic recession of recent times and emerging stronger, Mr Ward said. However, he expressed concern about the potential effects of legislation being debated to strengthen the powers of the Surface Transportation Board, the industry’s regulator.The main railways have long been concerned that tightening regulation could reduce the incentives for large investments in improved infrastructure and rolling stock. Some railway customers – particularly those that have no choice of operator – have complained about steep price rises.CSX is due to make $1.7bn capital investment this year.“We are concerned about threatened federal regulations that will without doubt cut investment in freight rail systems,” Mr Ward said.The company would comply with new federal regulations on rail signalling – expected to cost CSX $750m by 2015.But Mr Ward went on: “At the same time, we see other substantial federal demands on the horizon which could negatively impact the financial health of the industry. The current Senate version of the STB re-authorisation bill is not balanced.”Fuel – one of CSX’s largest outgoings – cost $250m in 2009, down 24 per cent on the year before. However, revenue from fuel surcharges also fell. Revenues and profitability were also hit by a 24 per cent fall in revenues from coal, the single biggest commodity for most freight railways and one of the most profitable cargoes.
73;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2009-11-03T20:42:04Z;Buffett sends important signal in rail move;;When Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s chief aide, addressed the 2007 shareholder meeting of one of the companies in the Berkshire Hathaway group, he was frank about railroad investing. The pair who run Berkshire had been too late to spot a change in the nature of a business they had hated, he admitted.In light of that admission, Berkshire Hathaway’s $26bn bid for Burlington Northern Santa Fe – which values the company at $44bn, including $10bn of debt and the value of the stake Berkshire had accumulated since 2007 – looks like a bold effort to make up for lost time.“We threw out our paradigms, but did it too late,” Mr Munger said in 2007.The question now is what light Berkshire Hathaway’s offer for the railroad company sheds on the wider prospects of a business Mr Munger says he and Mr Buffett had regarded as “terrible” and “lousy for investors”.Henry Posner, who invests in railways worldwide through his Pittsburgh-based Railroad Development Corporation, welcomes the signal the proposed takeover will give to would-be rail investors.“This is the highest vote of confidence any company can have,” Mr Posner says.The BNSF takeover conforms to many of Mr Buffett’s famous rules of investment. The company has some of the most highly regarded managers in the US railroad sector, led by Matthew Rose, chief executive. BNSF management invested heavily in improving capacity earlier this decade, at a point when most investment analysts doubted it was worthwhile.The result was that, when Union Pacific, the other main railroad in the western US, suffered severe congestion during a surge in container traffic in 2004, BNSF handled the traffic far more easily.“They are extremely well run,” says Anthony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst.BNSF also faces far fewer competition problems than many railroads have faced in recent years. Railroads compete strongly against trucking companies, which labour with higher fuel and labour costs. A wave of consolidation in the sector – Burlington Northern merged with the Santa Fe railroad in 1995 – has left two major operators.Mr Buffett’s move also comes amid an economic downturn that has shown the profitability of the bigger rail companies to be resilient. While the profitability of many transport operators has slumped, BNSF’s third-quarter figures, announced on October 22, showed operating income down only 25.3 per cent on the same quarter in 2008, to $901m. This was in spite of a 27 per cent fall in the third-quarter freight revenue to $3.49bn.“There are still people out there who believe the rail industry is obsolete and slowly dying,” Mr Hatch says, but adds: “That’s not been true for 15 years.”The deal is unlikely to run into the regulatory problems that have held up other railroad mergers. Thomas Hund, BNSF’s finance director, told investors yesterday that, because Berkshire Hathaway controlled no other railroads, the Surface Transportation Board, the regulator, should not need to get involved.According to Mr Hatch, the deal also suggests Mr Buffett is unconcerned at the prospect of more rigorous railroad regulation under Barack Obama’s presidency. Concerns over such prospects have increased since February, when BNSF was ordered to pay $100m reparations to Western Fuels, a coal customer, and cap its rates to the customer for 16 years.Instead, Henry Posner argues, the transaction could encourage BNSF to take a longer-term view of investment in capacity – potentially improving its service to its customers.The wider impact of Mr Buffett’s move remains unclear, however. Other companies among the big four US railroads saw share price rises on yesterday’s news. Main rival Union Pacific rose 6.8 per cent, while Norfolk Southern rose 2.4 per cent and CSX 6 per cent. Investor interest is frequently boosted when Mr Buffett makes a major move in a sector, Mr Hatch says.But few investors now are likely to find the resources for as ambitious a bid.His conversion to believing in the merits of railroad investing is unlikely to remain unique, but his ability to swallow large operators might be, according to Mr Hatch. “I don’t think there are a lot of other private investors who can afford this kind of price, particularly in the current environment.”

The index has given up 5 per cent from a 2009 high reached on October 19.The S&P 500, which bottomed in early March, remains per 15.4 cent higher for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday fell 1.2 per cent to 9,762.69. The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.7 per cent lower at 2059.61.Investors have lately been leery of buying into signs of a stronger economy, said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“Early on it was a reluctance to believe in the recovery,” he said. “As people become more convinced about the recovery, they really remain concerned about how far the markets have moved.”Third-quarter corporate earnings announcements on Wednesday sent mixed messages on the economic recovery.Among the stocks most punished was Goodyear, the tyremaker, whose revenues declined 15 per cent in the quarter. It dropped 19.6 per cent to $13.46 as the group indicated that its North American business faced struggles.International Paper declined 3.5 per cent to $21.83 after telling investors that seasonally weak demand would render “significantly lower” results in the final quarter of the year from the past quarter.A report that sales of new houses in the US fell a surprise 3.6 per cent in September also damped market sentiment. Shares of Lennar, a builder, fell 7.5 per cent to $12.63.Energy stocks felt pressure. US coal miner Massey Energy sank 8.5 per cent to $28.66 as weak demand from power plants triggered a profit drop. Rival Peabody Energy was 6 per cent lower at $39.64.ConocoPhillips, the first big US oil producer to report results this week, was down 2.8 per cent at $49.49 after announcing a 71 per cent drop in profit to $1.5bn, or $1 a share.A steep decline in crude futures on Wednesday also dented its shares.Financial stocks sputtered. Insurer Genworth Financial fell 7.6 per cent to $8.69 while insurer MBIA fell 8.2 per cent to $4.02.Meanwhile, card payment processor Visa rose 3.6 per cent to $76.57 after beating profit forecasts and indicating that consumer spending could be firming up.The Commerce Department reported orders for long-lived goods from US manufacturers rose 1 per cent last month, marking a reversal from a decline in August.“Through the month-to-month volatility, the improvement in manufacturing activity is evident across a large number of reports, and this is another one that fits into that picture,” analysts at RDQ Economics wrote in a note.Yet industrial stocks did not reflect optimism. US Steel fell 5 per cent to $35.53 after its quarterly loss announced this week was followed by disappointing results at ArcelorMittal, the largest steelmaker.

75;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2009-09-20T16:07:43Z;CSX prepares for a railroad rebound;;The US railway that spent 18 months fighting a hedge fund demanding it cut investment is spending $1.6bn this year to prepare for a post-recession rebound, said its chief executive.The comments by Michael Ward, of CSX Corporation, are the latest bullish sign from the US railroad sector, where improved returns and profitability of recent years have held up surprisingly well in the recession’s slump in traffic.It is a sign of renewed confidence from CSX, which was one of the worst-performing large US railroads for many years. This followed its botched integration in 1999 of parts of Conrail.Between October 2007 and April this year, The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, tried to push CSX to raise borrowing, hand cash back to investors and reduce capital spending. TCI, which with 3G, another hedge fund, had appointed several directors to CSX’s board, sold its stake suddenly in April.CSX is now “on a par with or better than” other large US railroads, Mr Ward says. In this year’s second quarter, CSX had an operating ratio – the proportion of revenue taken up by operating costs – of 73 per cent. This is better for example than the 74.8 per cent of the Norfolk Southern railroad or the 75.2 per cent of the Burlington, Northern and Santa Fe railroad – both had been better performers in recent years.“One of the big questions everybody has had is, ‘How do [railroads] fare during a recession?’” said Mr Ward. “We’re doing quite well, all things considered. The market is starting to say, ‘Gee, this railroad industry can withstand a recession’.”The company was investing in track upgrades and terminals to receive and distribute goods to be ready for the recovery, Mr Ward added. “We’re still finding $1.6bn this year for further investments.”Traffic fell less sharply in the second quarter of the year than in the first, Mr Ward said. Unusually, the third quarter was so far producing higher traffic levels than the second. But some forms of traffic, including automotive parts and intermodal traffic – goods moved in shipping containers – were down sharply from their peak.CSX has responded by parking 600 of its 3,600 engines and 30,000 of its 93,000 coaches, while putting 2,400 employees on extended leave. “What we’ve been able to do is resize the network,” Mr Ward said. “We said, ‘We have much lower volumes here. How do we still serve the customers well and do it with a lot fewer trains and a lot fewer people?’”But long-term factors that fuelled recent years’ rail traffic growth were still at work, he insists. They included a growing tendency for trucking companies to use trains for long-haul moves of containers, to save on expensive fuel and labour, though rate cuts from desperate small trucking lines masked the trend.“We think long term, so we don’t overreact to some of these short-term aberrations,” Mr Ward said.Factors favouring rail would re-emerge particularly strongly when consumer spending rebounded, Mr Ward said.He expected that to happen in spite of recent increases in saving by US consumers.“We think the highways in the US are going to get more and more congested.“There’s going to be a real position for us and we’re investing accordingly.”
76;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2009-06-02T02:19:37Z;Car industry could learn from Penn Central;;Passengers arriving at the station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania’s state capital, are greeted by the sight of a magnificent, ageing 1930s electric locomotive with the word “Pennsylvania” down the side.The locomotive – known as a GG1 – is one of the most visible reminders of the links between this crucial part of the US rail network and a bankruptcy filing that, in its time, was just as shocking as General Motors’ filing is now: that of the Penn Central railroad in June 1970.Harrisburg’s continuing role as a key hub in the current flourishing, healthy US rail sector offers some hints, meanwhile, about how the US motor industry could recover from its problems via government ownership to be a healthy part of the US economy again.Harrisburg station’s GG1 in 1938 pulled the first electric train into Harrisburg at a time when the Pennsylvania Railroad, which operated the route, called itself “the standard railroad of the world”.Its markets, providing express passenger services and moving heavy freight, looked as secure as GM’s prospects did in the 1950s and 1960s. However, by the 1960s the company was facing competitive pressures from the interstate highway system and increasing air travel. It tried to solve the problems through a merger with the New York Central, which came into effect after long negotiations in February 1968.As in GM’s case, the unions played a big role – they won an agreement that every dismissed worker after the merger would receive a year’s pay for every five years of service, making it prohibitively expensive for the two railroads to cut jobs. The Interstate Commerce Commission, the then-regulator, also forced railroads to keep operating lossmaking services. The ICC forced the merged company to take on the lossmaking New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1969. Much of Penn Central’s accounting was questionable and the merger poorly organised, with service standards collapsing in the aftermath.When the merged railroad sought bankruptcy protection in June 1970, it had $7bn in assets, 94,000 employees, was the sixth-largest company in the US by market capitalisation and was by far the largest US corporate bankruptcy.Henry Posner, chairman of Railroad Development Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based railway investment company, says Penn Central’s involvement in infrastructure and its strict regulation make its case different from GM. But Penn Central’s collapse, he points out, helped to lead to the abolition of the rules that brought about its collapse.“Railroads were thought of as businesses that required external funding from the public sector,” Mr Posner says. “The ultimate lesson was that that was not necessary. It was deregulation as opposed to public funding that turned the tide.”Penn Central’s passenger services were hived off to government-funded Amtrak. Penn Central’s freight operations were taken into government ownership and merged with other bankrupt north-eastern railroads in government-owned Conrail in 1976. The sector was then comprehensively deregulated under the Staggers Act in 1980 that allowed railroads to cut unprofitable services and charge market rates for their services.The railroad sector that has emerged had until recently been one of the US industries most resistant to the economic downturn.Motor industry executives can only hope that their industry can be returned to sound health more quickly.
77;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2009-05-26T02:25:27Z;US road haulage: Rail rivalry pulls big rigs off the highway;;It is one of the defining images of the rural US. Across mile upon mile of highway in the plains of the midwest, the rolling hills of the south-east or the forests of New England, huge trucks thunder, carrying goods from producers to customers or from distribution centres to retailers. The names of the biggest trucking lines – JB Hunt, YRC, Schneider National and Ryder – become as familiar as the names of the fast-food chains in the roadside stop-offs.For many truckers, however, in recent years long stretches of highway have been a less familiar home than the gatehouses and cranes of railroad companies’ intermodal yards, where shipping containers move between truck and rail. As the US economic boom was at its most intense two years ago, trucking lines started to make long-distance movements of containers and truck trailers to rail. The containers make only the short journeys to and from the railyard on a truck.With fuel prices high, and drivers both scarce and reluctant to spend days away from home at a time, the system reduced the number of drivers needed, allowed the drivers to operate nearer home and often cut costs. The move also allowed environmentally conscious customers to say they were reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.Bill Matheson, president of the intermodal division of Schneider National, which handles trips made by a mix of rail and truck, says that in summer last year shippers started to look at rail even for some shorter-haul trips in the eastern US. Fuel at $4 a gallon was accounting for – a historically high – half of the cost of an all-truck trip.“That certainly made it a far more competitive argument to convert over to intermodal,” he says.Yet now, he says, fuel prices have dropped sharply. Drivers are far easier to find as redundancies at truck and other companies bring more people on to the market.Trucking company prices have also collapsed as traffic volumes have shrunk. Truck freight volumes in March this year were 12.2 per cent below the same month last year, according to the American Trucking Associations.“Capacity right now is far exceeding the volume of demand,” Mr Matheson says. “So truck pricing is what I would call unsustainably low.”The question is whether the present conditions will alter the long-term trend away from all-truck journeys and towards the truck-rail intermodal mix.Anthony Hatch, an independent, New York-based railroad analyst, says truck capacity has remained far higher than expected given the falling demand, so prices have dropped sharply. Many shippers are playing off truck and rail against each other in search of a bargain.“The price of oil has allowed a lot of the truckers to hang on,” he says. “There’s shifting back and forth [between truck and rail]. It’s pretty dynamic.”Trucks are undoubtedly competing with rail better over shorter-haul routes.Yet the change has still been less dramatic than might have been expected.That is partly because intermodal business continues to make economic sense for trucking lines, according to Mr Matheson. Schneider’s intermodal operations require less capital investment than its long-haul operations, partly because short-haul trucks are cheaper and need no driver sleeping accommodation.“If a driver is moving a 1,000-mile load, that driver is going to be tied up for two days to deliver it,” Mr Matheson says. “In intermodal, a driver typically will deliver three loads a day.”There is also less short-term switching between modes, according to Mr Hatch, because the largest customers normally have long-term contracts with transport providers.Instead, there continues to be a surprising amount of shift towards rail from customers as companies prepare both for an expected rebound in fuel prices, an economic recovery and to reduce their carbon emissions by using more rail.Norfolk Southern, the US’s fourth-largest railroad, even reported a 2 per cent rise in domestic intermodal traffic for the first quarter this year when nearly every other form of traffic declined.The world recession may have slowed the shift in long-haul traffic to rail from road, Mr Matheson says, but few shippers believe trucking companies’ current, rock-bottom prices will stay so low long-term.“We have shippers who understand this is not sustainable,” he says. “We are still finding interest in intermodal.”
78;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2009-02-08T22:33:18Z;US rail companies steam through the downturn in profit;;North America’s principal rail companies underlined their growing resilience and pricing power by reporting improved operating profits for the quarter when the economic downturn started in earnest.Over the past three weeks, the four biggest US-based operators – Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX and Norfolk Southern – all reported improved operating profits for the quarter compared with 2007, in spite of sharp volume falls in some commodities.Anthony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, said the last quarter’s figures showed the companies had continued to enjoy the power to maintain prices they developed in the years of strong growth between 2003 and 2007.In the past, railroads were often forced to slash their rates during a recession to win traffic from trucking companies and keep the cash flow necessary to service their debts.“In the fourth quarter, we went from a slowdown to a complete collapse in demand,” Mr Hatch said. “Railroads responded with a good quarter. It’s further evidence that the rail renaissance, as I call it, is actually happening.”Railroads’ finances have improved as growing traffic levels have filled up the available capacity of their networks. For many, that has raised the returns on investments in new capacity above the cost of the capital required for the first time in more than 60 years.Even in areas where demand fell in the fourth quarter, revenue generally fell less than traffic. BNSF, which with Union Pacific dominates rail traffic in the western two-thirds of the US, saw volumes of automotive traffic – mainly new cars – fall 28.6 per cent between the last quarters of 2007 and 2008. But revenue per unit moved rose 20 per cent. Similarly, international inter-modal traffic – shipping containers moving between ports and end-customers – fell 11 per cent but revenue per unit moved rose 5.9 per cent.The companies’ pricing power was still more evident in the areas where demand remained strong. Norfolk Southern, which depends on coal mined in West Virginia and Pennsylvania for about a quarter of its revenues, benefited both from steady domestic demand for power station coal and continuing export demand. Coal volumes in the fourth quarter were up 5 per cent on the previous year, while revenues rose 33 per cent to $798m.However, according to Mr Hatch, demand for railroads to move containers within North America could be a still more positive long-term sign. Many observers had believed growth in recent years in the segment was dependent on high fuel prices, which made it cheaper for trucking lines to send goods by train for most of their trips.The only slight falls in volumes in the fourth quarter, when fuel prices fell substantially, suggest that instead a long-term shift of such traffic from road to rail is under way.
79;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2008-10-29T20:59:01Z;US railroads on track;;The US economy may be going off the rails, but don’t tell that to the men who make the trains run on time. It would seem the four big freight railroad companies that haul much of the industrial output and deliver commodities from coast to coast would be the first to feel the pain of the sharp downturn. Instead they are thriving. Recent quarterly reports for Norfolk Southern, CSX, Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe revealed an average of 29 per cent earnings per share growth versus the same period a year ago, with all four beating consensus forecasts and issuing mostly upbeat guidance.This stands in stark contrast to the ailing trucking industry or indicators such as the Baltic Dry index, measuring bulk shipping rates, which is off 90 per cent since June. The reason for the huge discrepancy is the quasi-monopolistic nature of railways and long-term tariff agreements. The sector’s return on equity climbed enough to attract Warren Buffett’s interest in BNSF last year.Since 1980, when the industry was partially deregulated and emerged from decades of decline, it has seen volumes rise and productivity increase amid falling tariffs. Tight capacity has allowed railways to raise prices the past few years but rates per-ton-mile are 54 per cent less in real terms than in 1981. That means rail remains extremely competitive versus trucks.All the big railways see easing volumes next quarter, having taken a hit from the slumping housing, auto and chemical industries. Next year they may even face some weakness in cash cows such as coal and grains, while expensive new safety mandates are also a concern. Railway shares’ relative outperformance does not make them expensive though. At about 11 times prospective earnings, the industry is priced for neither growth nor a derailment, and that seems about right.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
80;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2008-09-29T17:52:10Z;US freight lines carrying a lighter burden;;"The huge yellow crane straddling the tracks at one of Norfolk Southern Railway’s container-handling yards works steadily along the train. It lifts each of the two containers stacked on each railcar and places them on to a waiting flatbed truck trailer, ready to be driven off.Business at the yard in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania remains steady in spite of the downturn in demand for the consumer goods often carried in containers. Falling overall demand has been partially offset by the high fuel prices and driver shortages facing the US trucking industry.Lines such as JB Hunt, the US’s largest trucking company, save money by bringing containers to rail facilities such as Harrisburg for their journeys’ long-haul legs rather than hauling them by truck. As a result, revenues in Norfolk Southern’s Intermodal arm – its container-hauling business – were up 11 per cent year on year to $532m in the three months to June 30.There is even more robust activity at the Lamberts Point coal port that NS, the fourth largest US rail operator, operates in Virginia. Long lines of coal trucks wait at the port for loading on to ships. Demand for coal – including the 20m tonnes of Pennsyvlanian and West Virginian coal exported through Lamberts Point annually – gave NS coal revenues for the second quarter this year up 33 per cent on the same quarter of 2007.The less-severe-than-expected impact of reduced US consumer spending and strong growth in bulk commodities have together helped the seven large US and Canadian railways to withstand the economic slowdown better than any previous such crisis for several decades.For the second quarter this year, NS, one of two leading US operators east of the River Mississippi, reported net income up 15 per cent year on year to $453m on rail operating revenues up 16 per cent to $2.76bn. Union Pacific, the biggest operator west of the Mississippi, reported second-quarter net income up 19 per cent year on year to $531m on operating revenues up 13 per cent to $4.57bn.Anthony Hatch, an independent, New York-based rail analyst, says most leading groups beat market expectations in results in the second quarter. They were among the few groups in industrial North America to have done so.The sector’s strength has allowed it to raise prices. NS’s average revenue per carload of coal in the second quarter was up nearly 30 per cent year on year to $1,729; intermodal yields rose 9.6 per cent to $656.James Squires, NS’s chief financial officer, gives several reasons for the improvement, including the industry’s improving service.But a key factor has been rationalisation. The industry’s liberalisation in 1980 permitted operators to close lines and tear up unused tracks, saving millions of dollars in maintenance costs.There has also been consolidation among operators, which has allowed elimination of underused routes. “Capacity is still, on a comparative basis historically, relatively constrained,” Mr Squires says. “That leads to better pricing and financial performance even through a downturn.”Thanks to the price increases and volume growth, most large US rail groups for the first time in decades earn returns from investments higher than their cost of capital. As a result, railways are among the few US infrastructure owners investing heavily in increasing capacity. NS is still, for example, working on the $151m Heartland Corridor project to clear its route from the Hampton Roads ports in Virginia to Chicago to carry containers stacked two-high, as already happens on other parts of the network.The work – which, because of its potential to remove trucks from roads, is being part-funded by state and federal governments – should hugely improve the competitiveness of the Heartland route for container shipments to the Midwest.Mr Squires accepts that rail’s profitability and investment might not survive if the slowdown becomes very severe. “If there’s a long, deep recession, things are not going to go as well for us, even with the advantages and benefits we have,” he says.But NS is in a very different position from the years following its 1997 acquisition of part of Conrail, another leading railway, when its priority was to cut its debt.Now, says Mr Squires, NS is inclined to borrow so that its investments need not stop. “That gives you a lot more flexibility – including the ability to maintain growth-oriented investments which traditionally have been cut at the first sign of a downturn.”"
81;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2008-09-22T12:22:38Z;Road congestion and oil price invigorate trains;;Anyone arriving on an Amtrak passenger train at Union Station in Washington, DC sees evidence of the world’s railway boom. The trains arriving from Boston, New York and Philadelphia are fuller than ever in publicly owned Amtrak’s 38-year history. Downstairs in Union Station’s metro stop, the trains are full for much of the day and then, during the night, long freight trains run by CSX, the US east coast’s largest freight railroad, rumble through downtown Washington’s empty commuter stations, a reminder of the growth in most forms of rail freight over recent years.The boom is still more obvious in Asian cities such as Taipei, the Taiwanese capital. Smart new Japanese-built Shinkansen high-speed trains have captured significant market share from airlines for the journey between Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s second city, in the island’s south. At Jawaharlal Nehru Port, near Mumbai on India’s west coast, rail brings and hauls away an increasing share of the containers heading to and from inland India.In Europe, some of the strongest growth has come from the new, private freight operators competing with the continent’s established players and from private companies that have taken over some of the continent’s previously moribund regional rail routes. The continent’s web of high-speed rail connections also continues to grow impressively.The worldwide traffic growth has created a boom in work for the world’s trainmakers and equipment suppliers. According to a report published this month by Unife, the European Railway Industry Association, industry turnover has grown by an average 9 per cent annually in each of the last two years. Western Europe, the industry’s traditional heart, remains the most important region, says the report, prepared by consultants Roland Berger. But Asia’s rapid growth is set to move it ahead of North America as the industry’s second most important market. The industry’s annual average turnover in the last two years has been €123bn ($178bn), the Unife report estimates.“The short-term time horizon is characterised by huge growth rates,” says Andreas Schwilling, who compiled the report. Several large European rail operators are about to place significant orders, including France’s SNCF, Germany’s Deutsche Bahn and Spain’s Renfe, he points out. Only after those deliveries will the industry’s growth rate slacken off again – because so many important customers will have satisfied much of their need for new rolling stock.Michael Clausecker, Unife’s director general, points to long-term factors likely to sustain growth even once current orders are delivered. Growing environmental concerns have helped to shift both passengers and freight to rail. Well-loaded trains emit far fewer greenhouse gases per passenger or tonne of freight moved than road or air traffic. In many places, rail also provides an alternative to increasingly congested road systems.Surprisingly, the most obvious factor – rail’s price advantage over road and air because of high fuel prices – has been relatively minor, according to Mr Clausecker. While it has helped to encourage growth, the current upsurge in traffic started well before the most serious oil price hikes, he points out.As evidence of the shift, Mr Clausecker mentions the consideration being given to a dedicated high-speed passenger rail line from San Diego to Sacramento in California, an area that currently sees negligible long-distance passenger rail traffic, in contrast to the narrow, busy east coast corridor.“Even the fact that they’re investigating such a project shows that at least the economics for consideration of such a project have changed,” Mr Clausecker says, adding that greater importance is now placed on environmental considerations. Rail traffic in many regions has also benefited from strong worldwide demand for commodities such as coal, one of the cargoes best suited to travelling by train.The huge Lamberts Point coal-unloading facility of Norfolk Southern, one of the US’s major rail operators is far busier than for years, thanks to strong overseas demand for Appalachian and Pennsylvanian coal. The fuel arrives at the port in two-mile long trains to be tipped out of cars by huge machines and loaded on to ships.Australian and Brazilian railways are also seeing booming demand to move their countries’ coal, iron ore and other commodity products.Donald Seale, Norfolk Southern’s chief marketing officer, says demand for exported coal is up 63 to 64 per cent on last year – which was in turn 50 per cent up on the previous year. Domestic coal demand is also strong. Among Norfolk Southern’s locomotive purchases this year will be 24 aimed specifically at the demands of hauling coal.“We see very robust demand for coal for electrical generation going forward,” Mr Seale says. “That business continues to be good for us.”The recovery in rail’s fortunes also reflects the improving reliability and quality of rolling stock emerging from railway industry facilities – including the Erie, Pennsylvania, factory of General Electric, several hundred miles north-west of Lamberts Point.Among the improvements over the last 15 years has been a transformation in the design of the electric motors that drive nearly all rail vehicles, whether powered from electricity transmitted through overhead cables or from an onboard diesel engine. Many new vehicles have motors driven by alternating current electricity, rather than direct current. Such trams, suburban trains and diesel locomotives can provide greater power from motors requiring less maintenance.Diesel engines have been made far more fuel efficient – GE’s latest models produce the same power for 3 to 5 per cent less fuel, the company claims.In high-speed rail, France’s original Train à Grand Vitesse was considered a marvel when introduced in 1981 for its top speed of 270kph. But in Spain, Velaro high-speed trains built by Germany’s Siemens now routinely run at 350kph. The technology has been miniaturised so that the motors are now hidden beneath the floors to free up extra space for passengers. The new AGV high-speed train unveiled by Alstom, the TGV’s builder, in March has a standard top speed of 360kph.When a new metro such as that under construction in Dubai is planned, modern train control equipment means trains without drivers are the natural – and safest – choice. The world’s highest-profile train control project – the European Commission’s controversial European Rail Traffic Management System – also appears to be growing more reliable. It has gained significant overseas orders from customers glad that, because its specification is a publicly-available document, it can be produced by more than one supplier. Previously, railways that had chosen a signal supplier were its captive for any subsequent orders.The industry’s outstanding challenge, however, remains improving its profitability enough to afford more of the capacity expansions and rolling-stock purchases the new, higher levels of traffic demand. Amtrak, despite the strong traffic growth evident in Washington, made a net loss of $1.12bn in 2007 on $2.15bn revenue. The UK’s fast-growing rail system faces challenges meeting its investment needs as it faces sharp cuts in government subsidy over the next five years. Many other large railway systems rely to some degree on government support to survive.Yet profitability is already strong for some equipment suppliers. GE Transportation, the Erie-based locomotive builder, announced operating profits of $495m on $2.35bn sales for the first half of this year. Two of the big three European trainmakers are now solidly – if unspectacularly – profitable. Operators in many countries may follow suit as growing revenues cover the industry’s mostly fixed costs better and better.North America’s freight railroads have shown the way for train operators to achieve the same kinds of results. Many now earn such strong profits that, for the first time in 60 years, they earn more than it costs them to raise money for new investments.However, the growing revenue is bound to be good news even for less well-performing corners of the industry. Most of the industry’s costs are fixed, so that extra revenue can quickly turn into profit at the right level. That in turn may justify fresh investment and set off the next phase of rail’s renaissance.
82;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2008-08-31T22:35:33Z;Atticus principals to be hit where it hurts most;;"For most of the past decade, Atticus Capital has been a force to reckon with in global markets. From its base in New York, the hedge fund, which had more than $20bn of assets under management at its peak last year, helped dictate the course of mega-mergers and corporate strategy at some of the world’s biggest companies – and made a fortune in the process.Founded by Tim Barakett, a Canadian, in 1995, the young manager soon hired Nathaniel Rothschild, son of Lord Jacob Rothschild, to act as co-chairman and draw on his connections to raise money. He subsequently poached David Slager, a British-educated Dutch trader, from Goldman Sachs, who launched a European fund that grew rapidly to pass the original Global fund Mr Barakett runs.All three of them went on to make personal fortunes in the bull market, which ended in summer last year. Mr Barakett and Mr Slager were estimated by Trader Monthly magazine to have made $250m-$300m each last year, with Mr Rothschild adding to his family’s wealth with a similar income. The three of them, together with other staff, have more than $1.4bn invested in the $14bn fund, with Mr Barakett and Mr Slager having the vast bulk of their personal wealth tied up in Atticus.When the credit crunch hit in August last year, Atticus was caught out. The firm had a $1bn position in Britain’s Barclays Bank, where it was publicly opposing efforts by John Varley, chief executive, to buy Dutch rival ABN Amro – a deal that Barclays lost to Royal Bank of Scotland – as well as major unhedged holdings across many large companies. Mr Slager’s fund plunged more than 10 per cent in the month, its worst result yet, as banking shares, and Barclays, tumbled. Still, investors were unconcerned. The funds made back all their losses over the next two months, and the European fund ended 2007 up 28 per cent after fees – not a patch on the 44 per cent and 63 per cent gains of the previous two years, but still a phenomenal result for such a large fund.This year, investors have been more worried. The fund’s low levels of short-selling, which can hedge against falling markets, and its enormous position in Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the stock exchanges, has hammered its results. Mr Slager has recorded his seven worst months since the credit crisis hit, and at the end of August was down 32.9 per cent this year. Mr Barakett has fared slightly better, but was still down 25 per cent.Now the fund and its top executives are braced for at least a year without bonuses, as Atticus will receive no performance fees – the bulk of its income – until the funds have made back their losses – requiring gains of 50 per cent for Mr Slager and 33 per cent for Mr Barakett.“Perhaps one concludes that the time is over for them,” said one investor. However, other investors said the dire results over the past 12 months were just a “natural” give-back of some earlier profits. Clients who put money with Mr Slager when his fund launched in 2001, for example, have still made more than three and a half times their money, turning $10m at launch into almost $37m.Nicola Horlick, in the latest report to shareholders in Bramdean, the London-listed investment fund she runs, said its holding in Atticus European was expected to be volatile, and was kept small as a result. “Given that the manager maintains concentrated positions, the heavy losses in declining markets are not surprising,” she wrote.Still, this year’s losses have been galling for Atticus, which believes it has picked strong companies in sectors which are fundamentally sound.“We continue to be disappointed by what we believe is an over-reaction in specific themes to concerns about growth,” it said in a report to Atticus European investors last month.“These valuations indicate persistent fear, and reflect the willingness of many investors to de-risk their portfolios uneconomically,” it wrote. “Historically, these conditions have indicated the wrong time to sell equities, and we believe that remains true today.”The latest regulatory filings show Atticus running with three big investment themes at the end of June: mining and oil/energy, including a $1bn holding in ConocoPhillips; financials and stock exchanges, including more than €1bn ($1.47bn) of Deutsche Börse, and a combined $1bn in Visa and Mastercard; and US rail, with $1bn of Union Pacific and another $1bn in Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern. The hedge fund focuses on large companies, unlike many rivals, taking very large, concentrated positions. It originally started out following the “event-driven” strategy: buying cheap stocks where a corporate event could provide a catalyst for a jump in the price.As it grew bigger and more powerful it began to provide the catalyst itself, pushing management to take action it believed would boost the stock. In the case of Phelps Dodge, the miner, it even hired its own investment bankers to find a buyer, ahead of its sale last year to Freeport-McMoRan. It halved its $1.1bn equity stake in the second quarter, although it also bought $200m worth of options.Atticus has come under scrutiny for its links to The Children’s Investment Fund, an aggressive London activist hedge fund run by Chris Hohn, a Harvard friend of Mr Barakett.The two have frequently bought the same stocks or taken the same general views – including their focus on US rail – and are the two largest shareholders in Deutsche Börse.They worked together to prevent the exchange’s purchase of the London Stock Exchange, although subsequently they have diverged in views, particularly with regard to ABN, where Mr Hohn was pushing the Dutch bank to sell, while Atticus was trying to stop Barclays from buying.Concerns that they could be seen as acting together, highlighted by an inconclusive investigation by the German regulator, were behind Mr Hohn’s resignation last year as a director of RIT Capital, the listed Rothschild investment trust, where Mr Rothschild is also a director. RIT is an investor in Atticus, and the hedge fund rents its London office from RIT."

The sector advanced 2 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, Costco Wholesale said earnings would be “well below” Wall Street expectations as it had absorbed some recent hikes in energy prices to attract customers. Costco fell 11.9 per cent to $63.43. Wal-Mart Stores slid 1.6 per cent to $58.09 while Kroger lost 2.3 per cent to $28.18.There was some better news from PepsiCo and McDonald’s, which both beat analyst estimates for their quarterly results.PepsiCo rose 2.3 per cent to $67.72 but McDonald’s slipped 0.8 per cent to $59.66. The sector rose 0.5 per cent.In industrials, Boeing, the aerospace group and CH Robinson, the logistics provider, both undershot Wall Street expectations while Norfolk Southern, the railway company, outperformed.Boeing and CH Robinson fell 3.7 per cent to $66.72 and 15.6 per cent to $49.56, respectively. Norfolk, however, added 6.5 per cent to $69.96, helping the industrial sector advance 1.1 per cent.Seven of the 10 leading industry groups closed in the black, nudging the benchmark S&P 500 up 0.4 per cent at 1,282.12 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent higher at 11,632.38 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent ahead at 2,325.88 points.On Tuesday, stocks overturned early losses to surge in late trading after oil fell back and the new chief executive of Wachovia announced a turnround plan, prompting a powerful rally in banks.Financials climbed for a second session on Wednesdsay as lawmakers prepared to vote on a bill that would authorise the Treasury secretary to inject capital into the two government-sponsored entities if needed with only limited restrictions as part of a broader package to address the housing crisis.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, said: “The power of [the] blank cheque is huge in terms of restoring confidence in the major players of the mortgage market – Fannie and Freddie. Just having that there is psychologically very important to the market.”Fannie Mae climbed 11.9 per cent to $15 and Freddie Mac added 11.3 per cent to $10.80. The financial sector added as much as 4.6 per cent before paring gains to 1.9 per cent.Amid the positive sentiment, investors could not overlook poor results from Washington Mutual. The largest US savings and loans company, said it had lost $3.33bn in the second quarter, significantly more than forecast.Washington Mutual shares, which have lost about 88 per cent of their value in the past year, slumped 20.1 per cent to $4.65.The technology sector was also in focus. Overnight, Yahoo said second-quarter profits dropped 18 per cent to $131.2m on higher development costs and declining advertising spending.The company also reduced its full-year revenue forecast and the shares dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.39.EMC, the maker of storage-computers, was the leading sector gainer, however, surging 13.7per cent to $14.17 after it posted estimate-beating second-quarter profits and boosted its 2008 sales target. The technology sector advanced 1.4 per cent.Telecom stocks were the best performers on Wednesday. AT&T, the telephone carrier, said second-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent to $3.77bn, helping the shares to advance 3.9 per cent to $33.06 and the sector to add 3.4 per cent - its biggest one day gain since late January.As oil prices dropped, energy stocks were again a weak spot in spite of some solid earnings from ConocoPhillips. The third-largest US oil producer posted a record $5.44bn second-quarter profit thanks to soaring gas and oil prices. Still, investors were not satisfied and the shares fell 2.9 per cent to $81.83. The sector dipped 3.8 per cent
84;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2007-11-13T13:39:36Z;Investors flock to railroad recovery;;The recovery in the fortunes of the largest North American railroads has been marked by enthusiasm from three different types of investors - the very long-term, those adept at forcing a quick change of tack and private equity.The biggest name involved is Berkshire Hathaway, the vehicle of Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, which emerged as a major buyer of railroad stocks in May. Buffett’s company has concentrated heavily on BNSF, where it is by now much the biggest shareholder, but it has also taken stakes in Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. All three are seen as having the strong managements Mr Buffett favours.Railroads have been less enthusiastic about the attention of activist investors, often hedge funds. The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, is now the second-largest shareholder in CSX, whose management it is trying to force to change course, and also holds stakes in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific. Carl Icahn, the celebrity investor, and Atticus Capital have also taken railroad stakes.The most significant development, meanwhile, could be rising interest from the private equity industry. In July it emerged that one private equity house - Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management - had made a tentative approach to Canadian Pacific, which turned it down. However, private equity firms have bought up several short-line railroads, including the Florida East Coast Railroad, which sold itself to Fortress Investment Group in May for $3.5bn.
85;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
86;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;Mergers signal the rise of an all-powerful seven;;A series of mergers during the 1980s and 1990s shaped the structure of North America’s Class I railroads – all those with annual revenue of more than $319.3m – leaving most regions with just two competing operators.BNSF and Union Pacific compete over the western two-thirds of the US, while CSX and Norfolk Southern operate almost exclusively east of the Mississippi. The two Canadian Class Is – Canadian National and Canadian Pacific – have parallel routes from British Columbia to Canada’s main population centres, and substantial US operations.The seventh and smallest Class I – Kansas City Southern – operates mainly in a north-south corridor from the Canadian border through the Midwest into Mexico, where it owns one of the country’s two largest railroads.One of the two competing operators in each region has a history of being stronger than the other, even if the recent surge in traffic is reviving all lines. Just as BNSF’s operating figures have long been better than UP’s, Norfolk Southern has generally had stronger figures than CSX.
87;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;Railroads’ US revival entices investors;;Just four years ago, an economic slowdown like that now under way in the US would have produced long faces and worried expressions at the headquarters of Union Pacific, the US’s largest railroad by annual revenue, or at Burlington Northern and Santa Fe, the number two.This autumn, in spite of a slowdown of consumer demand – which drives railroads’ business carrying maritime containers – and of the housing market – which drives demand for building materials – executives at the two companies are positively buoyant.Omaha, Nebraska-based UP’s third-quarter operating income was a record $1bn, 34 per cent up on the year before, on $4.2bn revenue. Fort Worth, Texas-based BNSF’s income, also $1bn, on $4.07bn revenue, was 9 per cent up on the previous year.The robust performance results from a long-term surge in demand for nearly everything they deliver, from coal to shipping containers and from cars to wheat.The traffic has filled all the spare capacity on many routes and allowed operators to withstand slowdowns like the present one without cutting their rates.In previous economic cycles, the struggle to cover their high fixed costs meant railroads would often cut their rates in bad times to ensure truckers did not take too much of their business. This time the truckers are suffering.The railroads’ revival has provoked interest from many different kinds of investors. Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by Warren Buffett, has taken stakes in several companies, including 17.2 per cent of BNSF, seen as soundly managed.The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, and Carl Icahn, the activist investor, have concentrated on operators such as CSX, which they see as having the most turnround potential.CSX and UP still have more to do to catch up with the best-performing of the four largest US railroads, Norfolk Southern and BNSF. Of the two largest, BNSF, which competes with UP on key routes in the western US, still enjoys better returns and higher profitability than UP, thanks to its managers’ early spotting of the looming capacity shortage.BNSF had most of its key Los Angeles to Chicago line double-tracked before a sudden surge in container traffic in 2004 that overwhelmed UP’s systems and pushed traffic to BNSF.“We are behind the capacity curve,” admits Jim Young, UP’s chief executive, who blames the problem partly on the former Southern Pacific, which UP took over in 1996 during a consolidation wave that also saw the then Burlington Northern take over the better-maintained Santa Fe.UP is now rushing to double-track the Southern Pacific’s key Los Angeles to Texas Sunset Corridor, whose deficiencies lay behind many of its problems in 2004.Even the better-performing operators face a challenge raising the funds needed to invest for continued growth. UP plans to invest about $3.2bn this year, while BNSF plans to spend $2.75bn.Of the two, only BNSF consistently earns more than the roughly 10 per cent it and other railroads have to pay to raise capital.Even its position would look less healthy if its returns were calculated against the replacement cost of its assets, not the unrealistically low historic cost.Matthew Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, consequently concentrates investment on the core, strategic network, such as the Los Angeles-Chicago route, which is high-growth and low-risk for capital investment.This approach has required freight rate rises, which have angered customers of BNSF and other railroads. “Quite frankly, if you’re a shipper in the US, you’ve been used to lower costs every year since motor carrier, railroad and airline deregulation [in 1980],” Mr Rose says. “So customers are frustrated because for the first time they’re seeing rates go up.”The development is leading to “a lot of noise” from the marketplace saying the industry is making too much money, Mr Rose adds.“When you look at the basic returns and compare that to the S&P 500, we’re still below the majority of the S&P 500. It’s puzzling how anyone can look at the industry and say we’re making excessive profits.”As long as there is no serious re-regulation there is substantial evidence rates will keep increasing, helping to fund projects such as the UP’s double-tracking of the Sunset Corridor.That is the hope at UP, whose financial performance is poorer largely because 25 per cent of its business is still conducted under long-term contracts signed in the industry’s fallow days.The company, which earned 8.2 per cent on its invested capital last year, hopes to improve its performance as the contracts gradually come up for renewal.
88;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2007-05-16T21:34:20Z;Buffett spends $1.3bn on healthcare investments;;Warren Buffett has increased his bet on the pharmaceutical sector, spending some $1.3bn in three months to more than double its stake in healthcare group Johnson & Johnson and boost its holding in French drugmaker Sanofi Aventis.The move by the “Sage of Omaha”, who recently complained at the dearth of undervalued companies to invest in, suggests he is seeking to diversify his $58bn portfolio away from financial and consumer products companies.News of Mr Buffett’s increased interest – his stake in J&J is now about 1.6 per cent – sent shares in the healthcare group 2 per cent higher in afternoon trading to $63.02. The legendary investor also disclosed a smaller investment in Wellpoint, a US health insurer, and revealed further details of its exposure to the railway industry, identifying Virginia-based Norfolk Southern Corp as his mystery target in the sector.Berkshire Hathaway, Mr Buffett’s investment vehicle, had previously disclosed stakes in two railway operators, Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific but declined to name the identity of the third company in its portfolio.Mr Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway were unavailable for comment.In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway said its holdings in Johnson & Johnson had risen to 48.7m shares in the three months to March, more than double the 24m shares it had at year-end. The value of Mr Buffett’s stake in J&J is around $2.9bn, according to the document.Mr Buffett’s widely followed investment strategy is predicated on buying companies that are undervalued, easy to understand and have strong management teams.Shares in J&J have fallen more than 9 per cent in the three months to March amid regulatory problems for some of the company’s new drugs.Sanofi Aventis shares lost more than 6 per cent over the same period – a fall that may have prompted Mr Buffett to buy more of the company’s US-traded American Depositary Receipts. His stake in the French company is now worth over $36m.As expected, Mr Buffett rebuffed demands from human rights groups and kept his stake in the Chinese oil group Petrochina.
89;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2007-05-16T20:36:48Z;Wall St rallies on billionaires’ bets;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Wednesday with trading influenced by a number of well-known investors revealing their latest purchases in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Early on Wednesday, stocks traded in a choppy fashion as a better-than-expected rise for industrial production in April was offset by news that building permits last month fell at their fastest pace since 1990.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was boosted by the disclosure that its constituents, Citigroup, and Johnson & Johnson were in favour among leading investors.The Dow closed up 0.8 p+er cent at 13,487.53, and set its 23rd record close for the year. The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,514.14 and edged closer to its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research said good earnings and guidance for the coming quarter should support stocks and that the S&P was building up to moving higher towards its 2000 record peak.Within the S&P, telecom, and financial stocks led the major sectors higher, while materials lagged.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that while all 10 major S&P sectors were still trading near their recent highs, “many seem to be rolling over a bit.”They said: “Financials, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and health care have all had slight declines after hitting overbought levels, and it will be key to see how they react to resistance levels.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,547.42, and shrugged off weakness among semiconductors stocks. Earnings and lower guidance from Applied Materials did weigh upon technology for much of on Wednesday and the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.2 per cent, following a slide of 1.1 per cent on Tuesday.Applied Materials, a chipmaker, reported better-than-expected earnings, but its guidance for sales disappointed investors. Its shares were down 3.1 per cent at $19.17.Meanwhile the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 0.7 per cent at 820.29 and rebounded from its lowest closing level in more than a month on Tuesday.A number of stocks were in the spotlight on Wednesday when Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment company, said it had invested in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, two railroads, and also bought stock in Wellpoint and raised its holding in Johnson & Johnson, two healthcare companies.Norfolk Southern rose 1.65 per cent to $56.79, Union Pacific gained 0.9 per cent to $119.39 and the S&P railroad index rallied 1.3 per cent, taking its gain for the year to 25.1 per cent.Wellpoint gained 1.6 per cent at $84.86, while Johnson & Johnson rallied 2 per cent to $63.05.Edward Lampert, the hedge fund manager, said late on Tuesday that he had purchased 15m shares of Citigroup. This prompted the shares to jump 4 per cent to $54.91. Analysts believe that the banking conglomerate could now become the next high-profile target for activist investors, given its underperforming share price in recent years. Such a move would show that even the biggest companies were not immune to activist pressure.Meanwhile, George Soros, another of the most famous hedge fund managers, said his stake in Microsoft had doubled, and the stock rose 0.55 per cent to $31.07. Mr Soros had lowered his holdings in Oracle, and shares were up 0.8 per cent at $18.99, while he had sold shares in Ebay, down 0.75 per cent at $33.25, and Take-Two Interactive, and shares in the video game maker slid 0.2 per cent at $19.08.Another big investor, Carl Icahn, a well-known activist, said he had purchased a large slice of Anadarko Petroleum, boosting its shares by 1.6 per cent to $47.20, and also bought shares in CSX, the railroad finished up 1.4 per cent at $46.40. Mr Icahn also disclosed that his stake in Time Warner, had been cut by nearly half. Its shares in the media group rallied 1.55 per cent to $21.60.In takeover news, Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash. Shares in the the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.8 per cent to $67.50.“We believe pressure on operating cash flow, as the company struggles to recapture lost market share, creates significant risks in terms of return on capital for an acquiring firm and we do not expect any higher offers,” said Robert Gold, medical devices analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.After the closing bell, Hewlett-Packard said second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year- earlier period. In after-hours trade, shares in the computer maker were 0.7 per cent lower at $44.86, after a rise of 1 per cent in regular trade.Shares in Amazon closed 4.4 per cent higher at $63.22, after the online retailer said it plans to launch a digital music store later this year and sell songs without copy protection restrictions.In earnings news, Compuware reported a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings and its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $10.67.Shares in Federated Department stores rose 1.2 per cent to $62.69 after its first-quarter profit rose more than 5 per cent, but missed analysts’ estimates.
90;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2007-04-09T22:09:29Z;Buffet buys heavily into US railroad sector;;The value of the largest North American railroad companies was boosted on Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway emerged as a big investor in the sector.Over the weekend, Mr Buffett’s conglomerate disclosed that it had amassed a 10.9 per cent stake, worth more than $3bn, in Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the Texas-based freight company. The news sent Burlington shares soaring to close up 6.6 per cent at $88.17 on Monday.The effect of Mr Buffett’s investment in Burlington quickly spread to other big railroad companies, particularly after a Berkshire Hathaway spokeswoman confirmed to Reuters that the company was also investing nearly $1.4bn in two other railroad groups.The biggest gain came at Canadian National Railway, whose shares rose 5.3 per cent. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern rose 3.8 per cent, while Canadian Pacific gained 3.1 per cent and CSX was up 2.2 per cent. The companies being targeted by Berkshire have not been identified.The North American railroad industry has for several months been considered a prime candidate for investment by buy-out groups. This is because freight operators generally have little debt on their balance sheets given the steady cashflows they are generating. Moreover, railroad businesses have been performing relatively well amid tight supply in the trucking industry.However, the first quarter brought signs of a slowdown, as a series of winter storms and the slowdown in the housing market brought fears of lower volumes.CNBC first reported Berkshire’s plans to invest in the two railroad groups besides Burlington.Burlington generated $1.9bn in net income last year from about $15bn in revenues. One of the main business of the company, which has a market value of nearly $31bn, is to transport coal and other commodities.The disclosure of Mr Buffett’s interest in the railroad sector comes only three weeks ahead of Berkshire’s annual meeting with shareholders, a two-day pilgrimage by investors to the company’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska.Berkshire has made a number of large investments in recent years, including acquisitions of PacifiCorp, the electrical utility, Russell, the clothing manufacturer, and Iscar, the Israeli tool manufacturer. Because of Mr Buffett’s long and successful track record, the destination of Berkshire’s money is closely followed on Wall Street and around the world.A Berkshire spokeswoman declined any further comment on the company’s acquisition plans.
91;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2007-01-19T21:25:40Z;Intel and Apple set bearish tone for tech groups;;Wall Street endured a choppy week, as technology shares surrendered their impressive start to the year and the earnings season switched into a higher gear.Lower oil prices extended the recent pain for energy stocks. There were some bright spots as shares in the transport and retail areas benefited from expectations that consumers would raise their spending as the so-called oil tax of high prices was diluted.Overhanging the market were better than expected economic reports that lowered odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut this year. “The catalyst for a stronger stock market in 2007 was an easing and right now the Fed is not going to do anything,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.Technology shares dominated activity this week, and their new year surge was ended by earnings that failed to vindicate recent market gains as well as lower guidance on the outlook for the current quarter and broker downgrades.The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 5.3 per cent this week, wiping out its prior gain for the year.Late on Friday, stocks were rangebound, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the notable laggard for the week. Although it was up 0.3 per cent at 2,451.31 yesterday, it was 2.1 per cent down for the week.The S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent firmer at 1,430.50, and was unchanged since Monday. The information technology sector led losses in the index, with a decline of 3.4 per cent.Healthcare continued its good start to the year and the sector leads the S&P major groups this year with a gain of 3.5 per cent.Energy is 4 per cent lower for the year.Among semiconductor stocks, Intel set the bearish tone when it warned gross margins would narrow in 2007, following its fourth-quarter results. Intel slid 5.9 per cent to $20.82, cutting its gain for the year to 2.5 per cent. Other chipmakers down sharply this week included Lam Research, which plunged 13.3 per cent to $47.28 after the company said shipment delays would lower future earnings. KLA Tencor lost 8 per cent to $48.01 and Novellus fell 6.5 per cent to $30.61. Both suffered broker downgrades.Other high-profile technology companies also dragged the market lower. Apple slid 6.5 per cent to $88.50, as its strong fiscal first-quarter earnings were accompanied by lower guidance for the current quarter. JPMorgan cut its rating on the stock to “neutral”. Cisco lost 7.7 per cent to $26.70 this week amid a string of brokerage downgrades. Symantec plunged 14.4 per cent to $17.54 as the software maker said its 2007 profit would not meet analysts’ expectations.IBM’s fourth-quarter earnings beat estimates, but its shares slid 3.2 per cent to $96.17 as analysts expressed concern about growth in its hardware business. The stock rose above $100 a share for the first time since 2002 this week, part of a 30 per cent rally in the past six months.Citigroup reiterated its “buy” rating for IBM after its results and recommended investors buy Intel and Cisco “on recent weakness”. IBM dragged on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and late on Friday it was nearly unchanged at 12,565.53. The average was barely changed on the week, after hitting a record high on Wednesday of 12,614.Transport and retail shares were boosted by oil prices nudging down towards $50 a barrel. The Dow transportation average rose 2.1 per cent this week, and is up 6.6 per cent in 2007, outpacing the Dow’s gain of 0.8 per cent.A broker upgrade for FedEx sparked a 2 per cent rise to $110.98. Rail companies rose, led by a 5.3 per cent gain to $52.98 in Norfolk Southern.Among retailers, JC Penney rose 4.8 to $82.69, helped by a JPMorgan upgrade.Motorola jumped 7 per cent to $19.27. Its fourth-quarter earnings fell as expected, but the mobile phonemaker said it would cut 3,500 jobs to reduce costs. Better news on housing helped the S&P homebuilders index rise 4.5 per cent this week. Pulte Homes rose 5.9 per cent to $33.96.Mills surged 41.9 per cent to $21.58, after the real estate investment trust agreed to be acquired for $1.35bn.General Electric fell 2.5 per cent to $36.95 after its fourth-quarter earnings included a restatement. It also purchased diagnostics units from Abbott Labs for $8.1bn.
92;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2006-09-20T13:51:45Z;Wall Street dips on mix of negative news;;Wall Street finished lower on Tuesday as investor confidence was soured by data showing a precipitous drop in housing starts, a warning on profits from internet group Yahoo, and news of a possible coup in Thailand.Yahoo slumped 11.2 per cent to $25.75, erasing eight weeks of gains, after its chief financial officer said the company’s quarterly results would be at the bottom end of a previously forecast range, due to slowing advertising demand.The news also dragged down other internet stocks. Google shed 2.6 per cent to $403.81, and Ebay sank 3.3 per cent to $25.95.Crude oil prices tumbled, as high inventories helped ease supply worries. The front-month Nymex contract lost 3.2 per cent to $61.66 a barrel, its biggest single day decline since May. Valero slid 4.3 per cent to $50.10, and Devon Energy lost 3.8 per cent to $64.32.Mining stocks were also hurt by falls in copper and gold prices.

97;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2006-03-15T22:05:28Z;Wall Street powers ahead to 5-year highs;;The S&P 500 broke the 1,300 mark on Wednesday as fading concerns about US interest rates helped propel the index above the psychologically important resistance barrier. It prompted hopes that stocks have broken out of their recent trading range.The rally started in afternoon trade after the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report said the US economy was growing at a steady, moderate pace with inflationary pressures contained. The report was widely taken as evidence that the central bank would soon be done with its cycle of monetary tightening.The news triggered a rally among industrial blue chips. Caterpillar surged 3.3 per cent to $74.29, while Honeywell gained 1.2 per cent to $42.85. The blue chip index also found support in DuPont, which rose 2.7 per cent to $42.81 after the chemicals manufacturer increased its first-quarter profit forecast and announced a restructuring plan.This, along with a dip in crude prices, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.52 per cent higher to 11,209.77, while the S&P 500 gained 0.43 per cent to 1,303.02 – its highest close in almost five years – and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.69 per cent to 2,311.84.“This is the first time in recent memory we have had a two-day rally,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The follow-through is important because it gets a lot of people to wake to the fact that this market is getting some life.”The railways sector was in focus after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit estimates by 20 per cent.The revised guidance prompted Merrill Lynch to raise its price estimates for Union and four other rail companies. “We believe this is a clear signal that the rail industry continues to benefit from record pricing gains and subsequent earnings leverage,” Merrill said.The S&P transportation index jumped 1.8 per cent, boosted by shares of Union, up 5.9 per cent at $90.25, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, up 6.3 per cent at $81.30 and Norfolk Southern, up 4.7 per cent at $53.92.Investors also had their eyes on the banking sector after Lehman Brothers became the second major investment bank to report record quarterly profits and revenue. First-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent but Lehman shares fell 0.8 per cent to $144.15 as investors took profits after the previous session’s gains.Bear Stearns, due to report its results today, was down 0.2 per cent to $134.21 while Morgan Stanley, which will release its figures next week, fell 0.7 per cent to $59.64.Elsewhere, Sears Holdingssurged 12.8 per cent to $132.29 after it delivered first-quarter profits that beat market expectations.Shares in CVS fell 2.8 per cent to $29.71 after the pharmacy chain said the Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an informal investigation into its accounting practices.Shares in H&R Block dropped 6.2 per cent to $20.63 as the biggest tax preparer in the US became the latest company to draw the attention of the New York state attorney, Eliot Spitzer.

98;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2005-08-14T15:58:31Z;US grapples with rails' heavy load;;US railroad operators are increasing investment in infrastructure and labour as they seek to overcome chronic congestion across the system.CSX, one of the biggest US rail freight carriers, last week became the latest to lift capital expenditure, with some of the additional cash earmarked for urgently-needed capacity expansion.Congestion on the railroads is part of a broader capacity crisis gripping the country's freight transportation system, with ocean ports and truck operators also under strain.Railroad operators have sought to tackle the problem by hiring thousands of new workers, leasing more rolling stock and building new tracks and rail yards.CSX said annual capital expenditure over the next two years would be $1.3bn-$1.4bn, up from an average of $1bn over the past three years. The increase will fund large-scale infrastructure improvement projects on two of the company's busiest lines: those between Chicago and Florida and between Albany and New York City.“These investments will enable CSX to meet demand for freight service to the rapidly growing south-east while continuing to improve service in the populous north-east,” said Michael Ward, chief executive.However, with construction not scheduled to start until 2006, the investment will do nothing to ease congestion this year.Most operators, among them Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and BNSF, have improved service levels compared with last year.But delays continue to blight the rail network, especially around large ocean ports and coal mining regions. A combination of record demand for energy and rail bottlenecks have caused some power stations to run short of coal.Analysts blame the railroad capacity crunch on years of under-investment in infrastructure and reductions in workforce.Many critics believe this year's increases in spending fall far short of what is needed. Railroads, scarred by decades of boom-to-bust cycles, are reluctant to invest too much for fear of being left with surplus capacity should the economy falter.Soaring demand and capacity shortages helped railroad operators achieve record profits over recent quarters. Share prices in the sector have also risen.CSX's Mr Ward said a co-operative relationship was developing between road and rail services, with long distance freight shipments increasingly being made by rail while local deliveries were made by road.Mr Ward predicted that US freight hauling demand would increase by 40 per cent over the next 15 years, assuming average annual increases in industrial production and consumer spending of at least 3 per cent.
99;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2005-02-10T16:42:18Z;Market Insight: Clouded outlook overshadows equities;;The US stock market has remained mired in a rudderless pattern in spite of a flurry of good news this earnings season, frustrating bullish investors eager to extend the market's late-2004 winning streak into the new year.Burt seasoned investors say that to focus on companies' past peformance misses the point. It is the outlook for 2005, not the companies' fourth-quarter numbers, that has Wall Street worried.The vast majority of S&P 500 companies that have reported their fourth-quarter results so far have met or beaten expecations, some by a wide margin.With 79 per cent of companies reporting, 65 per cent have beaten expecations. Sixteen per cent have matched forecasts, and just 19 per cent have fallen short, according to Thomson Financial.Yet investors have remained fickle. Norfolk Southern, the fifth biggest US rail group, saw its shares tumble more than 3 per cent last week in spite of a five-fold increase in quarterly profit.Other big names that have lost out in spite of improved results include Starbucks, the coffee shop chain. Its shares fell 4.6 per cent the same day it topped expectations with profits up 31 per cent.Some analysts say the market is still suffering from a hangover after the rally in late October and early November last year, which left leading US indices hovering near 3½-year highs.Although profit-taking dragged shares lower in the first trading sessions of 2005, some valuations may still be a little on the plump side for some investors' tastes.Freight companies like Norfolk Southern saw their coffers swell last year, thanks to soaring demand for raw materials to feed the Chinese boom. Shares in the company climbed from a low of $20.54 in March 2004 to a high of $36.50 in December, a gain of more than 75 per cent.Others say this quarter's earnings are only half the picture. “Clearly the earnings season has been good,” says Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank. “But at the same time you report earnings you also issue expectations for the next year.”For the most part, he says, companies have been trimming their earnings outlook for the first quarter of 2005.Much of the pessimism stems from lingering uncertainty about the prospects for the US economy in today's climate of rising interest rates. Most market watchers expect higher rates to lead to a gradual slowdown in the US economy, which could translate into slower corporate earnings growth this year.Those expectations were reinforced by hawkish comments on inflation last month by the US Federal Reserve, which led some analysts to suggest the US central bank might consider raising rates at a faster pace.“The issue is not whether the Fed is going to raise rates by 50 basis points or 25 basis points” says Richard Bernstein, chief US quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch. “The key is that they are going to rise. As long as [the Fed] is in tightening mode, people should expect it to have an impact on the economy and the markets.”Some market-watchers hold out hope that, in spite of its lacklustre performance so far, the stock market will carve out healthy gains this year.“I think the decibel level on the earnings deceleration idea got [a little] loud. I think we're decelerating to a level that will be well above what most of the pessimists expect,” says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.Diane Swonk, managing director and chief economist at Mesirow Financial, says that easing uncertainty in the wake of the successful Iraqi elections late last month could bring back some upward momentum. “I'm not overwhelmingly excited but I think we have a window here,” she says. “We've been surprising on the upside for a while now. You've got to believe that some of [the recent] downward bias was tied to the Middle East.”
100;NSC;Norfolk Southern Corp;2005-01-28T22:25:42Z;Wall St notches first week of gains in 2005;;Wall Street succumbed to late losses on Friday, but momentum from a mid-week rally was enough to push stocks to their first week of gains in 2005.Procter&Gamble’s proposed $57bn takeover of Gillette, a rival consumer goods group, failed to breathe life into the broader market on Friday. But the leading US indices all closed higher for the week amid a raft of earnings reports and a flurry of merger and acquisition activity.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent on Friday to 10,427.20. The S&P500 slipped 0.3 per cent to 1,171.36, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.6 per cent to 2,035/83.For the week, the Dow closed 0.3 per cent higher. The S&P500 rose 0.3 per cent and the Nasdaq edged up 0.1 per cent. The stronger performance partly reflected anticipation of easing uncertainty after Iraqi elections on Sunday.The stock market rallied sharply in October and November following the US presidential elections. But market watchers yesterday offered differing opinions as to whether Wall Street can expect a similar outcome next week after the elections in Iraq.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said that sabotage or other attacks against oil assets could affect the markets in the short run. “There is an uncertainty that a big event could happen there, and that alone is probably worth $5 in crude prices,” he said. Stock market performance has been tied closely to the oil price in recent weeks.Richard Bernstein, chief US quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, said that although oil prices were likely to drive trading in the short term, the election’s outcome could also shed light on other long-term concerns. “There is an issue of oil, but there is also an issue of how long we are going to be in Iraq,” he said.P&G’s monster merger was the focus of attention yesterday after Thursday’s flat performance, which brought Wall Street’s brief two-day rally to a halt. News of the deal sent Gillette shares up nearly 13 per cent to $51.60 yesterday for a weekly gain of 17 per cent. P&G shares ended the week down 2.7 per cent at $54.15.Other deals this week included SBC Communicationss planned takeover of AT&T, the long-distance carrier. AT&T shares rose 9 per cent for the week after gaining more than 6 per cent after the deal was first reported on Thursday. Shares in SBC, the second-biggest US telecoms group, were down 7.7 per cent for the week at $23.62.Magnum Hunter Resources, the oil and gas group, was up more than 11.5 per cent for the week at $14.69 after rival Cimarex Energy revealed takeover plans. Cimarex fell more than 9 per cent.With earnings season in full swing, investors welcomed a series of upbeat reports from prominent companies. Most S&P500 companies that have reported so far have exceeded expectations.Sme analysts said that, after the market’s bull run to round out 2004, an expectation of outperformance had been priced in. But a rally on Tuesday and Wednesday indicated that investors were willing to reward companies for their fourth-quarter performance.Texas Instruments, the computer chip company, surged more than 7 per cent on Tuesday after its earnings brought upgrades from two prominent investment banks. Shares in the company rose nearly 10 per cent for the week to $23.11.Other stocks met with investor ire in spite of improved profits. Norfolk Southern, the biggest US railroad, was on track to end the week down 3.5 per cent after falling more than 5 per cent on Tuesday. The fall came in spite of a five-fold increase in quarterly profit.Starbucks, the coffee shop chain, fell 3.6 per cent this week to $53.70 in spite of higher quarterly earnings. Earnings disappointments stopped the rally in its tracks on Thursday. Caterpillar, the construction equipment group, led laggards on the Dow. Its shares fell 2 per cent on the week to $87.46.Merck, the drugs group, fell 10.1 per cent on Friday as US regulators stepped-up an investigation into the company’s handling of the Vioxx painkiller crisis and a court made an adverse ruling on a key patent. The shares fell 7.7 per cent for the week.

Cimarex shares fell 10.3 per cent to $36.06.Many investors view the oil and gas sector as ripe for further consolidation following a run-up in energy prices in 2004 that left many producers with healthy balance sheets and big cash piles.The S&P 500 energy index, which tracks 29 oil and gas stocks, has almost doubled in value since January 2002.An analyst at AG Edwards said: ""The majors got out of North America years ago, and now it's been the smaller companies that have begun developing resources that have once again become attractive.""Fast food companies brushed off a decision by a US appeals court to reinstate an obesity-related lawsuit against McDonald's.Shares in McDonald's, the world's biggest fast food chain, rose 0.2 per cent to $31.99. Yum! Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC chains, rose 0.3 per cent to $45.73.Shares in both groups have more than doubled since March 2003, in spite of mounting concerns about fast food's alleged contribution to America's growing obesity problem.Semiconductors led gainers on the S&P 500 for a second successive day after results at Texas Instruments earned upgrades from Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank.

Norfolk shares fell 1.8 per cent t o $34.08.The S&P 500 transportation index rose more than 30 per cent in 2004 but has dropped 10 per cent from its December peak.Genentech, the biotechnology company, rose 2.1 per cent to $48.45 after Merrill Lynch offered upbeat comments on the company's earnings potential."

Pharmaceuticals were also in the spotlight after a new study raised fresh questions about painkiller safety.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 10,759.43 - a 3½-year high - while the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent at 1,205.45. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,150.91.A strong rally in October and November has left shares in the leading US indices hovering near their highest levels since 2001, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touching 3½-year highs last week. The strong gains that came in the wake of the US presidential election have given way this month to slower progress on Wall Street, however, leaving stocks trading mostly flat in spite of a slew of year-end merger and acquisition activity.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co, said an expected slowdown in corporate earnings growth seemed to be the biggest factor keeping gains in check.Earnings among companies in the S&P 500 grew by 19 per cent this year, while forecasts for next year are 10 per cent.""I would argue that stock valuations still are relatively attractive, especially given the interest rate environment,"" said Mr Hogan.Most analysts predict that the stock market will continue to creep higher until the year's end, as bullish investors look to the first post-Christmas trading sessions for signs of sustained vigour. One analyst said he expected to increased volatility in share prices this week as Wall Street gradually empties ahead of the Christmas holiday.Transport stocks led gainers on what is traditionally the busiest shipping day of the year.
