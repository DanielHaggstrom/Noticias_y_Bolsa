0;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-03-30T21:19:16Z;Macy’s, Gap and Kohl’s put thousands on leave ;Retail chains employing 420,000 say store closures will last longer than expected;"The coronavirus employment crisis deepened on Monday when tens of thousands of US retail workers at companies including Macy’s, Gap and Kohl’s were told that they would be temporarily laid off.In a dark day for the US labour market, a series of the country’s largest chains that employ more than 420,000 people between them warned they had to put workers on a leave of absence without pay as extended restrictions to contain coronavirus would keep stores closed longer than previously thought.Clothing chain Gap, which has about 129,000 staff worldwide, said pay would be “paused” for most store workers in the US and Canada while its stores remained closed. The department store group Macy’s also said it was furloughing most of its 125,000-strong workforce.Kohl’s, too, said it would temporarily furlough most store and distribution centre workers, as well as some corporate office staff. About 85,000 of its 122,000 employees would be affected.Ann Taylor parent Ascena Retail, which as of last summer employed 53,000 people, said all store workers would be put on leave. Gary Muto, chief executive, said it was “one of the most difficult decisions we have ever had to make"".Casper, the mattress company that listed last year, said its retail employees would also be furloughed. The succession of announcements are the latest blow for American workers as stay-at-home rules to curb the spread of Covid-19 brings several sectors including hotels, restaurants and entertainment to a standstill. US jobless claims this month surged the most in a single week since records began in 1967, to 3.3m.While eligibility rules vary by state, furloughed workers can in most
circumstances claim unemployment benefits.In the immediate response to the coronavirus lockdowns, retailers including Macy’s, Gap and Kohl’s had said that despite temporary store closures they would keep paying workers for several days, at least.However, they warned on Monday that social distancing measures and movement curbs meant they would have to keep stores closed for longer than planned.The announcements underscored the mounting toll from the pandemic on the retail sector. Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands, which has about 94,000 employees, said on Friday that most of its store workers would be put on leave without pay.Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale's, said on Monday it would be “moving to the absolute minimum workforce needed to maintain basic operations”. The group, whose outlets have all been closed for 10 days, said it was unclear when it would be safe to reopen as it warned the outbreak was taking a “heavy toll” on the business.Unions were critical of the move. Macy’s “needs to do much more for its employees than what they have announced so far”, Stuart Appelbaum, president of the retail, wholesale and department store union, said. “They will be judged in the future by how they treat their employees now.” As of last year, only 7 per cent of the company’s workers were represented by a union.Macy’s has already suspended its dividend, drawn on a line of credit and stopped capital spending to shore up its finances, but it said that “while these actions have helped, it is not enough”. It said it was “evaluating all other financing options”.The company said there would be “fewer furloughs” in its ecommerce business, which remained open, as well as distribution hubs and call centres that support its online operation.Macy’s said it expected “to bring colleagues back on a staggered basis as business resumes”.Sonia Syngal, Gap’s chief executive, said: “We are intensely focused on welcoming back our store teams and customers as soon as we are able.”Kohl’s chief executive Michelle Gass said the decision to furlough staff was “incredibly difficult”, adding: “We look forward to the day that we can reopen our stores to welcome our associates back.”Workers at several of the companies affected by the changes would continue to receive healthcare coverage."

With the National Retail Federation calculating that $430bn in industry revenues could evaporate over the next three months, the question is how many of them will reopen.Tens of thousands of retail workers are already being furloughed without pay at Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands, while Macy’s warned its workforce of about 125,000 on Monday that it was unclear when stores could reopen and it would start to furlough most of the staff this week.As companies try to conserve cash, dividend payouts have been postponed at groups, including Nordstrom. At the same time, Best Buy, TJX and Kohl’s are among 126 discretionary consumer companies to draw a total $86bn from credit lines, according to Autonomous Research. Some, such as Mattress Firm, have told landlords that they will fail to make required rent payments for April.Another 30 nationally known US retail companies could file for bankruptcy protection this year, predicted industry consultant Jan Rogers Kniffen. Especially vulnerable are department stores and mall-based clothing chains that have long struggled to stay relevant in the age of Amazon.Retail executives and their advisers are pouring over the details of the congressional rescue bill, which includes $454bn in federal loans available to companies stricken by the crisis.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereBig questions remain about how and when businesses can access the funds and the conditions attached, although Matthew Shay, head of the NRF, said that taken as a whole the package promised a “crucial bridge” for the sector. Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at rating agency Moody’s, added the cash could help investment grade retailers “tide over any temporary liquidity issues”.Long before coronavirus, however, many retailers were battling to keep creditors at bay. Household names including Forever 21 and Pier 1 filed for bankruptcy in recent months and the sector accounted for almost a fifth of US corporate debt that defaulted in the fourth quarter.Junk-rated retailers with large debt burdens, cited by the rating agency Moody’s, include luxury chain Neiman Marcus, with outstanding debt of $6.1bn, mass market department store operator JCPenney ($4.2bn), womenswear company Ascena ($1.8bn) and clothing retailer J Crew ($1.4bn).Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia University and a former chief executive of Sears Canada, doubted federal loans could resuscitate heavily indebted companies. “A business that was struggling going into this crisis and is already leveraged up is unlikely to recover by taking on additional loans” even on favourable terms, he said.Corporate bond markets have become increasingly concerned about how discretionary retailers will cope. A Macy’s bond that matures in 2023, for instance, has tumbled from above $100 at the start of the month to $70, according to Finra data.Macy’s balance sheet has long been in better shape than more distressed rivals, although the department store chain lost its investment grade rating from S&P Global last month and was cut further into junk territory in a spate of sector downgrades last week.The company, which has already suspended its dividend, drawn on a line of credit and stopped capital spending to shore up its finances, said on Monday that “while these actions have helped, it is not enough”, as it drew up the furlough plans.Not everyone is sure coronavirus will lead directly to a wave of retail bankruptcies. “I expect to see an uptick, as companies that were on the edge have greater risk of falling off the edge quicker, but I don’t believe it will be the Armageddon that everyone thinks,” said Perry Mandarino, head of restructuring and co-head of investment banking at B Riley FBR.Such is the scale of the crisis that the bankruptcy process itself is not functioning properly. New York-based Modell’s Sporting Goods has put liquidation sales on hold as customers are unable to visit its stores, and a judge last week granted its request to suspend Chapter 11 proceedings.One leading restructuring banker argued lenders and landlords would do as much as they could to “hit the pause button” for the duration of the crisis. Prof Cohen added it may well be in creditors’ own interests to be more flexible than usual. “The assets that they would seize are currently worth a fraction of what they were before this erupted,” he said. “There will have to be widespread forbearance.”But creditors have bills of their own to pay — as mall owner Taubman pointed out in a memo to tenants, in which it told them it expected rent obligations to be met.Ultimately the longer business remains at a standstill, said Mr Kniffen, the more retailers will fold. “You can draw down on your revolver, you can furlough your employees, you can refuse to pay rent — but if this goes on for a while, you’re going to run out of levers to pull.”And those companies that come through the shutdown bruised, but intact, face the prospect that the impact will be felt long after the virus has been contained, putting them further behind more dominant rivals.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.Restrictions on movement threaten to convert even more consumers both to online shopping — benefiting retailers that have been investing in ecommerce — and to chains that remain open through the crisis such as Walmart, which is taking on 150,000 workers to cope with demand.Amazon — which last week snapped up two store leases from bankrupt New York supermarket Fairway as part of an expanding push into bricks and mortar — is hiring 100,000.John San Marco, research analyst at $356bn asset manager Neuberger Berman, said he was spending much of his time trying to assess how much of the coronavirus disruption would endure. But there was no doubt, he said, that the crisis will lead to “a meaningful acceleration of the retail shake-out”.
2;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-01-09T17:47:19Z;US mall retailers hit by declining holiday sales;JCPenney shares plunge after company delivers ‘more gloom than the grinch’;The persistent difficulties facing America’s mall-based retailers were demonstrated on Thursday when several of the biggest names in the sector reported falling sales over the crucial holiday trading period.Like-for-like sales at JCPenney, which operates 850 stores and is an anchor tenant at shopping malls across the country, dropped 7.5 per cent year-on-year over the nine-week period to the start of January.While JCPenney reaffirmed its guidance for the full year, including for a like-for-like sales drop between 7 and 8 per cent, it shares fell more than 11 per cent, bringing the decline for the past three years to 85 per cent.“JCPenney’s holiday numbers have more gloom than the grinch,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData’s retail division.Kohl’s, which analysts had hoped would manage to improve revenues during the festive season, reported a 0.2 per cent decline in like-for-like sales from a year ago, sending shares in the S&P 500 company down 9 per cent.The disappointing performance at Kohl’s prompted the company to say it now expected full-year diluted earnings to be “at the low end” of its previously announced guidance range, of between $4.75 and $4.95 per share.Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief executive, said momentum in some areas including beauty and the children’s department had been offset by “softness” in womenswear. The company was “working with speed” on a turnround, she said.At L Brands, which has struggled to adapt to shifting consumer attitudes to lingerie, like-for-like sales dipped 3 per cent in the nine weeks to the start of January.L Brands also reduced its outlook, saying it expected to produce fourth-quarter earnings of about $1.85 per share compared with previous guidance of about $2. Wall Street took the latest decline in its stride as shares in L Brands ticked up 2 per cent. They have lost 70 per cent over the past three years.The latest figures show how many mall-based clothing outlets and department stores are struggling even though overall consumer spending remains robust. Analysts were cautious about drawing conclusions about the wider sector based on them.Companies coping better with the retail upheaval, such as Target and Walmart, had yet to disclose how they had performed over the holiday season, noted Mr Saunders.“There’s a real weakness in some of the results coming out,” he said. “But what we haven’t seen is the pockets of retail that are naturally stronger.”The updates came a day after homeware retailer Bed Bath & Beyond scrapped its full-year financial guidance and warned it expected sales and profitability “to remain pressured”.Macy’s, meanwhile, set out plans to shut almost 30 stores and disclosed a sales decline, although it was less steep than analysts feared.
3;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2019-11-26T17:57:59Z;Department stores fight for relevance ahead of Black Friday;Calligraphy classes and in-store spas among experiments chains are running to counter Amazon;US department store Kohl’s has a plan to counter competition from Amazon, which has stolen a march on the retail chain and its rivals. It has set out to become a dumping ground for unwanted gifts bought from the online retailer.The Amazon return initiative topped chief executive Michelle Gass’s list of reasons to be cheerful as she sought to convince Wall Street that the chain would sparkle this holiday season, which begins this week with Black Friday.The tie-up, which Kohl’s has expanded nationally after a successful pilot, shows the lengths that mid-market department stores on both sides of the Atlantic are being forced to go to in an effort to convince consumers to set foot in their stores. Kohl’s now lets customers bring back items they buy from Amazon to any of its 1,100 outlets, and the store will pack and send them back to the internet retailer free of charge. Ms Gass said she expected the initiative to attract shoppers to Kohl’s and ultimately improve sales. While Ms Gass talked up Kohl’s move to cosy up to its biggest existential threat, the stock market did not appear to share her optimism. As she was detailing Kohl’s holiday plans to analysts last week, its shares fell about 18 per cent after its third-quarter sales targets fell short of analyst expectations and it warned it expected profits to drop at least 12 per cent this year. Kohl’s rival Macy’s followed up two days later with its third profit warning this year. As department stores head into the busiest shopping period of the year, the outlook for them is bleak. IHS Markit forecasts US department store sales will drop 6 per cent in November and December, worse than the 2.8 per cent decline in the 2018 season. This bucks the wider trend in US retail, where IHS expects sales to rise 4.6 per cent year-on-year during the two months, to reach more than $730bn.“In the old days [department stores] acted as a curator of other people’s products under one roof,” said Peter Williams, former chief executive of Selfridges in the UK and now chairman of Superdry. “The internet has blown a hole in that process.” He added: “All the products are available elsewhere and they don’t have a strong enough identity as destinations in themselves.”Stacey Widlitz, founder of SW Retail Advisors, said that product offerings were “a sea of sameness” that left department stores with only price as a distinguishing feature — “hitting the promotional panic button” to encourage footfall and ultimately eating into profit margins.Against this backdrop, department stores’ share of US retail spending has dropped from about a tenth in the 1980s to less than 1.5 per cent, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a consultancy. An index of large-cap US department stores has lost 35 per cent of its value this year, making it the worst-performing subsector in the S&P 500 index. Privately-held groups such as mass-market Sears and luxury chain Barneys New York have been through bankruptcy proceedings in the past year. This echoes the fortunes of their counterparts Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK, both of which have been through administration processes in the past 18 months. “The basic concept [of department stores] is simply not relevant to most shoppers today, particularly millennials,” said Mr Johnson.In the face of all of these pressures, department stores are having to stretch far beyond their roots to reinvent themselves as destinations that offer experiences that are unattainable on a laptop computer. Experiments being run from Dallas, Texas, to Southampton in England include in-store spas, bread-making classes and photography workshops.JCPenney this month opened a store with a “completely reimagined format” just outside Dallas. It features a spa, a barber and fitness classes — as well as in-store Sephora and Disney outlets, a nod to the pulling power of more popular brands.Similarly, the UK’s John Lewis has set up what it describes as “experience playgrounds” in Southampton, where customers can take part in workshops on pursuits from calligraphy to wreath-making. Interior designers, personal stylists and wine experts are among the specialists on site.There are some bright spots, notably in Paris, where the upmarket grands magasins Printemps, Galeries Lafayette, and LVMH-owned Le Bon Marché, have managed to appeal to consumers through a combination of exclusive collections, pop-ups and cultural collaborations — backed by substantial private investment. LVMH is reopening La Samaritaine department store in April following a €750m renovation.High-end UK operators such as Selfridges, Harrods and Harvey Nichols, which are exposed to the London tourist trade and prime sites in larger regional cities, have also fared better.Meanwhile, pressure is on mid-market operators to prove that they can differentiate themselves and turn round their fortunes. At Kohl’s, Ms Gass highlighted launches including a partnership with Elizabeth and James, a clothing brand from the twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Macy’s pointed to a womenswear collaboration with Becca Tilley, a dating show star turned social media influencer. Hal Lawton, Macy’s president, said the company had been “working on fashion and trends, and really rejuvenating our exclusive brands”.These strategies are yet to prove they can pay off. “They’ve been throwing a lot of stuff at the wall to see if it sticks,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a consultancy. “But it’s an uphill battle.”And more widely, the fact that the US department store sector is struggling, even as overall US consumer spending is relatively robust, raises the question of how they will cope in a recession. “It’s scary,” added Mr Perkins.Nordstrom Customers of Rent the Runway, a subscription service for designer clothes, can return items in drop-off boxesJohn Lewis “Experience playgrounds” feature workshops and talks about fashion, beauty and electricalsDebenhams Now offers fish and chips by Harry Ramsden’s at in-store restaurantsMacy’s Partnership with second-hand website ThredUp to sell used clothing in storesJCPenney A “selfie-studio” is among the initiatives at an experimental store in Texas
4;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2019-11-19T23:13:38Z;US retail stocks hit as Kohl’s, Home Depot and Urban Outfitters fall short;Concerns raised about consumer spending ahead of critical holiday shopping season;US retail stocks came under selling pressure after disappointing results from three of the sector’s best known names, Kohl’s, Home Depot and Urban Outfitters, raised concerns about how stores are faring as they head into the holiday shopping season.Both the department store chain Kohl’s and Home Depot, the nation’s largest DIY retailer, reduced financial forecasts for a second time this year. Urban Outfitters sent another negative signal about the sector after the market closed as the fashion clothing company missed quarterly sales forecasts.Executives identified a series of company-specific setbacks, from hitches in an IT rollout at Home Depot to weaker than expected sales of casual womenswear at Kohl’s.Yet the disappointing figures from such a diverse mix of retailers that serve a wide range of consumers added to worries about the health of the wider sector, ahead of the annual Black Friday shopping event.Shares in 13 listed US retailers lost at least 4 per cent in the ensuing sell-off, led by a 19 per cent drop in Kohl’s. Department store rivals Macy’s and Nordstrom saw their shares fall by 11 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief executive, cited an “increasingly competitive environment” and unseasonably warm weather in September, as well as “mixed results” from parts of its women’s clothing business.The company, which operates 1,100 stores, underlined the persistent difficulties in the department store sector with like-for-like sales in the most recent quarter that ticked up only 0.4 per cent from a year ago.While this marked an improvement from a 2.9 per cent decline in the previous three months, analysts had forecast a more robust recovery, pencilling in a near 1 per cent rise. The Wisconsin-based company’s net income declined 28 per cent from a year ago to $116m.However, Mrs Gass said that Kohl’s was “positioned for a strong holiday season”, pointing to new brand launches and a national rollout of a scheme under which Amazon customers can return items bought online in Kohl’s stores.Urban Outfitters increased sales 1.4 per cent in the quarter to $987m, shy of analyst forecasts of $1bn, according to Capital IQ. Net income fell from $77.5m a year ago to $55.7m. Its shares tumbled 15 per cent in after-hours trading. to $24.66.The sector-wide sell-off came even though results from TJX, also released on Tuesday, provided evidence that selected retailers were coping well with the competition from Amazon.The discount retail group, which operates TJ Maxx and Marshalls, reported a stronger-than-forecast 4 per cent rise in like-for-like sales and lifted its earnings guidance for the full year.Home Depot, whose shares have been trading near record highs, also performed far better than other retailers in the third quarter. The group generated sales of $27.2bn in the period, a rise of 3.6 per cent from a year ago on a like-for-like basis.However, those results also fell short of forecasts. Craig Menear, chief executive, said an $11bn investment plan designed to better integrate Home Depot’s online and physical presence had yet to generate the expected improvements.“We are seeing benefits from the initiatives — it’s just not at the rate of our original plan,” he told analysts.Mr Menear blamed technology setbacks in particular. IT projects including a new website for business contractors had “proven to be more complex than originally anticipated”.Home Depot said it now expected full-year like-for-like sales to rise 3.5 per cent from last year, weaker than the 4 per cent previously forecast. Although third-quarter net earnings dipped from $2.9bn in the same period a year ago to $2.8bn, the company still expected annual diluted earnings per share to be up 3.1 per cent.Kohl’s said it now expected diluted earnings per share, adjusted for exceptional items, to come in at between $4.75 and $4.95 — a year-on-year decline of between 12 and 15 and per cent. That compares with previous guidance of between $5.15 and $5.45.TJX forecast annual diluted earnings per share to rise between 7 and 8 per cent from a year ago, to range of $2.61 to $2.63. Its shares rose 1.8 per cent to close at $60.64.
5;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2019-11-19T18:02:23Z;Home Depot/Kohl’s: the sharper tool;Gap between retail winners and losers will widen as the holiday season begins;US retailers usually blame poor results on bad weather or the dollar. This quarter, they have an unconventional, new scapegoat: business investment.DIY retailer Home Depot cut full-year sales guidance for a second time this year on Tuesday. Department store operator Kohl’s issued a profits warning after reporting a 24 per cent slide in third-quarter earnings.Both companies said investments weighed on results. But what kind? There are smart bets and the kind where you just throw money down the drain. Investors showed what they thought. Kohl’s shares fell 18 per cent. Home Depot suffered a milder 5 per cent pullback a day after hitting fresh highs.Home Depot, which is worth $248bn, has been pouring money into its online business and revamping its supply chains to shorten delivery times. To keep customers away from rivals, it is making more items available for purchase online and offering free two-day delivery. It is installing automated lockers across its 2,290 stores so that shoppers can pick up orders quicker.The efforts have kept growth in transaction volume, average spend per visit and operating profit humming during the latest quarter. The weaker sales guidance is mainly down to the lower cost of timber as Lex previously explained. It is not, so far, a sign of a slowing economy.Kohl’s pushback strategy is more questionable. It has opened smaller shops. In a bid to drive foot traffic, its 1,100 stores double as Amazon return centres. Neither wheeze fixes the underlying problem for department stores: they mostly sell things available online more cheaply. The margin erosion and flat sales growth reported by Kohl’s reflect this.The divide between retail winners and losers will widen as the holiday shopping season begins. The future belongs to those that have hatched online strategies that fend off Amazon while finding the products and services to keep shoppers visiting physical shops. Department stores and apparel retailers that sell virtually the same products will continue to languish in the discount bins.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

6;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2019-08-01T21:41:30Z;US retail stocks slump as Trump widens tariff net;Consumer goods from clothing to electronics are among those facing 10% tariff;More than $20bn was knocked off the value of US retail stocks on Thursday as President Donald Trump’s plans to slap a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods sparked concerns on Wall Street over how the industry would cope.Shares in several of the sector’s biggest names, including electronics chain Best Buy, clothing retailer Gap and department store Kohl’s, closed down more than 7 per cent after the president tweeted that the US would place a 10 per cent levy on another $300bn worth of imports from next month.“This is a much bigger problem” than previous rounds, said Jan Rogers Kniffen, a retail consultant, because the new round would cover a wider range of consumer goods, from clothing to electronics.US retailers have been trying to contain the fallout from the existing tariffs by shifting sourcing and production away from China and pushing suppliers to absorb their share of the costs. However, analysts warned that the latest wave could force them either to raise prices or take a hit to profit margins.Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, said: “Things like sneakers that have avoided the earlier round of tariffs are vulnerable . . . A lot of the things on that list will hit the consumer.”Other stocks particularly hard hit in the market rout included Abercrombie & Fitch, down 11 per cent, American Eagle, down 8 per cent and Macy’s, down 7 per cent. Overall, the S&P 500 retail index was off 1.3 per cent.The new tariff threat comes despite an intense lobbying effort from corporate America to convince the White House to avoid escalating the trade war with Beijing. Retailers were among scores of companies who pleaded in testimony to the Office of the United States Trade Representative last month that their particular products should be excluded.Steve Pasierb, chief executive of The Toy Association, a trade body, had warned that the tariffs would “devastate” his industry. He argued it was unfeasible for members to shift much of their manufacturing outside China given limited facilities in other countries.On Thursday, he added: “Facts, logic, detailed financial explanations, testimony, and first-hand stories from toy company and retail employers here in the United States apparently still cannot prevail over the power of the tweet.”The industry immediately hit out at the announcement, made mid-afternoon in a series of presidential tweets. Matt Priest, head of the trade body Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said in a statement that he was “dismayed” that “political considerations are outweighing economic common sense”.Noting that 70 per cent of shoes sold in the US come from China, Mr Priest added: “This move will noticeably raise the cost of shoes at retail, and will have a chilling effect on hiring in the footwear industry.”Several retailers, including Macy’s, have already warned that annual profits would be put at risk if Mr Trump followed through on his threat to introduce additional tariffs, although the 10 per cent levy he announced on Thursday was smaller than the previously threatened 25 per cent and the president also delayed the start of the tariffs to September 1.Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research for Boston Partners, said the tariffs would further undermine investor confidence in a retail sector that is already under pressure from the relentless rise of Amazon.“This is not good — tariffs are taxes, and they cost,” he said. “There will be more uncertainty about the future and businesses will back off on spending because of trade and growth concerns.”The latest round of tariffs threatened to dent the strong role consumers have played in supporting the US economy, said Nela Richardson, investment strategist for Edward Jones. “The consumer is the pillar of strength. Business confidence is slipping but the consumer is propping up the US economy.”David French, senior vice-president of the National Retail Federation, said: “The administration is doubling-down on a flawed tariff strategy that is already slowing US economic growth, creating uncertainty and discouraging investment.”
7;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2019-05-21T23:18:55Z;Falling sales at big US department stores spark sell-off;Health of US consumer back in focus after Nordstrom, Kohl’s and JC Penney disappoint;New signs of trouble at three of the largest department store chains in the US unnerved investors on Tuesday, reigniting questions about the health of bricks-and-mortar retailers and sending share prices tumbling.Falling quarterly sales were reported by Nordstrom, Kohl’s and JC Penney, which between them operate more than 2,300 stores and employ almost 300,000 people. Kohl’s stock closed down 12 per cent and JC Penney 7 per cent. Nordstrom dropped 9 per cent in trading after the bell.The sector has been closely watched by Wall Street since retail sales fell sharply in December. The dramatic drop during such a critical month for consumer spending led some analysts to fret the US economy was beginning to sputter.Since then, data has swung wildly, rebounding with their biggest jump in 18 months in March only to fall sharply again in April. Economists are also concerned the sector could be hit by the White House’s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese goods.Managers at the affected chains insisted the disappointing figures were not due to a sector-wide decline, largely blaming company-specific mis-steps, from marketing problems to floundering loyalty scheme initiatives.After financial markets closed in New York, the upscale Nordstrom chain disclosed a 3.5 per cent decline in net sales from a year ago to $3.4bn. The Seattle-based group warned of a broad-based decline at both its full price and discount businesses, online as well as in stores.There were points in time during the quarter where we just weren’t as competitiveErik Nordstrom, co-president, cited “executional misses”, including a decision to make credits in its loyalty scheme digital-only.The company “later discovered that a segment of our customer base relies on receiving these [rewards] by mail”, he said, and “as a result, we saw a reduction in traffic”. Net earnings dropped from $87m a year ago to $37m.At mass-market retailer JC Penney, relative strength in fine jewellery and clothing failed to offset declines in women’s accessories and handbags, among other goods. Net losses in its fiscal first quarter widened from $78m last time to $154m, while net sales fell 5.6 per cent to $2.4bn.The latest earnings weakness adds to pressure on the Texas-based chain, which carries $3.8bn in long-term debt and whose market capitalisation has collapsed from highs in 2007 of $18.5bn to just $330m.“Re-establishing the fundamentals of our business operations will take time,” said Jill Soltau, chief executive.The department store results were the latest in a batch of mixed earnings reports from consumer-facing companies. US retailers are being squeezed by falling mall traffic, the rise of online shopping and a shift by consumers towards spending more on recreation and travel.Some chains are producing better results, however. Groceries helped Walmart last week report its strongest first-quarter sales in nine years. Macy’s also eked out a sales improvement, saying that recent bad weather had no impact on sales.TJX, which owns Marshalls and TJ Maxx, announced a 5 per cent rise in like-for-like sales on Tuesday. Results from other retailers, including Target and Best Buy, are scheduled for release in coming days.At Kohl’s, some of the chain’s difficulties appeared to be self-inflicted. Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief executive, said problems in marketing and homewares had contributed to the slower performance.“Some of our key promotional events weren’t as productive,” she acknowledged, while “there were points in time during the quarter where we just weren’t as competitive” in homewares.Kohl’s executives also said that bad weather, in particular unseasonal cold in the Wisconsin-based company’s Midwest and north-east heartlands, had exacerbated the same-store sales decline in its first quarter, down 3.4 per cent from a year ago.Kohl’s also issued a profit warning for the full year. Adjusted earnings were now expected to come in at between $5.15 and $5.45 a share, down from previous guidance of $5.80 to $6.15. Bruce Besanko, chief financial officer, said pressures included higher trade tariffs, which “we just didn’t have baked into our outlook”.Ms Gass added that Kohl’s, which has a partnership with Amazon to allow customers to return items purchased from the ecommerce giant at its stores, added that Kohl’s had “adjustments under way to get us back on track”.
8;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2019-03-05T15:13:06Z;Target boosted by best sales growth since 2005;Retail stocks lifted by strong final quarter performances;Target posted its biggest annual rise in like-for-like sales since 2005 while rival Kohl’s also posted stronger-than-forecast figures as the latest batch of retail sector results reassured Wall Street.Shares in big-box retailer Target opened 5 per cent higher while department store chain Kohl’s was up 2.2 per cent as investors cheered the fourth quarter figures and stronger than forecast outlooks for the year ahead.Same-store sales growth at Target accelerated to 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, rising 5 per cent in 2018 as a whole. Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive, said the big box retailer was reaping financial rewards from the investments it has made in revamping its stores and improving its online offering. Digital sales rose almost a third in the fourth quarter.The investments, together with rising logistics and wage costs, sent Target’s fourth quarter gross margin down from 26.1 per cent in 2017 to 25.7 per cent. Operating income for the year as a whole eased 2.7 per cent to $4.1bn.However, Target’s earnings per share outlook for 2019 of between $5.75 to $6.05 per share was higher than analysts had expected.Kohl’s target to deliver earnings between $5.80 and $6.15 per share for 2019 was also better than expected. The company, led by chief executive Michelle Gass, has struck a deal with Amazon to allow customers to return items purchased from the ecommerce giant at its stores.Annual like-for-like sales rose 1.7 per cent, although operating income dipped from $1.42bn in 2017 to $1.36bn.
9;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2019-01-10T13:22:40Z;Target bests rivals with upbeat holiday sales;;Target led the way among a series of retailer updates for the festive season as solid sales growth during the final two months of 2018 led it to recommit to its full-year sales and earnings guidance.The Minneapolis-based retailer’s numbers reinforce pre-Christmas predictions from top industry executives for a bumper shopping season supported by a robust economy — notwithstanding debate about the impact successive Federal Reserve interest rate rises might have on sentiment, and broader concerns over rent and footfall afflicting the sector.The big-box store said comparable sales, a closely watched industry metric, rose 5.7 per cent in the final months of 2018 from a year earlier, with growth in all five of its core merchandise categories.The increase was driven by more shoppers both in-store and online, as well as a “small increase” in average ticket prices, the company said. Seasonal gifts, along with toys and baby items, saw the strongest growth.The sales bump helped Target reaffirm guidance for its fourth quarter of 5 per cent year-on-year growth in comparable sales, and full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $5.30 to $5.50 a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters forecast full-year adjusted earnings of $5.39 a share.Target also announced a series of leadership changes alongside its financial figures, including news its chief financial officer Cathy Smith would be retiring.Brian Cornell, chief executive, said he was pleased with the holiday season performance. In 2019 “we expect to build on this momentum as we gain further scale in our fulfilment capabilities and deliver profitable growth throughout the year,” he said.Target said it had started an internal and external search for its next CFO. Ms Smith joined the company in 2015, having previously been CFO at pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts.Elsewhere among US retailers, L Brands, the parent company of troubled lingerie purveyor Victoria’s Secret, reported flat comparable sales growth in the five weeks ended January 5 compared to a year earlier, while net sales for the same period were down 1.6 per cent at $2.5bn. But the company added that it expects to report fourth-quarter adjusted earnings towards the higher end of recently upgraded previous guidance of $1.90 to $2.10.Kohl’s reported a 1.2 per cent increase in comparable sales for the final two months of the year. While sales improved slightly, the department store operator said it faced a tough comparison with strong numbers during the 2017 holiday season.Target shares were down 1.6 per cent in pre-market trade, faring better than L Brands and Kohl’s, which both shed 5.4 per cent.
11;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2018-11-20T14:04:29Z;Kohl’s upbeat quarter overshadowed by soft outlook;;Kohl’s on Tuesday posted another rise in a key sales metrics thanks to strength in its clothing business. However a softer full-year outlook weighed on the department store chain’s shares.The Wisconsin-based company said its same-store sales, a measure of sales in store open at least 12 months, rose 2.5 per cent climbing for the fifth consecutive quarter. That topped analysts' expectations for a 1.7 per cent increase, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.Net sales rose 1.3 per cent from a year ago to $4.37bn, just ahead of expectations. That pushed total revenue to $4.6bn.“We experienced strength across our entire apparel business, and our focus on speed to market and inventory management are driving relevancy with our customers, resulting in sales growth, margin expansion, and clean inventory levels,” said Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief executive.Net income rose to $161m or 98 cents a share, compared with $117m or 70 cents a share in the year ago quarter. That topped analysts’ expectations for 96 cents. Gross margin rose 25 basis points to 37 per cent.Traffic to Kohl’s stores have been aided by the company’s partnership with Amazon, including the ability of Amazon customers to return items purchased on the e-commerce site and certain Kohl’s locations.However, looking ahead, Kohl’s raised the lower end of its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $5.35 to $5.55 a share, up from its previous outlook of between $5.15 to $5.55. Analysts had forecast earnings of between $5.12 to $6 a share. The midpoint of Kohl’s estimate, $5.45, was also shy of the consensus of $5.51.The results follow a mixed season for department stores despite strong consumer spending and robust US economy.Target on Tuesday reported an unexpected drop in profit margins and a miss in headline sales. Earlier this month, Macy’s lifted its sales and profit outlook for the year, while Nordstrom said its gross margins fell as customers shopped at their discount aisle over full-price merchandise and said its profits fell after it took a $72m charge associated with a credit card error.Kohl’s shares, which are up more than 30 per cent year-to-date, fell 10 per cent in pre-market trade.
12;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2018-08-21T11:42:05Z;Kohl’s sales grow for fourth consecutive quarter;Shares slip despite upbeat results, rosier outlook;Kohl’s delivered upbeat quarterly results and boosted its full-year earnings outlook on Tuesday but its shares slipped in pre-market trade, reminiscent of a move by Macy’s last week.The Wisconsin-based company said same-store sales, a key metric that measures sales in stores open at least 12 months, grew 3.1 per cent in the three months ended in June — the fourth consecutive quarter of growth.That topped analyst expectations for a 2.7 per cent increase, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters, but was slower than the 3.6 per cent increase recorded in the first quarter.Total sales in Q2 climbed 4 per cent to $4.6bn, exceeding analyst estimates of $4.3bn according to a Thomson Reuters survey.“We saw strength across the business — both our store and digital channels, all regions of the country, and our proprietary and national brands,” said chief executive Michelle Gass, who took the top job in May. “Our men’s and women’s apparel businesses led the company, followed closely by footwear”.Analysts have argued that traffic to Kohl’s stores could be aided by its partnership with e-commerce retailer Amazon, which allows customers of the e-commerce giant to return items at certain Kohl’s locations.Net income rose to $292m or $1.76 a share, compared with $208m or $1.24 a share in the year ago period. That exceeded analyst expectations of $1.64 a share.Kohl’s also noted that its gross margin increased by 42 basis points to 39.1 per cent as it continued to focus on tightening up inventory.Looking ahead, the company raised its full-year adjusted earnings to between $5.15 to $5.55 a share, up from $5.05 to $5.50 previously. That compared with analyst forecasts of $5.36 a share.US department store shares have rallied for the past three trading days as some analysts have questioned whether fears of a retail apocalypse have been overblown following upbeat results and a rosy outlook for Nordstrom.Despite Kohl’s better than expected results and rosy outlook, it shares fell 4.2 per cent in pre-market trade, echoing a move seen in Macy’s shares last week. The department store behind Bloomingdale's, Macy’s was punished by investors when shares tumbled 15 per cent after it reported upbeat results.Both companies had seen their shares surge before the release of their results, with Kohl’s shares up more than 45 per cent year-to-date as of Monday’s close, while Macy’s shares had been up 66 per cent year-to-date before its results last Wednesday.
13;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2018-05-22T11:31:49Z;Kohl’s results top view, lifts outlook sending shares higher;;Kohl’s on Tuesday reported upbeat quarterly results and lifted its earnings outlook signalling that new chief executive Michelle Gass has taken the helm as the department store chain’s turnround continues.The Wisconsin-based company said same-store sales, a closely watched industry gauge of sales in stores open at least 12 months, rose 3.6 per cent in the first quarter, against expectations for an 2.7 per cent gain. The measure was up for a third consecutive quarter but reflected a slower pace of growth than the crucial holiday quarter.Total sales climbed 3.5 per cent from a year ago to $4.2bn, exceeding expectations for $3.95bn, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. The results helped send Kohl’s shares more than 5 per cent higher in pre-market trade.Net income rose to $75m or 45 cents a share, compared with $66m or 39 cents a share in the year ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 64 cents a share topped expectations for 50 cents. The company’s gross margin rate improved to 36.9 per cent, from 36.4 per cent in the prior year quarter.“We are very pleased with our strong start to fiscal 2018 as we continued to focus on our priorities of driving traffic and operational excellence,” said Ms Gass who took the helm earlier this month. “Further, we exceeded the high end of our margin expectations through continued focus on inventory management, while expenses were consistent with our expectations as we continue to make investments to ensure our long-term success.”Kohl’s has seen a boost in traffic in recent months following a partnership with Amazon, which allows customers of the e-commerce giant to return items at certain Kohl’s locations.The results come days after Macy’s said healthy consumer spending helped it post upbeat sales and lift its outlook. Markets are trying to determine whether retailers and department stores are overcoming a protracted slump or if they are just benefiting from easier comparisons after falling mall traffic and rising competition from online and off-price competitors knocked the sales of major US department stores last year.Following the upbeat quarter, Kohl’s boosted its full-year earnings outlook to between $5.05 to $5.50 a share, up from $4.95 to $5.45 a share previously.Kohl’s shares are up nearly 21 per cent year-to-date.
14;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2018-05-11T20:45:04Z;Kohl’s names Tailwind Capital partner as new chairman;;US department-store chain Kohl’s has tapped Frank Sica, a partner at private equity firm Tailwind Capital, as the new chairman of its board of directors.Kohl’s said that Mr Sica was selected on May 9 to replace Kevin Mansell, the company’s chief executive, president and chairman, who had previously announced his intended departure, according to a regulatory filing on Friday evening. Mr Sica will officially take over at the end of its annual shareholders meeting, which kicks off on May 16.Mr Sica has spent more than 30 years in private equity, and joined Tailwind in 2006, according to his corporate biography. Before that, Mr Sica held jobs at Soros Private Fund Management and Morgan Stanley, among others.Kohl’s shares, which have risen 11 per cent so far this year, were down 0.45 per cent in after-hours trading.
15;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2018-05-10T17:28:06Z;Macy’s leads decline on downgrade as department stores slip;;Department store shares were dropped in the sales basket on Thursday after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded Macy’s and said they are cautious on the department store sector, souring sentiment ahead of their results next week.Shares in Macy’s fell nearly 3 per cent to $29.29, while Nordstrom shares fell 1.7 per cent to $48.42. Kohl’s shares declined 1.6 per cent to $60.39, and JC Penney shares were off by about 1.9 per cent to $2.83.The bear camp on Macy’s swelled after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the stock to “underweight” from “equal weight” and lowered the price target to $25, from $27, citing the company’s “ongoing negative store comps and continued decline in return on invested capital (ROIC)”. That left Macy’s with 5 “buy” ratings, 11 “hold” ratings and 3 “sell” ratings on Wall Street.Kimberly Greenberger, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said Macy’s ROIC declined sharply from 2014 through the third quarter of last year. However, Macy’s shares have jumped 61 per cent since then, on the back of its real estate sales and the US tax reform.“However, we expect ROIC to deteriorate in 2018 after 1Q and thus expect the stock price to decline once again,” Ms Greenberger, said. “Furthermore, Macy’s increased reliance on private label credit card income and real estate gains masks the underlying deterioration in core retail EBIT.”More broadly, Ms Greenberger blamed “secular headwinds such as ecommerce disintermediation, market share loss, ecommerce EBIT margin pressure, and apparel price deflation” as reasons for remaining cautious on the broader department store sector.US department stores have struggled amid falling mall traffic and rising competition from e-commerce retailers. The companies that overbuilt during the boom times have been shuttering stores and investing in their online operations as they work to lure consumers back.Macy’s unofficially kicks off earnings season for department stores when it delivers its quarterly update on Wednesday.
16;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Kohl’s shares shine on improved sales, margins ;;US department store operator Kohl’s shares perked up after the company reported upbeat earnings noting a “sustained improvement in sales” over the year and added that it boosted margins by reducing discounting and trimming excess inventory.The Wisconsin-based company’s shares climbed 4.5 per cent in pre-market trade after it reported overall sales rose 9.2 per cent from a year ago to $6.8bn, a touch ahead of analysts’ estimates for $6.74bn. Sales benefited from an additional week during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a year ago — with sales of about $170m. Same-store sales, a key sales metric, rose 6.3 per cent in the holiday quarter and topped analysts expectations for a 6.1 per cent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data.“Over the course of the year, we saw consistent, sustained improvement in sales trends which culminated in a 6.3% increase in our fourth quarter comp sales,” outgoing chief executive Kevin Mansell said. “We improved our merchandise margins through strong inventory management and improved promotional and permanent markdowns.”That in turn helped boost profits to $468m or $2.81 a share, up from $252m or $1.44 a share in the year ago quarter. Earnings were boosted by the additional week that increased earnings by about 10 cents a share and the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December.Adjusting for those one-time items, Kohl’s reported earnings of $1.99 a share, ahead of the $1.77 a share analysts had been looking for. Gross margins improved to 33.8 per cent in the quarter, compared with 33.4 per cent in the year ago period. The results come as the company had previously noted that its online sales picked up over the holiday period and that traffic was stronger at its brick and mortar stores — partly boosted by the company’s proprietary bransd like Croft & Barrow and Jump Beans. US department stores have in recent years struggled in the face of falling mall traffic, competition from off-price retailers like TJX Cos and online competitors, like Amazon. However, Kohl’s has partnered with Amazon by stocking some department stores with certain Amazon items and accepting returns for Amazon products at those stores. Analysts have given the move a warm reception noting that it could provide Kohl’s stores with stronger traffic while also proving a convenience for Amazon shoppers.Moreover Kohl’s, like other retailers, has moved to reduce its store count and costs by subleasing to convenience and grocery stores and at the ended the year with 7 per cent less inventory. Looking ahead, Kohl’s expects comparable sales to remain flat or rise as much a 2 per cent in fiscal 2018. The company estimates that total sales could either fall as much as 1 per cent or climb as much as 1 per cent in its current fiscal year. Kohl’s shares are up 22 per cent year-to-date following a 19 per cent advance last year. 
17;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2018-01-19T16:00:49Z;Kohl’s awarded $100 price target;Highest price target on Wall Street;"Give joy, get joy indeed.

US department store operator Kohl’s, which reported strong sales over the holiday period, received a $100 price target on Friday by analysts at Jefferies, who called it a “top retail play in a digital world” and said the company’s shares could rise 50 per cent from current levels.The Wisconsin-based company had its price target boosted from $66 previously with analysts reiterating their “buy” rating on the stock, as they bumped up their earnings per share forecast for fiscal 2019 to $6.25 and 2020 to $7.50. That handily topped consensus estimates of $4.52 and $4.92 respectively, according to Thomson Reuters data.“We are buyers of Kohl’s given traction in proprietary brands, share gains from peer closings, thoughtful traffic-driving partnerships (eg, Amazon), omni-channel initiatives, and favourable off-mall real estate,” said Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies.Despite the rosy view, investors were less enthusiastic, sending shares up 1.6 per cent to $65.92Under Michelle Gass, who is set to succeed Kevin Mansell as chief executive in May, “the proprietary product story has returned to what made Kohl’s special in the early 2000s”, argues Mr Konik.The time it takes to bring proprietary brands to the shelf has been cut by nearly 30 per cent. Over the holiday period, it was these brands that helped Kohl’s achieve a 6.9 per cent increase in comparable sales. Mr Konik pointed out a pick-up in Google searches for its proprietary brands including Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Jump Beans and said he expected these in-house brands “present significant top-line opportunity” and “appealing margin potential”.Mr Konik also argues that the company’s partnership with Amazon — in which the department store sells certain Amazon items and accepts returns at those stores — is a win for both the department store and Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce juggernaut. “We anticipate the pilot to roll out nationally and provide Kohl’s stores with stronger traffic and is a nice added convenience for Amazon shoppers,” he said. Moreover, Kohl’s has executed on multi-platform retail, which helps it lower costs and meet customer demand for “speed and convenience”.Kohl’s also benefits from having exposure outside of malls, which have lower foot traffic. It is looking to reduce its store count by subleasing to convenience and grocery stores.The bullish view on Kohl’s comes at a time when department stores and clothing retailers have been bruised by a shift to e-commerce and falling mall traffic even as US consumer spending remains healthy.Kohl’s shares are up 22 per cent so far this year, following a near 10 per cent gain in 2017."
18;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2018-01-08T16:42:43Z;Kohl’s surges on holiday sales results;Glimmer of hope for embattled American retail industry;Kohl’s saw its share price surge on Monday after the department store said its sales climbed in the crucial holiday shopping period, providing the latest glimmer of hope for the embattled American retail industry.The announcement helped push Kohl’s shares up 3.2 per cent to $56.10 in morning trading in New York, outpacing the broader S&P 500 index, which moved 0.1 per cent lower to 2,741, putting it on course for its first daily decline of the new year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 25,247 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite edged 0.1 per cent higher to 7,143.Kohl’s said that its combined November and December revenues and comparable-store sales increased 6.9 per cent over the same period last year. Given the upbeat holiday performance, Kohl’s lifted its fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share forecast to $4.10-$4.20, from the previous range of $3.72-$3.92. Wall Street analysts had forecast EPS of $3.79, according to a survey by Reuters.The upbeat report from Kohl’s came alongside a similarly positive holiday sales report from Lululemon and followed a trading update last week from competitor JC Penney, which also experienced a rise in like-for-like sales during the festive period. Consumer spending in the US has been underpinned by high levels of consumer confidence, tight labour market and strong rises in asset markets.“We are very pleased with our holiday period sales, which were consistently strong through November and December,” said Kohl’s chief executive Kevin Mansell. “As expected, growth in digital demand accelerated significantly in the holiday period from the year-to-date trend. In addition, we experienced positive sales in our stores driven by stronger traffic.”But despite the strong holiday performance, US retail, and in particular big box department stores such as Kohl’s, remains in the grips of a big decline thanks to the relentless boom in online shopping and weakening interest in shopping malls that typically house department stores as “anchor” tenants.Last week Macy’s announced it would close seven more stores and lose 5,000 employees. Sears announced it would close 103 combined Sears and Kmart stores. Macy’s shares continued to slide on Monday, down 1.8 per cent to $24.03. Sears bounced 0.9 per cent higher to $3.51, having suffered consecutive declines of 4.8 per cent and 2.8 per cent on Thursday and Friday.The Sears store closures also hit bonds backed by commercial mortgages on the properties, but the effect on a widely tracked derivatives index tied to the securitised products dipped only slightly in reaction to the news.A report from data company Earnest Research showed that Amazon continued to take the vast majority of online holiday shopping sales, with an 89 per cent market share over Walmart, Best Buy and Target. However, the figures also showed the ecommerce group’s market share little changed from a year earlier in a sign that the traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers might be finding a way to hold on to some online traffic, according to Earnest Research president Andrew Robson.

20;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-11-19T16:27:44Z;Investors bet against happy holidays for retailers;Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s are among the most heavily shorted retail stocks in the US;Investors have sharply increased their bets against the US retail sector ahead of the holiday shopping season, anticipating that shoppers will continue their migration to the internet from the local mall.So-called short interest in US retail stocks — the proportion of a company’s shares on loan to short sellers who are betting they will fall in value — has reached the highest level in at least two years, after jumping 17 per cent in the past month, according to IHS Markit.The holiday shopping season kicks off in earnest in the US this week, with the traditional “Black Friday” sales that draw shoppers after the Thanksgiving Day holiday.Macy’s, the department store chain, is among the most shorted retailers with short interest topping 17 per cent of the underlying shares, an increase of more than 40 per cent over the past month. Short interest for rival Nordstrom was 12 per cent, Kohl’s 11 per cent while Target topped 6 per cent.Across all of the S&P 500’s retail constituents, 5.6 per cent of shares outstanding were on loan to short sellers at the end of last week. By contrast, short interest for the benchmark S&P 500 index was 2.7 per cent.“This is one of the easier trades you put on around the holidays,” says Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, an investment newsletter. “You short retail before the holidays because invariably the reality never lives up to the hype.”He added that this year “it does seem like investors and traders are shorting retail because they feel Amazon and other online retailers will have a great year and take more share away from brick and mortar retail”.Short interest in Amazon amounted to just 0.14 per cent of its float.While analysts are forecasting record Black Friday sales, the holiday season caps off a torrid year for retailers.Department stores, the anchors of American shopping malls, have been particularly brutalised by the shift towards ecommerce. Macy’s this month reported same-store sales shrunk for the 11th straight quarter. Nordstrom last month abandoned plans to go private after financing dried up. Kohl’s in the third quarter squeezed out its first sales rise in nearly two years: of 0.1 per cent.“No one has yet proven that they can withstand the Amazon onslaught, particularly over Black Friday,” says Joel Bines, director at AlixPartners, a consultancy. Some retailers are slashing prices to try to maintain market share as fewer people walk into malls to shop, but this strategy eats into margins.Still, short selling can be a risky strategy for investors, as even modestly positive surprises in performance can prompt a big share price jump. In a “short squeeze”, short sellers are forced to buy stock to cover their positions, accelerating the upward move and exacerbating their losses.Last Friday, for example, Abercrombie & Fitch and Foot Locker jumped more than 20 per cent in a matter of minutes.”Retailers have done a very good job of lowering expectations dramatically,” says Mr Bines. “Even the slightest beat can result in a giant increase in market value on a percentage basis.”
21;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-11-10T15:14:04Z;Winners and losers emerge in US department store war;Retailers reveal diverging fortunes as they clear inventory for holiday season;A flurry of earnings results revealed diverging fortunes of US department stores as they tried to clear inventory ahead of the critical holiday shopping season.In the three months to October, which includes the back-to-school season, Macy’s lost 4 per cent of comparable sales, marking nearly three years of quarterly declines, while Nordstrom reported comparable sales fell 0.9 per cent, a steeper drop than Wall Street had expected.But striking a brighter note was Kohl’s, which squeezed out its first sales rise in nearly two years, and JC Penney, which reported sales double that of consensus forecasts. It has been a punishing year for US department stores, with investors broadly selling the stocks of the stores that typically anchor malls, as more people shop online. The department store sub-index of the S&P 500 has fallen by nearly a third this year, while Credit Suisse estimates more than 140m sq ft of retail will be shut this year. The tough trading environment forced JC Penney to issue a surprise profit warning last month, while Nordstrom suspended its efforts to go private after financing dried up in the wake of Toys R Us’ unexpected bankruptcy.Investors appeared poised to pick winners from losers based on the latest income statements, however. Macy’s stock was up 2.9 per cent in afternoon trade on Friday, despite its sales loss, as the company also maintained its guidance for the year. JCPenney surged more than 14 per cent. Kohl’s stock was 3.7 per cent higher, while shares in Nordstrom slid 1.7 per cent.JC Penney chief Marvin Ellison said the better sales proved its aggressive discounting was “the right decision” even as it hit profits in the quarter. The company has been slashing prices to get rid of leftover clothes, particularly in its women’s section, “allowing for an improved apparel assortment heading into the holiday season”, he said. Moody’s commended Kohl’s and Macy’s for controlling inventory tightly, a strategy that comes “in stark contrast” to JC Penney’s liquidation sales. The idea is to restrict inventory to avoid resorting to steep discounts for unsold items left on the rack, to “adapt to the changing competitive environment”, said Christina Boni, Moody’s vice-president.JC Penney has endured the steepest losses of the group this year, losing two-thirds of its value as it shut stores and revised down guidance. However, big sales helped increase like-for-like sales by 1.7 per cent, lifting its stock even as it revealed a loss of 41 cents a share in the quarter. The results were muddied by the impact from the severe hurricanes that ravaged Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, with all four of the department store chains claiming the storms had hurt sales in the quarter. Nordstrom and Macy’s said the hurricanes wiped $20m from sales, while Kohl’s estimated a $15m hit. The chief executives of Macy’s and Kohl’s also blamed soft sales on unusually warm weather, curbing shoppers’ appetites for winter jackets and boots.
22;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-11-09T12:34:50Z;Kohl’s surprises with first same-store sales rise in 7 quarters;;A strong back-to-school showing helped Kohl’s eke out its first like-for-like sales rise in nearly two years, providing a faint glimmer of hope for the beleaguered US retail sector ahead of the all-important shopping season.The Wisconsin-based department store operator said comparable sales – a closely followed industry metric that measures demand at stores opened at least 12 months – rose 0.1 per cent during the third quarter.That is the first rise in seven quarters and confounded expectations for a 0.7 per cent decline. The gain came despite disruptions caused by a trio of devastating hurricanes which ravaged swathes of Texas and Florida during the quarter.“We are pleased to report an increase in comp sales for the quarter as the traffic momentum we saw in the first half of the year continued,” chief executive Kevin Mansell. “We saw strong results during the back-to-school season, achieving a low single-digit positive comp. The middle of the quarter was soft as we experienced disruptions from the hurricanes and other unseasonal weather. The quarter closed with strong sales in the second half of October.”Total sales came in at $4.33bn for the three months to end of October, largely unchanged from the level recorded in the prior year period and in line with expectations. Net income, at $117m, or 70 cents a share, was a hair below the $120m, or 72 cents a share, analysts had predicted as higher operating costs and lower margins from discounting eroded its bottom line.Kohl’s, which operates 1,156 stores across the US, lifted the lower end of its guidance for full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to $3.60 to $3.80, from its prior guidance of $3.50 to $3.80.This is in contrast to rival JC Penney, which last month issued a surprise profit warning after it had to sharply discount products in its women’s department in September and October in order to clear inventories.Still, investors – who have perhaps been looking for comments on the upcoming holiday shopping season, which is the sector’s busiest and most critical time of the year – were not impressed.Shares in Kohl’s, down 17.4 per cent so far this year, fell another 7 per cent in pre-market trading. At its peak in 2015, the stock exchanged hands for as much as $79.60. It closed on Tuesday at $40.79.(Photo: AP)
23;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-10-27T15:47:36Z;Department stores dragged lower by JCPenny’s bleak outlook;;Shares in department stores stumbled on Friday after JCPenney unveiled a surprise profit warning and cautioned about weakening sales.JCPenney shares fell more than 15 per cent to $3.11 and had declined as much as 25 per cent for its biggest intraday drop since 1980.The sell-off came after the company said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings to come in at 2-8 cents a share, compared to its previous forecast of 40-50 cents a share. It also expects to report a loss of between 40 to 45 cents a share in the third quarter, steeper than consensus estimates of 18 cents a share.The Plano, Texas-based chain also lowered the top end of its sales outlook for the year, expecting sales to remain flat or slide as much as 1 per cent from a year ago, compared with its previous outlook for sales to be up as much as 1 per cent.The news sent ripples through the department-store space which are slated to begin reporting results in 2 weeks.Sentiment on department stores has soured as ecommerce grows, eating into brick-and-mortar retailers and lowering mall traffic. They have also had to fend off growing competition from off-price names like TJX Cos, which offer designer items at a discount.The profit warning also comes ahead of the all-important holiday shopping period for retailers, when they look to clear out inventory and lure customers in with Black Friday deals and Christmas shopping.
24;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-09-26T14:34:24Z;Kohl’s longtime CEO to retire in May;;The curtain is coming down on the Kevin Mansell era at Kohl’s.The department-store operator said on Tuesday that Mr Mansell will be retiring from his positions as chief executive, chairman and president next May, bringing an end to a 35-year run at the company.Michelle Gass, head of Kohl’s merchandising and e-commerce business, will succeed Mr Mansell as chief executive. Sona Chawla, the company’s chief operating officer, will take over as president.Mr Mansell, who started his career at Wisconsin-based Kohl’s in 1982 as a merchandise manager, was promoted to the chief executive job in 2008 and became chairman a year later.Under his tenure, Kohl’s successfully weathered the financial recession, broadened its brand portfolio and grew its e-commerce business to $3bn. The stock more than tripled from a 2008 low of $24.28 to hit a record high of $79.60 in April 2015. Since then, however, the shares have shed 42 per cent of their value as the company, like many of its peers, struggled with declining mall traffic, rapidly changing consumer shopping habits and stiff competition from online retailers.“It has been a privilege to spend 35 years at Kohl’s, 19 years on the board and nearly 10 as CEO,” said Mr Mansell. “I look forward to this last year of my career, building on the positive momentum we have going into the holidays, furthering the development of our operational excellence and traffic-driving plans and ensuring a seamless transition for our associates, partners and shareholders.”Shares in Kohl’s, up 8 per cent over the past 12 months, fell 1.1 per cent on Tuesday.
25;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-08-10T17:14:53Z;US department store shares take another lurch down;Macy’s, Kohl’s and Dillard’s post a further quarter of declining sales;Sales declines reported by big US department store chains on Thursday were not as dire as had been forecast, but news of falling profit margins was enough to trigger another sharp sell-off in their shares.Macy’s shares fell 10.3 per cent on Thursday, marking their worst day since May, while Kohl’s shares fell 5.9 per cent and Dillard’s tumbled 15.9 per cent.Macy’s, the sector bellwether, said comparable sales slid 2.5 per cent in the second quarter. That was the 10th straight quarter of decline — although the fall was shallower than both the 3 per cent analysts had forecast and the 4.6 per cent fall in the first three months of the year.Total sales slid 5.4 per cent to $5.5bn, in line with Wall Street estimates, while earnings topped expectations.“Macy’s posted a bottom-line beat,” said Randal Konik, analyst at Jefferies. “But we walk away from the quarter with greater concern given comp deterioration and gross margin compression.”Faced with an onslaught from Amazon and the rise in online shopping, alongside falling shopping mall traffic, department stores have been struggling to lure customers and reignite growth.Macy’s chief executive Jeff Gennette, who took the helm in March, acknowledged he has a difficult task ahead. He noted on the call that the company is operating “in an environment of intense and disruptive competition”.The chain has been reducing costs and cutting the number of stores. It is also trying to win over bargain hunters through Backstage, its off-price offering, and targeting millennials through its luxury spa chain Blue Mercury, which it bought in 2015. The company is launching a new loyalty programme and partnering with designers on capsule collections made exclusively for Macy’s.The benefits of those projects, though, were “totally offset” by weakness elsewhere, Mr Konik said. Gross margins may have been better than Wall Street’s expectations but were down about 60 basis points from a year ago to 40.3 per cent. Gross margins also declined at Kohl’s and Dillard’s.Comparable sales, involving stores that have been open 12 months, declined at all three department store groups reporting on Thursday, although less sharply than in the first quarter.Kohl’s said same-store sales slid 0.4 per cent, down for the sixth consecutive quarter, though better than Wall Street estimates for a 1.5 per cent drop and an improvement on the 2.7 per cent registered three months ago.The company noted that transactions improved in July, “which was the toughest monthly comparison of the quarter, likely a sign that the back-to-school season started off well”, according to Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Citi.Little Rock, Arkansas-based Dillard’s said like-for-like sales fell 1 per cent, down for eight quarters in a row, but slower than the 4 per cent decline at the start of the year. The company swung to a loss of $17.1m in the quarter, following “significant markdowns”.Macy’s and Kohl’s were the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 for the day and the results weighed on the broader S&P 500 retailing industry group, sending it 2.4 per cent lower.
26;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-08-10T11:58:00Z;Kohl’s shares pop higher as sales fall less than feared, earnings beat expectations;;Kohl’s said a key sales metric fell less than feared in the second quarter, as it posted upbeat earnings and said that transactions improved in July, sending shares in the discount based department store higher in early trade.Shares in Wisconsin-based Kohl’s rose 3 per cent in pre-market trading after the company said comparable sales, sales at stores that have been open for 12 full months, including online sales, slid 0.4 per cent per cent, against analysts’ outlook for a 1.5 per cent decline. While that marked its sixth consecutive quarterly drop, it showed the pace of declines is slowing.Total sales dropped 0.9 per cent to $4.14bn, broadly in line with analysts’ expectations of $4.13bn.Net incomes rose to $208m or $1.24 a share, compared with $140m or 77 cents a share in the year ago period and topping expectations for $1.19 a share. Meanwhile, gross margin slipped modestly to 39.4 per cent, against Wall Street estimates of 39.5 per cent.Department stores have struggled as consumers have become more comfortable shopping online and as mall traffic has declined. But on Thursday, chief executive Kevin Mansell noted that “the traffic momentum that we saw in the combined March/April period accelerated in the second quarter”. He added that while transaction were lower for the quarter than the previous year, “July transactions increased”.Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Citi noted that the increase in July, “which was the toughest monthly comparison of the quarter [is] likely a sign that the back-to-school season has started off well”.In looking to reignite sales growth, the company, like its rivals has sought to differentiate itself through more exclusive offerings, part of its so-called Greatness Agenda, and relocate its stores in off-mall locations.The company has even sought to jump on the athleisure wagon — which has seen athletic gear makers benefit as consumers increasingly wear workout gear outside of the gym — through a partnership with Under Armour. It is also focused on tightening inventory and driving loyalty as it seeks to improve sales.Kohl’s shares are down 15 per cent so far this year.
27;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-08-06T16:09:46Z;Macy’s and Kohl’s bonds gain ahead of US retail earnings;Debt of venerable stores climbs in price despite migration of shoppers online;Bonds from some of the US’s venerable department stores have advanced ahead of earnings from the retail industry, despite a migration of shoppers online.The shifts, with the bonds of both Macy’s and Kohl’s outperforming their stock counterparts this year, show that investors have faith that the companies will still be able to repay their debts as earnings slide.Both stores will report results for the second quarter this week as the earnings season for the sector gets under way. Nordstrom’s results are also expected, while Target, Walmart and Home Depot are among those scheduled for the following week. The reports will give investors an indication of the extent of the damage from online rivals and if sales are improving at the start of the critical back-to-school shopping season.“Even though earnings are deteriorating, as long as these companies have the ability to ultimately pay their debt . . . and survive through the maturity of the bonds, the bonds should be recovering,” said Steven Oh, the head of global credit at PineBridge Investments. He added that some of the bonds had been oversold.Macy’s bonds maturing in 2024 have climbed in price almost 4 per cent since the end of June and are down less than 3 per cent for the year. By contrast, Macy’s stock has fallen by more than a third so far in 2017, even as shares are up 10 per cent from a near seven-year low in July.At Kohl’s, debt maturing in 2025 has fallen less than 0.5 per cent while the retailer’s stock has dropped 15 per cent this year.US department stores are expected to report shrinking revenues and profits for the second quarter. A blended rate of reported and estimated earnings forecasts from FactSet shows earnings for Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom, the three retailers in that sub-index of the S&P 500, down 11.8 per cent per share year over year on a revenue decrease of 2.3 per cent.With Amazon’s earnings miss last quarter on investment spending, internet retailers in the benchmark index were also expected to report a quarterly decline in earnings, but revenues in the FactSet forecasts are seen as rising by 24 per cent.The results will also be scrutinised for clues as to how Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Companies are performing. Investors are less sanguine about the debt issued by Neiman, which last week traded at roughly 55 cents on the dollar, down from roughly 75 cents at the end of last year.Some investors said the shares of traditional retailers could draw buyers if earnings beat expectations.“It could be a situation where less bad news is good news and could be a catalyst for a move higher,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“We could see some bargain hunters come in, but it doesn’t change the overall dynamic [in the industry].”
28;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-05-13T12:05:29Z;US retail sector’s misery — in charts;Unexpectedly sharp decline in department store sales felt across the markets;"Investors wiped $4.6bn from the market value of the US department store sector in the space of two days last week, as concern mounted about sliding sales and the effects of online competition.The consequences are spilling into the real estate and derivatives markets, and the latest bad news has intensified the focus on the sector ahead of more earnings reports from retail heavyweights next week.A quintet of big US department stores this week disclosed declines in like-for-like sales for the first three months of the year. The figures that were revealed by Macy’s, Kohl’s, Dillard’s, Nordstrom and JC Penney were below most analysts’ forecasts, suggesting Wall Street has still not got a handle on how fast things are deteriorating in the sector.The disappointment ignited a sell-off that sent the market value of the S&P department stores index sliding from $27.8bn on Wednesday to $23.2bn on Friday, marking the biggest two-day wipeout in dollar terms since the 2008 financial crisis. This despite some commentary from executives that they had seen an improvement since the start of spring.Here is how the individual stocks fared:● Macy’s and Dillard’s each ended down 18.5 per cent● JC Penney fell 17.1 per cent● Nordstrom was down 15.9 per cent● Kohl’s fell 9.1 per centThe anxiety was not limited to the equities market.Investors marked up the cost of insuring against defaults on department stores’ debt, and on the debt of other groups that are vulnerable to consumers’ shift away from bricks-and-mortar shopping.Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s were three of the worst four performers in Markit’s index of credit-default swaps of investment-grade companies this week. Spreads also widened for the CDS tracking the debt of electronics retailer Best Buy, Simon Properties, the biggest US mall operator, and discount chain Target.Real estate investment trusts that own and operate retail properties, like shopping malls, were among the worst-performing industry groups on the S&P 500 index this week. The broad benchmark ended the week down 0.35 per cent, while the retail Reit group was off 4.1 per cent.The fall this week deepens the year-to-date decline for retail Reits to 12.3 per cent, versus 1.5 per cent for the whole Reits sector.Here is a round-up of how individual retail Reits performed this week:● Macerich, which operates malls in the western US, fell 5.6 per cent● Kimco Realty, which focuses on open-air shopping centres, was down 5.1 per cent● Simon Properties, the largest player in the group, slipped 4.3 per cent● GGP, the second-biggest group by market value, slipped 1.9 per centMarvin Ellison, chief executive at JCPenney: “While February was a very challenging month for JCPenney and broader retail, we are pleased with our comp-store sales for the combined March and April period, which improved significantly versus February.”James Nordstrom, Nordstrom president: “While there may be opportunities to close underperforming stores, that’s not really part of our strategy. We don’t have a closure strategy. We have a market share strategy.”Jeff Gennette, Macy’s chief executive: “These are unusual and challenging times for retail, especially for mall-based department stores. We know that these changes we’re seeing are secular and not cyclical.”The weakness in sales is affecting the bottom line.According to FactSet, department stores and apparel retailers are expected to average declines of 6 per cent or more in net income for the first quarter. Profits at general merchandise stores are faring even worse, whereas internet retailers are on a tear. Their net income is expected to be up more than a quarter, on average.If department stores are uniformly losing out in the changing retail landscape, the companies that are reporting next week may be more of a mixed bag.So far off-price retailers, which offer rapidly changing selections of designer names at a sharp discount to retail prices, have bucked the gloom. Investors will tune in next week to see if TJX Cos, behind chains such as TJ Maxx and Marshalls; and Ross Stores, had a better start to the year than their traditional rivals, even though those traditional rivals have recently started to push their own lower-price offerings.Meanwhile, Target had a difficult holiday season as customers turned to Amazon and Walmart. But next week investors get to hear if chief executive Brian Cornell’s efforts to lure customers back by lowering prices, sprucing up stores, and introducing new brands is paying off."
29;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-05-11T21:11:29Z;Woes deepen at US department stores;Macy’s and Kohl’s shares tumble as comparable sales contract more sharply than expected;Investors who have been hoping that American department stores will have a better start to the year following the annus horribilis of 2016 were left sorely disappointed on Thursday.Three chains — Macy’s, Kohl’s and Dillard’s — reported another quarter of steep declines in comparable sales, missing expectations and sending their shares sliding.Macy’s shares tumbled 17 per cent to its lowest level since August 2011 after it said its sales decline had entered a third year.Retailers are facing unprecedented upheaval amid falling mall traffic, shifting consumer shopping patterns that prioritise spending on recreation, and fierce competition from online stores and off-price retailers that offer branded goods at steep discounts.In response, companies are shuttering shops and shedding jobs at a pace not seen since the Great Recession.Macy’s has already said this year that it could cut up to 10,000 jobs and shutter 100 stores, and Jeff Gennette, its chief executive, told analysts on a conference call that the US remains “over-retailed compared to other markets”.“These are unusual and challenging times for retail, especially for mall-based department stores. We know that these changes we’re seeing are secular and not cyclical,” Mr Gennette said. “But we don’t have our head in the sand as to the significant challenges that we face to get the business growing again.”Despite efforts by Macy’s to lure bargain hunters and younger shoppers with its own off-price product, Backstage, and a successful partnership with skin and spa chain Blue Mercury, its comparable sales fell 5.2 per cent in the first quarter. That was steeper than analysts’ estimates of a 3 per cent drop and came on top of the 6.1 per cent fall the company reported for the same quarter a year ago.Kohl’s, which has been trying to lure shoppers by selling Under Armour athletic wear, also saw little improvement in sales. Although the company said the tie-up with Under Armour “exceeded a very aggressive launch sales plan”, that was not enough to fully offset the industry’s wider structural challenges.Kohl’s like-for-like sales for the three months to the end of April fell for a fifth straight quarter, dropping 2.7 per cent, a much steeper fall than the 0.6 per cent dip the market was expecting. Its shares slid 7.8 per cent on Thursday.Arkansas-based Dillard’s said same-store sales fell 4 per cent, the seventh consecutive quarter of decline, sending its shares down 17.5 per cent.Few analysts are expecting the road ahead to get easier soon. S&P is forecasting double-digit declines in first-quarter earnings for department store operators and big box retailers. And retail bankruptcy filings so far this year have already outpaced those recorded for the whole of 2016.Dana Telsey, analyst at Telsey Group, said: “The first quarter was tough for everyone and we will see more differentiation as the year proceeds depending on the new elements they add to their offerings on product and service. The department store space is going through a reinvention.”
30;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-05-11T11:56:10Z;Kohl’s sales woes continue despite Under Armour tie-up;;A bet on athleisure did little to reverse the ongoing sales decline at Kohl’s during the first quarter.The discount department store on Thursday reported its fifth straight quarter of like-for-like sales drop despite a much lauded tie-up with Under Armour to sell the athletic apparel’s products in its 1,160 stores.For the three months to end of April, comparable sales growth – a key industry metric that compares year-on-year sales at stores open at least 12 months – fell 2.7 per cent, a much steeper fall than the 0.6 per cent dip that the market was expecting.Revenue, which fell 3.2 per cent to $3.84bn, also fell short of analyst estimate of $3.9bn.Like its peers, Wisconsin-based Kohl’s has struggled with a confluence of headwinds that have hit the US retail sector in recent years. Department stores in particular have been hard hit by declining mall traffic, the quickening rise of online shopping and changing consumer shopping habits that value experience — such as dining and travelling — over buying “stuff”.In response, Kohl’s has sought to reposition its stores in smaller, off-mall locations. It also launched a turnaround plan in 2014, called the Greatness Agenda, to focus on more exclusive offerings that would set itself apart from department store rivals.As part of this plan, the company struck a deal with Under Armour and started selling the group’s apparel, accessories and footwear at its stores and online in March. Company representatives have called it the biggest brand launch — in terms of product — in Kohl’s history and the campaign is aimed at attracting younger shoppers who tend to shun department stores.Kohl’s did not provide an update on how sales of Under Armour products have fared since the launch. In a statement chief executive Kevin Mansell said: “We are encouraged by the significant improvement in sales and traffic for the March and April period, after a weak February start to the first quarter.”Net income for the period surged to $66m, from the $17m reported last year. The gains were largely due to results last year being held back by a series of impairments and one off costs.Excluding these, adjusted net earnings rose 14 per cent to 39 cents per diluted share, ahead of expectations for 29 cents a share.Shares in Kohl’s, down more than 18 per cent so far this year, fell another 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading.
31;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2017-01-05T18:32:20Z;Big US retailers hit by tough holiday shopping season;Sears, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Barnes & Noble report weak Christmas sales;The holiday season was anything but merry for America’s bricks-and-mortar retailers.Some of the biggest names in the business, including Sears, Macy’s, Kohl’s and Barnes & Noble, all reported weak sales during the important Christmas shopping period, dealing a blow to the nascent recovery in investor sentiment towards the sector.Shares in Macy’s fell 14.3 per cent and Kohl’s were knocked back 18 per cent after the companies’ sales dropped more than expected in November and December. Both cut full-year earnings forecasts.In a sign that Macy’s is bracing for another tough year, the company warned that it could lay off as many as 10,100 workers.US department store operators are being squeezed by falling mall traffic, the rise of online shopping and a shift by consumers towards spending more on recreation and travel.While there are few signs suggesting that these trends could reverse in the near future, the sector rallied after Donald Trump’s election in November on hopes that his proposed stimulus spending plans would boost consumer spending.“Macy’s and Kohl’s disappointing holiday results serve as a reminder that underlying fundamentals trump the post-election rally we observed for many structurally challenged bricks-and-mortar retailers,” said Laurent Vasilescu, an analyst at Macquarie.Kimberly Greenberger, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said that the disappointing performance at Macy’s and Kohl’s came despite “the easiest compares since the recession, lean inventory, favourable weather and two extra shopping days before Christmas”.The malaise was underscored by Sears, which announced plans on Thursday to shut another 150 stores.The closures represent a 10 per cent cut to Sears’ store count and come as the group warned on the tough trading conditions for the current quarter. It said that same-store sales at its Sears and Kmart outlets for the first two months of its fiscal fourth quarter had declined in the range of 12-13 per cent.In a bid to shore up its balance sheet, Sears also said that it had reached a deal to sell its Craftsman tools business to Stanley Black & Decker for about $900m in cash.The sale, which came a day after Sears said it had obtained a $500m loan from affiliates of ESL Investments, the hedge fund run by Sears chief executive Edward Lampert, should help bolster the group’s cash balance, which stood at $258m at the end of October.However, Sears’ net debt stood at $3.7bn at the end of October, compared with its $1.24bn market value.The downbeat trading is not limited to department store operators. Book chain Barnes & Noble said on Thursday that comparable-store sales had fallen 9.1 per cent during the holiday shopping season, prompting its shares to drop 6.8 per cent.
32;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2016-11-10T12:59:41Z;Kohl’s climbs as business shows more signs of stablising;;Investors on Thursday cheered further signs that business is stablising at Kohl’s.Although a number of key metrics at the US department store operator – namely same-store sales and gross margins – came in slightly worse than expected, shares in the company jumped 8 per cent in pre-market trading on relief that the company did not cut guidance.Investors also took heart from Kohl’s comments that sales trends are improving ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season.For the September quarter, like for like sales fell 1.7 per cent, compared to an increase of 1 per cent in prior year period, and a shade steeper than the 1.4 per cent decline the market had forecast.Gross margin, at 37.1 per cent, also undershot expectations for a rise to 37.4 per cent.Nonetheless, revenue for the quarter managed to come in at $4.32bn, a 2.3 per cent decline from last year but in line with analysts estimates. Net income also rose more than expected to $146m, or 83 cents per diluted share, on the back of lower debt costs and administrative expenses.“We are pleased to see continued improvement in our sales trends. Our back-to-school season was strong, followed by a soft September, and progressive improvement throughout October,” said Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chairman, chief executive officer and president.“We are encouraged by these trends as we enter the Holiday season. Our teams did an excellent job managing inventory. Expenses were also well-controlled as substantially all teams outperformed their plans.”
33;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive, said he was “planning for a challenging environment” in the crucial second half, which includes the holiday shopping season and back-to-school sales. He said Target had “the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time”.Target expects full-year earnings — adjusted for early retirement of debt — of between $4.80 and $5.20 a share. That compared with earlier guidance of between $5.20 and $5.40. In the second quarter, comparable sales dropped 1.1 per cent and the number of transactions dropped 2.2 per cent.Target’s first quarterly decline since 2014 will sharpen investor focus on Walmart’s earnings on Thursday, where US comparable sales are expected to rise 1 per cent.Shares in Sears fell 6.4 per cent to $16.65, Kohl’s was down 2.2 per cent to $45.07 and Lowe’s, the home improvement store, which also produced weaker earnings on Wednesday, fell 6.7 per cent to $76.03. Walmart was down 0.4 per cent to $72.57.Retailers in the US have had a bumpy ride over the past year or so with many struggling to meet the needs of an increasingly fragmented consumer market. Shoppers are prepared to spend, but they are demanding value for money and are spreading across different platforms from mobile to physical stores.This has led to competitive promotions at a time when Amazon’s sales have soared. Target said it has increased its promotions, but analysts said that some of its offerings may have looked comparably more expensive. It has also been hurt by the sale of its pharmacy arm to CVS, which has disrupted consumer visits.“The company continues to be impacted by challenged consumers across multiple income demographics, as well as a food business that still needs to gain traction to drive additional traffic,” said Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea.“The downward revision to its second-half expectations recognises that the back-to-school/college and holiday selling seasons may not provide meaningful sales ‘lift’, and we also believe both seasons will be highly promotional.”In the second quarter, total sales dropped 7.2 per cent to $16.17bn, including the lost revenue from the pharmacy divestiture, while earnings dropped 11.6 per cent to $1.07 a share. Excluding the sale, EPS rose 0.5 per cent to $1.23.Two particular areas of difficulty for Target this quarter were electronics and food. Apple’s sharp sales decline also hurt Target, which said sales of the technology company’s products fell 20 per cent at its stores during the quarter. Target said it was working with Apple partners to improve traffic and ensure it was carrying the right mix of products.
35;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2016-08-11T20:39:54Z;Chesapeake Energy rallies after sale of shale assets in Texas;Energy groups and retailers make strong gains as stocks enter record territory;Shares in Chesapeake Energy rallied on Thursday after the company announced the sale of its shale operations in the Barnett region in Texas — home to the shale energy revolution — to buttress its balance sheet and trim costs.The energy group’s shares have lost more than 83 per cent of their value since mid-2014, when oil prices started crashing and sparked concerns over more indebted companies in the industry. Chesapeake has more than $8.6bn of debt and has been battling to shore up its finances lately.The company sold the Barnett Shale operations to Saddle Barnett Resources, a company backed by private equity firm First Reserve, and also severed its related gas agreements with Williams in exchange for $334m. The deal will save Chesapeake’s expenses on processing and transporting gas by $715m through 2017, and increase operating income by as much as $300m through 2019, according to the company.Doug Lawler, the chief executive of Chesapeake, said the deal marked “a major step” in the company’s transformation. “We believe there are more positive moves to come,” he added.Chesapeake’s shares rose as much as 6.3 per cent after the deal was announced, and closed up 4.8 per cent in New York at $5.03 — also helped by a rebound in energy prices on Thursday. Chesapeake is the second-largest gas supplier in the US.Nomura analyst Lloyd Byrne said the sale was “positive and another forward step” for the embattled energy group, allowing it to focus on better-performing parts of the business and lowering its cost of capital.The shares of oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevronalso rose, by 0.4 per cent to $86.72 and 1.3 per cent to $101.40 respectively, helping the S&P 500 index to a 0.5 per cent gain to 2,185.8 at the close.The companies benefited from the increase in crude oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate — the main US benchmark — rising 4.3 per cent to $43.49 a barrel and Brent climbing 4.5 per cent to $46.04. The S&P energy sector lead big groups with a 1.3 per cent gain.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 18,613.5 and entered record territory, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 5,228.4 on the day.However, the biggest gainers on the US stock market on Thursday were retailers, with the department store sub-index jumping 14.5 per cent. The rise was powered by Macy’s and Kohl’s, which climbed 17.1 per cent to $39.81 and 16.2 per cent to $44.19, respectively. Nordstrom, Ralph Lauren and Under Armour also rose sharply.The rally was caused by Macy’s revealing that the decline in same-store sales slowed for the first time in six quarters, and revealing plans to close 100 stores to boost profitability. Kohl’s lowered its profit outlook but still reported better than expected second-quarter results on Thursday.The gain of the niche S&P department store index — which only includes Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom — was the biggest one-day jump in eight years, and took the gauge to its highest level since May.
36;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2016-08-11T11:43:05Z;Kohl’s cuts profit outlook;;Another quarter and another profit warning from a department store.Kohl’s lowered its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to $3.80 to $4.00 a share, from its previous outlook for $4.05 to $4.25 a share. This compared to analysts estimates for $3.83 a share.The Wisconsin-based department store’s guidance cut comes after Macy’s, a bellwether for department stores, trimmed its profit outlook earlier this year ahead of the important back-to-school shopping season.Kohl’s also said same-store sales, a key industry metric, fell 1.8 per cent in second quarter, however the pace of decline slowed from the 3.9 per cent drop in the first quarter.News that the sales decline in the company was slowing, alongside a strong decrease in inventory and rise in gross margin was well received by investors.Shares in Kohl’s jumped 8 per cent to $41.20 in pre-market trading as gross margin climbed to 39.5 per cent, up 400 basis points from the first quarter.Kohl’s said profits rose to $221m or $1.22 a share in the three months ended July 30, compared with $211m or $1.07 a share in the year ago period. Sales slid 2 per cent to $4.18bn.Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of $1.04 a share, on sales of $4.16bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.22 a share, topped forecasts for $1.03 a share.The results come as department stores continue to compete with a surge in online retailers. Moreover, the rise of off-price retailers like TJX Cos, that sell designer brands at a discount, have also eaten into their sales.In an effort to lure customers to its stores, Kohl’s last month announced a partnership deal with Under Armour, the sportswear maker popular with middle class consumers. The deal could help Kohl’s benefit from the so-called “athleisure” trend, that sees people wear work out gear outside of the gym, that has helped sales at companies like Under Armour and Nike.Kohl’s shares have declined 20 per cent so far this year.
37;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2016-05-18T20:27:25Z;Tesla jumps after Goldman Sachs backing;US stocks edge ahead in choppy trading session;Tesla shares shifted into top gear on Wednesday after the electric vehicle maker was upgraded by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who cited strong demand for Tesla’s cars and more stable macro backdrop for the upgrade.Shares in the carmaker advanced 3.2 per cent to $211.17 after the stock was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” and analysts maintained their price target of $250 a share.The number of analysts with a “buy” rating on the stock rose to 10 while three have a “hold” rating and six have a ‘sell’ rating, according to Bloomberg data.Elon Musk’s Model 3 mass-market vehicle, which was unveiled earlier this year, has already booked 400,000 reservations.Patrick Archambault, at Goldman, said that an update on the car, which he expects in early 2017, should “have the added benefit of driving incremental awareness and interest in the mass-market product, and has the potential to drive further reservations”.Noting the potential for positive news, Mr Archambault said that Tesla could make an announcement on a shared mobility, or journey-sharing, service at some point.Finally, he expects that a ramp-up in production of its falcon-winged Model X vehicles could also help lift shares later this year.Concerns about the company’s accelerated production plans to meet demand for the mass-market vehicle, delayed projections for positive free cash flow and delivery target misses have weighed on investor optimism, with shares down 11 per cent so far this year.But Mr Archambault said that the company’s shares were not “fully capturing the company’s disruptive potential”.The rally in Tesla shares came as US markets gave up gains after meeting minutes released from Federal Reserve showed an openness to lifting interest rates in June.The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.6 per cent on the day before paring back all gains to 2,047.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed nearly unchanged at 17,526.62, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent to 4,739.12.Elsewhere, Lowe’s shares advanced more than 3.3 per cent to $78.60 after the DIY chain reported stronger than expected first-quarter profits amid strong demand for home improvement goods.Profits at the retailer rose to $884m, or 98 cents a share, up from $673m or 70 cents a share in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 87 cents a share topped expectations for 85 cents. Meanwhile, sales rose 7.8 per cent to $15.2bn, ahead of forecasts.Target shares fell 7.6 per cent to $67.99 after the company reported a smaller than expected increase in first quarter like-for-like sales during a challenging period for US department stores.The company said that same-store sales, a key industry metric, advanced 1.2 per cent, below expectations for a 1.6 per cent rise.The company said that it expected comparable sales in the current quarter to be in a range of flat or down as much as 2 per cent.The news sent shares in rival Walmart nearly 3 per cent lower to $63.14. Target’s soft sales figures followed dismal results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s.Meanwhile, shares in Hormel Foods, fell 8.6 per cent to $35.47 and were among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 after margins shrunk in its refrigerated foods division, raising concerns about the maker of Spam and Jenny-O Turkey.Profit margins for the company’s largest division fell to 11.9 per cent in the fiscal second quarter, from 14.4 per cent the previous quarter, said Akshay Jagdale, an analyst at Jefferies.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
38;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2016-05-13T18:58:57Z;US retail: in a box;Ecommerce is hardly a pot of gold;Successful retailing has two pillars. The aesthetics must to be right, and the supply chain must run smooth. America’s big apparel merchants, such as Macy’s, Gap, Nordstrom or Kohl’s are wobbly on both. All four announced sales shortfalls this week.No one disputes that the big chains have a glamour problem. Basics that are cheap and cheerful, found at the likes of H&M or Zara, and the fancier stuff on a discount rack at, say, TJX have beaten the middlebrow fare of department and speciality stores.Next, consider the choice of sales channel. Incumbents have started to boast of their “omnichannel” capabilities, with online and store sales complementing each other. This could have been one channel too many. Focus on online innovation may only have distracted from the creeping rot on the store side. Consultant Green Street Advisors thinks that anchor tenants in shopping malls would need to shutter a fifth of their stores to reach the productivity levels — sales per square foot — of a decade ago.Money has flooded into internet retail start-ups, but in the US there is no independent online fashion success story to match the UK’s Asos. Most are either flops (fab.com, Gilt Group) or burning millions in venture capital trying to get off the ground (Jet.com). The challenge of handling fast home deliveries is its own headache. The profits have slipped away from the big rag merchants. Will they reappear? Perhaps, once a lot of stores have shut and a lot of start-ups have wound down. Until then, invest elsewhere.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
39;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2016-05-12T20:41:58Z;Kohl’s shares drag US department stores lower;Stocks slip as Apple’s decline weighs on broader market;Shares in US department stores faced a second day of declines after Kohl’s reported a bigger than expected drop in first-quarter sales and profits.Kohl’s shares fell 9.2 per cent to $35.15 — taking its decline since the beginning of last year to more than 40 per cent — after the Wisconsin-based company said same-store sales, a key indicator of demand, dropped 3.9 per cent during the March quarter, compared with expectations for a 0.7 per cent rise.Total sales fell 3.7 per cent to $3.97bn during the period, well below market forecasts for a slight increase to $4.13bn.Net income meanwhile tumbled 87 per cent to $17m, partly as a result of one-off costs related to store closures. Meanwhile, gross margin fell 139 basis points to 35.5 per cent as the company resorted to heavy discounting to clear inventory.The dour news sent shares of Sears 10.7 per cent lower to $11.39 and shares in JC Penney down 1.2 per cent to $7.80. Nordstrom shares were little changed at $45.20.Kohl’s downbeat results arrived a day after Macy’s lowered its profit forecast.“Apparel is fighting an uphill battle. As evidenced by surprisingly weak April trends at L Brands, pressure at Macy’s and department stores, and specific issues at Gap, retail is in the midst of a transition,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen.Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren shares advanced 2.8 per cent to $86.86 after the retailer reported adjusted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped expectations but the news came alongside an otherwise grim quarter.The company, best known for its preppy polo shirts, reported adjusted earnings of 88 cents a share, ahead of analysts’ expectations for 83 cents.But like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, fell 6 per cent during the fiscal fourth quarter, worse than expectations for a 5.1 per cent decline.Operating margin at its retail business, which accounts for nearly half of group revenue, fell to -1.1 per cent, compared with 3.4 per cent in the year-ago period.Elsewhere, Apple’s shares extended their 2016 sell-off as analysts remained wary about slowing iPhone sales growth. The California technology group last month disappointed investors by disclosing the first year-on-year drop in iPhone sales in the device’s history.Investors were concerned that consumers in developed countries are not overly eager to upgrade their smartphones while demand for Apple’s most important product has waned in emerging markets like China that are experiencing growth slowdowns.“We remain cautious on iPhone growth this year given slowing smartphone market growth, elongating refresh cycles and Apple’s peak share at the high end,” said Sherri Scribner, an analyst at Deutsche Bank this week.Apple’s shares briefly fell below the $90 mark in New York trading for the first time since June 2014, according to Bloomberg data. They ended the day with a 2.4 per cent decline at $90.32.Apple’s decline weighed on the broader market with the Nasdaq Composite 0.5 per cent weaker at 4,737.33. Meanwhile the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were nearly unchanged at 2,064.11 and 17,720.50, respectively.
40;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Kohl’s latest US retailer to warn on tough trading;;More grim news for US retailers.Kohl’s has become the latest department store operator to warn over tough trading conditions as it reported a bigger than expected drop in first quarter sales and profits.The chain, which operates 1,167 outlets across the US, saw same store sales, a key indicator of demand, drop 3.9 per cent during the March quarter, compared to expectations for a 0.7 per cent rise.Total sales fell 3.7 per cent to $3.97bn during the period – well below market forecasts for a slight increase to $4.13bn.Net income meanwhile tumbled 87 per cent to $17m – partly as a result of one off costs related to store closures. Excluding these, adjusted net income came in at $58m, a 55 per cent drop and still below the $68.3m the market had expected.Gross margin fell 139 basis points to 35.5 per cent as the company resorted to heavy discounting to clear inventory.Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chairman and chief executive officer said:First quarter sales were challenging. Despite the sales environment, we wer able to manage our gross margin and inventory levels consistent with our expectations as we took the markdowns necessary to clear excess inventory. We managed our expenses effectively throughout the quarter as every area contributed to our savings versus our plan.Kohl’s weak first quarter performance comes just a day after rival Macy’s issued a profit warning and apparel retailer Gap was junked by Fitch. The numbers further underscore the fear in the market that the lacklustre holiday shopping season last year has carried over into the new year.Kohl’s shares tumbled 7 per cent in pre-market trading, adding to Wednesday’s 6 per cent drop.
41;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2016-02-04T22:42:53Z;Ralph Lauren slumps on dollar headwind;Retailer faces increased competition from fast-fashion retailers and ecommerce;Ralph Lauren, best known for its preppy, Ivy League style of clothing, slumped on Thursday after it lowered its sales forecast for the year, citing a strong US dollar.Shares in the New York-based retailer declined 22.2 per cent to $89.95, after it said that it expected net revenues to be up 1 per cent on a constant-currency basis, compared with its previous estimate for a gain of 3 to 5 per cent.Including the impact of currency fluctuations, the retailer expects revenues to have declined 3 per cent, compared with its previous forecast that sales would remain unchanged from a year ago. For the current quarter, Ralph Lauren expected flat net revenues, down 2 per cent from the period a year ago.Third-quarter profits were $131m, or $1.54 a share, compared with $215m, or $2.41 a share, in the period the previous year. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $2.12 a share. Adjusting for one-off items, earnings of $2.27 a share topped expectations.Ralph Lauren faces increased competition from fast-fashion retailers such as Zara and H&M and the proliferation of ecommerce. The strong dollar has hurt the chain by eroding tourism spending in the US and denting overseas earnings.Sales slid 4 per cent to $1.9bn, shy of estimates for $2bn. Warm weather, declining tourist traffic and product assortment challenges contributed to a 4 per cent decline in North America sales.Stefan Larsson, chief executive, said: “We are disappointed with the current business results.”He succeeded Ralph Lauren last year in an effort to revive sales, having helped turn round sales at Gap’s Old Navy brand.The shares declined 40 per cent last year.Kohl’s was also under pressure, falling 18.8 per cent to $41.52 after it cut its full-year earnings forecast. The department store expects fiscal 2015 earnings in the range of $3.95 to $4 a share, down from its previous outlook for the low end of $4.40 to $4.60.Shares in GoPro fell as much as 16 per cent to $9.01, a fresh record low, after it revealed a disappointing outlook and said that it was abandoning the low end of the action-camera market.The maker of wearable cameras expects revenues in the range of $160m to $180m in the current quarter, below the $300m expected by analysts. Its full-year sales forecast of $1.35bn-$1.5bn also came in shy of Wall Street estimates.Disappointing fourth-quarter results showed the company swinging to a loss of $34.5m in the final three months of the year.Analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded GoPro from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered their price target from $21 to $10.Shares in ConocoPhillips declined 8.7 per cent to $35.29 after the oil company cut its dividend by nearly 70 per cent to 25 cents a share amid a protracted slump in crude prices.The S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 1,915.45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 16,416.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 4,509.56.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
42;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2015-12-29T12:08:24Z;Department stores: still serving;Despite existential threats, department stores can still make reasonable investments;A simple post-Christmas task to ease you back in after all the turkey: build a bear case for the department store. It should be straightforward. Assailed by the internet on one side and fast-moving, niche specialists on the other, the lumbering department store looks like a jack of all trades and a master of none. Its customers are ageing, and the next generation will shop elsewhere.With those principles laid out, you can present the evidence. Exhibit one: a profit warning from Macy’s in November, which bemoaned “tepid” spending by domestic customers. Exhibit two: data from Euromonitor showing that sales at US department stores have shrunk by 8 per cent since 2010. Exhibit three: shares in Macy’s, Nordstrom, Kohl’s, Sears and JC Penney have all underperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years (years when, remember, the US economy has been recovering). The case looks well proven. Shut them all down now.And yet somehow the department stores are surviving, on both sides of the Atlantic. Even those that may seem troubled are not doomed. Just look at JC Penney, which had a torrid time in 2012 and 2013. A turnround plan is in place and like-for-like sales have been growing nicely this year (third-quarter same-store sales were up 6.4 per cent). The shares have responded by rising a tenth in the year to date — at their September peak they were up 59 per cent. It is still possible to make money investing in department stores.Still, unless you are especially adept at picking the turnrounds, most of that money is likely to be made via dividends. There are some decent yields around — Macy’s, Kohl’s and the UK’s Debenhams and Marks and Spencer all offer around 4 per cent. The department stores may be able to arrest their decline with fresh looks, new ranges and click & collect services, but life is not about to get easier. Department stores are not finished yet, but stick with those that can offer relatively stable profits to fund decent cash returns.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
43;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2015-11-12T23:05:59Z;Advance Auto Parts skids into red;Every US stocks sector in negative territory;Advance Auto Parts skidded into the red on Thursday after the company revealed weaker than expected quarterly results and its long-time chief executive stepped down.The Virginia-based company said third-quarter net profits dipped 1.4 per cent on a year-over-year basis to $120.5m. Excluding certain items, earnings came in at $1.95 a share, well below Wall Street estimates of $2.09. Sales edged higher by 0.3 per cent to $2.3bn, also shy of expectations of $2.33bn.Advance Auto, which sells after-market auto parts such as batteries and windshield wipers, said continuing demands from the integration of General Parts, a 2013 purchase, continued to weigh on results. It also took a hit from currency fluctuations. Meanwhile, chief executive Darren Jackson will step down after eight years at the company’s helm.Advance Auto also forged a pact with activist investor Starboard Value, which revealed a 3.7 per cent stake in the company in late September and has been pushing for “comprehensive operating improvements” and a “substantial” dividend or stock buyback programme.Starboard chief executive Jeffrey Smith will be given a seat on the board and made chair of its nominating and corporate governance committee. Investors sent the shares sinking 15.4 per cent to $164.67 by close of trading. Shares, however, are still up 3.4 per cent for the year.Elsewhere, department store chain Kohl’s revealed better than expected quarterly earnings amid an outperformance by its women’s clothing and footwear businesses.Sales rose 1.2 per cent from the prior year to $4.43bn, while net profits slid to $120m from $142m on the same basis. Adjusted profits of 75 cents a share topped the street view of 69 cents.The shares rallied 6.1 per cent to $45.80. The move came in stark contrast to the 14 per cent dive that Macy’s shares sustained on Wednesday on the back of disappointing quarterly results and a cut to its full-year sales outlook.Meanwhile, the materials and energy sectors faced heavy selling on the back of declines in the prices of several commodities.Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world’s biggest copper miners, dropped 5.8 per cent to $8.77 on the back of a 2.3 per cent fall in the price of copper.On the energy side, ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly traded energy company, fell 2.7 per cent to $79.40. US crude oil futures were down 64 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $42.30 a barrel.US stocks sustained broad-based selling by markets close. Every sector was in negative territory, while nearly 90 per cent of volume on the New York Stock Exchange was in declining shares.The move came as two Federal Reserve officials offered differing assessments on whether the central bank will be prepared to increase short-term interest rates from historic lows when it meets next month.While the labour market has shown continued signs of improvement recently, inflation has remained stubbornly below the Fed’s target.The broad S&P 500 slipped 1.4 per cent to 2,045.97, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.4 per cent to 17,448.07 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.2 per cent to 5,005.08.

The shares, which were already down 38 per cent this year, fell 14 per cent to $40.41.“The department store sector has come under significant pressure in recent weeks as a number of brands commented on weakness in the US wholesale channel and elevated inventory levels driving a promotional acceleration,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.The extent of the hit to sentiment was underlined by the performance of JCPenney, another veteran department store, whose shares began the day brightly after it said same-store sales in the third quarter had climbed a larger than expected 6.4 per cent.Its stock rose as much as 2.3 per cent to $8.88. But the move quickly unravelled after Macy’s results, which pushed the shares down 2 per cent to $8.51.JCPenney said it would pay as much as $50m to settle a lawsuit by customers in California over pricing. Although it denies the allegation that it broke Californian state law, the retailer said it was settling to avoid a protracted legal battle.The S&P 500 Consumer Durables and Apparel index, a broad measure of US retailers that includes Under Armour and Ralph Lauren, dropped 1.6 per cent, making it the second-worst performer on the S&P 500.Pharmaceuticals were also in focus. Shares in Horizon Pharma plunged 19.6 per cent to $17.99 after Express Scripts, which manages drug programmes for insurers and is a force in US healthcare, said it was suing the company and severing ties with pharmacy chain Linden Care, which dispenses Horizon’s products.Speciality pharmacies, which exclusively or predominantly sell medicines made by a single company, have been hit by concerns about some drug companies’ business models. Horizon said Express’s suit was without merit.In oil and gas, Apache shares fell 7.4 per cent to $49.38 after Anadarko Petroleum confirmed that it had made an approach. Anadarko added that it had withdrawn the bid. Energy companies are struggling to agree deals despite the pressure for consolidation.Some sectors fared better. The S&P 500 homebuilding index rose 1.9 per cent after surging 5.4 per cent on Tuesday. Results from DR Horton, one of the largest US homebuilders, buoyed sentiment after its profits rose more than expected. Its shares were up 2.8 per cent at $32.02 after jumping 8.3 per cent on Tuesday.US stocks overall struggled for direction on Veterans Day, a public holiday for many government employees, some businesses and the bond market. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent to 2,075.00, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent to 17,702.22. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent lower at 5,067.02.

Sales rose per cent to $4.1bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 55 cents a share on sales of $4.2bn.The company said sales slowed in February before picking up in March and April. “We are very pleased with our earnings results, with a more balanced promotional calendar driving merchandise margin combined with strong expense control,” said Kevin Mansell, chief executive.Shares of Kohl’s, which have gained 18 per cent in the past year, fell 13 per cent to $64.61.JC Penney shares slid 8 per cent to $8.04 after the family retailer said first-quarter comparable sales growth missed estimates.The Plano-Texas based company said same-store sales rose 3.4 per cent, slower than the 7.4 per cent growth in the prior-year period and lower than Wall Street forecasts for 3.7 per cent growth.The company reported a narrower than expected first-quarter loss and sales that were largely in line with forecasts.JC Penney also lifted its full year same-store sales forecasts to the range of 4-5 per cent for the year compared with Wall Street forecasts for 4.1 per cent growth.After lifting its full-year sales outlook, shares of Shake Shack ended 4 per cent lower at $65.50 after the momentum stock initially climbed as much as 13 per cent.Short interest in the burger chain has climbed since its debut in January, with nearly 11 per cent of its shares on loan to short, according to data from Markit.The company said it expects revenues from the current year to range between $161m and $165m, above its previous estimates for $159m or $163m, with the high end of its range meeting Wall Street estimates.The company also reported a first-quarter loss of $12.7m or $1.06 a share, from a profit of $1.1m in the year-ago period. Sales rose 56 per cent to $37.8m.Analysts had forecast a narrower loss of 29 cents a share on sales of $33.9m. On an adjusted basis, however, earnings of 4 cents a share topped estimates.Shares of Puma Biotechnology fell 19 per cent to $170.67 after results from a study on the company’s main drug candidate, Neratinib, fell short of Wall Street expectations.A later stage clinical trial showed that after two years of treatment of Neratinib, the disease free survival rate for patients with a type of early stage breast cancer was 93.9 per cent, just 2.3 per cent higher than those on a placebo.Investors had hoped it would show a difference of at least 3 per cent.US stocks gained on Thursday as yields on US bonds retreated from recent highs and after the number of weekly claims for unemployment benefits in the US fell.The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 2,121.09, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.1 per cent to 18,252.24 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4 per cent to 5,050.79.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

48;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2015-02-04T18:27:44Z;Gilead sinks on discounting worries;Consumer discretionary and telecoms offer support to S&P 500;Gilead Sciences shares tumbled on Wednesday despite exceeding fourth-quarter earnings and sales estimates after it said it would have to offer discounts on its hepatitis C drug.The California-based company said it would make a “gross to net adjustment” of 46 per cent on US sales of its Harvoni and Sovaldi pills this year.Sales of the company’s older hepatitis C medication, Sovaldi, slowed to $1.73bn from a quarter earlier as patients transitioned to its successor, Harvoni.The new medication, which has a cure rate of 94-99 per cent and a $94,500 price tag for a 12-week treatment, beat Wall Street estimates at $2.11bn. Sales a quarter earlier were limited as the medication was only available in Europe.“Gilead expects lower margins to be offset by higher patient volumes and fewer eligibility restrictions, including treating F0 patients (no fibrosis) in select agreements,” said Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura.Gilead expects to have capacity to treat more than 250,000 patients for hepatitis C in 2015.Matthew Roden, an analyst at UBS, said market penetration would rise as the drug became more affordable, but in the short term “more patients are captured by Gilead ahead of further competition”.But he added that year estimates beyond 2015 would decrease because more patients would have been cured.Gilead profits more than tripled from a year earlier to $3.49bn, or $2.18 a share in the three months to the end of December, while sales more than doubled to $7.3bn.Gilead announced that it would pay a 43 per cent quarterly dividend and announced a $15bn share buyback programme.Shares of Gilead, which have climbed more than 18 per cent in the past year, fell more than 8 per cent to $98.43, wiping $16.5bn in market capitalisation.Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill fell 7 per cent to $676.00 after the restaurant chain reported a 16.1 rise in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, shy of Wall Street estimates for 16.5 per cent growth.Earnings of $3.84 a share topped forecasts, while sales of $1.1bn were in line with estimates.Ralph Lauren was the worst performing stock on the US benchmark after the company reported a 9 per cent drop in fiscal third-quarter profits to $215m or $2.41 a share and sales of $2.03bn that missed Wall Street estimates.The retailer expects fiscal 2015 revenue to rise 4 per cent in constant currency terms, lower than its previous estimates for 5-7 per cent growth.

Revenues climbed 6 per cent to $5.03bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.85 a share on sales of $4.96bn. Adjusted earnings of $2.30 a share beat expectations of $2.11 a share.The company also boosted its 2014 revenue guidance to a range of $19.8bn-$20bn and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.45 to $8.55.“While we take comfort that it appears Amgen’s base business has largely stabilised, we believe the quarter will be overshadowed by the [October 28] Business Review meeting,” Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura, said.Amgen has been under pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb, whose hedge fund Third Point has a stake in the company, to split into two.During an analyst meeting, Robert Bradway, chief executive of Amgen, said he was not convinced that splitting the company would add much value to shareholders, according to Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Shares of Amgen climbed 6 per cent to $157.19 and are up 38 per cent so far this year.Kohl’s lagged behind the S&P 500 after the US department store chain warned on Monday that quarterly profits would be at the low end of its earlier guidance as sales softened in October.Lex discusses whether the biotechnology group is better apartIt expects earnings in its third quarter to be at the low end of earlier guidance of between $4.05 and $4.45 a share.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $4.29 per share before Monday’s announcement.Shares of Kohl’s fell nearly 7 per cent to $54.66.Coach shares dropped 6 per cent to $34 after the luxury handbag maker said it expected a mid to high 20 per cent decline in comparable store sales in fiscal year 2015.The retailer reported a 10 per cent decline in sales to $1.04bn in the three months to the end of September that were modestly ahead of expectations for $1.01bn.Profit fell 45 per cent to $119.1m, or 43 cents per share.

50;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2014-09-18T16:55:59Z;Peabody sinks after Goldman downgrade;;Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, led the laggers on the benchmark S&P 500 after brokerage Goldman Sachs dimmed its view on the company as pressure on global coal markets persist.Weak Chinese demand and high Australian supply of coal is expected to weigh on the price through the remainder of the year, analysts with the investment bank said.Lower demand from US utilities is also expected to depress coal prices.Spot metallurgical coal prices have hovered near $115 per metric ton this year, below average levels over the past three years.Goldman on Thursday subsequently cut its fourth-quarter price target for met coal to $120 from $132 per metric ton.“Many investors have been surprised by the lack of volatility in met pricing – with prices effectively unchanged for six months,” Neil Mehta, an analyst with Goldman, said.“We attribute the flatlining of pricing to the role of China, which is significantly less active in the seaborne market, and typically acts as the swing driver of pricing.”Mr Mehta lowered his rating on Peabody to ‘sell’ from ‘neutral’, sending its shares 5 per cent lower to $13.49.Rival Consol Energy declined 2 per cent $37.98 while Arch Coal slipped 5 per cent to $2.65.Goldman becomes the second investment bank this week to downgrade Peabody to ‘sell’ or sell-equivalent, following Nomura.Rite Aid, the third-largest US drugstore chain, cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday as a number of medications came off patent, weighing on the retailer’s margins.The company, which has about 4,600 stores in the US, said full-year profits would be as much as 25 per cent lower than earlier estimates, ranging between $223m and $333m on sales of $26bn-$26.3bn.Rite Aid had earlier projected sales between $26bn and $26.5bn.Executives with Rite Aid blamed a delay in the introduction of generic version of some medications as well as lower insurer reimbursement rates on the introduction of new generic drugs for the profit warning.Rite Aid shares slumped 19 per cent to $5.41, the worst performing stock on the Russell 1000.Rival Walgreens fell 1 per cent to $63.18 and CVS declined 1 per cent to $81.18.Kohl’s shares climbed after analysts with Citi lifted their rating on the retailer to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, as chilly weather and encouraging back-to-school sales lift the company’s third-quarter prospects.“We expect an improved product assortment, loyalty programme leverage and prudent inventory management to drive comp store sales and margins,” Oliver Chen, an analyst with Citi, said.Kohl’s shares rose 2 per cent to $62.50.ConAgra shares led the S&P 500, advancing 5 per cent to $33.48, after the company reported first-quarter profits ahead of Wall Street expectations.The packaged foods producer, which owns the Hunt’s ketchup and Hebrew National hot dog brands, said profits rose to $484.5m in the quarter.When adjusting for certain items, the company said it earned 39 cents a share, two cents ahead of consensus forecasts.Overall, US equity markets climbed to record highs following Wednesday’s Fed decision.

51;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2014-08-14T20:42:41Z;Utilities climb amid appetite for haven assets;;Utilities led a languid trading day as markets digested stagnant European economic activity as a drop in yields on German and US treasuries made the sector comparatively more attractive.Investors shifted back into haven assets, particularly higher dividend-paying equities in the US, and out of higher growth sectors including the technology industry.The reversal into US utilities, including Pinnacle West, Entergy and Exelon, which all climbed more than 1 per cent, followed a difficult quarter for the sector.Since the start of July, utilities have lagged behind all others on the benchmark S&P 500, falling 5.2 per cent.Analysts with Credit Suisse noted that much of the weakness at the end of July related to “market concern over Fed activity and the threat of rising interest rates”.Sluggish activity across Europe, which economists with IHS Global Insight said faced significant growth constraints, and a Federal Reserve cautious of lifting rates amid a fragile recovery, has made utilities more appealing.“Fiscal policy is still generally restrictive, despite increased flexibility over countries’ fiscal targets, and tight credit conditions persist in several countries amid still significant banking sector problems,” said Raj Badiani, European economist with IHS.The Dow Jones Utilities Average advanced 0.8 per cent to 545.91 while the Russell 2000 technology index declined 0.2 per cent to 2,047.88.Shares of Pinnacle West rose 1.8 per cent to $54.35, Entergy climbed 1.5 per cent to $73.01 and Exelon advanced 1.2 per cent to $31.83.Cisco shares were under pressure after the company said it would lay off 6,000 employees, or 8 per cent of its workforce, beginning in its current fiscal quarter as it seeks to trim costs and better compete with rivals.The San Jose, California-based company said it would incur a pre-tax charge of $700m relating to the restructuring.Cisco, like venerable tech giants IBM and Hewlett-Packard, has found difficulty lifting revenues, particularly as emerging markets struggle to maintain economic growth rates seen over the past decade.John Chambers, the Cisco chief executive, highlighted the “economic and geopolitical challenges” in China, Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Turkey and Thailand for some of the weakness.Cisco declined 2.6 per cent to $24.54 while HP rose 0.8 per cent to $35.59.Berkshire Hathaway, the company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett, soared to $200,000 for the first time on Thursday.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s class A shares advanced 1.6 per cent to $202,850 valuing Berkshire at more than $326bn.Kohl’s buoyed the wider department store sector after it said profits exceeded expectations as it trimmed costs and saw an uptick in July sales.The Wisconsin-based retailer said quarterly sales fell 1 per cent to $4.24bn.Profits were little changed at $232m, or $1.13 per share. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.07 a share.Kevin Mansell, chief executive, told analysts on a call that the company saw sales momentum at the start of July, reporting “a positive comp for the first time in several months”.The results followed figures from Macy’s on Wednesday, which fell short of analyst forecasts.Kohl’s shares rose 3.3 per cent to $56.91. Rival Dillard’s edged up 0.2 per cent to $115.60 while JC Penney climbed 4 per cent to $9.74, ahead of stronger results which lifted the stock another 5 per cent to $10.24 in after-market trading.Restaurant chain Noodles & Co tumbled 16 per cent to $21.16 after the company said second-quarter profits and sales missed analyst expectations as same-store sales declined.The company said overall sales advanced 11 per cent from a year earlier to $99.5m as it continued to open new restaurants, while profits climbed to $3.5m, or 11 cents per share.Overall, US equity markets advanced as new figures showed recent jobless claims hovering near pre-crisis levels.The S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent to 1,955.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 16,713.58.

52;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2014-08-13T16:09:17Z;Department stores slip on Macy’s warning;;Shares in US department store operators slipped after one of the country’s largest chains warned an improving second half would not fully compensate for weakness at the beginning of the year.Macy’s, which also owns the Bloomingdale’s luxury chain, said full year same-store sales – a key measure for retailers – would likely rise between 1.5 and 2 per cent, below initial projections as high as 3 per cent.The bitter US winter eroded first-quarter profits, increasing the importance of the so-called ‘back to school’ shopping period for both Macy’s and its rivals.Terry Lundgren, Macy’s chief executive, said the retailer was approaching the second half with optimism “tempered with the reality that many customers still are not feeling comfortable about spending more in an uncertain economic environment”.Overall revenues for the quarter ended August 2 climbed 3 per cent from a year earlier to $6.2bn. Profits edged 4 per cent higher to $292m, or 80 cents per share. Both figures were shy of analyst estimates.The results coincided with monthly retail sales figures from the Department of Commerce, which fell short of Wall Street expectations.The figures showed virtually no change in overall sales in July from a month earlier but a 0.7 per cent decline in sales at department stores.Analysts with Wells Fargo noted Macy’s had the poor fortune of being the first mall-based retailer to report quarterly results.“Once all have reported, we don’t think Macy’s will seem so bad,” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said. “After all, gross profit dollars increased showing that the company is at least driving sales with its promotions. Not all will be so fortunate.”Macy’s shares slumped 5 per cent to $56.50. Rival Nordstrom declined 1 per cent to $68.06, Sears fell 2 per cent to $35.89, Kohl’s declined 2 per cent to $54.94 and JC Penney slipped 2 per cent to $9.32.Yahoo shares climbed after Alibaba amended an agreement with the parent company of Alipay, the online payment processor it spun off three years ago, that capped the amount of money it could have earned in an initial public offering or other “liquidity event”.In a filing with US securities regulators, Alibaba said it would now receive at least $9.38bn in a liquidity event – representing its stake in Alipay’s parent, Small and Micro Financial Services Company. Alibaba was previously set to receive between $2bn-$6bn.Yahoo, which holds a 22.5 per cent stake in Alibaba, rose 2 per cent to $36.20.Shares in King Digital Entertainment, the UK gaming company, tumbled 23 per cent to $14.00 after it warned that the money players are spending on its flagship game, Candy Crush Saga, has moderated.As a result, King, which was valued at $7bn in its March initial public offering, cut its forecast for gross bookings to between $2.25bn and $2.35bn for the full-year.American Apparel shares slipped 5 per cent to $0.86 after the struggling retailer said sales stalled in the three months to the end of June.The Los Angeles-based company said its loss narrowed to $15m, or 9 cents per share, from $38m a year earlier. Analysts on Wall Street had expected a loss of 6 cents per share in the period.The company said it would also delay filing its quarterly report with US securities regulators to give new board members time to review its financials.Fossil Group, which makes watches for Burberry, Michael Kors and Emporio Armani, along with its own namesake brand, was under pressure after the company said operating margins declined as sales growth fell to its slowest pace since 2012.Second-quarter profits slid 22 per cent to $52.5, or 98 cents per share, as the company continued to invest in new stores.Sales climbed 9.6 per cent to $774m. Analysts had expected profits of $50.5m from sales of $771m.The figures are unlikely to allay concern as competitors prepare to unleash their own smart watches.Apple has marshalled the most attention for its possible entry into the watch market.

53;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2012-11-29T23:44:53Z;Sandy batters sales at US stores;Sales fall despite pick-up in post-Thanksgiving shopping;Superstorm Sandy turned November into a bad month for US department stores as they reported falling sales, despite a pick-up in post-Thanksgiving shopping and modest overall growth across the retail sector.As the disruption caused by Sandy suppressed consumer spending on non-essentials, Macy’s recorded a 0.7 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year, its first decline in three years.Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Macy’s, said: “Despite the largest volume Thanksgiving weekend in our company’s history, we were not able to overcome the weak start to the month, which included the disruption of Hurricane Sandy.”Across the retail sector, three-quarters of companies reported sales that fell short of expectations, according to Retail Metrics.The results follow mixed signals from the traditional start of Christmas shopping around Black Friday last week, with ShopperTrak estimating that sales rose a modest 2.7 per cent on the four days from Thanksgiving on Thursday to Sunday.However, online sales surged, according to data from IBM, with double-digit growth.For the whole of November, Kohl’s, a mid-market department store, reported a 5.6 per cent fall in like-for-like sales.At Nordstrom, an upmarket rival, sales were down 1.1 per cent but the company said they had rebounded to historic levels in the second half of the month.Jason Buechel, a senior executive in Accenture’s retail division, noted that in addition to inhibiting consumer spending the superstorm had led to the temporary closure of some stores and disrupted distribution.JC Penney, the department store, whose quarterly sales have been plummeting in the midst of a wrenching transformation, does not report monthly sales figures.At 17 retailers that report monthly figures – excluding drug stores – like-for-like sales rose 1.6 per cent from last November, according to Thomson Reuters.Order Barney Jopson’s startling account of the hidden influence and boundless ambition of Amazon, overlord of a mini-economy that goes well beyond online shoppersThe figure fell short of forecasts of 3.3 per cent growth and led to a 0.5 per cent fall in the New York stock market’s retail index, while equities overall rose 0.4 per cent.Barnes & Noble shares fell 11 per cent after it reported a quarterly profit but slower digital sales growth.While some money that consumers would have spent on discretionary purchases shifted to materials for post-storm clean-up and repair, sector-wide figures suggested this did not have a net positive effect on sales.Shopping patterns in November were also distorted by the US election on November 6, which was preceded by political advertising that raised the price of commercials and drove many retailers off the air.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, a research group, said: “We caution not to read too much into these soft numbers given all the disruptions and would look to December as a better gauge of consumer spending.”

Significantly warmer weather in March throughout the US also helped boost pent-up demand for spring clothing, he said.Shares in Bed, Bath & Beyond gained 9.2 per cent to $71.85 for the week, the fourth best-performing stock on the S&P 500 over the shortened period. The home goods and appliances retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings per share above analyst projections and revised up its forecast earnings per share for its first quarter of this year.The company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.48, beating analyst projections of $1.32.“This was 15 cents above the high end of guidance,” said Laura Champine, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “Bed, Bath & Beyond has beaten the high end of its guidance range for 13 consecutive quarters dating back to the February 2009 quarter,” she noted and raised the price target for its shares to $73.Kate McShane, analyst at Citigroup, also increased her price target for the company but warned that earnings per share growth may decelerate as competition from online retailers increased. Shares in Bed, Bath & Beyond have gained more than 24 per cent in the year to date.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent for the week to 1,398.08 after it had touched a post-financial crisis high on Monday above the 1,420 points mark. The benchmark US index remains up 11.2 per cent in the year to date.Many stocks on the main market turned negative on Tuesday as investors interpreted the release of the minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee as suggesting that a third round of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve would be unlikely.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.2 per cent to 13,060.14, while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.4 per cent to 3,080.50.Avon Products, the door-to-door cosmetics seller, was the biggest riser on the S&P 500 after it rejected a $10bn takeover offer by Coty, the private fragrance group. Shares in Avon rose 22.1 per cent to $23.42 over the week but were still down almost 15 per cent in the last year.But not all retailers managed to notch up big gains. Constellation Brands, the world’s largest wine company, tumbled 8.5 per cent to $21.61 and was among the week’s worst-performing equity’s on the main US market.The decline came after Constellation said earnings per share would come in below analyst projections. A Bloomberg survey had put 12-month EPS at about $2.23, but the company warned that it would likely be between $1.93 and $2.03 instead.Groupon, the daily deal and offers website, sunk 22.9 per cent to $14.18, its lowest point since shares debuted on the main market in November. Investor confidence in the company, which reported last week that its internal accounting controls were subject to “material weakness”, was shaken by the news and shares fell well below their initial offer price of $20 this week.American International Group, the insurance company that was rescued by the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, added 9.9 per cent to reach $32.89. Shares in AIG rose this week as news broke that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was considering a sale of its Maiden Lane III portfolio, which was created when the central bank rescued the insurer.JPMorgan Chase fell more than 3.5 per cent to $44.34 as it said chief executive Jamie Dimon earned $23.1m in 2011 and as it agreed to pay a $20m penalty to settle regulatory allegations that it mishandled customer accounts.In its annual report, JPMorgan said Mr Dimon received $1.4m in salary, a bonus of $4.5m and $17m in stock and options compared to James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, whose pay package totalled $10.5m in 2011.Shares in Morgan Stanley lost 6.4 per cent to $18.39 this week but are still up more than 21 per cent in the year to date.

Stocks barely paused for breath when consumer spending data showed a fall in real disposable income in January, leading Goldman Sachs to lower its first-quarter growth forecast.A surge in the price of crude oil triggered a pullback in mid-afternoon trade but the S&P 500 rebounded to finish near a day high.Despite the US market’s apparent resilience to bad news in 2012, Sam Stovall at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ became the third equity analyst in a week to urge clients to retreat from equities.“We view current price levels . . . as very good areas in which to lighten equity exposure. We think the next pullback could be particularly sharp,” Mr Stovall said in a note.Bank stocks led the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 climbing 1.6 per cent. Bank of America was up 1.9 per cent to $8.12 and JPMorgan rose 2.9 per cent to $40.37, its highest close since August.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.2 per cent higher at 12,980.3 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent to 2,988.97.Among investment banks, Goldman Sachs surged 5 per cent to $121.13, a six-month high, and Morgan Stanley added 3.5 per cent to $19.19.Nomura analysts forecast that the sluggish start to the year in US M&A and equity trading activity would pick up as a result of the buoyant markets.“Investor risk appetite has increased and asset levels are higher,” Glen Schorr told Nomura clients. “If asset prices can hold relatively steady, we think activity in these businesses will likely see some improvement.”February same-store sales exceeded analysts’ expectations for many retailers.Shares in Gap climbed 7.2 per cent to $25.05 as sales rose 4 per cent, beating the average analyst estimate for a decline of 1.4 per cent.The clothing store chain endured a torrid 2011 but shares are now within reach of 10-year highs, having gained by a third this year.Mid-market department store chain Kohl’s was one of the few companies to disappoint with its same-store sales figure. It slipped 1.6 per cent to $48.87.Advanced Micro Devices climbed 2.2 per cent to $7.51 after the semiconductor manufacturer’s move to buy computer server manufacturer, SeaMicro.The purchase appears designed to staunch AMD’s loss of market share to Intel in sales of personal computer chips. Shares in Intel lost 0.1 per cent to $26.86.It was the second sign of consolidation in the semiconductor space this week after Japanese computer memory chipmaker Elpida filed for bankruptcy. But analysts said the two cases were different.“The computer memory space is ripe for consolidation because the industry has high fixed costs and products are easily substitutable,” said Srini Pajjuri at Crédit Agricole Securities.“AMD’s acquisition, on the other hand, is more strategic. It’s partly vertically integrating to improve its offering to computer manufacturers.”First Solar fell 5.8 per cent to $30.42 as investors continued to sell the stock after the solar panel manufacturer declared an unexpectedly large quarterly loss this week.At one point in February, shares in First Solar were up almost 50 per cent for the year, following the trend for last year’s S&P 500 laggards to outperform in 2012.But the poor earnings report and a planned reduction in German subsidies for solar panels have seen its shares fall $20 in two weeks and the stock is down 10 per cent for the year.Finisar ended a volatile day up 4.6 per cent to $21.23. The stock had fallen as much as 10 per cent in pre-market trading after the telecoms equipment provider saw earnings fall 50 per cent compared with the same period last year.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 2.6 per cent to $8.59, giving back part of a strong gain on Wednesday, which analysts had put down to unrealistic expectations of an imminent housing recovery.
56;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2012-02-23T21:44:25Z;Sears jumps on spin-off and sale plans;;Shares in Sears Holdings jumped after the department store chain said it would raise up to $670m from asset sales and other restructuring, as it published quarterly results.A fourth-quarter loss of $2.4bn had been expected after the company pre-announced disappointing holiday sales and said it would close stores in December. Investors instead focused on the turnround plan announced by Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and chief investor. The process is set to begin in April with the $270m sale of 11 stores.The shares climbed 18.7 per cent to $61.80, $15 above their price before December’s announcement.That helped the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 to a healthy gain, although it remained in negative territory for the week, and was not helped by a 5.9 per cent fall for Kohl’s, the mid-market department store, which reported a decline in profits of nearly 8 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, high costs ate into margins for several companies.Shares in Safeway fell 7.6 per cent to $20.95, as profits at the supermarket chain fell, despite a rise in same-store sales.Mass market retailer Target also reported a fall in net fourth-quarter income and a decline in gross margins. Analysts had forecast worse figures and the shares climbed 2.9 per cent to $54.50.Procter & Gamble investors responded positively as the company bowed to analyst pressure to streamline its business, by announcing it would cut 5,700 jobs and $10bn in costs over the next four years. Shares in the consumer goods maker climbed 3.1 per cent to $66.42.Elsewhere, stocks closed within 0.2 points of a post-financial crisis high, as the S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,363.46 points.Wall Street had opened lower but was given a shot in the arm by better than expected data from the Kansas Fed manufacturing index, a closely watched indicator of economic activity in the mid-western states of the US.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,984.69 points, its highest close since May 2008.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,956.98 points, as Apple shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $516.39, after the company bowed to pressure to give investors greater influence over the election of directors.Shares in Vivus gained 77.5 per cent to $18.73 after the drugmaker received backing from a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel for a new weight loss pill.Hewlett-Packard shares fell 6.5 per cent to $27.05 after the computer maker reported a 7 per cent fall in sales after the bell on Wednesday. Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, promised a multi-year turnround of HP’s large businesses, but analysts stressed the challenges.“[The turnround] will require significant investment in streamlining operations, regaining product leadership and positioning the company to benefit from key industry trends,” said Richard Gardner, technology analyst at Citi. “The company will have to make these investments while navigating a number of extremely competitive, mature end markets – not a journey for the faint of heart.”Shares in First Solar fell 8 per cent to $37.20, as investors reacted to the German government’s plans to cut subsidies for solar power generation. Analysts were expecting the solar panel manufacturer to report a fall in profits of more than 10 per cent when it released fourth-quarter results after the close of trading on Thursday.MetroPCS climbed 13.8 per cent to $11.70 as the company reported a sixfold increase in fourth-quarter profit. The pay as you go mobile phone network has challenged large mobile networks by offering customers attractive rates. But the company showed strong cost discipline in the fourth quarter, cutting back on phone subsidies and marketing costs. The cost of acquiring new customers fell, while most analysts had expected it to rise.Oil and gas exploration and production companies continued to report fourth-quarter results and 2012 budgets, with two winners evident on Thursday.QEP Resources climbed 7.8 per cent to $34.03 and Denbury Resources was up 5.5 per cent to $20.71 as the companies responded to decade-low natural gas prices in different ways.Denbury saw fourth-quarter profits easily beat analyst expectations, thanks to strong oil output from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.QEP resources reported a fourth-quarter loss, but saw earnings from its field services operation, which is less closely tied to gas prices, almost double compared with the same period in 2010.Shares in Salesforce.com gained as much as 10 per cent to $144.33 in after hours trading, after the business accounting software provider reported revenue that exceeded analyst expectations.
57;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2012-02-23T17:46:08Z;Sears spins off stores after $2.4bn loss;;Sears Holdings, the e mbattled US department store, signalled a change in course by spinning off part of its business and selling 11 stores to raise about $670m as it reported a record net loss of $2.4bn.Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund manager at its helm, said the company was “unwilling to continue on the current course” as it unveiled restructuring moves that were welcomed by the stock market. Its shares jumped 20.6 per cent to $62.81.Sears is one of the most storied names in US retail but it has been in decline for more than a decade and is still criticised as a tired operation. Mr Lampert, who chairs and controls Sears Holdings, has failed to turn it round since he created it in 2005 by merging the department store with Kmart.Since late 2011, as it became clear its performance had worsened during the year, Sears has faced a fresh round of speculation about its ability to meet its debt obligations and stay in business.On its first earnings call with analysts in several quarters Sears tried to quash the bleakest prognoses while beginning to meet some investor demands.It said that it would raise between $400m and $500m by giving existing Sears shareholders the right to buy shares in a new business created by spinning off its Hometown and Outlet stores and some hardware shops. It would raise a further $270m by selling or ending its leases on 11 stores.Some analysts have promoted the benefits of breaking up the company, and in a partial concession to such arguments Mr Lampert said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday: “The ability to successfully transform the disparate businesses we have in the Sears Holdings portfolio under a single management structure has proved very difficult.“We intend to separate the management of several of our businesses from that of the core Sears and Kmart formats, with the goal of allowing each business to pursue its own strategic opportunities.”Sears said its plans also highlighted the “unrecognised value” in its assets, but at the same time it stressed that it already held “ample” liquidity of $3.2bn. “In my opinion, Sears Holdings has a profit problem, not a liquidity nor an asset problem,” Mr Lampert said.In the three months to January 28, Sears reported a net loss of $2.4bn compared with a profit of $374m in the same period last year. The quarterly loss, which Mr Lampert described as an “anomaly”, accounted for the bulk of a full-year net loss of $3.14bn.Sears’ quarterly revenue dropped 4 per cent to $12.48bn, with declines in consumer electronics and appliances sales eclipsing growth in clothes, shoes and home goods.Elsewhere in the retail sector, Kohl’s, a rival department store, reported an 8 per cent fall in net income to $455m on sales up 0.3 per cent to $6.02bn in the three months to the end of January.Target, a mass market discounter, said its net income fell 5.2 per cent to $981m on sales up 3.3 per cent to $20.94bn in the same period.
58;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2012-01-25T23:36:45Z;JC Penney to shake up pricing policy;;"JC Penney announced an end to unpredictable discounts and a new era of permanently lower prices under Ron Johnson, its new head and a former Apple executive, who criticised retailers for creating a blizzard of special offers that has confused shoppers.In a highly anticipated presentation, Mr Johnson, who led Apple’s retail business for 11 years, said he would scrap the hundreds of sales that JC Penney has offered every year and replace them with three simple, predictable price tiers.The highest price tier would be 30 to 50 per cent below current prices, equating roughly to what JC Penney had traditionally used as its first discount price, said Michael Francis, the group’s president.The pricing is part of Mr Johnson’s plan to transform JC Penney, a 110-year old department store chain that he said had become “tired”. He unveiled a new logo and marketing plan, a partnership with designer Nanette Lepore and a glimpse of how he wants to overhaul store layout and design.JC Penney’s sales were worse than those of its main rivals, Macy’s and Kohl’s, in the holiday season and in recent years. Its shares have outperformed the market since Mr Johnson joined the board in August, but they fell 1 per cent on Wednesday to $34.27.In a presentation laced with references to Apple, which does not discount its products, Mr Johnson said JC Penney’s pricing had “no integrity”. It had done 590 promotions last year and customers had ignored them “99 per cent of the time”.Instead, from February, JC Penney would introduce “fair and square” pricing with three tiers: “everyday” price; deeper discounts on items relevant to the current season; and the lowest prices on clearance items on the first and third Friday of each month.A woman’s T-shirt that last year had an official retail price of $14 had sold for an average price of $6, Mr Johnson said. From next month it would be sold for $7, reduced to $5 when people needed T-shirts in warmer weather, and marked down for clearance to $4.He said the array of discounts, coupons, loyalty programmes and other deals offered by retailers had eroded consumers’ trust, equating the situation with a similar lack of confidence in Wall Street and in the political class in Washington.“There’s a fundamental fairness and integrity issue going on. Customers are rejecting us because of that,” he said.But some analysts say that “treasure-hunting” consumers, who have become accustomed to the thrill of finding bargains, may not take to more stable pricing.Mr Francis acknowledged that JC Penney wanted to attract more young shoppers and said: ”We’ll be repositioning products to put trend stories together and inspire outfits …as opposed to this [selling] clothes by the pound idea that has really plagued us within a promotional [environment].”Mr Johnson said his broader ambition was to make JC Penney “America’s favourite store”, but he is trying to do so in a highly competitive environment where many younger shoppers prefer speciality stores to department stores and internet retailers are winning market share from all of them."
59;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

But will they expend their new-found vigour by actually consuming, or will they dig down deeper into their bunkers?The answer matters for the world economy. US consumption accounts for roughly 70 per cent of the country’s GDP and 15 per cent of the planet’s. This means that a 3 per cent contraction in US consumption would be the equivalent to the economy of, say, Colombia, simply disappearing.The good news is certainly not ubiquitous. It comes in dribs and drabs. Household net worth took a nasty step down in the third quarter as property and share prices slipped. But Thursday’s private sector jobs report from payroll processor ADP was surprisingly robust (and will look even better if confirmed by Friday’s official jobs figures). It was accompanied by another tick down in initial jobless claims. In addition, delinquencies for many types of loan fell in the third quarter, according to the American Bankers Association. Consumer debt payments, as a percentage of disposable income, have reached lows last seen in the 1990s even while credit is expanding.The ultimate confirmation will come, of course, from the results of the companies where Americans spend their money. Here the signals are mixed. There are some bright spots, such as the Macy’s department store chain, and car sales were surprisingly strong. But several of the biggest retailers to report – Kohl’s, JC Penney, and, most significantly, Target – have posted disappointing Christmas trading.A thriftier US might be stronger and more balanced in the long run, and the great crash may have taught consumers valuable lessons. But austerity, whether from governments or from individuals, could not come at a worse time. By all means have virtue, but tomorrow.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
61;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2012-01-05T16:14:50Z;US retailers cut forecasts despite gains;;Several US retailers have downgraded their earnings forecasts even as stores reported overall gains in holiday sales, underlining a structural shift toward lower profit margins driven by the internet and stiff competition.Target, JC Penney, Kohl’s and American Eagle all downgraded their earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter as retailers reported a 3.6 per cent rise in sales in December, some 0.3 percentage points above market expectations.Sales growth came at the cost of reduced profit margins as retailers relied on discounts of up to 70 per cent to attract shoppers, a feature that could be hard to reverse as demanding, internet-savvy consumers become “trained” to expect them.Stacey Widlitz, an independent retail analyst, said: “Retailers are creating a new margin structure in order to gain share. The fear factor is taking over, even when [sales] trends are encouraging.”American Eagle, a teen fashion retailer, was “a perfect example of the new normal”, she said. Its like-for-like sales in November and December were up 12 per cent from a year ago, but it cut its quarterly earnings forecast to $0.33-$0.35 per share from $0.40-$0.44.Ms Widlitz said she had just paid $18 for a vest from American Eagle that was being sold for $76 before Christmas.Heavy spending on advertising and free shipping for online orders are also eroding profits in a sector that was already “low margin, high volume” compared to industries such as technology and pharmaceuticals.The biggest surprise of the day was Target, the mass market discounter, which signalled the end of a strong run by reporting weaker-than-expected December sales – up 1.6 per cent from a year ago – and downgrading its profit forecast to $1.35-$1.43 per share from $1.43-$1.53.The retail landscape is being reshaped by consumers who have become rigorous bargain hunters since the economic downturn and avid users of online stores and smartphones, which have delivered price transparency and one-click convenience.“Gone are the days of guaranteed margins and predictability,” said John Long, retail strategist at consultants Kurt Salmon. “The retailer is in much less control than they were before.”Ms Widlitz said: “Last year it was all about getting the consumer in your door and hoping that they’ll be loyal next year. But the reality is there is no loyalty.”Competition is intense as a growing number of analysts acknowledge that a weak economy and the rise of ecommerce have left the US with too many stores.Profit margins in retail are thin because barriers to entry in the sector are low and most retailers have limited ability to raise prices. At department stores, operating margins are typically between 6 and 12 per cent.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which compiles monthly sales figures, described the 2011 holiday season as “a modest success.”JC Penney, the department store group, reported a 0.3 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in December and forecast a larger quarterly loss than previously expected of between $0.45 and $0.30 per share.Kohl’s, a rival, said like-for-like sales fell 0.1 per cent in December and lowered its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter to $1.70-$1.73 per share from $1.93-$2.04.Profit forecasts, however, were not universally bleak. Macy’s raised its fourth quarter forecast to $1.55-$1.60 per share from $1.52-$1.57 as it reported a 6.2 per cent rise in December sales.Mr Long said another factor reshaping margin structures was the need for retailers to invest in being “ubiquitous”. He said that a Fifth Avenue store in New York, or a good-looking website, or a smartphone app were not, on their own, enough.“Retailers really need to take a hard look at the degree to which they are satisfying customers need to buy wherever they are.”
62;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-12-08T00:29:33Z;JC Penney takes $38m stake in Martha Stewart;;JC Penney, the US department store, has struck a $38m deal to take a stake in lossmaking Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, whose home and lifestyle products it will sell from branded units within its own stores.The deal is the first strategic move by Ron Johnson, who was recruited to lead JC Penney from Apple’s retail business and is seeking to reverse an unexpected loss in the past quarter by developing more distinctive products and stores.JC Penney said on Wednesday that it had paid $38.5m for a 16.6 per cent stake in Martha Stewart Living, a group whose eponymous founder became a symbol of American homemaking and cookery.But in a blow to Martha Stewart Living, Macy’s reacted to the deal by putting its selling of Martha Stewart products under review.JC Penney has struggled to compete with rivals such as Macy’s and Kohl’s as they acted faster to reverse a drift toward sameness in the sector by introducing exclusive designers and celebrity brands not available elsewhere.So far this year, Martha Stewart Living has reported a combined net loss of $19.7m. The group’s shares had fallen by 37 per cent since the start of January, but news of the deal triggered a 33.3 per cent surge on Wednesday that lifted them to $4.16.Martha Stewart Living said that over the 10-year period of the deal it expected to receive more than $200m from JC Penney, including design fees, advertising commitments and royalty payments.But Macy’s spoilt Martha Stewart’s celebrations by saying: “In light of the proliferation of Martha Stewart-branded product in the market place, Macy’s is reviewing the Martha Stewart products sold at Macy’s for potential changes in the future.”Shares in JC Penney, which will gain representation on the Martha Stewart board, closed up 0.6 per cent at $33.51.Mr Johnson, credited with creating Apple’s retail stores, became JC Penney’s chief executive last month. One of his first tasks was to report a $143m quarterly loss.He said on Wednesday: “The opportunity to work with Martha and create an entirely new shopping experience, both in-store and online, is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”Mr Johnson has already recruited two former Apple colleagues as senior JC Penney executives as well as a former colleague from Target, where Mr Johnson also worked.This year, Ms Stewart returned to the board of the company she founded, having been convicted in 2004 of lying to investigators about a stock sale and serving five months in prison. She later agreed to a five-year ban from serving as a director of a public company.The two companies said that trom February 2013 there will be “distinct Martha Stewart retail stores” inside the majority of JC Penney department stores.For Martha Stewart and other brand owners, stores-within-a-store combine the opportunity to broaden their distribution with an ability to maintain tight control over product presentation and face-to-face interaction with customers.Blackstone advised Martha Stewart Living and Peter J Solomon advised JC Penney.

Metal, mining and energy stocks soared on rising commodity prices, and hopes that monetary easing in China would offer support to the country’s resource-intensive construction industry.Steel stocks performed particularly strongly with Alpha Natural Resources, which mines metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, rising 28.2 per cent to $24.11, AK Steel Holding rose 16.8 per cent to $8.22 and US Steel climbed 24.9 per cent to $27.81.“The Policy accommodation may support Chinese steel consumption, reducing the chances of oversupply, which would depress prices and hurt US companies,” said Aldo Mazzaferro, a steel analyst at Macquarie.But other analysts said the rally had more to do with trading patterns than fundamentals.“Steel stocks are heavily short sold, and shorts are buying shares to cover their positions,” said David Lipschitz at Crédit Agricole Securities.Some energy stocks sat out the rally, as investors remained wary of companies carrying debt.Transocean fell 3.9 per cent to $42.76, after announcing plans to issue 29.9m new shares and raise up to $2.5bn in the corporate bond market, to refinance outstanding debt.Robin Shoemaker at Citigroup said the dilution effect could reduce earnings per share by as much as 55 cents to $3.85 in 2012.“We believe Transocean is partially financing with equity to meet near term liquidity obligations while trying to avoid losing its investment grade credit rating,” he told clients.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 9.5 per cent, led by Citigroup, which climbed 19.2 per cent to $28.17 and Morgan Stanley, up 17 per cent to $15.52.Hospital owners and medical device manufacturers had a tough day on Friday after Wells Fargo said Medicare carriers in 11 key states will perform pre-payment audits for inpatient hospital linked to certain cardiovascular and orthopaedic conditions from the start of the new year.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 10.7 per cent on Friday to end the week up just 0.2 per cent to $4.18. Device manufacturer St Jude Medical tumbled 7 per cent, to end the week up 3 per cent to $35.83.Western Digital Corporation rose 25.8 per cent to $31.44, hitting levels not seen since flooding forced the hard disk drive manufacturer to close production facilities in Thailand more than a month ago.The company raised its current quarter revenue forecast to at least $1.8bn from a previous maximum of $1.25bn, as supply chain pressure eased.Fertiliser companies underperformed broad markets, as concerns mounted that Indian farmers will import less nutrient.Mosaic and Potash Corporation suffered losses early in the week as Indian farming co-operatives pushed for discounts on potash imports of up to 35 per cent in dollar terms, to reflect rupee weakness.Mosaic ended the week up 3.8 per cent to $51.78 and Potash Corporation up 4 per cent to $42.29.CF Industries, which supplies India with nitrogen-based fertilisers, had fared better earlier in the week, but fell Friday to close the week up just 0.7 per cent to $140.73, as reports suggested Indian orders for urea declined significantly in November compared with October."
64;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-12-01T21:40:41Z;US stocks steady after strong rally;Yahoo rises on renewed takeover rumours;November sales data sent department store stocks spinning in different directions, though analysts were reasonably upbeat about overall trends.Kohl’s led fallers in the S&P 500, down 6.4 per cent to $50.37 after same-store sales came in 6.2 per cent lower than November 2010. It had been expecting a 2 per cent year-on-year rise, after it opened stores at midnight on Thanksgiving to draw in Black Friday discount hunters.Sears Holdings slumped 4.7 per cent to $57.48, on reports of weak Black Friday sales, and claims that its biggest shareholder, an investment fund linked to chairman Edward Lampert, has been selling shares.Discount department store rival Ross Stores climbed 3.6 per cent to $92.28 after year-on-year November same-store sales increased 5 per cent.“We’re still seeing year-on-year growth overall, but the holiday season is shaping up to be very competitive,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.“Companies are discounting to attract traffic, while the cost of inputs like cotton and Chinese wages are rising, and that’s going to continue to eat into gross margins.”Broad US indices dipped slightly, though they held on to most of their gains from a Fed-fuelled Wednesday. The S&P 500 was off 0.2 per cent to 1,2443.59, still up more than 7 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,020.03 but still in positive territory for the year following a 500 point gain on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend and rose 0.2 per cent to 2,626.2, helped by Google. Shares in the group rose 2.4 per cent to $613.77. Google was catching up with the market after sitting out Wednesday’s rally, but was also helped by reports it would launch an online shopping service with low delivery costs to rival Amazon’s Prime. That did not stop Amazon gaining 2.6 per cent to 197.35.Fertiliser producers continued to be volatile as the weak rupee increased tension between Indian consumers and North American producers.On Thursday Indian farming co-operatives threatened to cut potash imports after a Russian producer refused to consider discounts.Mosaic shares rose as much as 3 per cent in the morning session on hopes it would resist demands to discount as well. But shares ended flat at $52.77. PotashCorp also pared early gains to close up 0.4 per cent at $43.51.CF Industries rose 5.1 per cent to $146.98, for the best performance in the S&P 500. CF is more active in the nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser markets, where Indian customers have negotiated prices that take account of the weak rupee.Shares in wireless network provider Clearwire rose as much as 25 per cent before closing up 14 per cent at $2.03. Clearwire’s main customer, Sprint Nextel agreed to extend up to $1.6bn in conditional revenues and funding to allow the company to make a $237m interest payment.Sprint initially tumbled on the arrangement, but closed flat at $2.70.Yahoo climbed 3.3 per cent to $16.23 as investors appeared to grow more confident that a $16.50 per share takeover bid led by Silver Lake Partners might end the internet portal’s long-running takeover saga.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, more than any other sector, with investors remaining nervous about bank stocks.Citigroup fell 1.8 per cent to $26.66 and JPMorgan fell 1.7 per cent to $30.46, as they were named among five banks in a case brought by Massachusetts for foreclosure malpractice.But market watchers were struck by an overall lack of bearish sentiment.According to data from Birinyi and Associates, in the past two years a 3 per cent rally in the S&P 500 has almost invariably been followed by losses in early trading on the next trading day. “What’s interesting about this is that Wednesday’s huge moves haven’t attracted a massive wave of short selling or profit-taking,” Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, told clients.Netflix recovered from steep falls against the market on Wednesday, belatedly participating in the rally. Shares in the DVD delivery and video streaming website were up 4.1 per cent to $67.17.Lululemon Athletica fell 5.1 per cent to $47.17. The yoga and athletic clothing retailer disappointed with third-quarter results.Fibre optic maker Finisar slid 12.6 per cent to $16.12 after missing analyst estimates of earnings per share.
65;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-12-01T18:44:48Z;Winners and losers in Black Friday sales;;Strong shopping traffic over the Black Friday holiday weekend failed to provide a boost to all retailers, with November sales figures revealing a clear separation of winners and losers.Like-for-like sales across the sector increased by 3.2 per cent in November from a year ago, but some retailers reported declines, according to Retail Metrics, a research group. Bargain-hunting shoppers in the days after Thanksgiving account for between 20 and 30 per cent of most retailers’ November revenue.In spite of a strong Black Friday, shares in Barnes & Noble, the book retailer, plunged by 16 per cent on Thursday after its latest quarterly results revealed slowing revenue growth and a bigger-than-expected loss as it invests in its digital business to take on Amazon and Apple.Among department stores, Macy’s reported a 4.8 per cent rise in sales in November thanks partly to the buzz generated by its decision to open at midnight on the cusp of Black Friday. But sales at JC Penney, which stuck to a 4am opening, fell 2 per cent.No clear recipe for success emerged. Kohl’s, which also opened at midnight, reported a 6.2 per cent fall in sales, while sales at Nordstrom, which kept to normal openings hours and did not offer big discounts, grew by 5.6 per cent.“You still have the consumer dichotomy,” said Joel Bines of consultancy Alix Partners, referring to shoppers who split their spending between high-end luxuries and cut-price basics. “And within each retail segment you are seeing a separation of the winners and the losers.”Barnes & Noble said its sales grew by 11 per cent over the Black Friday weekend, compared with retail-wide growth estimates that ranged from 9 to 16 per cent.But investors were unnerved by a sharp slowdown in sales growth for its Nook e-reader business in the three months to October 29 – which preceded the November launch of its own tablet computer – as total sales slipped 0.6 per cent to $1.89bn.Barnes & Noble shares were down 16 per cent at $14.62 at midday in New York after Standard & Poors lowered its rating on the company to sell and other analysts said they were reviewing their sales and profit estimates.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said that the November sales figures for the sector suggested “a good, but not great, start to the holiday shopping season”.Gap, the clothing retailer, reported another weak performance in November as it struggles to revive its business, with like-for-like sales at Gap-branded stores in North America falling 2 per cent and the group’s international sales down 9 per cent.Megan Donadio, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, a consultancy, said: “The companies that have had negative [sales] have lost touch with their target consumer. They’re clearly not able to give consumers what they want.”
66;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-11-10T22:05:36Z;Wall Street edges up but banks still subdued;Cisco shares rise after beating analyst estimates;A rare bad day for Apple shares weighed on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500.Apple was down 2.6 per cent to $385.22 as rumours that the company is reducing production of iPads resurfaced.Reports that Apple had cut fourth-quarter orders to its China-based suppliers first emerged in late September but a note attributed to research firm CLSA, but not released, reignited chatter among analysts and investors on Thursday.Apple’s fall left the Nasdaq up just 0.1 per cent to 2,625.15.But after Wednesday’s sell-off, broader markets saw a bounce of sorts.The S&P 500 index was up more than 1 per cent in early trade as rumours that northern European leaders may sanction a eurozone break-up failed to gain momentum, even if they were not decisively quashed.The benchmark index closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,239.7, having fallen 3.7 per cent on Wednesday.All but two stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up as the blue chip index gained 1 per cent to 11,893.86, fighting back from its worst day in two months.“The bullish case is that a correction was needed because the run-up the last few weeks had been so good,” Randy Warren, principal at Warren Financial Service, said. “I’m quietly optimistic that we can rise steadily from here.”Government spending appeared to drive two of the best performers in the S&P 500. Cisco jumped 5.7 per cent to $18.61 as the world’s largest seller of networking equipment beat analyst estimates and its own guidance on earnings for the second quarter running.Public sector orders grew 10 per cent year-on-year and were up 5 per cent in the US with management noting an unexpected surge in US government orders.Cisco is now down just 8 per cent for the year as it makes strong progress on a corporate restructuring announced in March.Sprint was up 3.7 per cent to $2.84 on reports that the company is benefiting from a government subsidy for low-income mobile phone users. The Lifeline programme is said to be responsible for 50 per cent of subscriber growth at Sprint.But Computer Sciences, the IT outsourcing company that is heavily dependent on government contracts, continued to suffer from fears of a slowdown in federal spending. The stock fell 9.5 per cent to $25.24, leaving it down more than 20 per cent for the week after it slashed full-year guidance on Wednesday.One-off events drove forecast-beating quarterly earnings at Kohl’s and Viacom.Kohl’s, one of the five biggest US department-store chains by sales, said third-quarter profit rose 20 per cent to $211m, driven by the launch of a Jennifer Lopez range of clothing. Its shares were up 2 per cent to $55.36.Box office revenues of $1.12bn from the latest Transformers blockbuster helped Viacom’s film unit post a 46 per cent increase in revenue compared with the same quarter in 2010. Its shares were up 8.2 per cent to $43.61.Banks, which have tended to benefit the most from Europe-inspired rallies, were relatively subdued.A judge’s threat to block Citigroup’s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations of mis-selling mortgage-related products appeared to unsettle investors in those lenders still facing similar lawsuits.Citi fell 0.8 per cent to $28.63 and Bank of America was down 2.1 per cent to $6.03. BofA has reached a settlement with the SEC over its own mortgage selling practices but faces legacy lawsuits against its Merrill Lynch unit, which it acquired during the financial crisis.JPMorgan, whose mortgage selling settlements has been sanctioned, moved upwards with the broader market, gaining 0.6 per cent to $32.74.Jefferies, the investment bank under scrutiny because of its European exposures, was off 0.6 per cent to $11.11 and is down 8 per cent for the week after falling more than 10 per cent last week.That left the financial sector of the S&P 500 up just 0.6 per cent, easily bettered by cyclical energy and industrial stocks.Benefiting from a strengthening oil price were Cabot Oil & Gas, up 7.8 per cent to $86.55, Pioneer Natural Resources, up 6.7 per cent to $92.12, and Range Resources, up 5.2 per cent to $71.19.Healthcare group Merck rose 3.5 per cent to $34.97.
67;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-11-10T18:56:56Z;J-Lo range gives Kohl’s plenty to sing about;;Jennifer Lopez helped Kohl’s, the US department store, lift its sales and profits in the past quarter as shoppers were attracted by a new line of clothes and jewellery endorsed by the singer and actress.Department stores such as Kohl’s are signing deals to sell celebrity brands that are not available elsewhere as they struggle to maintain sales in the face of a slowdown in spending by middle-class customers.Kohl’s, a family-oriented chain not renowned for its glamour, reported a 20 per cent rise in net income to $211m from a year ago, while sales increased by 4 per cent to $4.4bn in the three months to October 29.Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chief executive, said the Jennifer Lopez brand – which launched in mid-September – had “met our very aggressive sales goals and exceeded the size of any previous brand launch by a substantial degree in sales”.Sears, the well-known but struggling department store chain, has an exclusive deal to sell a collection of clothes branded by the Kardashian sisters, the reality television stars.JC Penney, a Kohl’s rival, has exclusive brands from Cindy Crawford, the former supermodel, while Kmart has products from Selena Gomez, an actress and singer. Walmart, the mass market discounter, has a line from Miley Cyrus, a teenage celebrity.Ms Lopez, who was born in New York to Puerto Rican parents, is particularly popular among the US’s Hispanic population, which is increasingly being targeted as a growth market by retailers and consumer goods makers.Kohl’s pushed ahead with its launch of the products developed with Ms Lopez – also known as J-Lo – alongside a parallel set of goods branded by her husband, Marc Anthony, even though the couple announced in July that they would divorce after seven years of marriage.Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in Accenture’s retail practice, said that although retailers shared profits with their celebrity partners, it was cheaper to associate with them than to build a brand from scratch.But he added: “You see retailers working with a portfolio of celebrity brands because you mitigate the risk that … one gets in hot water.”Mr Donnelly said that carrying exclusive brands from celebrities or fashion designers was helping department stores to reverse a drift towards homogeneity.“There was an error in a lot of areas of retail where there was a tremendous sameness,” he said.
68;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US retail sales fall short of expectations;;US retail sales rose in October but growth decelerated and fell below market expectations as retailers head into a holiday shopping season of fragile sentiment and fierce competition.In spite of a weak economy, sales increased 3.8 per cent from a year ago to rack up a 26th successive monthly rise, according to Retail Metrics. But they fell below analyst forecasts of 4.4 per cent growth and below the 5 per cent-plus increases of the previous three months.Although spending has not collapsed, the US is entering the biggest shopping period of the year with consumer confidence plumbing depths last visited in the 2008-09 recession.Fifty four per cent of the retailers that report monthly sales fell short of expectations, among them both those that reported overall increases and declines.At Gap, the struggling fashion retailer, sales at North American stores open at least a year fell 6 per cent from a year ago while its group-wide sales were $1.14bn.JC Penney, the mid-market department store, also missed expectations with like-for-like sales that dropped 2.6 per cent.High-end department stores failed to live up to market hopes as well, as Saks reported a 1.8 per cent increase in sales and Nordstrom a 5.4 per cent gain.Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in Accenture’s retail practice, said: “When you consider all the other things battering consumers … the fact [they] are still spending at a healthy clip is encouraging.”He added: “Is it possible we’ll look back at October and say we saw a bit of pull back? Absolutely. But it’s also possible we’re seeing some variability in a month that is not typically the strongest.”Competition between retailers in the run-up to Christmas is likely to be especially tough as cash-strapped consumers confront high unemployment and a weak housing market.Macy’s, Target and Kohl’s this week said that for the first time they would open at midnight on the day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, when retailers traditionally kick off the holiday shopping season with big discounts.Holiday shoppers plan to spend less on gifts and seasonal merchandise this year than last: $704.18 versus $718.98, according to a National Retail Federation survey.But analysts say consumers typically spend more than they intended and the NRF is forecasting that retail sales in November and December will grow 2.8 per cent to $456bn.Steve Riordan, global managing partner of advisory services at PRGX Global, said: “There won’t be a holiday bump unless [consumers are] digging into savings or running up the credit card.”He added that consumer sentiment had become as volatile as financial markets: “We’re super excited one day and ready to jump off the cliff the next … It’s hard to make a decision as a consumer.”
69;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-10-12T20:54:46Z;Wall Street shrugs off Alcoa earnings miss;;The highly anticipated third-quarter earnings season got under way with a whimper when Alcoa’s shares sank in the wake of its disappointing results.The aluminium company fell 2.4 per cent to $10.05 after reporting earnings per share of 15 cents after the market closed on Tuesday, well below the average forecast of 22 cents from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.But the stock still remains slightly up for the week, with analysts blaming the results on foreign currency transactions rather than operating losses.“Translation adjustments accounted for a good portion of the miss,” Fraser Phillips, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets wrote to clients.“A weak result but not as bad as it looks,” he added.Analysts were also cheered that the company maintained its aluminium demand forecast for the year, with higher demand from China expected to offset weaker demand from Europe.PepsiCo was up 2.9 per cent to $62.70 after the beverage and snacks company reported sales growth even after raising prices to offset commodity costs.Earnings per share of $1.31 just beat the average forecast of analysts polled by Bloomberg.Host Hotels and Resorts, a real estate investment trust that invests in hotels, narrowed losses in the third quarter and predicted that it would almost break even for the year.Host posted a loss of $33m, or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of $58m, or 9 cents a share, in the same quarter last year, while lowering its full-year forecast loss to between 1 and 3 cents a share. Revenues have been boosted by a series of hotel acquisitions.Host rose 4.2 per cent to $62.70.“US corporate earnings continue to confound the market with their strength,” said Doug Cote, chief investment strategist at ING Investment Management.The S&P 500 moved above 1,200 for the first time this month, closing up 1 per cent 1,207.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 11,518.85, briefly straying into positive territory for the year in mid-afternoon, before closing a fraction in the red.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.8 per cent to 2,604.73.Traders are watching to see if the S&P 500 can break above 1,220, a level at which previous rallies this summer have broken down as investors booked profits.Networking equipment manufacturer Tellabs fell 5.3 per cent to $4.27, the biggest fall in the S&P 500 after its rival Adtran reduced guidance for fourth-quarter revenue.Adtran cited unexpectedly low demand from a main domestic client, which analysts believed to be mobile phone network AT&T.“Adtran’s guidance was a surprise, and I think Tellabs’ exposure to AT&T is definitely weighing on its share price,” said Blair King, an analyst at Avondale Partners. “There’s a concern that both Adtran and Tellabs might be left with a lot of unsold inventory.”Johnson Controls was up 5.2 per cent to $31.72 after the car parts manufacturer raised its full-year guidance to $44bn in sales and double-digit earnings growth.JC Penney was up 0.9 per cent to $30.23 after announcing the $288m capture of the Liz Claiborne and Monet fashion brands from Liz Claiborne Inc.Liz Claiborne shares were up 34.1 per cent to $6.84 after the company also announced the sale of its Kenzie brand to affiliates of brand management company Bluestar Alliance and the sale of its Dana Buchman brand to Kohl’s Corp.The Kenzie and Dana Buchman sales will net a further $40m. Kohl’s was up 0.6 per cent to $50.40 after the announcement.Sprint Nextel was up 7.6 per cent to $2.56 as optimism grew that the company may be able to raise capital required to roll out fourth-generation services and upgrade its network without issuing new equity and diluting existing shareholders.Genworth Financial was up 4.5 per cent to $5.87 on hopes that a European rescue package will forestall a spike in claims on its European consumer debt insurance product.Shares in Research In Motion were only down 2.2 per cent to $23.88, as service interruptions to its signature BlackBerry handsets began to impact on the stock price. RIM is still up 2.2 per cent for the week however.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 2.7 per cent, outperforming all other sectors, the day before JPMorgan kicks off the banks’ earning seasons. On Wednesday, Standard & Poor’s said analyst expectations of full-year earnings growth for the financials sector had ticked into negative territory for the first time, with earnings now expected to decline 1.4 per cent year on year for the sector.Citigroup was up 4.9 per cent to $29.20 and Wells Fargo was up 3.5 per cent to $26.95, as universal banks fared better than investment banks. Goldman Sachs was up 2.5 per cent to $99.11 and Morgan Stanley rose 2.9 per cent to $15.84. JPMorgan Chase was up 2.8 per cent to $33.20.
70;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-10-06T15:37:33Z;Back-to-school shopping lifts US retailers;;Back-to-school shopping and heavy discounting fuelled sales at US retailers in September, beating Wall Street’s expectations as consumers searched for deals in a turbulent economic environment.Sales rose 5.8 per cent at stores open at least a year, ahead of an estimated 4.9 per cent gain, according to Retail Metrics, the research firm.“The general disconnect between US retailers…and broader weakness in the global economy continued in September,” said Ken Perkins, Retail Metrics president. He noted that the labour market “continues to struggle to gain job-building momentum”, citing Thursday’s report that weekly jobless claims rose back above 400,000. The government is due to report on September job creation and unemployment on Friday.As the stock market has taken a wild ride, driven by concerns over the eurozone debt crisis and fears that US growth may remain in low gear, consumers have been more pessimistic about economic conditions.Despite those worries, shoppers flocked to discounters like Target and Costco, and department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s to stock up for the new school year.Target sales rose 5.3 per cent from a year ago, the company’s biggest single monthly increase outside of the Easter holiday since before the recession, Mr Perkins noted. That beat an expected 3.9 per cent rise. Costco, the membership-based discounter, posted a 12 per cent gain compared with a forecast 9.9 per cent rise.Kohl’s recorded a 4.1 per cent gain, compared with a forecast of 2 per cent, helped by aggressive promotions. Sales at Macy’s were up 4.9 per cent, compared with an expected 4.4 per cent, a performance that chief executive Terry Lundgren said “underscores that our business remains on track, despite the persistently negative macroeconomic news”.With Americans watching their wallets more closely, retailers “who have figured out how to do business with the consumer in these economic times” are succeeding, said Mike Brown, a vice-president at AT Kearney, the consultancy. “We are looking at strong performance from retailers who are offering the consumer great value.”He pointed to luxury retailer Saks, which posted a 9.3 per cent sales rise compared with an expected 6.2 per cent gain, saying that stores which sell high-end products that people feel they “have to have” continue to do well despite the rocky economy.Other department stores were not so successful, however. Bon Ton Stores sales fell 3.6 per cent while JC Penney was down 0.6 per cent, both missing expectations. Following the disappointing sales data, JC Penney cut its forecast for third-quarter earnings to 10 to 15 cents a share from about 25 cents a share, and said it expected sales growth in the July to September quarter to be flat.Clothing retailers reported mixed results. Sales at Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath and Body Works, jumped 11 per cent compared with an expected 3.9 per cent rise. But Gap sales dropped a greater-than-expected 4 per cent.“While there were some bright spots across our brands and business units, we’re clear and focused on the steps necessary to improve our business performance going forward,” said Glenn Murphy, chief executive of Limited Brands.Hurricane Irene, which brought record flooding and damage to the east coast at the end of August, was likely to have affected shopping patterns last month, said Michael McNamara, head of MasterCard Advisors Spending Pulse, which tracks US retail sales. He said store closings over the final weekend of August pushed some back-to-school shopping into September and also boosted sales at hardware suppliers as homeowners repaired damaged houses.
71;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-08-30T14:48:26Z;Retail shares buffeted in Irene’s aftermath;;The S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since August 4, despite poor consumer confidence data and a rough day for department stores.Retail stocks were volatile as analysts picked winners and losers from Hurricane Irene.Kohl’s was down 2.2 per cent to $46.63 and JC Penney shares were off 1.8 per cent at $26.97.“We believe the department stores were negatively impacted by the hurricane as consumers stocked up on consumables ahead of the storm, rather than focusing on back-to-school items,” Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, told clients.That also hurt Staples, the stationery retailer, which was down 1.7 per cent to $14.60.But Edward Kelly said drug stores probably experienced heavy traffic in preparation for Hurricane Irene. CVS Caremark was up 0.6 per cent 35.76, although shares in Walgreen and Rite Aid were both flat.Overall, consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 were up 0.4 per cent, outperforming consumer staples stocks by 0.2 per cent in what is normally a sign of heightened expectations for economic growth.But it was hard to discern that much confidence from retail movers, with defensive stock, discount store Family Dollar, the biggest retail riser, up 4.2 per cent at $51.06.Randal Konik, retail analyst at Jefferies, said he was cautious about calling a strong rally in retail.“But it is hard to recommend going short on many [retail] stocks, simply because expectations for the back end of the year have already been downgraded and a lot of bad news priced in.”Overall, the S&P 500 index was up 0.2 per cent at 1,212.89, its third consecutive day of gains rise, ending the day above 1,200 for the second day running.Although stocks have bounced back from lows, previous rallies this month have fallen back after 1,200, and traders were relieved that the latest rally had not shrivelled.“The next stop is whether there is a major breakdown at 1,250. I think there will be major resistance if we get there,” said Paul Zemsky, head of multi-asset strategies at ING.The rally was again based on light trading volumes. Aggregate volume in US markets on Monday was the second lowest this month. Only Monday’s aggregate level had been lower.Monster Worldwide, which operates the job-search site Monster.com, led gainers, jumping 21.5 per cent to $9.91, after SEC filings revealed three executives had exercised options to buy more than 85,000 shares shares between them.The shares were purchased at $8.17, one cent higher than Monday’s closing price. Monster shares had hit a 28-month low of $7.00 on Friday.PulteGroup, the homebuilder, was up 7.1 per cent at $4.95 after better-than-expected house price figures. The Case-Schiller home price index was down only 0.1 per cent month on month in June.Pulte’s share price – an indicator of confidence in the construction sector – had briefly topped $5 for the first time since August 5.Insurers fell as financial stocks in the S&P 500 dropped 0.8 per cent, one of only two sectors to fall on the day. Hartford was off 0.3 per cent to $19.26, a partial correction to a strong rally on Monday, when Hartford had gained 10 per cent on relief that insurance companies would not have to make big pay-outs after Hurricane Irene inflicted less damage than expected.Bank of America shares dropped 3.2 per cent to $8.12. But the stock remains strongly up on the week after the shares rose 8 per cent on Monday on news of the $8.3bn sale of a 5 per cent stake in China Construction Bank.On Tuesday, analysts weighed in positively on the deal. Baird estimated that, when combined with other recent disposals, the CCB sale would increase BofA’s Basel I tier one capital, an important tool regulators use to measure the financial strength of banks, by 50 basis points to 8.75 per cent.Regional bank First Horizon was down 4.1 per cent at $6.99.Alpha Natural Resources was down 2.6 per cent at $34.02. JPMorgan initiated coverage on the coal supplier, giving it a neutral rating. But the stock was also retreating from the $35 mark that it reached yesterday, a level at which the stock has faced resistance all month.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent at 2,576.11, despite shares in NuPathe falling 34.6 per cent to $2.65. At one point, NuPathe stock had lost more than half its value after the company failed to win regulatory approval for the first skin patch to treat migraines. The Food and Drug Administration asked for more information.The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was tracking up 0.2 per cent to 11,559.64, closely following the S&P 500.
72;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-08-12T20:54:54Z;US stocks end week on a high note;;US stocks ended an historically volatile week on a high note, paring their losses from Monday’s session, which saw the biggest one-day drop in share prices since 2008.In focus on Friday were retail groups, which gained initially on strong earnings and macroeconomic data. But those gains were cut when the University of Michigan consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly sharply, to its lowest in three decades.Nordstrom, which was up as much as 7 per cent at the opening bell, was up 4.6 per cent to $44.27 at midday on Friday. The high-end goods retailer topped earnings forecasts and brought its full-year profits projection back to where it began the year, after lowering it earlier. Polo Ralph Lauren, which reported strong earnings earlier this week, was up 5.5 per cent on Friday to $137.70.Kohl’s, the department store chain, also beat forecasts and opened higher, jumping 5 per cent. However, executives said they “weren’t happy” with their sales, and the stock ended just 0.1 per cent higher on Friday, at $47.54.It was reported on Friday that US headline retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in July, while June’s increase was revised from 0.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent, with notable improvements in electronics goods sales that do not simply reflect rising gas and food prices.“The consumer is at the centre of the weak economy debate,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. “Even a modestly better than expected number provides us with some level of relief.”By the closing bell on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent to 1,178.80, with industrials and consumer groups advancing, but financials declining.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent higher at 11,269.40, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.6 per cent to 2,507.98.The S&P 500, despite extraordinary volatility– the index moved 50 points each session from Monday to Thursday for the first time – lost just 1.8 per cent this week, and the Dow just 1.6 per cent.That pales in comparison with last week’s S&P decline of more than 7 per cent, the market’s worst five days in two years. The index is down 6.3 per cent on the year.But buyers began to emerge as the week wore on. Factors in their favour included resistance to falling below 1,100 points on the S&P 500 index, as well as some timely and unexpected economic data, such as a fall in jobless claims.There were also tempting bargains such as Apple, which at one point fell into “correction” territory, down more than 10 per cent from the year’s peak price. Apple was up 0.9 per cent on the week to $376.99. The biggest gainer on the week, MEMC Electronic Materials, maker of solar panel wafers, was rebounding from its lowest price since the dotcom bust in 2002. It added 17.8 per cent to $6.53.Financial groups were the worst performers of the week, haunted by concerns ranging from a slowing economy to spillover effects from European bank troubles and the impact of near-zero yields on their deposits. The KBW Banks index fell 8.9 per cent on the week, adding to its 10 per cent decline the previous week.Bank of America, fell 12 per cent over the week, bouncing back somewhat from a 20 per cent drop on Monday. It was the worst performer in the Dow, however, and was trading at $7.19 on Friday – below the $8 level for the first time since early 2009.Citigroup fell 10.7 per cent on the week, to $29.85. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were among the better performers, with analysts citing them as potentially better able to weather the storm, falling 4.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively.Despite the rout, analysts continued to recommend that investors buy or hold their shares. “We struggle to find the source of another US banking crisis: liquidity is high, capital is high and changes in asset prices are more subdued,” said Brian Foran at Nomura.“The big risk, we believe, is re-rating for limited growth and low rates,” he added, terming it “the ‘Japan-isation’ of US banks.”Stocks that offered dividend yields higher than Treasuries did well on the week. Mortgage-buying real estate investment trusts, which return their cash flows directly to investors, were up for the week. Annaly Capital Management added 2 per cent to $17.88, and Capstead Mortgage rose 5.6 per cent to $12.90.Materials was the only sector to rise this week, up 0.2 per cent, amid expectations that it would benefit from higher commodity prices – which many believe the Fed’s low rates could bring. CF Industries, the fertiliser group, added 14.7 per cent to $168.20 on the week. Newmont Mining, the gold miner, added 5.6 per cent to $57.44.News Corp, the media group headed by Rupert Murdoch, jumped 10.6 per cent on the week to $16.23, after it promised share buy-backs and Mr Murdoch said he would remain in charge. Analysts at Citigroup recommended selling the stock, citing how much it had risen.
73;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-08-04T20:58:57Z;Wall Street tumbles on economic concerns;;US stocks tumbled to their worst one-day losses for more than two years with industrial and energy stocks leading the declines as a surge in the dollar raised fears that exporters would be hit by higher costs.All three major US indices entered correction territory, meaning they were more than 10 per cent lower that their 2011 highs. The benchmark S&P 500 retreated 4.7 per cent on Thursday to 1,200.24 at the closing bell. It was the worst session since February 2009.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in more than two years, falling more than 500 points or 4.3 per cent to 11,383.83, while the Nasdaq Composite was off 5.1 per cent to 2,556.39, its worst session since January 2009.The CBOE Volatility index or Vix, popularly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge“, jumped to its highest level since March, up 29.64 per cent on the session to more than 30.The S&P energy sector fell 6.8 per cent, materials lost 6.7 per cent and industrials were down 5.4 per cent, all hit by the rising dollar and weakening market sentiment.Alcoa was the Dow’s biggest faller at the close, retreating 9.2 per cent to $12.94, while Caterpillar was 7 per cent lower at $89.55.In the energy sector, which reached its lowest level since March, the US oil majors were hit hard.ExxonMobil fell 5 per cent to $73.84, ConocoPhillips was down 5.2 per cent to $66.92 and Chevron lost 5.8 per cent to $96.84.Alpha Natural Resources reported a $56.4m second-quarter loss, much of which was due to takeover-related costs after acquiring Massey Energy for $7.1bn in June. Its shares dropped 17 per cent to $33.24.In addition to concerns about global economic growth and currency stability, weekly US initial jobless claims weighed on sentiment, with the 400,000 figure less than the 405,000 that was forecast.Wall Street was also anticipating Friday’s nonfarm payroll report for July, one of the most important economic indicators, which has disappointed in the last two months“Having been burned badly the last two months, it appears that this time a lot of traders have been exiting positions and going to the sidelines ahead of the US non-farm payrolls report,” analysts at CMC Markets said. “This suggests that unlike the last two months where pre-announcement euphoria ended up being crushed, the resignation and despondency seen today could set the table for a positive surprise.”Kraft was one of the few bright spots, leading the Dow after news that the US food company would split into two divisions.As well as reporting forecast-beating results, the maker of macaroni and cheese, Oreos and Kool Aid said it would spin-off its grocery business from the faster-growing snack business. Its shares were 1.5 per cent lower at $33.78.Among retailers, individual July same-store sales figures were mixed but sent the S&P retail sector 4.9 per cent lower.As a whole, the Retail Metrics July same-store sales index rose 5 per cent, with 58 per cent of retailers beating forecasts. “Retailers catering to higher-end consumers outperformed once again in July,” the report said.But mid-level department store group Kohl’s, which was expected to miss sales expectations, fell 7.9 per cent to $47.67.Shares in Gap, the clothing store, fell 11.6 per cent to $16.98, one of the worst-hit retailers of the session. Shares in the troubled retailer have fallen nearly 30 per cent from its 2011 high.Costco, the discount retailer, reported a 15 per cent bump in sales against a similar period last year, registering net sales of $6.4bn. Gasoline inflation and foreign exchange rates both worked in the chain’s favour, Citigroup analysts noted. Its shares were off just 0.7 per cent to $76.51.Limited Brands also reported strong sales and boosted its outlook for the second quarter, which left its stock 1.27 per cent lower at $35.84. The company, whose brands include Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said same-store sales rose 6 per cent over 2010, beating analysts’ expectations.Elsewhere among the earnings reports, General Motors said its quarterly profit nearly doubled to $2.5bn on strong North American and Asian sales. Earnings per share in the carmaker were $1.54, beating analysts’ expectations.“We believe this quarter should begin to revive momentum around the GM story,” Citigroup analysts said. “Recent market share gains, resilient pricing and now a high-quality quarter are all occurring ahead of GM’s major North America product cycle.”But the strong earnings did little to boost GM shares, which fell 4.3 per cent to $25.99. Its domestic competitor, Ford, was down 6.8 per cent to $10.86.DirecTV, the US satellite broadcaster, reported that net income rose to $701m, or 91 cents a share, but its market share shrunk, adding just 26,000 US subscribers. Its shares dropped 5.7 per cent to $46.63.A key concern is that DirecTV’s model is “structurally flawed vs the cable operators”, analysts at Collins Stewart noted. They were optimistic about the outlook because “DirecTV has been able to withstand the crippling US recession and housing crises because of its premium brand and superior service.”
74;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-08-04T14:47:53Z;Heatwave boosts July US retail sales;;US retail sales rose 5 per cent in July from a year ago thanks to deep discounting and hot weather, but growth decelerated from the previous month against the backdrop of a weak economy.Sales at stores open at least a year rose ahead of expectations for the seventh consecutive month, according to Retail Metrics, which tracks 25 retailers that are estimated to account for between 20 and 30 per cent of total retail spending.The year-on-year growth was down from 7.2 per cent in June. July is typically a transitional month in which retailers offer big discounts to clear out summer merchandise and make room for back-to-school and autumn goods.“Heatwaves and high temperatures drove many shoppers to air-conditioned malls, which gave a nice boost,” said Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics.Some analysts cautioned that the sales jump gave a misleadingly positive impression because it was explained partly by higher ticket prices linked to commodity inflation and did not necessarily signal consumers were buying more units than last year.Underlining the strength of the wealthiest Americans, the best performing retailer was Saks, the high-end department store, which reported a 15.6 per cent rise in sales.Gap, the mid-market retailer struggling with its fashion and branding, posted a 5 per cent fall in sales following a gain of 1 per cent in June.The biggest negative surprise came from Kohl’s, a mid-price department store, where sales dropped 4.6 per cent.
75;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-07-07T21:10:11Z;Wall Street boosted by employment data;;Wall Street bounced higher after US employment data surpassed expectations and a number of retailers reported strong same-store sales, helping the markets to shake off the malaise of the last few days.Target, the discount retailer, was one of the best performing stock on the S&P 500, adding 6.7 per cent to $51.67 after reporting a 4.5 per cent rise in June same store sales, which was at the top end of its projected range.Elsewhere, Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, rose 2.7 per cent to $40.35 as same-store sales jumped 12 per cent last month, easily topping the 3.8 per cent expected by analysts.Hot Topic, the teen retailer, was up 13.2 per cent to $8.40 while Kohl’s added 7 per cent to $55.78 after also reporting healthy sales numbers.Urban Outfitters was up 6 per cent to $32.58, helped by a ratings upgrade.This raft of strong news left the S&P retail sector up 2.4 per cent, while the S&P consumer discretionary sector climbed 1.3 per cent, one of the best performing major indices in the session.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 index was up 1.1 per cent to 1,353.22, the first substantial rise in a mostly flat week, led by the financial, industrial, technology as well as the consumer discretionary sectors as strong employment data prompted a “risk on” trade on Wall Street.Sentiment was boosted by news that the Automatic Data Processing number on employment had come in better than expected. The survey found that 157,000 private jobs had been added to the US economy in June, which was ahead of the 95,000 that had been forecast by economists.This raised hopes that the crucial non-farm employment data on Friday, which is closely watched by the markets as an indicator of the strength of the US economy, would come in strong as well. Analysts upgraded their expectations for non-farm payrolls following the ADP figure.Separately, labor department figures showed that the number of people claiming for unemployment benefits slipped 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 418,000 last week, which was better than the 420,000 reading economists had expected.This healthy data added weight to the bullish argument that the last few months of weak economic data – which left the markets down 7.2 per cent from the start of May to the middle of June – was just a summer “slow patch” from which the US economy would recover.“The recent ISM data, the same store sales figures and the ADP report all bolsters the case that the soft patch was indeed just a temporary blip,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist with ING Investment Management.Hopes that the US economic recovery would begin to accelerate again helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.7 per cent to 12,719.57.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.4 per cent to 2,872.66, closing just a fraction away from a fresh decade-long high.Financial stocks were the best performing of the session as risk appetite improved and traders positioned themselves for a healthy official jobs report on Friday.JP Morgan Chase was one of the best performing financial stocks, adding 1.9 per cent to $41.32 as its private investment arm, One Equity Partners, agreed to buy APAC Customer Services, an outsourced services company, for $470m.Shares in APAC were up 55.2 per cent to $8.44.In other news, NYSE Euronext was up 3 per cent to $35.40 after its shareholders voted to approve the proposed tie up with Deutsche Börse, clearing the first of many hurdles in the merger process.The energy and materials sector were also up in the session as commodity prices ticked higher. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.7 per cent to $55.49 while Halliburton added 3.1 per cent to $54.30.The S&P materials index was up 1.5 per cent while the energy index added 1.4 per cent.The technology sector also benefited from the “risk on“ trade, adding 1.1 per cent. The sector was led by KLA Tencor, a semiconductor equipment maker, which was up 7 per cent to $42.53, bouncing back to its 50-day moving average line.Utility, healthcare and telecommunication stocks were among the worst performing as investors rotated out of defensive sectors.Pfizer was down 2.7 per cent to $20.23, leading the losses in the healthcare sector, as the drugmaker said it was considering spinning off its animal health and nutritional unit to focus on the pharmaceutical business.The S&P utility sector was up 0.4 per cent, while the telecom and healthcare indices were flat.In other news, News Corp saw high volume trading after the media group closed one of its popular British newspapers amidst a furore over phone hacking, but the stock was only down 0.2 per cent to $17.43.
76;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-05-12T21:05:14Z;Upbeat jobs figures lift Wall Street;;Cisco Systems lost ground after issuing a profit warning, while the wider markets edged higher after broadly positive economic data and firmer commodity prices helped to lift investor sentiment.Shares in Cisco fell 4.8 per cent to $16.93 after the world’s largest producer of networking gear by revenues announced that its sales and profits in the current quarter would come in below expectations.The company also reported that its net income had fallen 18 per cent in its last quarter to $1.8bn, or 42 cents a share. This was broadly in line with expectations.News of the profit warning weighed on related technology stocks. Motorola Mobility fell 1.1 per cent to $24.98 while Harrislost 1.4 per cent to $48.29. The S&P technology equipment sector was down 0.7 per cent, although in the broader tech sector most stocks were up.Looking at the wider markets, the S&P 500 index closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,348.65, paring some of the 1.1 per cent losses in the previous session, with sentiment helped by upbeat employment data.Figures from the Labor Department showed that 44,000 fewer Americans applied for unemployment insurance last week.The number of new claims fell to 434,000, which was a bigger drop than had been expected and was the steepest fall since February 2010.It also reversed much of the sharp increase in claims in the previous week. But other data in the session were less positive, showing that the higher oil and food costs were hitting retail spending and lifting producer prices.The 0.5 per cent rise in retail sales in April and the 0.8 per cent rise in inflation were both slightly worse than the markets had been expecting.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,696.14 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.6 per cent to 2,863.04.The energy sectors were again lower in the session, as traders remained uneasy following the recent volatility in the oil markets.Within the energy sector Murphy Oil fell 1.3 per cent to $66.63 while ConocoPhillips declined 1.4 per cent to $71.53. The broader S&P energy sector closed down only 0.1 per cent, however, after the oil priced edged a little higher. The S&P energy sector has fallen 7.2 per cent this month.Consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks saw some of the biggest gains in a possible sign that some stocks are beginning to benefit from the recent drop in oil prices.Among the stocks to gain in these sectors, Tyson Foods was up 4.6 per cent to $18.84 while Mead Johnson added 2.1 per cent to $67.72. Best Buy rose 4.1 per cent to $31.69.The S&P consumer discretionary index was up 0.9 per cent and the consumer stable index added 1.3 per cent.The financial sector was one of the worst performing of the session, led by Goldman Sachs. Shares in the investment bank were down 3.5 per cent to $142.1 after pair of analyst notes downgraded the stock, warning investors that Goldman could still face charges from the US Justice Department for its behaviour during the financial crisis.Citigroup fell 1.2 per cent to $42.42, adding to the 5 per cent losses already this week after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split on Monday. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.The S&P financial index was down 0.1, recovering from sharper losses earlier in the session as the afternoon continued.Elsewhere, shares in First Solar rose 6.3 per cent to $132.07, the best performing stock on the S&P 500 index, after the maker of thin-film solar modules received letters indicating support from the US Energy Department for three projects in California.Shares in Symantec added 5.2 per cent to $20.42 after the maker of security software reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 38 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate by 2 cents.VeriSign, the company best known for the management of internet domain names, was up 3.2 per cent to $36.68 after saying that it had resolved a lawsuit.Clearwire, a wireless broadband provider, fell 15.6 per cent to $3.99 after Intel said that it would sell 10m shares in the company.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Kohl’s added 3.9 per cent to $55.68 after the retailer reported a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast for the year.
77;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-04-07T19:08:44Z;Luxury US brands enjoy sales boost;;"Luxury and specialist brands such as Victoria’s Secret enjoyed an uptick in US retail spending in March, while middle-market retailers led by Gap suffered as consumers grew in confidence but shopped selectively.Retail sales grew by about 2 per cent year on year as the impact of high fuel prices and worries over crises in the Arab world and Japan were offset by an improving US labour market.But while Victoria’s Secret, a lingerie chain owned by Limited Brands, reported sales up 19 per cent at stores open a year or more, sales for Gap in North America fell by 9 per cent.“It is not a rising tide that lifts all ships,” said Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “The consumer is discerning. The more premium products and brands seem to be faring better; the less-prestigious brands and the lower-priced products are not faring so well.”Gap’s woes were exacerbated by an effort to revamp its product line-up and marketing, which the company acknowledged have been problematic. It shook up its management in February, including the appointment of a new creative director.Luxury department stores also reported strong figures, with sales up 11.1 per cent at Saks and 8.8 per cent higher at Neiman Marcus. Sales at Nordstrom, an upmarket fashion store, rose 5.1 per cent.“The retailers have to be happy with how things shaped up this month. The consumers have been resilient,” said Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics. “What was underestimated was the improving jobs picture over the past several months, which is giving consumers more confidence to spend.”In March, the US economy generated a stronger-than-expected 216,000 jobs, the second consecutive month of growth.But on the divergence in retailers’ fortunes, Mr Perkins said: “Strong performers are gaining strength and the weaker ones not.”Among mid-market and low-end department stores, sales were down 1 per cent at Dillards and 6.5 per cent at Kohl’s. Target, a discount retailer, reported a 5.5 per cent fall.Headline figures from Retail Metrics showed retail sales up 2.2 per cent in March while the International Council of Shopping Centers reported a 2 per cent gain.The growth was down from an expansion of 4 per cent in February, but would have been higher had it not been for distortions stemming from the late timing of Easter this year.Many Americans buy clothes in a new season splurge in the weeks leading up to the Easter break. With Easter Sunday falling on April 4 last year, March caught a large chunk of that shopping. But with the holiday this year on April 24, it had no impact last month.Sherif Mityas, a partner in the retail practice at AT Kearney, a management consultancy, said: “People need to be encouraged but still cautious, because there are a lot of pressures.“Unemployment is better, but there are still a lot of people out of work. Inflationary pressures are rising and at some point those costs are going to need to be passed on.”"
78;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-03-03T19:02:53Z;US retailers report robust February sales;;US consumers returned to shopping malls in February, shrugging off harsh winter weather and demonstrating a renewed willingness to spend.Sales at large US retailers were stronger than analysts had expected, with luxury chains and department stores leading the way and robust demand at merchants such as Saks and Nordstrom.The 4.3 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales surpassed the 3.8 per cent advance that was projected and was stronger than last year’s increase, according to data from Retail Metrics.“February 2011 will go down as a month where improved consumer sentiment, tax refunds in hand and stimulus in pay cheques created a spark in the minds of consumers to buy discretionary goods and not be so stringent on the type and amount of daily necessities bought,” said Brian Sozzi, a retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies.Same-store sales at Saks rose 15.3 per cent on the back of greater demand for women’s apparel, men’s apparel, shoes, handbags, fashion jewellery, cosmetics and fragrances.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie chain, benefited as purchases heated up around Valentine’s day and it reported a 12 per cent increase in comparable store sales.Meanwhile, Macy’s sales were up 5.8 per cent thanks in part to a surge in online shoppers.“Consumer reaction to new spring merchandise has been encouraging,” said Terry Lundgren, Macy’s chief executive.February tends to be a weaker month for retailers. However, last month was an exception for many after a stormy January held shoppers back.But in spite of rising sales, signs of inflation could create a spring lull, as consumers are forced to spend disposable income on more expensive food and fuel.“We’re starting to see inflation flow through at this point,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.“The question is how much will consumers be able to take in terms of price increases before they stop buying.”On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said that retailers in many parts of the US were implementing price increases or planning to do so in the next few months.Analysts argue that rising petrol prices have a two-month lag before they have a negative impact on retail sales, potentially posing a problem in May and June.So far, high-end and discount stores have fared the best, while mid-range retailers such as Gap, Kohl’s and Dillard’s have experienced slower sales.David Bassuk, head of the retail practice at AlixPartners, a consultancy, said that consumers at high-end chains have been helped by a wealth effect from elevated stock prices and discounters have benefited from the ability to offer aggressive promotion schemes.“We see it as the hour glass effect, where the ones at the top and bottom are finding their place, but those in the middle are squeezed,” Mr Bassuk said.
79;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-02-25T00:18:57Z;Retailer results show US consumer caution;;Results from US retailers show that consumers remain cautious with their purchases amid a fragile economic recovery and growing signs of inflation.Target, the discount retailer, said on Thursday that its fourth-quarter profits grew on the strength of a successful holiday shopping season and its improving credit card business.Kathy Tesija, head of merchandising, told analysts Target shoppers remain cautious and focused on lower-end products and groceries.“Guests are telling us that they are still risk averse, they’re concerned about losing their jobs and focused on controlling household budgets, leading to increased coupon use and a focus on promotions,” she said.A surge in profits in its credit card business gave Target a boost, as customers took advantage of a new rewards programme. The unit reported $151m in income during the fourth quarter, up from $39m in the same period a year earlier, and Target’s bad debt expenses fell from $284m in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $83m in the latest quarter.Net income rose by 10.5 per cent to $1.035bn, or $1.45 a share, up from $936m, or $1.24, in the same period a year ago. Target’s revenues grew by 2.8 per cent to $20.3bn during the final three months of last year.Comparable store sales, which rose by 2.4 per cent, surpassed those of its larger rival Walmart, which earlier this week reported its seventh consecutive quarterly same-store sales decline. Signs of consumer caution were also evident in Sears’ earnings, as shoppers steered toward lower-end discount products.Profits at Sears fell by 13.4 per cent to $374m, or $3.43 per share, with comparable store sales at the US retailer falling by 1.2 per cent. But at Kmart, its discount branch, sales picked up by 2.5 per cent.At Kohl’s, the department store chain, shoppers over the age of 60 will soon be eligible to receive special discounts in an effort to offset rising clothing prices.“Apparel inflation is clearly real, but we believe we have had the time, the tools and the processes to work through it effectively and have a competitive advantage for both us and our consumer,” said Kevin Mansell, chief executive of Kohl’s, as the company reported a 14 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits.Meanwhile, comparable store sales at Gap, the clothing company, were flat during the final three months of last year. However, fourth-quarter profits rose by 4 per cent to $365m, or 60 cents a share and Gap announced an increase to its 2011 dividend.
80;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-02-24T15:22:10Z;Year of ‘foundation building’ takes toll on GM earnings;;General Motors lost ground after quarterly earnings figures disappointed investors, while the wider markets hovered in neutral territory as positive sentiment created by healthy employment data were negated by the continuing unrest in north Africa.The carmaker reported its best yearly earnings figure in more than a decade and the first profitable year since 2004. But fourth-quarter profits came in at $510m, or 31 cents a share, which was below expectations.Daniel Akerson, chief executive of GM, said that 2010 had been a year of “foundation building”. Shares in GM were down 4.5 per cent to $33.02, while rival Ford Motor lost 1.1 per cent to $14.70.In the wider markets, sentiment was lifted by promising weekly unemployment data. The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped by 22,000 to 391,000 last week, ahead of the 5,000 fall expected by most economists.The more stable four-week moving average of new claims dropped 16,500 to 402,000 in the week, which is the lowest level since July 2008 and provides hope that the US jobs market is recovering.But investors continued to worry about the violence in Libya and the disruptions that this is causing to oil supply, fearing that sustained high oil prices could slow down the domestic economic recovery.Oil prices fell back slightly late in the day – helped by rumours on the trading floor that Muammer Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, had been shot – which took some pressure off equities.This left the S&P 500 down 0.1 per cent to 1,306.10. The index has lost 2.8 per cent this week already on geopolitical concerns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent to 12,068.50, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent at 2,737.90.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, fell back 5.1 per cent in the session although it is still up nearly 30 per cent over the week.The retail sector suffered from a mixed batch of earnings reports from key industry players.Sears Holdings tumbled lower after the retailer said that profits had fallen by 13 per cent in the fourth quarter after same-store sales declined during the holiday period. That sent shares down 5.5 per cent to $82.40, the sharpest one-day fall in six months. On Wednesday, the company announced a new chief executive after a three-year search. The stock is down 11.4 per cent over the week.Elsewhere in the sector, Target reported higher same-store sales and fourth-quarter earnings. The discount retailer said that net income had risen 10.5 per cent to $1.035bn, or $1.45 a share, on the strength of a successful holiday shopping season and its improving credit card business.Comparable store sales at Target increased 2.4 per cent, helping shares climb 3.5 per cent to $52.Earlier this week rival discount retailer Walmart reported its seventh consecutive quarterly same-store sales decline.Kohl’s, the department store chain, reported a 14 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profits but gave a 2011 earnings forecast that fell short of expectations. Still, shares were up 3.4 per cent to $53.80.Not all the economic data of the session was as positive as the employment numbers.Durable goods data showed a strong 2.7 per cent increase in orders by businesses, a sign of confidence in the recovery. But most of this was down to a spike in aircraft orders. New orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft, declined 6.9 per cent in January, according to the Commerce Department.Sales of new homes also tumbled last month, damping hopes of a speedy housing market recovery. New single-family home sales fell by 12.6 per cent in January from the previous month, worse than the 8.8 per cent decline predicted by economists.Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific equipment, was up 1.7 per cent to $41.15 after lifting its full-year 2011 earnings forecast to as much as $2.63 a share, exceeding analysts’ average estimate of $2.51 a share.E-Trade Financial, the online bank and brokerage house, was down 4.8 per cent to $15.85 on reports that Citadel Investment Group, a major shareholder in E-Trade, was planning to sell most its shares.Priceline.com, the online travel company, ticked 8.5 per cent higher at $462.34 after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits and a rise in bookings.
81;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2011-02-04T05:01:29Z;US retailers beat bad weather;;US shoppers continued to step up their spending during January, shrugging off extreme winter weather, higher fuel prices and continuing high unemployment levels.Monthly sales data from leading US retailers released on Thursday showed stronger-than-expected gains, with the Retail Metrics’ index of comparable sales growth up 4.4 per cent against the same quarter a year earlier.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said that “with signs the economy may be turning a corner here, retailers carried some of holiday 2010’s sales’ momentum into the new year”. But he warned that “retailers and consumers are still facing some headwinds from a languishing housing market, as well as 9.4 per cent unemployment”.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the sales gain was “encouraging …and suggests relatively healthy underlying consumer demand”.The increasingly buoyant consumer mood was also reflected by SpendingPulse, the monthly survey from MasterCard Advisors, which estimated that clothing sales rose 6.2 per cent during January against a year ago.SpendingPulse, which bases its estimates on MasterCard card spending and estimates of other forms of payment, said luxury spending rose 6.1 per cent, and online sales rose 12 per cent.Store chains reporting better-than-expected numbers included Limited Brands, owner of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain, which saw sales at stores open at least a year increase by 24 per cent.Same-store sales at Victoria’s Secret rose 35 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, also reported a better-than-expected 1 per cent increase in comparable sales against the same period a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, reported a 2.3 per cent increase in comparable sales, although Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said sales have been “restrained by the series of snowstorms that caused widespread store closures along the east coast and in the south-east”.Its online sales were up 27 per cent.JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-price department stores, reported sales below Wall Street’s expectations, with JC Penney down 1.2 per cent and Kohl’s up 1.4 per cent.Target, the mass discounter, said its comparable sales increase of 1.7 per cent was below its expectations, citing weakness in the north-east and south, regions affected by the bad weather.Costco, the warehouse club, said its same-store sales in the US, excluding petrol sales, rose 4 per cent.Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report monthly sales data.
82;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-12-20T18:59:04Z;US retailers upbeat on holiday sales;;US retailers are this week unleashing last-minute promotional sales offers ahead of the Christmas holiday as they head towards the climax of a shopping season that shows signs of meeting optimistic forecasts.Department stores such as Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s are offering discounts of up to 50 per cent on items such as winter coats and sweaters, as they push to attract last-minute shoppers. But Wall Street analysts say the sector has largely kept to its scheduled promotional plans, with a conservative approach to inventory planning reducing the need for more drastic price cuts.Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group, a retail research firm, said that “even if prices are marked down, [the stores] are managing it better”.“For holiday 2010, there are three words that sum it up: it feels better,” she said after touring stores in several US cities since the start of the season.The positive sentiment was underlined by the most recent survey of sales in major categories by MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse, which uses card swipe data from MasterCard and estimates of other payment methods. SpendingPulse said that the momentum seen in November continued into the first two weeks of December, with “moderate to strong” sales gains in several sectors.The survey estimated that the overall clothing category was up 9.8 per cent for the period from October 31 to December 11, compared to the same period last year, while e-commerce sales were up 13.5 per cent.The jewellery sector had 2.6 per cent growth over the same period, while luxury sales excluding jewellery rose 2.8 per cent.But consumer electronics sales, which dipped below last year’s levels in the weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, remain slow, increasing only 0.4 per cent against last year. The sector has been hit in particular by continuing steep falls in the price of televisions, which contributed to weaker-than-expected earnings last week from Best Buy, the largest consumer electronics retailer.The National Retail Federation last week raised its forecast for annual sales growth for November and December by 1 percentage point to 3.3 per cent.
83;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-12-02T14:14:59Z;Return to spending boosts sales at US shops;;Leading US chain retailers recorded a strong start to the holiday shopping season in November, as early promotions and solid sales on the post-Thanksgiving weekend boosted revenues.Monthly sales data from retailers released on Thursday suggested they had benefited from an improvement in discretionary spending. As a result sales rose at department stores and top brands.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of comparable sales growth rose by 5.3 per cent against the same month last year, beating the 3.5 per cent forecast based on Wall Street analysts’ predictions. The increase compared to the 0.7 per cent gain in November 2009.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said he expected a “robust” December, supported by “stock market gains, improving macro data leading to better consumer confidence numbers, and aggressive promotions”.Department stores delivered some of the strongest sales growth, as they benefited from shoppers’ increasing readiness to spend on items such as costume jewellery.JC Penney, the mid-price department store, said comparable sales increased by 9.2 per cent, while its rival Kohl’s reported a 6.1 per cent increase.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, saw its comparable sales rise by 6.1 per cent.Target, the mass discounter, said November sales rose 5.5 per cent on a comparable store basis against last year.Comparable sales at Limited Brands’ Victoria’s Secret stores rose 13 per cent against last year, continuing a run of double digit monthly gains since the summer.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, said its same-store sales rose by 4 per cent compared to last year.Same-store sales at Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer, surged 22 per cent. But same-store sales at its lower cost rival American Eagle were flat.The strong sales at individual stores came amid broad year-on-year increases in consumer spending in leading categories, according to estimates from MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse. SpendingPulse, which uses data from card spending and projections for other payments, said clothing spending had increased by 9.6 per cent against a year ago.The survey estimated that e-commerce sales rose by 12 per cent in November against last year. ComScore, the online research firm, reported this week that US online sales on the Monday following Thanksgiving rose 16 per cent, giving the US e-commerce sector its first day of sales surpassing $1bn.
84;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-11-26T15:21:24Z;US shoppers defy Black Friday weather;;"US shoppers defied cold weather and rain to flock to traditional post-Thanksgiving sales early on Friday, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that this year’s sales would be boosted by a growing readiness to spend after two years of frugal restraint.Brian Dunn, chief executive officer of Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, said in mid-morning he was “pleased with our traffic so far”.“This is anecdotal, but so far we estimate that our crowds are bigger than last year,” he said, with strong sales of categories including mobile devices, computers and the new Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect video gaming systems.Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of Toys R Us, said the largest US speciality toy store had “been busy from the start”, after it opened its doors two hours earlier this year at 10pm on Thanksgiving Thursday.He said the queue at the retailer’s New York flagship store was longer than last year, with customers chasing must-have toys such as Mattel’s $13 Sing-a-ma-jig harmonising rag dolls, and Squinkies, miniature collectable figures from Blip Toys.“It certainly feels like the consumer is more willing to open up wallets, particularly on larger toys. In the past it might have been something between $25 and $50; now it is $50 to $75, or up to $100,” he said of the season so far.Marshal Cohen, senior retail analyst at NPD Group, said he had seen large crowds at stores as they opened during the early hours of the morning, with Kohl’s, the low price department store, opening its doors at 3am, Target starting at 4am, and Walmart selling its non-electronic bargains earlier than usual at midnight. He said his analysis indicated a 15 per cent improvement from last year in conversion rates – the percentage of shoppers entering a store who complete a purchase, rather than just browsing.At the Target store in the Eastwood Mall in Niles, Ohio, several hundred people were queuing in long lines to check out at 7am, almost three hours after the discount store opened. Target was one of a number of retailers offering extra incentives to customers, with a $10 store gift card for shoppers spending more than $100 before 10am.At the Walmart Supercenter at Howland, a few miles away, staff had started selling at 5am the discounted electronic goods, such as $198 laptops and a $69 Blu-ray DVD player, to customers who had been waiting in line since midnight.Barbara Brunton was one of a number of shoppers at Walmart who said she would not be spending more at Christmas this year. “We are spending $200 on each of the children, and that’s it. You have to spend on the kids, but we’re not spending anything on the adults,” she said, noting that her sister and her brother-in-law had both lost their jobs this year."
85;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-11-16T22:23:11Z;Show of retail strength fails to halt wider US retreat;;Concerns about the risks of Chinese inflation and Eurozone sovereign debt overshadowed increases in forecasts from US retailers Walmart and Home Depot.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent. The materials and energy sectors led the decline, losing more than 2 per cent as they followed commodity prices lower.The S&P 500 closed down 1.6 per cent at 1,178.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had also lost 1.6 per cent to close at 11,023.50 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.8 per cent lower at 2,469.84.However, a flurry of retailers reporting earnings helped the S&P 500 retail index limit its losses to just 0.6 per cent.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, added 0.8 per cent to $54.50 after it raised its full-year guidance. Earnings rose during the quarter as income from international operations jumped.Elsewhere in retail, Home Depot also lifted its full-year earnings outlook even though the home improvement retailer cut its forecast for sales growth.In the third quarter it outperformed Lowe’s as same-store sales increased 1.5 per cent compared with largely flat sales at its rival.Shares in Home Depot added 1 per cent to $31.71 while Lowe’s shares rose 0.5 per cent to $21.57.Saks and Nordstrom saw a rise in luxury spending. But Saks fell 1.4 per cent to $11.16 after it reported an unexpectedly high quarterly profit as sales rose. The high-end department store chain forecast a mid-single digit rise in sales during the fourth quarter.In contrast, department store owner Nordstrom narrowed its forecast for the full year to a range below average analyst expectations. Nordstrom shares dropped 3.1 per cent to $40.55 even though surging sales helped the retailer report a better-than-expected profit for the quarter.Liz Dunn, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said there could be upside to the retailer’s guidance if the high-end customer continued to show resilience.Competing department store stocks also fell, with Macy’s losing 2.2 per cent to $24.15 and Kohl’s nudging down 0.6 per cent to $50.65.Among other retailers announcing their earnings, clothing chain Abercrombie & Fitchbeat expectations.International demand helped Abercrombie & Fitch and the shares, which have risen 29 per cent since the retailer reported its second-quarter earnings in August, advanced 0.8 per cent to $45.68.Sales from the Urban Outfitters website and the fashion retailer’s catalogues jumped 31 per cent in its third quarter, helping total sales rise by double-digits and lifting the chain’s earnings above expectations. Shares in the chain rose 11.9 per cent to $36.64.
86;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-11-12T18:43:39Z;Mid-priced US retailers ring up rising sales;;Three of the largest US department stores have provided further evidence that middle-income consumers are spending more, in spite of high unemployment and depressed house prices.Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, said on Friday that the mid-price retailer had seen “clear signs of strength in key businesses” during its third-quarter as it reported earnings ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.JC Penney said it expected to see comparable sales rise by 3-4 per cent during the quarter ending January 31, which would continue a slow but steady recovery in spending by its core mid-income shoppers.The department store sector’s monthly sales this year have regularly outperformed both Walmart and Target, the largest mass discounters, who serve a predominantly lower-income customer base.Macy’s, the largest US department store by sales, this week forecast holiday quarter sales growth in the same range, while Kohl’s, JC Penney’s main rival in the mid and lower-price range, gave a 2-4 per cent target.Macy’s, which reported comparable sales growth of 3.9 per cent in its third quarter, highlighted the particular strength of its upmarket Bloomingdale’s chain.Kohl’s reported that sales of its more expensive “Simply Vera” line by designer Vera Wang had grown more than 15 per cent during the quarter.JC Penney said it had seen “clear signs of strength” in sales of cosmetics and fragrances at its 231 store-within-a-store Sephora locations.Similar signs of sales strength during the third quarter have been reported by several retailers whose sales slumped after the 2008 financial crisis, including Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural supermarket, Starbucks, the coffee business, and Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie retailer.Estee Lauder, the upmarket beauty brand business, also said recently that beauty sales at “prestige” department store counters and at Sephora stores, owned by LVMH, had outstripped growth at lower price drug stores and discounters during the third quarter.Macy’s, Kohl’s and JC Penney are all still taking a strongly promotional marketing approach to the holiday shopping season, launching a series of special weekend sales offers in the run-up to the Thanksgiving holiday.But Kevin Mansell, chief financial officer of Kohl’s, said its marketing message this year had moved away from stressing just low prices to a broader focus on value for money.“A lot of the incremental marketing we are doing . . . is around convincing and communicating to consumers why what we give them for the price is of better overall total value,” he said.JC Penney reported third-quarter earnings of $44m, or 19 cents per diluted share, up 63 per cent on the same period last year.Total revenues were almost unchanged at $4.19bn, reflecting a decision to end distribution of its mail-order catalogue on the rise of online shopping.
87;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-11-11T19:03:08Z;Technology stocks lead Wall Street losses;;A cautious outlook from Cisco sent the technology company’s shares tumbling and dragged down US stocks.Cisco dropped 16.2 per cent to $20.52, pulling down the S&P 500 information technology index by 1.8 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,213.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to close at 11,283.10 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent lower at 2,555.52.The world’s largest maker of computer networking equipment forecast sales and profits lower than analysts had estimated.John Chambers, chief executive, said the company faced a “challenging economic environment” and that it had missed revenue expectations in the quarter because of an unexpected drop-off in spending by the public sector, especially in Europe.It predicted that revenue would grow by 3-5 per cent in the second quarter, much less than the consensus forecast for a 13 per cent increase.Analysts at JPMorgan, who lowered their price target for the stock to $24.50 but kept its “overweight”’ rating, said: “Government spending was a risk but we believe that Cisco guidance indicates that this large part of the global economy, particularly US state and European governments, may be deteriorating rapidly.“Guidance for full-year revenue growth of 9-12 per cent seems ambitious to us considering the speed and severity of this reduction – our new forecast is for 6.4 per cent revenue growth for the full fiscal year.”They added that as Cisco said it was gaining share in seven of its nine largest markets, this was probably an early sign of a wider problem and not Cisco-specific.Brad Thompson, fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors, which owns Cisco shares, said: “We’re taking a pretty close look at it.”“Technology is currently the most consensus trade among institutional investors,” he added. “Everybody is pretty much placing a bet in that space but Cisco is a bellwether with its tentacles in business and government.”Shares in Cisco’s rivals also suffered with Cavium Networks 4.4 per cent lower at $34.53.Mr Thompson said the drop in government spending would affect other parts of the technology supply chain, as well as the money flowing from government to healthcare and defence companies.Among the suppliers, Jabil Circuit gave up 4.6 per cent to $14.40, Altera fell 2.8 per cent to $32.90 and Xilnix was down 3.3 per cent to $26.50.Other technology stocks also slumped with Dell falling 3.9 per cent to $13.93 and Hewlett-Packard losing 2.4 per cent to $43.10.Elsewhere in earnings news, Disney reported late in the trading session. Shares slumped 2.9 per cent to $35.93 after it missed profit estimates in its fourth quarter.Income from pay-TV services for ESPN which last year was recorded in the fourth quarter, came in an earlier quarter this year. This outweighed strong advertising sales and receipts for films including Toy Story 3.Viacom gained 3.1 per cent to $44.59 after it beat analysts’ estimates with its fourth-quarter profit. The owner of MTV Networks and Comedy Central joined other cable operators in reporting results buoyed by higher advertising sales.The popularity of its hit show Jersey Shore helped viewing figures and advertising revenue rose 8 per cent. The company also said it planned to sell Harmonix, the Rock Band music video game developer.In retail, Kohl’s department store chain forecast profits and sales in its fourth quarter that were above some analysts’ expectations. The retailer reported quarterly profit in line with expectations and said it had gained market share. Its shares edged up 0.3 per cent to $52.41.Rival Macy’s reported strong earnings on Wednesday, which buoyed other department store stocks.In financials, Bank of America dropped 1.6 per cent to $12.37 after it said it would sell its right to buy extra shares in a $9.3bn rights issue by the China Construction Bank to the Singapore state investment agency.
88;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-11-05T17:52:35Z;US retailers bring sales offers forward;;Leading US retailers have this weekend thrown themselves into a frenzy of early holiday sales offers, three weeks before the traditional start of the US Christmas shopping season on “Black Friday” – the day after the Thanksgiving holiday.From the “Biggest Sale of Them All” at JC Penney, the mid-price department store, to the “Bigger than Black Friday” online event at the discounter Kmart, retail analysts say this year’s weekend deals mark a significant acceleration of pre-Thanksgiving activity, as retailers try to secure an early share of holiday spending.Kathy Grannis, of the National Retail Federation, said that while only a few retailers had tried out pre-Black Friday sales events last year, “it seems it was a hit”. “This is retail, so if something catches on, we certainly better do it again.”Joel Bines, a retail analyst at AlixPartners, said that the holiday shopping season was in effect now under way by the start of November: “Retailers have recognised that once the air starts getting chilly, people seem to be ready to think about their holiday shopping.” Black Friday is so named because it once marked the day when the holiday shopping rush pushed retailers’ ledgers into positive territory.This weekend has seen a particularly intense battle over consumer electronics, one of the most popular gift categories.Walmart, the largest US retailer, has launched a two-day sale with price cuts of more than 25 per cent on laptops, video games and high-definition televisions.Best Buy, the largest electronics retailer, has countered with a two-day sale. Amazon, the online retailer, started its offers last weekend but has thrown in a two-day electronics sale this weekend to match Best Buy and Walmart.The onslaught of bargains also includes techniques traditionally associated with Black Friday such as early opening and offers that only last until lunchtime. JC Penney is offering 60 per cent off selected items before 1pm on Saturday, while rival Kohl’s opened an hour earlier at 6am on Saturday for its three-day “Power Shopping Sale” and will stay open an hour later until midnight.Some stores are also hoping they will be able to get customers who shop early to come back before Christmas.Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie store owned by Limited Brands, is distributing gift cards to anyone who spends more than $10 in November, valid only during the first 19 days of December. The battle for sales comes against sluggish overall consumer demand, with the NRF forecasting that retail sales in November and December will rise by 2.3 per cent against last year.
89;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-11-04T20:54:32Z;Financials lead sector gains in US stocks;;Financials, materials and energy shares led US stocks to their highest levels in two years as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s decision to extend quantitative easing.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose with nine up more than 1 per cent.The S&P 500 closed up 1.9 per cent to 1,221.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 2 per cent to close at 11,434.77 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.5 per cent higher at 2,577.34.The dollar weakened and commodity and oil prices rose, helping the energy sector to add 3 per cent and the materials sector to advance 3.3 per cent.ExxonMobil soared 2.1 per cent to $69.38 and Chevron climbed 3 per cent to $85.14. Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4.7 per cent to $70.00 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold surged 7 per cent to $103.89.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investment, said stocks could rally into the end of the year as diminished uncertainty after quantitative easing, the midterms and stabilising jobs and housing data helped investor confidence.“Cyclicals like energy and materials are very good suspects for leading markets [where as] financials have a lot of question marks like Basel III and Dodd-Frank,” he said.He added that natural resources stocks were soaring partly due to quantitative easing but also because of expectations that China would end its tightening cycle in the first half of next year.The financials rallied later in the session, up 3.4 per cent, after it was reported that the Federal Reserve might allow banks with strong capital levels to increase dividends. The two biggest banks by assets led the risers. Bank of America jumped 5.2 per cent to $12.12 and JPMorgan Chase shot up 5.5 per cent to $39.80.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.7 per cent, lifting the wider consumer discretionary sector by 1.6 per cent as retailers reported their October same-store sales.Gap, Target and Macy’s all beat expectations. Gap jumped 6.1 per cent to $20.43, Target climbed 1.5 per cent to $54.76 and Macy’s gained 6.6 per cent to $25.56.Even shares in Kohl’s, where same-store sales fell and the retailer lowered its third-quarter outlook, rose 2.3 per cent to $51.92.Some retailers also reported their quarterly earnings. Limited Brands, which owns the Victoria’s Secret chain, advanced 5.3 per cent to $31.43 after it beat estimates. Shares in Limited Brands have risen 68.2 per cent this year.In food retail stores, Whole Foods rocketed 15.1 per cent to $47.27 after the upmarket grocer raised its 2011 profit forecast and beat expectations in its fourth quarter. Same-store sales rose 8.7 per cent as customers dipped into their pockets for more organic and gourmet foods.At the other end of the spectrum, Costco, the warehouse club operator, said its same-store sales rose 6 per cent in October. Its shares were higher by 3.7 per cent to $65.48.News Corp, the owner of Fox News and newspapers around the world, beat expectations as advertising recovered. Revenue grew 17 per cent at Fox News after it led the cable news ratings, helping to increase operating income at the division by 23 per cent. But its shares edged down 0.6 per cent to $14.75.Cable operators also beat expectations with their quarterly earnings as they added more internet and phone subscribers.Time Warner Cable said it added more internet customers even though the number of basic video subscribers fell. Revenue and profit rose and the company said it would launch a $4bn share buy-back programme. Its shares advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.33.Cablevision Systems also reported better-than-expected results. Its shares jumped 2.6 per cent to $28.36.US-listed shares in PotashCorp dropped 2.4 per cent to $141.97 after the Canadian government rejected BHP Billiton’s $39bn bid. Potash shares have risen 29.2 per cent this year as the Australian miner has pursued the company. BHP Billiton, which added 6 per cent to $91.20, has 30 days to appeal.
90;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-10-08T22:46:57Z;Pershing and Vornado reveal JC Penney stake;;"Pershing Square, the activist investor fund run by Bill Ackman, and Vornado, the real estate investment trust, have acquired control of a combined 26.7 per cent of JC Penney, in a challenge to the management of the mid-range US department store.Pershing Square said on Friday it had control of 16.8 per cent of the department stores shares, making it the retailer’s largest shareholder, while Vornado said in separate regulatory filing that it had acquired a 9.9 per cent stake. Both said they planned to cooperate and would hold talks with management on issues including finances and strategy.Wall Street analysts said the combined move is likely to focus attention on JC Penney’s real estate assets.Mr Ackman fought an unsuccessful proxy battle with the management of Target three years ago, after proposing spinning off the discount retailer’s extensive real estate holdings into a separate real estate investment trust.Vornado’s significant retail moves have included taking part in the private equity buy-out of Toys R Us in 2006, and supporting the 2005 merger of Sears and Kmart by Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund billionaire.JC Penney, founded in 1902, operates more than 1,000 department stores that are mainly based in regional shopping malls and are aimed at middle-income customers.Under Mike Ullman, chief executive since 2004, the retailer has focused on differentiating itself from competition from lower price retailers such as Target and
Walmart by evolving a successful private label strategy.It has also faced intense rivalry from Kohl’s, a rapidly expanding chain that has successfully developed off-mall locations, while JC Penney’s stores have been hit by overall declines in traffic levels at regional malls.The retailer is set to unveil a new partnership with Mango, the European fast fashion brand, and is expanding a network of Sephora-branded beauty and cosmetic store-within-a-store units.In the filing, Pershing said it had begun building its JC Penney stake in mid-August, took a break in early September and then resumed buying at the end of the month before finishing on Thursday. Vornado started building its stake at the end of September, and also finished on Thursday.Most of Pershing’s shares were accumulated when the retailer’s stock was trading around $20. Its shares have risen sharply this month, and closed on Friday up over 2 per cent at $32.49.Mr Ackman’s recent investments have included General Growth Properties, one of the largest owners of US shopping malls, where he backed an $8.5bn recapitalisation plan to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. He is also a significant shareholder in Borders, the second largest US bookstore.Pershing manages about $7bn. It also said on Friday it had acquired an 11 per cent stake in Fortune Brands, a company whose brand portfolio includes the Jim Beam bourbon, home security, kitchen cabinets, and gold products."
91;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-10-07T14:42:15Z;Late back-to-school buying lifts retail sales;;US chain retailers reported broadly better-than-expected store sales during September, supported by last minute back-to-school and college shopping that boosted teen and youth retailers in particular.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same store sales rose 2.7 per cent in September. He cited strong back-to-school selling “coupled with attractive fall fashions, aggressive promotions and a near-record September stock market rise” as factors supporting the performance.Limited Brands, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works, reported a 12 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, with margins up “significantly” as the company avoided the price-cutting promotions seen last year.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, said same store sales rose 4.8 per cent. Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said the back-to-school period was “one of our most successful in years”. He highlighted the performance of its Material Girl teen clothing collection, a joint venture with Madonna, and its American Rag clothing for teen boys.JC Penney said its sales rose 5.1 per cent, ahead of expectations. Its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales up 3 per cent. Kohl’s said on Wednesday that it would increase its temporary holiday staff hiring this year by 20 per cent, reflecting new store additions and increasing confidence in holiday demand.Luxury and high-end stores also performed well, with Neiman Marcus reporting same store sales up 4.7 per cent, Nordstrom up 7.5 per cent and Saks up 6.5 per cent.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the strong performance of higher-end spenders was “especially encouraging for the economy and the upcoming holiday-shopping season because the top 20 per cent of households by income account for nearly 40 per cent of total consumption”.Several teen and youth fashion retailers who have struggled over the past year with sluggish discretionary spending also fared better than expected. Abercrombie & Fitch reported a 13 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Zumiez, a teen retailer, said its same store sales rose 17 per cent, and raised its earnings guidance for the quarter. Buckle and Aeropostale both saw comparable sales up 3 per cent.But Target, the discount retailer, said its 1.3 per cent increase in comparable sales was lower than it had expected, despite being pleased with its back-to-school performance. Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, reported a 1 per cent drop in same store sales, saying that September had been more challenging that it had expected.Sales at its Gap stores in North America fell 1 per cent, despite efforts to draw sales with a large marketing focus on black denim pants that the company said would increase inventory levels. Gap’s lower-price Old Navy stores reported a 5 per cent drop.Costco, the warehouse club, said on Wednesday that its same store sales rose 5 per cent, also slightly above Wall Street’s expectations, although US store sales excluding fuel were slightly below forecasts, at 2 per cent.
92;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Retail: Digital-savvy shoppers drive change;;Best Buy, the largest US electronics retailer, is testing a system that sends messages about special offers to customers’ mobile phones when they enter its stores.Kohl’s, the mid-price department store, is rolling out in-store touch screen kiosks that will allow customers to order online items that are not available in the store.JCPenney, its rival, is moving towards the launch of a mobile e-commerce platform, and has just upgraded its website search system.Walmart, the international retail group, is creating a global e-commerce platform.Customer demand may still be sluggish after the recession of the past two years, but US retailers have been continuing to spend money on technology aimed at their customers.“Retailers have maintained as spending priorities anything that may enhance the customer relationship or experience,” says Nikki Baird, of Retail Systems Research, a consultancy that specialises in retailers’ information systems. “Everything else has struggled.”The current spending on customer-facing technology is supported by the need, in a slow-growth economy, to deliver increased sales by luring shoppers away from rivals, says Ms Baird. But it also reflects a significant shift in the traditional world of retail technology.Instead of introducing customers to technology aimed at increasing operational efficiency, such as bar codes, or electronic payments, retailers are now struggling to stay abreast of the technology at the fingertips of their customers.Shoppers equipped with smartphones can now use tools from the online world in-store. They can check prices at rival stores and look for independent product reviews. They can use their phones to receive digital offers, and increasingly to access payment systems and complete transactions.But dealing with the digitally equipped “multichannel” shopper is presenting challenges for the industry that go well beyond what the customer sees in the store.“It may start with the customer,” says Ms Baird. “But as soon as we go down that path, there are questions to do with business models, supply chain design, how you compensate stores for online sales that happen at an [in-store] kiosk. These are big issues for a retailer.”“It’s not just about integrating channels, it is about changing your business model, and no one wants to hear that.”For retailers, the challenges of creating a single customer experience both online and in stores can encompass basic considerations such as ensuring the prices or offers are the same whether the customer is buying in a shop or via the internet.In one of the most radical responses to the challenge, Moosejaw, a small outdoor equipment retail chain based in Michigan, has done away with a separate computer system for its point-of-sale devices.Instead, the in-store machines connect to the same IBM Websphere Commerce database as its e-commerce site, which is also used by its call-centre sales staff. The system also operates a loyalty reward scheme – the customer’s purchase history is accessible in all channels. “All the channels are updated in real time and can each offer the exact same features,” says Gary Wohlfeill, Moosejaw’s creative director.With just seven stores, Moosejaw’s multichannel transformation was relatively straightforward.At the other end of the scale, Tom Nealon, chief information officer at JCPenney since 2006, is overseeing the creation of a digital platform for the retailer, which has more than 1,000 stores and sales of $17bn last year. The platform, he says, will eventually encompass “all the main pro­cesses you need to run any business”.“Traditionally, a digital platform is certainly customer-experience kind of stuff,” he says. “But even there, we take it deeper into order management, fulfilment, enterprise planned allocation, customer analytics. It is really quite comprehensive.”Initially, JCPenney’s online business – worth more than $1bn annually – was largely built on its “big book” catalogue business, which presented customers with more conservative products than its stores.The shift to a single buying system and fully-aligned merchandise meant that some sales were lost in the trans­ition, with the old big book catalogue finally discontinued this year.Mr Nealon says the introduction of the new technology has largely followed rather than led those organisational changes, which he said were “a huge first step”.Once the new teams started working together, “that’s when you started to see what the process needs were, and how you were going to build the technology out.”The first part of the e-commerce platform to be launched will, however, be its mobile e-commerce capability – an area that is gaining attention from a range of leading retailers, including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Sears Holdings.But, while most now have mobile phone applications that allow customers to browse their website or locate stores, they provide “brand-building” and information, rather than mobile transactions, which require a full digital platform.“Mobile has become a huge priority just in the past eight or nine months,” says RSR’s Ms Baird. “The CIOs I’ve talked to say that, while they are throwing out customer-facing applications, they are frantically working on the back-end to be able to support them in an efficient, sustainable and leverageable way.”Smartphone apps, says Mr Nealon, raise the question “to what degree do you intend to transact business through that application?”“That’s where the new digital platform comes in. You actually have to have the order management, fulfilment and the pricing capability [to support mobile transactions]. That’s what we’re building out right now.”
93;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-09-02T21:35:25Z;Retailers help Wall St amid positive economic figures;;US stocks rose on Thursday after slightly better-than-expected data on initial jobless claims, pending home sales and retailers’ same-store sales boosted investor confidence.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent at 1,090.10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 10,320.10 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent higher to close at 2,200.01.Initial jobless claims fell slightly last week, to 472,000 from a revised 478,000 for the week before. Economists had forecast an increase to 475,000 from a previously reported 473,000.“Thank heavens for small mercies,” said John Ryding, of RDQ Economics.He said the rises in jobless claims might have been because of changes in legislation authorising people to renew their benefits.“It would take a sustained move above 500,000 in claims to signal that the economy might be slipping back into recession,” he said.“However, even if claims fall back into the 450,000 area – as we judge likely over the coming weeks – they would still be at a level that historically has not been consistent with solid job creation.”Pending home sales increased unexpectedly in July, rising 5.2 per cent compared with the consensus forecast for a 1 per cent decline.The S&P 500 homebuilders index rose 2.2 per cent with DR Hortonleading the risers, gaining 2.5 per cent to $10.98. Home improvement retailers, which are heavily dependent on the housing market, also rose with Lowe’s up 3.3 per cent to $21.94.Factory orders edged up 0.1 per cent in July after declines in May and June.Most retailers reporting same-store sales from August – the key back-to-school season – beat analyst expectations.The S&P 500 retailers index climbed 1.9 per cent, pushing up the wider S&P 500 consumer discretionary index by 1.8 per cent.Costco, the largest US warehouse club operator, reported a 5 per cent rise in same-store sales in August, excluding gasoline. Its shares rose 1.4 per cent to $58.59. Same-store sales at Family Dollar Stores rose 6.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, beating the consensus forecast of 3.1 per cent. Its shares were 0.5 per cent higher at $43.50.Department store chains also did well, with Saks, Macy’s, Nordstromand Kohl’sbeating expectations. Saks, which was subject to bid speculation in the week, surged 10.8 per cent to $7.90 and Macy’s was up 2.6 per cent to $20.71. Nordstrom jumped 8.1 per cent to $32.76 and Kohl’s added 1.9 per cent to $49.31.Limited Brands posted a same-store sales increase of 10 per cent, helped by a 15 per cent sales rise at its Victoria’s Secret underwear chain. Its shares advanced 6.1 per cent to $25.75.But Abercrombie & Fitchfell 3.9 per cent to $35.16, in spite of beating sales estimates, after an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said promotions may have contributed to the gain and sales growth was slowing.The bidding war for the 3Par cloud computing company finally concluded after Dell, the original bidder, walked away. Hewlett-Packard raised its offer to $33 a share. Dell had proposed $32 but 3Par’s board declared HP’s bid the “superior proposal”. Shares in Dell rose 2 per cent to $12.36. 3Par rose 2.5 per cent to $32.88 and HP nudged up 1.2 per cent to $39.68.Burger King, which soared 14.7 per cent on Wednesday, jumped 25.1 per cent to $23.59 after it agreed to be bought by investment firm 3G Capital for $24 per share, or $4bn including debt.In other deal news, Avis Budget Group raised its offer for Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group to $40.75 a share in cash and 0.6543 of Avis stock, which it said was superior to the offer from Hertz Global Holdings.Dollar Thrifty had signed a deal with Hertz, but Avis said it would increase its offer to make up for any fee payable to Hertz to break the contract.Shares in Dollar Thrifty rose 1.2 per cent to $48.05. Avis shares added 4.3 per cent to $10.17. Hertz rose 4.2 per cent to $9.47.Mariner Energy slid 2.6 per cent to $22.75 after an oil rig it owns in the Gulf of Mexico caught fire and there were reports of a mile-long oil sheen.
94;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-08-13T18:05:06Z;JC Penney lowers earnings forecast;;Mike Ullman, chief executive of US department store chain JC Penney, painted a sombre picture of the economic health of his store’s core middle-class customers on Friday, as the chain lowered its earnings forecast for the year, citing weakening consumer sentiment.Mr Ullman, who is also a member of the board of the Dallas federal reserve, said JC Penney’s middle-income customers “have had the brunt of the effect of the job situation”, with the number of new entrants to the job market continuing to exceed new jobs created on a monthly basis.“To be realistic, the consumer restriction on credit, the job situation and the protracted housing situation has had the biggest impact on the middle-income consumer,” he said.He contrasted the situation with more prosperous households “that never ran out of money”, and lower-income consumers where “families are getting by taking care of the needs of their families, and they don’t have much flexibility beyond that”.JC Penney, with more than 1,000 stores in the US, lowered its earnings forecast for the full year to $1.40-$1.50 per diluted share, below a consensus forecast of $1.64, despite reporting stronger than expected second-quarter earnings.Its rival Kohl’s also lowered its full-year earnings guidance on Thursday, with its chief executive Kevin Mansell saying the store was still seeing a “cautious consumer”.“We see one that’s reluctant to spend. We see one that’s focused on the long-term value of what she buys,” he said.Kohl’s trimmed the top of its earnings forecast by 5 cents to $3.70 a share.Mr Ullman said that he expected virtually all of JC Penney’s forecast 2-3 per cent increase in comparable store sales in the third quarter would come from new initiatives, such as the launch of the MNG by Mango fashion units in its stores, rather than from strengthening underlying demand.The diminished expectations at Kohl’s and JC Penney contrasted with a more optimistic outlook this week from Macy’s and Nordstrom, department store chains that target more affluent customers.Nordstrom left its earnings guidance unchanged, with Blake Nordstrom, its president, saying management had not detected any changes in customer behaviour during the year, either upwards or downwards. It did not expect to see changes “in the foreseeable future,” he said.Macy’s raised its guidance for the full year, after reporting a stronger than expected second quarter, saying it was gaining market share from competitors, and citing “strong performance” at its Bloomingdale’s top end department stores.Macy’s also said it was pleased with initial demand this month at the beginning of the important back-to-school shopping season. However, Mr Ullman said he expected consumers to delay spending on items such as clothes and bedding for college as close as possible to the reopening of schools, with consumers trying to focus spending on the tax-free shopping days used by many states to support retail spending.
95;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-08-12T20:43:13Z;Cisco warning dents Wall Street's technology sector;;US stocks fell after disappointing jobless figures and cautious company outlooks reinforced investor concern about the possibility of a double-dip recession.The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent to 1,083.60 by midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to close at 10,319.95 and the Nasdaq closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,190.27.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose by 2,000 to 484,000 last week, the highest level since mid-February. Economists had expected claims to fall to 465,000.The S&P 500 opened 0.9 per cent weaker after the jobless data but was off its lows by mid-morning.Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said that, from watching Vix, a measure of volatility, he believes the sell-off will not last long.“Vix did not jump yesterday [on Wednesday] as much as one would expect,” he said. “Generally when Vix jumps less than expected, it means the sell-off is not going to continue and, although we do have a continuation today, it’s well off the lows.”Companies from Cisco, the technology company, to Kohl’s, the retailer, re-ported positive earnings but forecasts were worse than expected.Cisco, the world’s largest maker of networking equipment, sank 10 per cent to $21.36 in spite of better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and a 79 per cent jump in net income.Investors were spooked after John Chambers, Cisco chief executive, borrowed words from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to warn of “unusual uncertainty” in the economy and forecast revenue for the current quarter of between $10.64bn and $10.83bn, below the average analyst estimate of $10.95bn.The company is seen as a barometer for the technology industry because it dominates the market for products that direct the flow of internet traffic.The S&P 500 information technology sector was down 1.7 per cent with Juniper Networks, the second-largest maker of computer networking equipment, falling 6.8 per cent to $25.78.Kohl’s, the department store chain operator, repor­ted earnings that beat ex­pec­tations but analysts were disappointed by a worse-than-expected outlook.Like Macy’s, which reported its earnings on Wednesday, it gained market share by adding exclusive lines. But it warned rising costs would put pressure on earnings in the third quarter, which the company forecast to come in between 57 and 63 cents a share, below analysts’ est­imates of 74 cents. Its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $46.50.Sara Lee, the food and household group, was also down 0.7 per cent to $14.37 after issuing a forecast that fell short of expectations. It said earnings for the year ending June 2011 would be between 88 cents and 95 cents a share compared with a consensus forecast of $1.02. Fourth-quarter earnings also missed expectations after wheat, meat and coffee prices rose, squeezing profit in its North American retail division.Estée Lauder also fell after forecasting earnings for 2011 below the average analyst estimate. The cosmetics company said profit would be between $2.80 and $3.05 a share, excluding some items, compared with the consensus forecast of $3.19. Shares dropped 2.6 per cent to $58.80 after it also missed expectations for its fourth quarter.Brinker International’s Chilis chain and the Wendy’s-Arby’s Group Arby’s chain suffered from declining sales in their restaurants. Brinker rose 5.1 per cent to $15.65 after it said margins would rise in 2011 but Wendy’s-Arby’s edged down 0.2 per cent to $4.40. Industrial stocks slid on fears about economic recovery. The S&P 500 Industrials was down 0.8 per cent with Caterpillar off 1.8 per cent to $67.50 and Textron falling 2.9 per cent to $18.43.Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, slid 3.6 per cent to $54.17 after India became the latest country to say it might ban the device if security issues were not addressed.American International Group fell 2 per cent to $37.10 after it was reported it had started negotiations with potential investors to sell stakes in AIA, its Asian life insurance business, before a planned initial public offering.
96;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-08-05T22:52:25Z;US store sales data give subdued picture;;US chain retailers’ July sales reflected the fitful nature of the recovery, with data released on Thursday showing pockets of strength offset by an overall picture of subdued demand.Several stores that hold the middle ground in the US retail landscape did well, with Macy’s, the largest US department store by revenues, reporting a 7.3 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Limited, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, saw same-store sales rise 7 per cent and raised guidance for the second quarter, as did Kohl’s, a mid-cost department store, whose sales rose 4.6 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, said its same-store sales rose 1 per cent, with continued strength at its lower-cost Old Navy stores, and growth at Banana Republic. But sales at its Gap brand stores fell 6 per cent. Gap also raised earnings guidance for the quarter.JC Penney, a mid-price department store, reported its comparable sales fell 0.6 per cent.Dillards and Bon-Ton, two regional department store chains, reported comparable sales falls.Saks, the luxury department store, said comparable sales rose 6.4 per cent, while its rival Nordstrom reported 7.6 per cent growth.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 3 per cent, missing the 3.2 per cent forecast based on Wall Street analysts’ views. The index was pulled down by weakness at teen and youth retailers.TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded clothing, also saw sluggish sales growth of 2 per cent, after seeing much stronger growth from bargain-hunting shoppers during the recession.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that the subdued overall picture came despite stepped up discounting and promotions by retailers.
97;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-06-04T01:00:57Z;US store recovery slows in May;;The gradual recovery in US shoppers’ discretionary spending showed signs of slowing in May, according to monthly sales data from leading chain retailers released on Thursday.But several leading retailers suggested that bad weather in the first part of the month, and a shift in the timing of Memorial Day holiday shopping, may have affected spending more than continuing macroeconomic concerns.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 2.7 per cent against the same period last year, 130 basis points below initial expectations.Mr Perkins said the data suggested that consumers had “pulled back the reins on what looked like a fledgling spending recovery in the first quarter”.But the monthly figures were also affected by the timing of the Memorial Day holiday, which pushed sales from the last Sunday and Monday of the month into the retailers’ June reporting period.Sales of summer clothing were also affected by unseasonably wet and cool weather during the first half of the month.Frank Badillo, senior economist at Kantar Retail, argued that the “results provide some sign that the retail recovery will persist” in spite of wealth declines and economic uncertainties.Monthly sales at Target, the discounter whose performance has become a bellwether of broad consumer sentiment, increased 1.3 per cent against a year ago.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said in a statement that the retailer’s “recent experience reinforces our belief that we will continue to experience volatility in the pace of economic recovery”.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, which reported a 1.4 per cent increase in comparable sales, cited the impact of the weather, saying its “business trend strengthened toward the end of the month as the weather turned warmer”.Kohl’s, the lower price department store, noted that business improved during the last week of the month, with its comparable sales up 3.5 per cent, better than it had expected.Neiman Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom, the luxury and high-end department stores also continued to provide evidence of the recovery in spending by better off consumers.Neiman Marcus said same store sales rose 7.8 per cent, and noted that its store sales growth was led by its locations in New York City and Texas. Saks comparable sales were up 5.8 per cent, and Nordstrom’s were up 3.7 per cent, with slower growth due to the later start of an annual half-year sale.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent, with only its North America Gap brand stores seeing a sales decline, by 2 per cent.Discount retailers also continued to outperform their full price competition, with TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded goods, reporting same store sales growth of 4 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.Despite the continued sales growth seen by most retailers, their overall sales remain below levels seen in 2007 and the first part of 2008.
98;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-05-15T02:42:13Z;US shoppers come out of hiding;;US shoppers have been spending more on fashion, handbags and men’s clothes, but remain cautious about spending, according to leading US department store chains that reported quarterly results this week.Executives at Macy’s, Kohl’s, JC Penney and Nordstrom – representing almost 3,000 stores and about $70bn in annual sales – painted a similar picture of sentiment among their largely middle-class customers.“We think the consumer is no longer in hiding, but they are being very pragmatic about how they shop,” said Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney.JC Penney saw a 1.2 per cent increase in same-store sales compared with the first quarter last year, its first quarterly same-store sales gain since late 2007.Kevin Mansell, CEO of Kohl’s, also said on Thursday that consumers were “a little more confident in their spending, but remain focused on value and ways to make their dollars go farther.”Kohl’s saw same-store sales rise 7.4 per cent in the first quarter against the same period last year, while Macy’s, the largest US department store by sales, reported a 5.5 per cent increase at its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores.Nordstrom, which serves a more prosperous and aspirational customer, saw its same-store sales rise 12 per cent.Both Kohl’s and Nordstrom also said they were seeing lower rates of delinquency in their store credit card businesses, although Michael Koppel, Nordstrom’s CFO, noted that delinquency and write-off trends “are still measurably above historical averages”.All four retailers reported improved operating profits against a year ago, when they were hit by the need to clear excess merchandise after the sharp drop in consumer demand following the Wall Street crash of autumn 2008.Mr Ullman noted that JC Penney expected to start building up its inventory levels again, having ended the quarter down only 1 per cent against last year.“We will continue to rebuild our inventory levels to take advantage of the general recovery in the consumer environment,” he said.Restocking by retailers is being reflected by steady increases in the volumes of container traffic into US ports, with data from Global Port Tracker this week predicting a 10 per cent increase in volumes this month against May last year.The survey, by Hacket Associates for the National Retail Federation, said US ports handled 1.07m TEUs in March, the most recent month for which numbers are available, up 12 per cent from last year’s slump.Jonathan Gold of the NRF said the numbers “show us that retailers are confident their sales are going to go up this summer and give us an early hint of optimism about the fall as well”.
99;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Return of shoppers boosts Macy’s profits;;Macy’s, the US department store chain, reported first-quarter results that it said exceeded its expectations, supported by recovering spending by its mainly middle class shoppers.Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said the company’s first-quarter earnings of $23m, or 5 cents per diluted share, were “well ahead of what we originally expected”, crediting the impact of a store localisation initiative launched two years ago.A year ago, Macy’s reported an $88m loss as consumers cut back discretionary spending at its more than 800 Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores in the aftermath of the financial chaos on Wall Street.Mr Lundgren said that both Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s had “an excellent quarter and outperformed most of their key competitors”. The company was one of the first of the large US retailers to report on the first quarter, with lower-price rivals Kohl’s and JC Penney following later this week.“While the direction of the overall economy remains unclear, we believe we are well positioned to continue to gain market share,” he added.Sales in the quarter totalled $5.57bn, an increase of 7.2 per cent against the same quarter last year. Same-store sales rose 5.5 per cent from last year.Its overall sales still remain below the $5.75bn reported in the first quarter of 2008.Karen Hoguet, chief financial officer, said the retailer remained cautious about the strength of recovering US demand. “While the economy has been stronger than we anticpated, it is unclear how strong it really is,” she said in a call with analysts.Online sales rose 34 per cent against a year ago, but the retailer did not give a number for total online sales.Macy’s operating profits increased to $203m or 3.6 per cent of sales in the quarter, compared with adjusted operating income a year ago of $24m, excluding store closure costs. Along with other retailers it has reduced inventories sharply over the past year and lessened the need for clearance price cuts that hit its results a year ago.Macy’s is also planning to open a new discount store concept, called Bloomingdale’s Outlet, with four stores planned for the autumn. Its more upmarket rival Neiman Marcus, which already has 28 Last Call clearance stores, is also testing a new discount concept, aimed at appealing to more value-focused aspirational luxury shoppers.Bloomingdale’s also opened its first international store in Dubai in February.Macy’s increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance at the end of April, saying it expected same-store sales to rise by 3 to 3.5 per cent and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.75 to $1.80.Macy’s shares, which have doubled in value over the past year, rose over 2 per cent in morning trading in New York to $24.59.
100;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-04-08T21:01:13Z;US retailers enjoy spring sales rebound;;US retailers reported their best year-on-year monthly sales gains for several years on Thursday as Easter holiday purchases and renewed discretionary spending helped sales bounce back from last year’s slump.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its same store sales index rose 8.7 per cent for March, the largest monthly increase since it began tracking the data in 2000.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that the strong performance was supported both by the early Easter and the easy comparisons with last year, when the index fell 4.8 per cent. But he also saw signs of improving consumer confidence.“Consumers are generally feeling better about their plight and are finally making discretionary purchases and beginning to trade back up a bit,” he said.The strong monthly sales led a handful of large retailers, including Target, the discounter, and Kohl’s and JC Penney, the mid-price department stores, to raise their quarterly earnings guidance.At the top end of the retail market, Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, both reported strong increases in comparable sales from last year’s lows, of 12.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively. Their rival Nordstrom reported a 16.8 per cent increase.Meanwhile, Macy’s, the largest department store, saw a 10.8 per cent lift, while JC Penney reported a 5.4 per cent increase and Kohl’s reported a 22.5 per cent increase in same store sales.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, continued its sales recovery, with an 11 per cent increase in comparable sales, with double digit increases across its US Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores. Teen retailers American Eagle, Aeropostale and Zumiez also reported double digit comparable sales gains, although Abercrombie & Fitch delivered a more subdued 5 per cent rise.Target, the mass discounter, also reported a strong recovery in sales, which were up 10.3 per cent on a comparable basis. Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said the performance “exceeded our expectations, driven by particular strength in our apparel business”.Target’s larger rival Walmart does not report monthly sales numbers.At the lower end of the spectrum, TJX and Ross Stores, which focus on selling remaindered clothing brands, continued the sales growth that saw them outperform full-price rivals over the past year, with 12 and 14 per cent comparable sales increases.John Long, retail analyst at Kurt Salmon Associates, cautioned that, in spite of the strong March performance, consumers were still facing challenges. “We have already seen an uptick in consumer confidence but it is not necessarily something that we believe may be able to be sustained, given the macro-economic story,” he said.
101;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-03-12T15:28:11Z;Gap chief hails new phase as sales grow;;Glenn Murphy, chief executive of Gap, argued on Thursday that the biggest US clothing retailer has moved beyond its turnround phase, less than three years after he was appointed to head the then-floundering chain.“We are hoping that the word ‘turnaround’ that was synonymous with the word Gap …we can just park that,” he told an investor conference in New York.“I’m sure the word ‘turnaround’ can just go and find another brand now.”His comments followed Gap’s return to positive same-store sales growth across its brands in its fourth quarter, and improvements in operating margins driven by cost cutting and more disciplined inventory management.Mr Murphy argued that Gap’s renewed drive to gain market share in the US would benefit from the slowing of expansion by rival chains, which had during the past decade emulated its own rapid growth of the 1990s.The recession and “the maturing of the apparel business” in North America had shifted the focus away from store expansion by rivals that had cut into the markets of its own 2,500 North American stores, he said.“There will be some Kohl’s [department] stores that will open, and there will be a few more Forever 21s [fashion stores] …but by our crystal ball and the work we’ve done on the next five years its pretty much a level playing field.“It is going to be mano a mano, not based on square footage and capital. It’s based on execution, differentiation, knowing your target customer …and fighting for every one of them.”Mr Murphy, who previously headed Shoppers Drug Mart, Canada’s biggest drugstore chain, delivered a frank assessment of the shortcomings he identified when he arrived, including an “almost criminal” weakness in ensuring return on invested capital, and lack of cost awareness.“It had been a culture that didn’t necessarily embrace really rolling-up-of-sleeves work that needs to get done inside a really great company,” he said.He highlighted the high turnover rate of headquarters staff when he arrived, which reached 23 per cent in 2007 but dropped to 9 per cent in 2009.“You cannot run a business with that kind of turnover,” he said. “Gap brand, over a 10-year period, had seven brand presidents. Shame on us.”Emanuel Weintraub, a retail consultant, said Gap’s stores had seen a marked improvement.“Quality is better, product is better, pricing is better.”JPMorgan Chase’s retail analysts on Thursday raised their price target for Gap’s shares from $22 to $24.Gap shares, which dropped below $11 a year ago, have recovered to pre-crisis levels of about $22.
102;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-03-04T22:39:26Z;US consumers show readiness to spend;;US chain stores saw more evidence during February of a cautious readiness by US consumers to spend, as a broad range of retailers reported comparable sales gains in spite of severe winter weather that swept the US east coast.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly same-store sales data, said its index rose 4.1 per cent year-on-year in February, against a forecast 3 per cent increase, the biggest monthly gain in the index since November 2007.“Consumers seem to be coming out of hibernation,” said Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics. “We need to see more of this to really feel the consumer is coming back.”February is a transition month for US clothing retailers, as they bring in spring styles and clear out winter merchandise. But the stronger-than-expected sales across all sectors except drug stores painted a picture of a US consumer increasingly ready to spend on more discretionary items.Macy’s, the mainstream department store chain, reported a 3.7 per cent increase on Thursday in same-store sales over February 2008, supported by a 38 per cent jump in its online business.Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said the retailer estimated that comparable sales would have risen by 5 per cent but for the impact of the winter storms on the eastern seaboard states.JC Penney, the department store, said its February comparable store sales rose 1.2 per cent, while its rival Kohl’s reported a 3.7 per cent increase. Target, the discount retailer, reported a 2.4 per cent increase and said the number of customers visiting its stores was continuing to rise year-on-year.Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report its monthly same-store sales numbers.Gap, the largest US clothing store chain, continued its sales recovery, reporting a 3 per cent gain in comparable sales across its business.Youth clothing retailers also performed more strongly. Abercrombie & Fitch, which experienced monthly sales declines of up to 30 per cent last year, reported a 5 per cent increase in same-store sales, after its sales turned positive last month.Its shares jumped about 10 per cent. Aeropostale’s monthly comparable sales increased 7 per cent, and American Eagle’s rose 6 per cent.Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 2 per cent increase in same-store sales, after seeing a double-digit decline in February last year as luxury demand slumped.The comparative strength of February’s sales came in spite of a sharp fall in the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index during the month.However, a survey of consumer confidence in March, released on Thursday by RBC, reported a recovery in confidence levels.RBC’s Consumer Attitudes and Spending by Household index bounced back to 58.2, it said, after falling to 18.8 in February.
103;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-02-17T22:23:51Z;Wall St buoyant as earnings news and economic data shine;;Encouraging January housing starts, better-than-expected earnings and receding fears on the European sovereign debt situation boosted risk appetite on Wednesday and prompted Wall Street stocks to rise moderately for the second consecutive session.January industrial production figures from the US Federal Reserve were also better than expected.Output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.9 per cent following a 0.7 per cent increase in December.“We are starting to see the early signs of a virtuous circle in the recovery,” said Brian Bethune, chief US financial economist at IHS Global Insight.“Solid gains across a number of key spending categories, including consumption, housing, exports and business equipment spending [are starting] to reinforce each other, leading to lean inventories and upward leverage on production.”The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,099.51, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent at 10,309.24 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent higher at 2,226.29.Walgreens, the largest US drugstore chain, was up 0.3 per cent to $34.19 after announcing plans to buy rival Duane Reade for $1.08bn, a figure that includes $457m of debt, from affiliates of Oak Hill Capital Partners, the private equity group.The acquisition will enable Walgreens to expand in metropolitan New York.It would dilute profits in the first year after closing – expected to happen at the end of August – but add to earnings the following 12 months and thereafter, Walgreens said.Shares in Citigroup moved ahead 3 per cent to $3.41 as Paulson & Co, the hedge fund run by billionaire investor John Paulson, was revealed to have increased its stake in the bank in the past quarter, making the fund one of its largest institutional stakeholders.Prominent investor George Soros also revealed his fund had increased its stake in Citigroup last year.Whole Foods, a natural and organic food supermarket chain, improved 12.6 per cent to $34.35 after posting a quarterly profit that beat analyst estimates and revising upwards its fiscal 2010 sales and earnings forecasts.The company said identical-store sales, a closely watched indicator, rose 2.5 per cent after five quarters of declines.Retailers at the value end of the market also performed well. Walmart rose 0.9 per cent to $54.06, Target was up 1.4 per cent to $50.60 and Kohl’s moved up 1.1 per cent to $51.21.The software and technology sector was in focus as it prepares to fight an Obama administration plan to reduce offshore tax avoidance, according to Business Software Alliance, a Washington-based trade group that represents the sector.A proposal in President Obama’s 2011 budget targets an accounting technique known as transfer pricing, which allows companies to reduce their tax liabilities by transferring intangible property such as patents, trademarks and licenses to offshore subsidiaries. It is thought to be worth about $15.5bn annually.Microsoft was up 0.9 per cent to $28.59, Hewlett-Packard gained 1.4 per cent to $50.12 but Dell declined 0.2 per cent to $14.11.The proposals are also likely to affect companies that have valuable intangible assets and significant international operations and rely on this accounting technique, such as those in the pharmaceuticals sector.Merck fell 0.9 per cent to $37.34 and Pfizer lost 0.3 per cent to $17.67.Shares in Deere jumped 5 per cent to $56.48 after the maker of farm equipment reported first-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations.It also raised its full-year net income forecast to about $1.3bn from $900m.Rival machinery producer Caterpillar improved 0.7 per cent to $57.60.Martha Stewart Living strengthened 8.3 per cent to $5.76 after the company reported a fourth-quarter profit against a loss in the same period a year ago.The media sector overall performed well. Walt Disney was up 1.3 per cent to $30.86 and CBS, the television network, rose 1.9 per cent to $13.52.
104;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-02-15T23:19:52Z;US stores cautious in spite of robust results;;"US retailers, including Walmart, will give a further reading of the state of US consumer confidence this week as they start the sector’s reporting of earnings for the important holiday quarter.Overall monthly sales have remained significantly below pre-crisis levels, but analysts on Wall Street are expecting the sector as a whole to benefit from holiday demand that was at the high end of most retailers’ expectations.Profit margins are also expected to have benefited from broad cost reduction efforts introduced by many retailers last year, and from reduced clearance of unsold merchandise, as they entered the season with inventory levels that had been significantly reduced.Other retailers reporting this week are Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer; Whole Foods Market, the natural and organic supermarket; Office Max, the office supplies retailer; and JC Penney, the department store operator.The comparatively positive mood has been reinforced by positive early guidance from Ann Taylor, the women’s clothing retailer, which said its fourth-quarter earnings would be “substantially higher” than a year ago, on better-than-expected sales of about $470m and an improved gross margin, reflecting reduced price markdowns.Macy’s, the department store, Gap, the clothing store and Kohl’s, the discount department store all raised earnings guidance earlier this month after announcing their January sales results.Branded clothing companies including Polo Ralph Lauren and VF Corp, which operate their own stores as well as supplying department stores and other retailers, have also been reporting comparatively robust results, again reflecting tightly managed inventory and cost-cutting.Polo Ralph Lauren as well as Estée Lauder have reported improved luxury and aspirational spending that is likely to boost performance at traditional department stores.But most retailers are expected to maintain their conservative view of the year ahead, with the National Retail Federation predicting a sales rise for the industry of about 2.5 per cent.Eric Wiseman, chief executive of VF, whose brands include Lee jeans and Nautica sportswear, said last week he expected retailers to continue to focus on managing existing inventory levels more efficiently, rather than restocking.“Everybody is working on speed and being more responsive in our inventory management,” he said.Michael Dart, a retail consultant at Kurt Salmon Associates, argues that the overall low growth prospect means retailers will now focus resources on initiatives to improve the top and bottom lines."
105;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-02-04T18:59:39Z;US retailers boosted by strong January;;Spending by US shoppers continued to bounce back from last year’s post-crash lows, with retailers ranging from luxury department stores to teen fashion boutiques on Thursday reporting stronger sales in January.Retail Metrics said its index of chain retailers’ same-store sales figures rose 3.3 per cent, higher than the 2.4 per cent forecast, the fifth successive month of positive year-on-year sales growth shown by the index.Retailers including Gap, Kohl’s and Macy’s, saw their shares rise as they raised expectations for their fourth-quarter earnings.The monthly sales numbers offered further indications of returning demand for prestige and luxury goods, with Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion department stores, reporting increases of 6.8 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, saw its comparable sales jump 14 per cent.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, highlighted a strong performance from its luxury Bloomingdales stores, as it reported a 3.4 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month and raised its earnings guidance.The performance of the prestige stores fits with recent comments from Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing brand company, and from Estée Lauder, the cosmetics maker, which have both reported stronger demand for their higher-priced products.The more mainstream retailers also enjoyed sales that were stronger than had been expected.Comparable sales at Kohl’s, the discount department store, rose 6.5 per cent, although Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said customers “remain conservative in their discretionary spending”.Kohl’s rival JC Penney reported a 4.6 per cent decline in comparable sales, but said this was better than the forecast decline of 5 to 8 per cent.Speciality clothing retailers also fared significantly better than last year, with Aéropostale’s same-store sales up 6 per cent, American Eagle up 10 per cent and Abercrombie & Fitch up 8 per cent.The Limited, which owns the Victoria’s Secret lingerie stores, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales while Gap, the largest US speciality clothing seller, reported a 5 per cent gain, led by a 10 per cent increase at its low-cost Old Navy chain in the US and positive sales at its Gap and Banana Republic brands.Comparable sales at Target, the discounter, rose 0.5 per cent, lower than Wall Street had expected. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports its same-store sales on a monthly basis.January is traditionally a month of transition for retailers, as they dispose of excess holiday inventory and prepare to bring in the spring ranges.
106;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2010-01-07T16:07:39Z;US retailers report stronger Christmas sales;;Many of the largest US retail chains reported sales that were at the high end of their forecasts for the important holiday shopping month of December, although sales for most remained below pre-crash levels of two years ago.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of comparable store sales rose 3 per cent, the strongest increase in the index since April 2008.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said “retailers handily exceeded very modest expectations”, supported by “a last minute sales surge that saved the day prior to and immediately following Christmas”.A range of retailers, including Macy’s, the department store, TJX, the discount clothing chain, Limited Brands, owner of Victoria’s Secret, and Aeropostale, the youth fashion retailer, raised their quarterly earnings guidance on their stronger than expected performances.Mr Perkins said the positive earnings guidance “came from retailers that were able to keep promotions in check and maintain all-important margins”.Kohl’s, which has picked up business from the bankruptcy of its rival Mervyn’s, saw its same-store sales rise 4.7 per cent, while JC Penney reported a 3.8 per cent decline. Macy’s reported a one per cent increase in comparable sales, while Target, the discounter, said comparable sales had increased 1.8 per cent.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported continued strength at its lower cost Old Navy US stores, where comparable sales rose 7 per cent, and saw its Gap stores in North America report a 1 per cent increase. Comparable sales at its more upmarket Banana Republic stores fell 3 per cent. Overall, the company reported a 2 per cent increase in comparable sales.Sears Holdings, owner of Sears and Kmart stores, saw its shares surge after it forecast stronger than expected earnings. It said same-store sales for the month rose 5.3 per cent at Kmart, the discount store, but fell 4.3 percent at its Sears department stores. Overall, it said same-store sales rose 0.4 per cent in December, but had fallen 2 per cent in November and December combined.Toys R Us, the privately held toy retailer, also reported a 4.6 per cent increase in its comparable sales at its US stores, which reported a 3.9 per cent increase for the nine week holiday season.Saks, the luxury retailer, reported that its comparable sales had fallen by 7.3 per cent over November and December, despite a 9 per cent increase in comparable sales in December that was supported by a shift in a major sales promotion. Neiman Marcus reported a 4.5 per cent same store sales increase in December, after a 9.7 per cent fall in November.Barnes & Noble, the largest US speciality bookseller, said its sales for the nine week holiday period fell 5.4 per cent, and reduced its quarterly earnings guidance.
107;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-12-03T16:09:34Z;US retailers report tough November;;Leading US retailers reported November sales that were broadly lower than expected, as a post-Thanksgiving rush failed to offset earlier weak demand.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly comparable sales figures, said its index for the month rose just 0.7 per cent from last year, when sales slumped. Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the “the bottom line is that comp store sales were very disappointing ahead of the critical December holiday shopping season”.“The standard line from many retailers was a stronger year-on-year Black Friday [post-Thanksgiving] weekend was not enough to offset very weak sales throughout most of the month.”JC Penney, the low price department store, reported a 5.9 per cent fall in its comparable sales, in line with its forecast of a drop of 4 to 7 per cent, but on top of last November’s 11.9 per cent decline.“Strong sales for the Black Friday weekend offset slightly weaker sales beginning mid-month and leading up to Thanksgiving,” the company said.Kohl’s reported a 3 per cent increase in comparable sales, while Macy’s, the largest US traditional department store chain, reported a 6.1 per cent fall in comparable sales. Macy’s said its post Thanksgiving sales had been “below expectations”, which it attributed to competing sales promotions, and also highlighted the impact of the unseasonably warm weather on winter clothes sales.Target, the second largest discounter, said its comparable November sales were down 1.5 per cent against last November, with softer sales in the first three weeks “substantially offset by better-than-expected sales during our post-Thanksgiving Two-Day sale”.The retailer said it has seen strong sales of consumer electronics, toys and apparel, as well as household goods, small appliances and beauty. It also said that while overall sales levels had decreased, the number of transactions had increased.Walmart, the largest US retailer and Target’s rival, does not report monthly same store sales.Costco, the discount warehouse club that has been one of the beneficiaries of households seeking to cut spending, reported flat comparable sales at its US stores. The company noted that its top line sales were affected by lower food prices and by continuing deflation in flat screen TV pricing, where unit sales were up 15 per cent, while dollar sales saw a mid single digit percentage declines.Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen retailer, reported a 17 per cent fall in comparable sales, far worse than analysts’ expected. Aeropostale sales were slightly worse than expected, with a 7 percent rise, and its shares fell over 10 per cent in New York after its quarterly earnings forecast disappointed market analysts.Low price and discount retailers continued to outperform full price rivals, with both Ross Stores and TJX Companies reporting comparable sales up 8 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported overall comparable sales that were flat, but saw a 6 per cent increase at its low price Old Navy stores, offsetting comparable 4 per cent declines at its US Gap and Banana Republic stores, and a 5 per cent decline in its international business.Luxury retailers Neiman Marcus and Saks reported comparable sales declines of 7.5 per cent and 26.1 per cent, on top of the declines of around 30 per cent seen in November and December last year in the aftermath of the Wall Street crash. Saks said it still expected comparable store sales for the fourth quarter to be down in the high-single digits.
108;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-11-27T20:44:47Z;US consumers aim to dispel ‘frugal fatigue’;;Just after 4am on Friday morning in the Sears department store in the Newport Center mall in Jersey City, a middle-aged shop assistant was discreetly lamenting her lot.“Last year we opened at 5am,” she said. “This year it was 4. Next year, it will be 3 probably. And after that, the whole night.”Behind her, a crowd of shoppers seethed around the check-out desks in the store’s electronics department in pursuit of “early bird” post-Thanksgiving bargains.On “Black Friday” – the day that US pre-Christmas shopping begins in earnest – opening the store even earlier than usual has proved a popular gambit for US retailers, as they slog their way through the slump in consumer spending that hit when Wall Street crashed a little over a year ago.At the other end of the Newport mall, the JC Penney department store had already upped the ante on Sears and its rival Kohl’s.Penney’s was one of the first to move to a 4am post-Thanksgiving opening two years ago, but on Friday the Jersey City store opened at 3.30am – half an hour earlier than advertised.Elsewhere, Gap’s Old Navy clothing chain opened at 3am, when a queue of 150 people was already lined up outside its mid-Manhattan store in New York.Toys R Us moved its opening to midnight, drawing more than a thousand people to its Times Square location. But while shoppers were out in force, it was hard to find anyone planning to spend more this Christmas than last year.Jazz Alexander, a young student standing in a queue of more than 1,500 people outside Best Buy in Jersey City, said she expected her spending this year to be “lower than last year”, while her friend Kiki Jenkins said she was “definitely on a budget”.In an even longer line outside the local Target discount store, Shanae Felder said she was looking for “a little bit of everything”. “I want the vacuum cleaner, the microwave, a GPS system and the TV,” she said, listing four of the discounter’s “door-buster bargains”. But she still expected her spending to remain “about the same” as last year.Although sales data for the period will not come out until next week, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, said his annual morning visits to stores in Manhattan and the New York area suggested the numbers of people turning out to shop this year were similar to last.In 2008, the industry saw a 3.4 per cent drop in sales in the November and December period against the previous year, according to the National Retail Federation. In September the NRF predicted that this year retail sales over the two holiday months would fall 1 per cent.But Mr Cohen said consumers this year seemed more focused on their purchases. “The big difference this year is that the consumer is coming in with intent to buy,” he said.“This year anyone coming out has a mission: they know what they want, where they want to buy it and how much to pay for it. It is more planned.”He also cited anecdotal evidence from shoppers turning out on Friday that suggested consumers who had been holding back on discretionary spending were now prepared to spend on holiday-related promotions, to dispel “frugal fatigue”.Mr Cohen said: “A glaring majority said clearly, yes, they have been waiting to spend, that this is the time, and that they haven’t purchased anything for themselves all year.”Retailers acknowledge there is no guaranteed link between their performance during the holiday season, and the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales.If sales on the day turn out to be up on last year, retailers will need to see steady spending in the weeks up to Christmas and they will hope consumers do not keep their wallets closed in anticipation of price-cuts in the final days before Christmas.
109;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-11-27T12:52:58Z;US retailers turn to social media on ‘Black Friday’;;US retailers were on Friday unleashing a traditional barrage of post-Thanksgiving holiday shopping promotions, with the National Retail Federation expecting 134m Americans to head for the stores.This year, however, the retailers have reinforced their traditional efforts with an array of social-networking weapons including Twitter, the micro-blogging website.Retailers including discounters Target and Walmart, and department store groups Macy’s, Kohl’s and JC Penney have used Facebook pages to publish the “doorbuster” and “early bird” deals traditionally announced in newspaper advertising inserts on Thanksgiving, the day before “Black Friday” – so called because it was once the day on which retailers’ ledgers for the year moved out of the red and into the black.Brad Smith, head of social networking at Best Buy, said the electronics retailer had targeted its more than 1m Facebook fans when it decided this year to publish its Black Friday deals early for the first time.“We released the deals at 2am last Sunday, and even at that time of night we had literally 1,000 responses within an hour or two,” said Mr Smith.Best Buy is also using Twitter for the first time to publicise its “deal of the day” running on the shopping days leading up to Christmas. “This is the first year in which social media is playing such an important role for all of our marketing,” said Mr Smith.Other stores planning to use Twitter to pull in shoppers include Target, JC Penney, American Eagle and Nordstrom.Further, more than a dozen top retailers are launching customised mobile e-commerce sites ahead of the holidays.Alongside traditional buy-one-get-one-free deals, more conventional strategies have included stores opening early, with Toys R Us joining a handful of retailers that planned to open at midnight for the first time. Some stores, such as Old Navy and Gap, were even opening at midday on Thanksgiving itself.Other retailers including Target, the discounter, and Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing chain, are for the first time offering money-back gift cards on sales.Toys R Us is also seeking to woo shoppers by guaranteeing the first 100 people in queues outside its stores the chance to buy a $10 Zhu Zhu Pet robotic hamster – the season’s hottest toy.But the retailers’ promotional activity this year will also reflect less desperation than last year, when the slump in spending after September’s Wall Street slide forced drastic price cuts to clear stock. Clothing retailers in particular have entered the two-month holiday season with inventory levels that are more than 10 per cent below last year.In spite of the marketing hullabaloo, retail analysts point out that the day is not necessarily an indicator of how retailers will perform over the entire holiday shopping season.Mike Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that the day was “typically is not a precursor of the entire holiday season’s sales picture”.Follow Jonathan Birchall’s Black Friday at http://twitter.com/Birchall_Jon
110;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
111;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-11-17T21:25:27Z;Economy fashions JC Penney’s outlook;;Mike Ullman believes Main Street fashion in the US may be taking its cues from the gloomy state of the US economy, even though discerning buyers are staying well away from greys and blacks.“Certainly the bright colours and the more whimsical things that are selling represent the desire on the part of the consumer to kind of escape some of the mood in the economy,” says the laconic chief executive of JC Penney, the mainstream US department store.But as the company’s more than 1,000 stores across the US enter the holiday shopping season, Mr Ullman is expecting his mainstream middle American shoppers to continue mixing whimsy with a solid dose of reality.The customer, he says, “has made a bigger decision to focus on need, and focus on the basics, and less on the most discretionary items like fine jewellery or bigger ticket home items”.JC Penney’s stores, which sell clothing, household furnishings and home goods, have served as an indicator of the health of the US consumer. In the summer of 2007, as the slowdown spread beyond the home improvement sector, the retailer saw months of comparable sales gains turn negative.Then in September and October 2008, as shoppers cut back sharply in the aftermath of Wall Street’s crash, JC Penney’s sales fell by double digits. Comparable sales have continued around similarly depressed levels, with some limited improvements, over the following months.Now, the retailer is entering the holiday shopping season with 12 per cent less inventory than it had last year. Mr Ullman says the store will still be highlighting promotional offers but that it will be different from last year, when the retailers were frantically trying to avoid being left with merchandise as consumers cut back.“We are still a very promotional department store and we know that the customer likes to shop promotion,” he says. “But it will be more of what she wants, instead of what we didn’t sell last month and the previous month.”The retailer performed slightly better than its conservative forecasts in the year to date. Its initial forecasts were for a 10 per cent drop in full-year same-store sales but its revised estimate is for a 6.5 to 7 per cent fall. But Mr Ullman, a former luxury retailer who joined JC Penney in 2004, says his shoppers remain cautious.“The economists are seeing signs of an economic rebound,” he says. But unemployment remains “a major overhang on the consumer’s sentiment”, which is also constrained by the drop in home equity values, and pressure on credit limits. The latter, he says “hasn’t helped our category but it might be the right thing for the economy”.He expects that the markets hardest hit by the housing collapse, such as Florida, may “have years to go before they recover”, while seeing more strength in the north-east and in “river cities” of the Midwest, such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Little Rock and St Louis.Mr Ullman, a member of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is also disappointed with what he sees as the failure of the Obama administration’s $787bn federal stimulus package, passed in February, to create new jobs.“From the middle American consumer’s point of view, it was not much help,” he says, arguing that it was too focused on major infrastructure projects. “It wasn’t timely, it wasn’t targeted. It didn’t accomplish what the stated objective was.“The best stimulus is less withholding tax, because it’s immediate, we know it’s cash and we know it will be spent. The least effective is some project that’s three years off that is not essential.”The recession has also brought some opportunities for JC Penney. The bankruptcy last year of Mervyn’s, a California-based regional competitor, has translated into comparatively stronger sales for both JC Penney and its rival Kohl’s on the West Coast. And while cutting back on expenses, Penney went ahead with the opening of its first flagship store in Manhattan in September.It has also just signed a deal to become, from next year, the exclusive seller of women’s clothing from Liz Claiborne, the women’s clothing brand.“We’re going to offer that brand at a better price point to the consumer, and we’re going to make more money because of the way we’re sourcing it,” he says. The brand, he argues, will help entice customers from higher priced competitors, and play to a new focus on value. “I think there will be a new pragmatism. Customers are not giving up on all things discretionary, but when they spend, they want to get good value.”
112;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-11-12T22:01:34Z;Sagging oil price drags on Wall Street;;Sinking oil prices dragged US stocks lower in choppy trading on Thursday, overshadowing a rush of deals and higher profit at Walmart.Investors also remained cautious after the previous session’s rally when Wall Street closed at its highest level since October last year. Data showing a steeper drop in claims for unemployment benefits for unemployment benefits than had been expected lifted confidence.But crude oil inventory readings, revealing a surprise increase in stockpiles, weighed on the market.After dipping in and out of the red in early trading, the S&P 500 declined steadily towards the end of the session, closing 1 per cent lower at 1,087.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to 10,197.47 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,149.02.“Every time the S&P has approached 1,100, it seems to hit a wall but one of these days it’s going to blow right through that number and may not look back for a while,” said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of Gamco Growth Fund. “There’s so much cash on the sidelines that people who have been missing the rally are beginning to panic.”Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, reported quarterly profit above expectations due to aggressive cost-cutting.The group also said it had gained market share in the US, the UK and Mexico.However, its forecast for the fourth quarter was at the lower end of analyst estimates. Its shares gained 0.5 per cent to $53.24.Kohl’s, the fourth-largest department store chain in the US, reported higher-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, lifting the company’s shares just 0.1 per cent to $54.64.Like Walmart, the retailer also gave a more cautious outlook for the imminent holiday period than Wall Street had been expecting.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, shares in Green Mountain Coffee fell 10 per cent to $68.35 after the Vermont-based roaster forecast first-quarter earnings below analyst estimates. However, the shares were still up more than 160 per cent from last year due, in part, to Walmart’s agreement to stock the brand and the continued appeal of premium coffee in the downturn.The technology sector gave one of the day’s best performances after a spurt of deal activity.After the closing bell on Wednesday, Hewlett-Packard announced that it had struck a deal to buy 3Com for $2.7bn in cash, presenting a significant challenge to its rival Cisco Systems.The acquisition is set to make HP, already the largest personal computer maker, a stronger player in Cisco’s core market of networking gear.HP shares lost 0.6 per cent to $49.70 while 3Com surged 31.1 per cent to $7.46. Meanwhile, Cisco slipped 2.2 per cent to $23.40.Reports had previously suggested HP would buy Brocade Communication Systems, another manufacturer of networking gear.News of the deal with 3Com prompted analysts to cut their ratings on Brocade, causing the shares to drop 12.7 per cent to $8.08.Chipmakers Intel and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to settle their long-running dispute over competitive and licensing issues.AMD shares surged 21.8 per cent to $6.48 and Intel was down 0.8 per cent at $19.68.Applied Materials, the largest company in the chipmaker industry, reported its first quarterly profit in a year due to an increase in orders. However, the group also said it plans to shed 1,500 jobs in a further effort to cut costs.The restructuring plan is expected to achieve total annualised cost savings of about $450m. The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $12.82.Churchill Downs, owner of the horse racing track that hosts the Kentucky Derby, announced it would buy the online betting company Youbet.com in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $127m. Churchill shares lost 2.6 per cent to $30.76 while Youbet gained 11.6 per cent to $2.69.Shares in United Technologies lost 0.4 per cent to $66.70 after it said it would acquire General Electric’s security business for $1.82bn. General Electric shares edged 0.5 per cent lower to $15.75.
113;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-11-05T16:26:28Z;US shoppers still cautious in October;;US chain retailers’ October sales figures on Thursday underlined shoppers’ cautious mood, with many mainstream retailers still seeing flat or declining sales against the lows seen a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store, reported comparable sales at stores open at least a year that were only slightly down from October 2008, decreasing 0.8 per cent. Target, the discounter, also reported sales slightly down at 0.1 per cent, with Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, describing the performance as “slightly better than our expectation”.But sales at JC Penney, the mid-range department store with around 1,000 locations, decreased 4.5 per cent. The company said it had seen better-than-expected sales during the first half of the month, but that sales “turned softer and were below expectations in the final week”. Its rival Kohl’s reported a 1.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, missing Wall Street’s forecast of a gain of almost 5 per cent.Teen retailers also continued to struggle. Abercrombie & Fitch saw its comparable sales fall 15 per cent, and American Apparel saw a 6 per cent drop. Aeropostale reported a positive 3 per cent, but far below the 14 per cent gain expected by Wall Street.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, delivered a positive surprise, reporting a 4 per cent increase that marked its first company-wide comparable-sales increase for two-and-a-half years.Gap’s improvement came against the 16 per cent fall in same-store sales it saw last October, underlining the fact that most full-price retailers are still seeing sales subsantially below pre-crash levels.More well-heeled customers also showed some readiness to spend. Nordstrom, the fashion department store, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales, while Saks saw a 0.7 per cent increase - against last October’s 16.6 per cent fall.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales data, said its index of comparable-store sales rose 2.2 per cent, a second consecutive monthly increase.The index was boosted by continuing stength of off-price retailers TJ Maxx and Ross Stores, which reported same-store sales gains of 10 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, continuing to benefit from consumers’ frugal focus.A monthly survey of consumer confidence released on Thursday by RBC also highlighted a mood of continuing caution. RBC’s consumer attitudes and spending by household index fell to 30.5, down 21.6 points from October’s 51.8 reading. The group described the fall as “the sharpest one-month drop in consumer sentiment since last autumn’s financial crisis”, and cited factors including unemployment concerns.“Although we have pulled back from the abyss, consumer attitudes remain susceptible to negative news,” said Ira Jersey, head of US interest rate strategy for RBC Capital Markets.
114;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-10-08T19:36:47Z;US retailers in first gain since 2008 crisis;;Leading US retailers on Thursday reported their first monthly sales gain since the financial collapse of September 2008, although most still saw lower sales than a year ago as shoppers remained focused on bargain hunting.The 1.1 per cent rise in Retail Metrics’ September comparable sales index emerged as the Department of Labor reported that the number of workers claiming jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level this year.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, attributed the comparable sales gain in September – the first increase since August 2008 – to stronger autumn fashions and promotions, and comparisons with a year ago when sales plunged. But he warned: “We would not interpret this month’s results as a sign the consumer is back.”The monthly sales figures were supported by a later Labor Day weekend, which shifted some back-to-school sales into September from August.The figures showed shoppers continuing to favour lower-price retailers as they face uncertainties over unemployment and tighter credit. For example, Gap’s Old Navy low-price chain reported a 13 per cent surge in comparable sales, while overall same-store sales fell 8 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, at its more upscale Gap and Banana Republic stores.Comparable sales also rose 5.5 per cent at Kohl’s, the low-price department store, and by 7 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, at TJX and Ross Stores, which focus on remaindered brands.By contrast, Saks and Neiman Marcus, the upmarket department stores, underlined the comparative weakness of US luxury demand, with comparable sales down 11.6 per cent and 16.9 per cent, respectively.Sales at Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, fell 2.4 per cent, while Target, the mass discounter, reported a 1.2 per cent decline. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said the retailer “remained cautious” about the fourth quarter, despite the stronger-than-expected September. The National Retail Federation has warned that total US retail sales excluding gasoline and restaurants in November and December will fall by 1 per cent to the levels last seen four years ago.
115;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-09-03T17:56:15Z;US retailers battle through August;;"US retailers on Thursday reported increasing signs of steadying consumer demand, tentatively signalling the end to the steep year-on-year sales declines that have forced waves of store closures and cost-cutting since last September.August’s comparable sales numbers from leading retail chains again declined during the month but by significantly less than in the preceding months.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of the monthly sales numbers showed a 2.3 per cent decline compared with the 4-5 per cent falls seen in recent months, the best performance for the index since September last year.Several retailers, including Costco, Gap, Target and Kohl’s, delivered better than expected sales numbers, despite the absence of a boost from pre-Labour Day holiday sales.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the numbers suggested the decline in US retail sales may have “bottomed out” in July when the index fell 4.7 per cent.Mid-price and discount retailers also reported anecdotal evidence of renewed interest in discretionary spending – such as strong television sales at Costco, the warehouse club; and stronger women’s clothing sales at JC Penney and Kohl’s, the department stores; and stronger accessory sales at Target, the mass discounter.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said he believed the monthly sales reports showed a shift in the fundamental mood, and “may indeed be the start of a recovery for the industry”.“I think there is a turning point of sorts that will only get better as we look ahead.”Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount stores, reported a 0.2 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month, while Old Navy reported a 4 per cent rise.Target, with more than 1,700 large discount stores, reported a 2.9 per cent fall in comparable sales, against Wall Street’s expectations of a drop of more than 5 per cent. Costco, the largest US warehouse club, said comparable sales in the US, excluding petrol sales, were flat, again better than analysts expected.Retailers’ year-on-year comparable sales figures will improve from September as they contrast with the sharp monthly declines seen after last year’s financial crash. However, overall sales volumes will remain at levels significantly below last year, and most retailers have cut back on inventories for the autumn and holiday seasons.Luxury spending remains depressed. Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, again reported sales sharply down from last year, with comparable declines respectively of 16.6 and 19.6 per cent.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports same store sales on a monthly basis."
116;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-08-13T21:24:52Z;Wall Street hits new highs for the year;;US stocks reluctantly joined the global equity rally on Thursday, staggering to new highs for the year after weak economic data hampered what could have been a stellar day of trade.Results from Wal-Mart added to pre-market optimism sparked by the unexpected return to growth in France and Germany.But the news that retail sales for July unexpectedly declined, while the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week rose, kept the lid on any major rally.“Retail sales were very disappointing,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “Consumption makes up 60-70 per cent of GDP, so a dive in consumption is more important than growth elsewhere.”But the promise of global growth meant equities rallied towards the close, ending in positive territory after a choppy day of trade.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,012.73, its highest close for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 9,398.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.5 per cent to 2,009.35.“People are desperate for the party to start again, which means that stocks are rallying even though the underlying economy is still weak,” said George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers.“They then gather momentum as investors chase the rally.”Consumer discretionary stocks were watched closely after the sales figures and Wal-Mart’s results.The world’s biggest retailer made better profits than expected and predicted comparable sales could rise 2 per cent in the next quarter. This helped boost the shares 2.7 per cent to $51.88 in spite of disappointing quarterly revenues.Drinks group Dr Pepper Snapplealso beat earnings expectations and, after the company raised its full-year forecast, the shares climbed 6.2 per cent to $24.98.Clothing retailer Urban Outfitters also impressed with its earnings after becoming one of the few in its sector to report a quarterly rise in sales, which helped lift profit above expectations and boost its shares 3 per cent to $29.06.Ford was another stand-out performer during the day after the company said the success of the “cash-for-clunkers” programme to encourage consumers to buy new cars would mean it had to increase production over the rest of the year. The shares gained 2.6 per cent to $7.90.A late bounce saw department store Kohl’s also find gains. The company raised its full-year forecast following the quarterly results, and its shares rose 0.2 per cent to $52.39 even though that forecast remains below analyst estimates.The rest of the consumer discretionary sector did not fare so well, however, and homebuilders were particularly badly hurt both by the retail sales numbers and by analyst downgrades.The recent run-up in share prices in the sector encouraged Citigroup to recommend selling shares in DR Horton while Raymond James rated KB Home at “underperform”.DR Horton fell 3.7 per cent to $12.95 while KB Home gave up 2.5 per cent to $17.83.But strength from materials stocks bolstered the market. Metals prices were higher on the promise of improved demand from abroad and shares in miners were especially strong.Newmont Mining picked up 2.5 per cent to $41.47 while rival gold miner Freeport McMoRan gained 4.9 per cent to $66.07.Financial stocks also showed some strength with several large banks benefiting from the news that Paulson & Co, the hedge fund controlled by John Paulson, who predicted the housing crash, had taken large positions in them. Paulson became the fourth-largest shareholder in Bank of America, which rose 6.7 per cent to $17, and the second-largest at Regions Financial, which gained 7.9 per cent to $5.20.This came on a morning when trading in BofA’s shares was delayed by technical issues, the second trading problem to hit the New York Stock Exchange this week.Technology stocks were helped by positive comments from analysts. Apple’s shares climbed 1.9 per cent to $168.42 after Barclays praised its product pipeline and put a price target on the stock of $208.
117;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-08-10T20:47:39Z;Strong dollar takes toll on metals groups;;US stocks drifted from last week’s highs on Monday, with investors looking to bank profits even as several experts gave a relatively bullish analysis for equities.Analysts at Citigroup said they expected companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index to earn more in 2010 than they had previously forecast.This followed suggestions over the weekend from Laura Tyson, an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, and Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, that the recession may be ending.But sellers were in the ascendency on Monday as investors looked to take advantage of the recent four-week rally and pull money off the table.The S&P and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 0.3 per cent down at 1,007.10 and 9,337.95 respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.4 per cent to 1,992.24.Investors were also betting that stocks could be set for a sharper tumble, with futures for the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility, trading higher than the index itself.“There is an idea that people are buying short-dated S&P volatility options in anticipation of a sell-off,” said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital.Cyclical sectors, which led the buying last week, were the steepest fallers, with industrial, retail and materials stocks all lagging behind the market.Metals producers were among the hardest hit as investors bought the dollar, betting that the unexpected dip in unemployment announced last week could signal that the US will recover ahead of other economies.The currency’s strength hampered metals prices and shares in companies that produce them. US Steel lost 2.3 per cent to $43.85, while rival AK Steel dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.31.It was also a disappointing day for retailers, many of which will announce their results this week.Electronics retailer Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $37.66 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the shares, warning increased competition could hamper the company’s growth.Other retailers also declined ahead of earnings announcements later in the week. Macy’s dropped 4.8 per cent to $15.23 and Kohl’s gave up 1.8 per cent to $52.53.“I don’t think there is going to be much new information from retailers’ results,” said Mr Knapp.“They are likely to show very little top line growth, and investors are waiting now to see what happens during the back-to-school season.”But McDonald’s provided some optimism on consumer spending after it announced stronger July sales than analysts had been expecting, helped by the success of the company’s recent McCafé coffee offering. Its shares climbed 1.9 per cent to $56.27.The financial sector was mixed, with volumes much lower than they were last week.Citigroup rose 2.3 per cent to $3.94, outperforming other banks and building on last week’s stellar performance, during which its shares rose more than 20 per cent.Bank of America also found gains, rising 1.6 per cent to $16.68, but Wells Fargo dropped 0.4 per cent to $28.64.Meanwhile Freddie Mac, the mortgage provider rescued by the government last year, surged 128.4 per cent to $1.69 after it reported its first profit in two years and said it would not need to seek more government aid in the foreseeable future.State Street then triggered a dip in the sector during the afternoon after saying the amount of money it has set aside to cover legal claims coming from subprime losses may not be enough.The stock and sector dropped on the news, with some appearing to misinterpret the words as meaning the money manager was increasing its subprime loss reserve.Both then recovered much of that ground, but remained lower for the day. State Street closed 2.4 per cent down at $52.57.“A lot of the names that have done extremely well have gone back a bit, which looks like a normal profit-taking day,” said Jeff Mortimer, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab. “That is a healthy pause for the markets.”
118;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-08-06T19:04:37Z;US stores suffer gloomy July;;Leading US retailers had another month of year-on-year comparable sales declines in July, and several said they managed to maintain or improve profit margins on leaner inventory levels and reduced price markdowns.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly same-store sales, said on Thursday its index for July was down 4.7 per cent against the period last year. The index excludes Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, which no longer reports monthly sales numbers.Consumer concern over rising unemployment and the economy hit sales, but other factors were the later start to the back-to-school shopping season than last year and the fact that several states moved annual sales-tax-free shopping days to August.Only a handful of retailers reported comparable sales gains, including the “off-price” stores TJX and Ross. Off-price stores, which buy excess stock from other brands, have performed well throughout the recession.Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount-style department stores, also reported a 0.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, its first gain since April last year. Its rival JC Penney said its comparable sales fell 12.3 per cent, while Target, the discounter, reported a 6.5 per cent drop, and Macy’s was down 10.7 per cent.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 2 per cent fall in comparable sales at its US stores, excluding petrol, as lower prices for food and large electronics items including televisions offset continued gains in transactions. Costco’s unit sales of TVs were up 30 per cent on July last year.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks department stores reporting comparable sales down 27 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.Several retailers reported strongest sales in the southwest and north-east of the US but continued weakness in Florida, the south-east and in the Midwest. Kohl’s said its stores in the south-west had recorded double-digit sales gains in comparable stores.In spite of the overall sluggishness, several retailers raised conservative earnings estimates, including Gap, Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said retailers’ attention was focused on the back-to-school selling surge, from the end of August and to the first week of September.“I think inventories are going to be lean, and they could leave some sales on the table as a result …But if I were them, I would take that bet,” he said, noting that in July sales “remained in a rut”.
119;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-07-07T21:07:12Z;Wall St slides ahead of earnings season;;"US stocks fell to their lowest levels in two months on Tuesday as investors sold shares ahead of the start of the second-quarter earnings season.Confidence in the economic recovery was knocked by talk of a potential second government stimulus plan after Laura Tyson, an economic adviser to president Barack Obama, and House Democratic leader Steny Hoyer both suggested there could be merits to such a package.Economic fears and a strong dollar took its toll on commodities, with the price of oil falling for a fifth consecutive session.Energy producers followed, and Schlumberger dropped 4.4 per cent to $49.20 while Exxon Mobil lost 2.3 per cent to $66.56.Industrial stocks also suffered, and General Electric gave up 4.1 per cent to $11.01.But Alcoa, the aluminium producer, was buoyant after Klaus Kleinfield, its chief executive, said he was ”very optimistic” about sales ahead of its earnings on Wednesday. The shares gained 1.6 per cent to $9.41.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 2 per cent at 881.03, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9 per cent to 8,163.60 and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 2.3 per cent to 1,746.17.That came after sharp selling in the afternoon as the S&P fell below its 200-day moving average, which is seen as a key support level.“The ten-year Treasury bond has taken off and the dollar is strengthening, which is bad news for stocks,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams. “We got way too positive too soon.”Analysts predicted that the market would remain subdued at least until Thursday, after Alcoa has reported its results.“Everyone is taking a deep breath before earnings,” said Andy Corn, chief investment officer, equities, at Beacon Trust.The pressure from energy and materials stocks was counteracted by strength from health insurers after president Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel stressed that a public health insurance plan would help keep the private sector competitive.Health insurers, which have suffered on concerns about the effects of the president’s reforms, bounced on Tuesday.UnitedHealth gained 4.5 per cent to $25.17 and Aetna rose 6.3 per cent to $25.94.“It shows how sensitive those stocks are that some words from the White House last night have given those stocks a pop,” said
Mr Corn.Certain microchip manufacturers performed well after Bank of America raised its ratings for several companies in the sector.The bank said it saw a “definitive turn in end demand” and recommended that investors buy stocks in Intel, the market leader.But Intel lost its early gains amid a wider sell-off in the technology sector and finished 1.8 per cent down at $16.25.BofA also upgraded Marvell Technology, which gained 0.9 per cent to $11.50 and LSI, which climbed
2.2 per cent to $4.65.Banking stocks were mixed as banks continued to raise capital to bolster their balance sheets.KeyCorp was one of the sector’s strongest stocks after KBW upgraded the shares, saying the bank’s balance sheet was stronger than the Treasury required after it raised fresh capital. Keycorp’s shares climbed 4.1 per cent to $5.29.But shares in Discover Financial, the credit card group, dropped 10.8 per cent to $9.37 after the company announced it would issue $500m of stock.Discover, which only made a profit last quarter after successful litigation against rivals Visa and MasterCard, forecast a default rate of up to 9 per cent in the third quarter.Goldman Sachs gave an initial boost to Kohl’s after it upgraded the shares, saying it is the best positioned department store to show positive same-store sales in the fourth quarter. But Kohl’s could not resist the selling and its stock closed 0.9 per cent down at $42.30.Goldman downgraded BJs Wholesale Club, however, the warehouse club that has prospered as shoppers look for bargains.The bank said consumers would soon begin returning to more discretionary retailers, and BJ’s shares fell 2 per cent to $31.46."
120;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-06-25T20:43:58Z;Retail sector leads Wall Street rally;;"US stocks staged an impressive broad-based rally on Thursday with retail stocks leading the way.Home furnishings retailers fared especially well after Bed Bath & Beyond reported an unexpected rise in profits with cost cuts and new store openings making up for a fall in same-store sales. Its shares climbed 9.5 per cent to $31.08.That lifted rival retailers, with Home Depot rising 3.9 per cent to $23.57 and
Target gaining 4.2 per cent to $40.31. Lowe’spicked up 3.8 per cent to $18.87.Office Depot, meanwhile, jumped 7.8 per cent to $4.42 after Goldman Sachs said the $350m cash injection from BC Partners earlier this week could enable the retailer to merge with another company.An apparent stabilisation in sales of homewares also encouraged JPMorgan to upgrade shares in JC Penney, which gained 6 per cent to $28.20, lifting rival department stores with it.Kohl’s picked up 2.3 per cent to $44.43 and Macyâ€™s climbed 3.9 per cent to $11.83.But there was bad news elsewhere in the consumer sector as Nike reported quarterly earnings that missed consensus estimates once restructuring costs had been factored in.Investors were also disappointed by the news that forward orders had fallen 12 per cent and Nike shares lost 3.3 per cent to $51.28.Economic data showed that the US economy contracted 5.5 per cent in the first three months of the year, slightly less than had previously been estimated.But investors focused on the fact that more people claimed jobless benefits last week than expected.The data saw the markets open in negative territory but they then rose as Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress on last year’s takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America.Mr Bernanke was accused on Wednesday by a senior Republican of being part of a “cover-up” concerning what disclosures should be made about the deal.That knocked the market’s faith in the Fed on the day it decided to keep interest rates low, but some of that confidence returned on Thursday as Mr Bernanke defended his position.Mr Bernanke was also supported by President Barack Obama, who said he had confidence in the job he had done.“Mr Bernanke’s comments seemed fairly justifiable, and that probably held up the market a little bit,” said Nick Kalivas.“People seemed pretty nervous about the testimony but I am not sure there was anything there that constituted the smoking gun that might quicken his demise.”The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all rose 2.1 per cent to 920.26, 8,472.40 and 1,829.54, respectively.“It has been very difficult to push this market down,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “There has been a continual flow of investor money as the awareness grows that recovery is coming.”Bank of America fell during the morning, with many on Wall Street saying the investigation into the Merrill purchase could make Ken Lewis, chief executive, more vulnerable than Mr Bernanke.It was also hit by analysis from Citi, which warned that BofA could have a
difficult quarter as it builds capital in case of further loan losses.But the shares picked up ground during the day as nervousness about Mr Bernanke’s testimony abated. They closed flat at $12.35.There was a glimmer of hope on US housing as Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar, the homebuilder, said he sensed some pent-up demand from potential home buyers. This helped the company’s shares climb 17.5 per cent to $9.19, even though it reported a bigger loss than expected as falling house prices continued to take their toll.Other homebuilders were also lifted. Centex advanced 5.8 per cent to $8.58 while KB Homeclimbed 8.3 per cent to $14.77.There were encouraging signs on investor appetite as Medidata, a clinical technology company, made an impressive debut on the Nasdaq, jumping 21.4 per cent to $17 on the day of its initial public offering. The shares had initially been priced at $14."
121;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-06-11T20:37:57Z;Wall St adds to gains as oil prices surge;;US stocks closed at their highest level of the year on Thursday as the surging price of oil boosted energy stocks, which added to the impetus created by fresh data suggesting that the recession is abating.The figures showed that, since January, the fewest number of people claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, well below what analysts had forecast.Meanwhile, the climbing price of oil drove energy companies higher. Chevron gained 2.4 per cent to $71.90 while Schlumberger rose 4.9 per cent to $62.18.This helped markets open higher, and they extended the gains after an auction of 30-year Treasury notes was well received, easing fears that rising interest rates could start to hurt the US consumer.They dipped shortly before the close, but the benchmark S&P 500 index was still able to finish 0.6 per cent higher at 944.89, the highest closing price since November last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 8,770.92 and the Nasdaq Composite index also rose 0.5 per cent to 1,862.37.“Jobless claims are moving in the right direction, although we don’t know if we’ve seen the effect of the automotive plant shutdowns yet,” said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial.Consumer staples received a boost from indications that retail sales rebounded in May following April’s surprise fall.Defensive stocks in household name consumer companies did well. Philip Morris gained 0.8 per cent to $43.88, while Coca-Cola climbed 1.2 per cent to $48.58.But economists warned the numbers were not as good as the headline figures suggested, with much of the rise coming on the back of escalating fuel prices.“Given the government’s large fiscal stimulus we would have hoped that maybe sales would have been even higher,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “But they have been kept lower by the sharp rise in the price of gasoline.” Retail stocks remained suppressed on the back of similar analysis from a number of experts. Target fell 2 per cent to $39.55 while Kohl’s declined 1.9 per cent to $45.92.Bank of America was one of the strongest performers in the financial sector after it was upgraded by analysts at KBW, who said the bank’s balance sheet was much stronger after its recent capital raising.Shares in the bank, whose chief executive Ken Lewis addressed Congress on Thursday morning on the details of the takeover of Merrill Lynch last year, advanced 8.3 per cent to $12.97.Two of the country’s largest regional banks also did well after being upgraded by Goldman Sachs, which saw relative value in the shares of Regions Financial and Fifth Third. Regions jumped 9.3 per cent to $4.37, while Fifth Third gained 5.9 per cent to $7.77.Elsewhere in the financial sector, BlackRock confirmed its $13bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors to create the world’s biggest money manager. Early reports of the deal have sent BlackRock’s shares up nearly 10 per cent this week, and they rose 2.3 per cent on Thursday to $182.60.Homebuilders suffered after news that the number of foreclosures in May was the third highest on record, dousing hopes that the housing market could be set for a swift recovery.Three of the largest US homebuilders fell sharply. Centex lost 5.4 per cent to $8.52, KB Home dropped 2.9 per cent to $14.45 and Pulte Homes gave up 5.7 per cent to $8.87.But steelmakers built on the week’s stellar gains as the price of steel continued to rise and the dollar continued to fall. US Steel picked up 4.2 per cent to $41.83 and AK Steel rose 5.2 per cent to $21.14.The battle for supremacy in the smartphone market took a new turn as Palm, which launched its Pre phone last weekend, appointed Jim Rubinstein, who helped develop the iMac and iPod at Apple, as chief executive. Palm’s shares climbed 12 per cent to $13.43 on the news.UnitedHealth was one of the S&P’s heaviest fallers, however, after Oppenheimer warned that the health insurer’s aggressive bids for Medicare contracts could hurt profit margins in 2010. Its shares lost 6.5 per cent to $24.05.
122;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-05-14T20:47:33Z;Financial stocks boost Wall Street;;US equities broke their losing streak on Thursday following three consecutive days of selling as investors shrugged off negative unemployment data and took encouragement from the retail sector.Figures showed that many more people claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week than analysts had projected.But financial stocks managed to gain headway in the face of this data, in part as a result of the falling interbank lending rate, which saw its biggest drop in two months to a record low of 0.85 per cent.Citigroup gained 4.1 per cent to $3.55, Bank of America picked up 2.7 per cent to $11.31 and JPMorgan rose 4.4 per cent to $35.54.MBIA, the bond insurer, fell in early trade after a group of the world’s biggest banks filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming that it reduced its ability to pay policyholders by splitting its business into a “good bank” and “bad bank”.Its shares then recovered after the company said that the claim lacked merit and that the New York State Insurance Department approved the split “after a “thorough examination”. They closed 6.5 per cent up at $6.06.The impact of the figures on the broader market was tempered by several retailers’ reporting encouraging profits. This relieved some of the gloom surrounding consumer behaviour after the release of data on Wednesday that showed retail sales unexpectedly fell in April.Wal-Mart, the supermarket chain, reported profits that were in line with Wall Street’s expectations. But investors were concerned about lower-than-expected revenues and its shares lost 1.9 per cent to $49.10.Kohl’s, the chain of family department stores, opened higher after its profits beat analysts’ earnings estimates and the company raised its full-year profit forecast. But they fell back during the day while directors spoke to shareholders and closed down 1.7 per cent at $41.24.At the higher end of the market, Whole Foods, the organic food retailer, announced higher profits than expected after keeping costs low. Its comparable sales fell but not as far as predicted and the shares gained 2.8 per cent to $20.55.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1 per cent up at 893.07 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 8,331.32.The gains came as a surprise to many, who had expected the jobless figures to trigger a sell-off.“As people look for a bottoming process, they are focusing on retail sales as a leading indicator, rather than jobless claims, which people think of as a lagging indicator,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed, picking up 1.5 per cent to 1,689.21.It was helped by results from CA, the business software maker, whose profit beat expectations on the back of a long-running effort to cut costs. Its shares rose 5.5 per cent to $18.27.There was more turbulence in the automotive sector as shares in General Motors dropped close to the historic lows set on Tuesday after Fritz Henderson, chief executive, said that bankruptcy was now “probable”, and its shares lost 5 per cent to $1.15.Shares in its rival Fordjumped 4 per cent to $5.16, however, after Alan Mulally, chief executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting it was making “tremendous progress” on restructuring its balance sheet.Car parts makers also had a volatile day as the market digested news that Chrysler would terminate contracts with a quarter of its dealers.Shares in Lear swung over 38 per cent during the day. The company reported a quarterly loss, but its shares rose on hope it could renegotiate its debt. They fell back after the announcement from Chrysler and closed 5.7 per cent down at $1.32.Its competitor Johnson Controls has completed 70 per cent of its restructuring programme, according to Wachovia, which upgraded its shares, sending them up 5.5 per cent to $18.68.Exchanges were some of the day’s biggest winners as they stand to benefit from the government’s plan to move over-the-counter ­derivatives trading on to electronic platforms.CME, the Chicago-based exchange where futures are traded, gained 3.8 per cent to $284.37. Its rival Intercontinental Exchangerose 4.3 per cent to $100.76.
123;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-05-08T00:02:08Z;US retailers have cause to raise earnings call;;More than a dozen US retailers raised their earnings guidance on Thursday, after releasing April sales data that showed battered US shoppers displaying renewed interest in purchases of clothing and other discretionary items, while continuing to frequent low-cost stores.Companies raising guidance included the three largest US department store chains – JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s – as well as Target, the mass discounter.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales numbers, said its overall index for April showed a 1.5 per cent increase, supported in part by sales around Easter, which fell in March last year.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said the figures were better than expected and had been “aided by rising consumer confidence from improving market performance” as well as extra cash from lower tax payments and mortgage refinancing.Janet Hoffman, managing partner of Accenture’s North American retail practice, said “the overall picture is for a baby step towards [a] positive [environment]”.“I think we are definitely on the path towards moving out of the depth of the underperformance in consumer-facing retail,” she said.In a sign of resilience in the middle of the market, JC Penney said its strongest performing divisions had been women’s and children’s clothing, although overall comparable sales, against last April, were still down 6.6 per cent. Kohl’s, with comparable sales down 6.2 per cent, also reported strong children’s clothing sales as it raised its earnings guidance by over 10 cents a share.Target said its same-store sales increased by 0.3 per cent, adding that it had been able to avoid price-cutting and had seen better-than-expected profit margins. The retailer said it expected its first-quarter earnings to be “well above” the current $0.52 per share forecast by Wall Street.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, continued to benefit from budget-focused shoppers, reporting a stronger-than-expected 5 per cent increase in comparable store sales and gains in customer traffic. The company, which also announced that it would no longer issue monthly comparable sales data, said last week it had seen renewed strength in discretionary spending.Other low price retailers continued to fare well, including Dollar Tree, Ross and TJX. But luxury department stores Saks and Neiman Marcus continued to struggle.
124;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-04-09T15:23:05Z;US retailers see some signs of demand;;March sales figures from leading US retailers provided some shimmers of light amid the prevailing gloom, with a number of store chains reporting signs of an increased readiness to spend by still-cautious consumers.The months comparable sales figures were affected by the shift in the timing of Easter, which drives gift and clothing sales, from March to April this year. The monthly data from store chains can also reflect specific marketing and merchandising, rather than broader economic trends.But the March sales data offered some signs that middle-class shoppers, who snapped their wallets shut in the fourth quarter of last year, may be starting to resume cautious spending.JC Penney, the US department store focused on middle class consumers, said it had seen “a positive response” in women’s clothing and in its home business” as it reported a better-than-expected 7.6 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year. The retailer had forecast a low-double digit to mid-teen drop.The retailer raised its forecast for first quarter earnings, which will include a 23 cent pension costs non-cash charge, seeing a loss of 5 to 10 cents against a previous estimate of a 20 to 30 cent loss.Its rival Kohls reported a 4.3 per cent fall in same store sales. Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said the results “exceeded our expectations” and that home furnishing sales had also been its strongest business.Target, the discounter that is also heavily dependent on clothing and home sales, said it had “begun to see encouraging signs” in the operating results of both its stores and its credit card business. The retailer reported a 6 per cent drop in comparable March sales, but said it expected April sales to be essentially flat, due to the Easter shift.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported that comparable sales at its Supercenters and discount stores increased just 0.6 per cent, below Wall Street’s expectations. Including its Sam’s Club warehouses, which saw a 6 per cent increase, the retailer’s overall US same store sales rose by 1.4 per cent.But it said it expected its first quarter earnings to come in at the higher end of the 72 to 77 cents per share it forecast in February.Wal-Mart also reported the sixth consecutive month of increases in customer traffic. It said average transactions were lower, which it attributed to the Easter shift, and to moderating price rises in its grocery sales.The retailer said sales were again driven by grocery and pharmacy sales, but said that its home and “do-it-yourself” categories had seen mid-single digit comparable store sales gains.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks reporting comparables sales falls of 29.9 per cent and 23.6 per cent. Both reported weakness across all their merchandise categories.Elsewhere, Gap reported an 8 per cent fall in comparable sales, but said it had stopped the sales decline during the month at its troubled Old Navy division. Gap brand US sales were down 14 per cent, and Banana Republic fell 16 per cent. But the retailer said it had achieved profit margins above those seen last year.Despite the outbreaks of optimism, overall March sales fell by more than Wall Street expected. Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index fell 1.6 per cent, against the 0.6 per cent fall it had been expecting. But it also noted that several retailers including Hot Topic, American Eagle and Cache, the fashion retailers, as well as “off price” discounters TJX and Ross Stores had raised first quarter earnings guidance.
125;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-02-26T21:48:41Z;Wall Street pulled lower by healthcare sector;;US stocks fell on Thursday after a bright start was wiped out by the news that President Barack Obama intends to cut subsidies in the healthcare sector as part of his reform plan.Health stocks promptly dropped, losing 5.1 per cent overall.Humana, a big beneficiary of government support in making healthcare plans for the elderly, fell 19.5 per cent to $23.64.UnitedHealth, which Mr Obama plans to make bid for a new style of insurance plan along with Humana and WellPoint, fell 12.9 per cent to $20.07. Coventry Health also lost out, tumbling 14.4 per cent to $11.88.“Traders realise that the changes may begin to squeeze healthcare companies either through lowered premiums or decreased subsidies from the government,” wrote Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.The Obama administration’s plans also spelt bad news for the defence sector, as it vowed to end overspending and schedule delays in the US weapons program.Shares in Boeing fell 3.5 per cent to $32.71 while Northrop lost 2.9 per cent to $39.42 and General Dynamics was off 1.9 per cent to $45.68.The major falls from these sectors cancelled out the gains made by banks, which rallied as the administration also announced plans to set aside an additional $250bn for future bail-out funds.Bank of America was a winner, up 3.1 per cent to $5.32 and was helped by news that it was looking to sell First Republic Bank, a private bank inherited from Merrill Lynch.The rally included JPMorgan, which climbed 6.1 per cent to $23.05 on the day of its investor conference. The bank expected to open 120 new retail branches and projected a total of 12,000 job cuts resulting from the merger with Washington Mutual.Wells Fargo was another strong performer, rising 7.1 per cent to $14.40. Among several regional banks to enjoy strong gains, Fifth Third also did well, up 18 per cent at $2.29.The S&P financial index reflected the advances made by banks and was the strongest performing sector, up 2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down 1.6 per cent at 752.83 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.2 per cent at 7,182.08 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 2.4 per cent at 1,391.47 points.“There is a strong belief among the financial community that the centre of power has moved from New York to Washington,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equities strategist at Citigroup. “That is why the market moves on what the president says.”Stocks had rallied earlier in the day in spite of worse-than-expected economic data that showed continuing unemployment benefits passed the landmark 5m mark to a hit a fresh record..“The data is only going to get worse, and the figures on job losses are going to be very severe later this week,” said Mr Levkovich.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Global Banking & Markets wrote that the data would “do nothing to support serious follow through in better risk appetite today, even though the focus for the moment is very much on banks”.Consumer staples also performed badly, dragged down by Safeway, the grocery chain. Safeway shed 13 per cent to $18.37 after sales came in $400m less than analyst estimates. The sector as a whole fell 2.3 per cent.Several department stores rallied initially after Sears reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said it would be closing an additional 24 stores to cut costs.But the stocks fell again towards the close. Sears eased 0.8 per cent to $35.54. Kohl’s lost 1.6 per cent to $34.70 and JC Penney dropped 1.7 per cent to $15.43.Energy stocks fared well early in the day as crude oil continued to rise, hitting $45 at one point during early trade. The sector climbed in early trade but succumbed late in the day to finish just below the previous session’s level.Elsewhere, IBM bucked the general downward trend in the technology sector when it reaffirmed its full-year proft outlook and forecast a profit in its business services division.This came just a week after peer Hewlett-Packard cut its full-year outlook. IBM’s shares were up 3.6 per cent at $88.97 in afternoon trade, while HP also saw some benefit, rising 0.4 per cent to $30.24.
126;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-02-24T10:53:45Z;Liz Claiborne shifts sourcing strategy;;Liz Claiborne, one of the largest US clothing companies, is to hand its global sourcing operation over to Li & Fung, the Hong Kong-based trading company, in a deal that marks the evolutionary changes underway in the global clothing supply chain.The company, whose brands include Mexx, Juicy Couture and Kate Spade, was one of the first US clothing companies to shift manufacturing orders abroad in the late 1970s and 1980s, and to set up its own “direct sourcing” offices to oversee orders.It is now shifting to use of an agent, at a time when it is facing intense pressure in the US from steep declines in consumer confidence that have hit discretionary spending on women’s clothing particularly hard.Li & Fung already handles supply chain management for brands that include American Eagle, the youth fashion retailer, Tommy Hilfiger, and Kohl’s, the low cost department store, as well as KarstadtQuelle, the German retailer.Bill McComb, chief executive of Liz Claiborne, said the move was “a big shift”, given Liz Claiborne’s previous reliance upon its a direct sourcing operation that employed around 475 people in five offices in China, Indonesia and India.“I do think this will be seen as a bell-wether, because we were the first ones out, and we stood by a model of owning and managing the sourcing on our own,” he said.Li & Fung will pay around $80m to take over most of the existing staff and the offices, which handled around $1.3bn in orders in 2007.Mr McComb characterised the change, which he said would be largely revenue neutral, to underlying shifts in the global supply chain since the end of the old GATT trade system, under which garment exports to the US and the European Union were controlled by national quotas.Under GATT, large companies developed direct sourcing to leverage the scale of their orders to secure the best manufacturing capacity in countries with available quota.Mr McComb said the shift also reflected shifts in Liz Claiborne’s own structure, and give the company’s recently decentralised brand management greater flexibility within a variable, rather than a fixed, cost structure.The company’s Mexx brand started using Li & Fung last year, in a pilot that Mr McComb said had delivered significantly improved performance.“They have a far better global reach, and they can manage business in the western hemisphere” as well as in Asia, he said.Mr McComb said the agreement would maintain Liz Claiborne’s existing commitment to ethical supply chain management, and that a global compliance unit would be retained to oversee Li & Fung’s operations.“Nothing will change with regards with standards and compliance,” he said.
127;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-02-13T21:45:45Z;Wall Street financials fall on stimulus fears;;Further selling of financials characterised the end of US stocks’ worst week of the year so far, which was dogged by concerns over the Obama administration’s ability to shore up the stricken banking sector.Two key lenders warned of greater losses than previously disclosed, which exacerbated investor fears that Washington may have no choice but to take drastic action that could be unfavourable to shareholders.Wells Fargo shed 6.2 per cent on Friday to $15.76, taking its loss for the week to 17.7 per cent, as investors had their first chance to respond after the bank revised its results to take account of fresh investment losses.Meanwhile, the fallout from Lloyds Banking Group’s warning over losses at its HBOS division extended across the Atlantic, helping send the S&P financial sector 4.2 per cent lower and extending its losses during the five sessions to 10.2 per cent.Relative strength in the energy, industrial and technology sectors helped pare the wider market’s losses for much of the session but all ten sectors finished in the red.The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent at 826.84, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1 per cent lower at 7,850.41, and the Nasdaq Composite index off 0.5 per cent at 1,534.36.Friday’s decline came after a strong rally in the final hour of trading in the previous session, prompted by hopes that Washington could be drawing up an anti-foreclosure plan.The White House confirmed on Friday that President Obama would give more details next week. Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets, said concrete news of the mortgage plan “could help to give the market some life as we move in to next week.”For the five-day period, the benchmark S&P 500 index lost 4.8 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 5.2 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index 3.6 per cent.At one point during the week, the S&P was as little as 3 points away from a fresh low for the year. The index later recovered somewhat, but still stands less than 10 per cent away from an 11-year low hit last November. It has gained only 2.6 per cent during Barack Obama’s presidency.Financials led the weekly declines as much-awaited rescue proposals failed to instil investors in the stricken sector with confidence. During the half-hour that Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, delivered his much-awaited speech, the sector tumbled 6.5 per cent as shorts – who had covered their positions ahead of the speech – returned to the market.JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by market capitalisation, dipped 10.6 per cent over the week to $24.69.Regional banks also fared particularly poorly, down 17.6 per cent overall, while insurers lost 6.3 per cent on fears over the need to raise fresh capital.Bucking the downward trend in the sector, XL Capital surged 42.2 per cent for the week to $4.31 after the group disclosed plans to let go of 10 per cent of its staff and a cut in its dividend. Standard & Poor’s affirmed key credit ratings.Elsewhere, Alcoa was one of the highest-profile victims outside the financial sector. It was pushed 11 per cent lower for the week to $7.48 after S&P cut the aluminium producer’s credit rating to the lowest investment grade.Technology came under pressure, hit by a downbeat assessment of prospects from Research in Motion. The US-listed shares sank 18 per cent to $48.51.Retail stocks were also among the losers as the market took scant comfort from better-than-expected sales figures.The sector shed 6.5 per cent overall. Kohl’s was one of the losers after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “conviction sell” list. Its shares lost 6.1 per cent for the week to $36.13. By contrast, Best Buy added 1.7 per cent to $30.35 after Goldman added the stock to its “conviction buy” list.
128;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-02-12T21:46:46Z;Wall Street rallies from early slide;;Retail stocks were among the losers in a wild session on Wall Street on Thursday as the market took scant comfort from better-than-expected sales figures.However, the benchmark S&P 500 index finished in positive territory after jumping by 3.2 per cent in the final hour of trading on a Reuters report that the Obama administration was working on a move to subsidize mortgage payments for troubled homeowners.The S&P had lost as much as 3.1 per cent as analysts warned that the apparently upbeat retail sales data had been skewed by seasonal swings and investors focused instead on the latest downbeat unemployment data and earnings reports.The decline left the index only 3 points away from a fresh low for the year, but traders were relieved late in the session that the market did not cross the key technical support level.The major indices finished at the break-even line: the S&P closed 0.2 per cent higher at 835.19 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.1 per cent lower at 7,932.76. Strength in the technology sector helped the Nasdaq Composite Index close up 0.7 per cent at 1,541.71.Tiffany and Target shed 2.1 per cent to $20.57 and 2.8 per cent to $30.85, respectively, in spite of a Commerce Department report that showed retail sales unexpectedly rose in January for the first time in six months.The retail sector losses came even though the headline figure rebounded 1 per cent, while economists had forecast a decline of 0.8 per cent.Although the data also appeared upbeat when excluding motor vehicles and parts – sales rose 0.9 per cent on this basis against expectations of a 0.4 per cent decline – analysts highlighted that the previous month was revised downwards and suspected the supposed recovery was little more than a statistical anomaly.“Don’t believe the headlines,” wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, in a note to clients. “January’s results by no means suggest that the consumer is on the road to recovery.”Kohl’s was the biggest loser in the sector after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “conviction sell” list. The shares lost 3.7 per cent to $36.54.The consumer staples sector outperformed, helped by better-than-expected quarterly earnings from Coca-Cola, which rallied 7.6 per cent to $44.39 on better-than-expected quarterly profits. The sector was the best performing on Thursday, up 1.2 per cent overall.Financials were the worst performing, down 1.3 per cent overall, on persistent concerns over the Obama administration’s rescue plans for the sector even though Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, hit back at criticism that the proposals lacked detail.Wells Fargo fell 4 per cent to $16.80. Illustrating the scale of the volatility, JPMorgan fell as much as 7.4 per cent but closed up 0.4 per cent at $26.19.NYSE Euronext was among the victims, off 3.8 per cent to $19.82 after Citigroup downgraded its view of the stock to “hold”.“Sentiment for market structure stocks remains fairly negative due to concerns around volume trends, hedge fund de-leveraging, reduced risk appetite and bank consolidation,” wrote Donald Fandetti, Citi analyst, of the sector. “While there have been some signs of a thaw and more aggressive government action, we believe a true recovery will simply take some more time.”Homebuilders were among the biggest losers, down 3.5 per cent overall after National Association of Realtors data showed prices of existing single-family homes tumbled by a record 12.4 per cent in the fourth quarterDownbeat labour market data – the four-week moving average for initial jobless claims rose to the highest level since 1982, while total unemployment benefits rose for a fourth straight week to near the 5 million mark – also weighed on the market.“The jobless claims number is the one that traders really care about,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim, who downplayed the significance of the retail figures. “It’s forward looking.”The lower oil price hurt the energy sector, which spent much of the session in the red although found positive territory by the close.In other earnings news, Viacom rallied 3.9 per cent even to $17.70 even after the media group disclosed a sharp decline in fourth-quarter profit.
129;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-02-12T17:24:32Z;US retail sales show surprise rise;;US retail sales in January rose for the first time in six months, as consumers were lured by deep post-holiday discounts in spite of growing job cuts and declining home values.January retail sales were up 1 per cent from the month before, according to figures released on Thursday by the commerce department, breaking a record stretch of six months of declines. Sales were off by 9.7 per cent compared with the previous January, however.The jump surprised economists. Most forecasters predicted a monthly fall of about 0.8 per cent after sales dropped by a revised 3 per cent from November to December. In December retail sales were off by a revised 10.5 per cent compared with the year before, the sharpest such fall since record-keeping began in 1992.“Plainly consumers were to some extent willing to pick up extreme post-Christmas bargains,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.Wall Street took little comfort from the results on Thursday after analysts warned that they appeared to be skewed by seasonal swings.Retail stocks were among the losers as the wider market fell sharply in the first half hour of trading. By mid-morning in New York, the benchmark S&P 500 index was down 2 per cent at 817.10, leaving it little more than 1 per cent away from hitting a fresh low for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2 per cent to 7,783.50 and the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.4 per cent at 1,509.39. Tiffany, Macy’s and Home Depot all shed more than 3 per cent.Excluding the volatile market for automobiles, January retail sales rose by 0.9 per cent. Car dealers saw sales up by 1.8 per cent last month and sales at electronics and appliance stores increased by 2.6 per cent. Sales at petrol stations also rebounded, rising by 2.6 per cent after sinking by 15.6 per cent the month before.The data clashed with much of the anecdotal evidence and other statistics that have suggested that US consumers are retrenching. Some analysts said that the surprise rise was the result of sales falling so dramatically in the fourth quarter.“The results were totally inconsistent with company reports and we strongly suspect that seasonal distortions were responsible for much – if not all – of the upside surprise,” noted David Greenlaw and Ted Wieseman, economists at Morgan Stanley.After the toughest Christmas season in decades, US retailers last week reported grim January sales figures that underlined the intensity of their struggle for survival.Gap’s Old Navy stores delivered one of the worst performances, with comparable sales down by more than a third. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 23 per cent drop, echoing the 24.4 per cent drop announced by Neiman Marcus.Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, the youth fashion stores, also reported sales down by more than 20 per cent, while JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw mid-teen percentage drops.Retailers have announced several thousand job cuts this year, including 1,100 at Saks and 7,000 at Macy’s. Most have also indicated that they are sharply reducing inventory levels. Last week the International Council of Shopping Centers reported that chain store sales fell by 1.6 per cent in January compared with the previous year.Companies have been working to reduce their inventories in expectation of continued weak demand. Business inventories in December fell 1.3 per cent from the month before and were up 0.9 per cent from the prior year. Sales dropped more than expected in December, resulting in an inventories-to-sales ratio of 1.44, the highest since 2001.“Looking ahead, aggressive moves to keep inventories under control will weigh on orders and production as the cyclical downturn persists,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Meanwhile, the number of US workers claiming unemployment benefits for the first time fell by a less than expected 8,000 to 623,000 for the week ending February 7, according to labour department figures. That follows a week when initial jobless claims reached a revised 631,000, a 26-year high.The four-week moving average for initial jobless claims rose to 607,500, the highest level since 1982 and total unemployment benefits rose for a fourth straight week to near the 5m mark.
130;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2009-02-05T19:36:26Z;US retailers report grim January;;After the toughest Christmas season in decades, US retailers on Thursday reported grim January sales figures that underlined the intensity of their struggle for survival.Gap’s Old Navy stores delivered one of the worst performances, with comparable sales down by more than a third. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 23 per cent drop, echoing the 24.4 per cent drop at Neiman Marcus announced this week.Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, the youth fashion stores, also reported sales down by more than 20 per cent, while JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw mid-teen percentage drops.In contrast, Wal-Mart, the low-cost retailer, again outperformed rivals, with same-store sales up 2.1 per cent for the month, ahead of its own expectations.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart USA, said comparable sales for the past 52 weeks were three times higher than the previous year. “Clearly, our stores are performing very well,” he said.The retailer reported strong sales growth in groceries and healthcare but also said it outperformed the market in sales of home and entertainment products.The comparative strength of discount stores was underlined by Dollar Tree, the chain that sells items for only $1, which reported a 2.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its quarter ending January 31.In contrast, Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a 3.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, and said it had seen a decline of more than 20 per cent in sales of women’s clothing. The retailer lowered its fourth-quarter earnings guidance.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly sales, said its index of same-store sales from leading retailers fell 1.8 per cent for the month, the fourth consecutive month the index had fallen.Retailers have announced several thousand job cuts this year, including 1,100 jobs at Saks and 7,000 at Macy’s. Most have also indicated that they are sharply reducing inventory levels.Chris Donnelly, a retail consultant at Accenture, said: “The name of the game is to focus on cash, keep inventories low, and try to ride this thing out.”But he also noted that retailers faced the challenge of managing cutbacks while trying to maintain the customers’ experience of their stores.“Can retailers manage cuts without damaging the customer experience? It is a fine balancing act, so that people don’t feel that they are either going out of business, or are a frustrating place to shop.”
131;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-12-19T19:40:08Z;Shopping freeze hits US Main Street;;An ill-timed outbreak of wintry weather is threatening to deliver a further blow to struggling US retailers, as they wind up one of the toughest holiday shopping seasons in memory with a last frantic push for sales.“I would say that the people who are saying it’s the worst in memory are right,” said Emanuel Weintraub, a veteran retail and apparel consultant, of the promotional frenzy that has erupted amid the slump in consumer spending.The onset of bad weather has now added to retailers’ fears that shoppers will stay at home on the last weekend before Christmas, with heavy snow falling Friday across Chicago, New York and Boston, and more cold, wintry weather forecast.The last Saturday before Christmas typically rivals Black Friday – the day after Thanksgiving – as the busiest day of the US holiday shopping season.Retailers from Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion store, to JC Penney and Kohl’s, which target middle America, have unveiled incentives ranging from limited availability “doorbuster” sale specials, to coupons and gift cards that can be redeemed in January sales. In a sign of the desperation, Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, is offering customers $10 coupons that can be used on Saturday before 1pm to pay for merchandise already reduced by 50 to 60 per cent.Howard Davidowitz, a retail consultant and investment banker, described the environment as “the biggest trade-down effect” the retail business has ever seen.“The fact that 70 per cent off is the new 50 per cent off is simply a response to the consumers being in the worst post-war condition that they have ever been in financially,” he said.The pressure on clothing and fashion retailers in particular has been exacerbated by the speed of the slump in consumer demand after mid-September, which left many holding excess inventory. Liquidation sales at some stores have also added to downward price pressure.The stakes for this weekend have been increased by sluggish December sales despite aggressive promotions. Saks Fifth Avenuewas already offering 70 per cent off cashmere sweaters in mid-December, as well as interest-free credit for customers spending over $2,000.A survey of 4,000 people for the National Retail Federation found they had completed just over two-thirds of their holiday shopping as of the middle of the past week.
132;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-12-04T20:24:02Z;US retailers suffer worst month this decade;;US retailers experienced their worst month this decade in November, as stores such as Macy’s, Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch reported double-digit falls in comparable store sales amid the economic gloom.But Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, led a small band of retailers that managed to deliver comparable sales growth during the month, beating its own forecast with a 3.4 per cent increase.The retailer said it had seen rises in both customer numbers and average spending per trip, and had benefited from the rapid fall in petrol prices.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said it was “extremely difficult” to provide sales guidance in the current environment, but Wal-Mart forecast December comparable sales at the high end of its quarterly growth estimate of 1-3 per cent.Costco, a warehouse club, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent at US stores, excluding petrol. Its rival BJ’s said sales rose 6.2 per cent. Sales at Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart’s warehouse unit, were up 3.5 per cent.Reflecting increasingly value-focused shopping, Family Dollar, which operates a large chain of small hard-discount stores, also reported a 2.1 per cent gain in comparable sales for the quarter ending November 30.Elsewhere, the figures were largely bleak. Poor performances were exacerbated by a difficult comparison with last year, when the Thanksgiving holiday fell earlier in November and boosted seasonal shopping at the end of the month.While several retailers reported strong sales at the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales, it was not enough to make up for the weakness.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly sales figures, said its comparable sales index fell 1.8 per cent, the worst monthly performance this decade. Without Wal-Mart, the index would have dropped 9.3 per cent.Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a 10.4 per cent drop in comparable sales, worse than its predicted range of a fall of 6-9 per cent.Department stores also struggled, with Macy’s down 13.3 per cent, JC Penney down 11.9 per cent, and Kohl’s down 17.5 per cent. Among speciality clothing retailers, Gap was down 10 per cent, while comparable sales at Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer, dropped 28 per cent.
133;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-11-14T23:35:43Z;Free credit offer for Saks card holders;;Saks Fifth Avenue, the US luxury department store chain, is offering established customers who spend more than $2,000 in a single shopping trip access to 12 months of interest-free credit, in a sign of the pressures facing the luxury US sector.The retailer has previously used interest-free credit offers to support jewellery sales, although the deals are more broadly associated with retailers of big-ticket home appliances rather than Bottega Veneta handbags and Oscar de la Renta evening gowns.Saks Gift of Time promotion was launched last week and runs until December 11. It is open only to holders of the retailer’s own-brand charge card, provided they meet credit criteria.Some 44 per cent of Saks’ sales in its last fiscal year were charged to its proprietary credit-card holders, who are the target of the offer, underlining the importance to the retailer of this core customer group.Saks, at which total sales fell more than 18 per cent in October to $269m, is also trying to drive purchases by its SaksFirst loyalty club members. This weekend it was offering triple reward points on purchases that can be converted into store gift cards and other offers.Saks’ upmarket rival Neiman Marcus is stepping up promotional sales after its store takings fell more than 25 per cent to $286m in October.Other more modest US retailers are also boosting offers to their most loyal customers, as they face what is expected to be a brutally competitive festive shopping season.Kohl’s, the low-cost department store, has said it will offer holders of its charge card two extra days of discounted shopping in November and December.Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chief executive, said last week that charge-card holders were “really, really important” to the retailer, because of their greater loyalty to the store. He also said there were signs that, in the current tough environment, its card holders were concentrating more of their spending around Kohl’s regular monthly discounted shopping events.“I think they’re finding the extra percentage off better value than collecting bonus points for airline miles or things like that,” he said.Amazon, the online retailer, which first launched interest-free offers on electronics two years ago, is now offering 90 days of free credit on any item costing more than $119, and up to 24 months’ interest free on more expensive items, such as flat-screen televisions costing more than $1,000.
134;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-11-14T21:36:05Z;JC Penney urges action on consumer spending;;A leading US retail executive on Friday called for government action to boost consumer spending as new figures showed a record fall in sales last month.“Obviously, consumer confidence has plummeted,” Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, told Wall Street analysts. “I think [for] the new administration, it is job one for them to try to understand how to get the consumer back in the game.”US retail spending fell by a record 2.8 per cent in October from September levels, which was far worse than economists were expecting.The S&P 500 fell more than 4 per cent in response to the sales figures..JC Penney, which targets the quintessential middle-American shopper, said that its third-quarter profits fell 53 per cent. It was one of several maintstream retailers which saw double-digit declines in comparable store sales in October.Mr Ullman suggested that consumer sentiment had overtaken financial instability as the chief threat to the US economy, but had so far received less attention from economic policy makers.“We know that the Federal Reserve has been very, very active in reacting to…financial pressures, and there’s been less focus on the consumer up until the last 90 days,” he said.“It [consumer spending] is 70 per cent of the economy. People with money are not spending as freely as they otherwise would, because they are concerned about the lack of visibility to ’09 and beyond.”JC Penney forecast that comparable sales at its stores would fall 9-11 per cent in the holiday quarter. A day earlier, Kohl’s, its rival, forecast a similar drop.Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department store, said on Thursday it expected comparable sales would fall 13-16 per cent, with Blake Nordstrom, its president, saying: “We are in unprecedented times and customers are lacking confidence.”The precipitous fall in sales after mid-September’s market turmoil was also cited by Circuit City, the consumer electronics retailer, as one of the factors that pushed it to file for bankruptciy protection on Monday.The National Retail Federation has been pushing for a second stimulus package for consumer spending, following on from April’s tax refunds. But the prospect of action by Congress before January is looking less likely.
135;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Kohl’s and Nordstrom cut outlook;;Kohl’s, the price-focused department store, and Nordstrom, purveyor of fashion and shoes to a more upmarket clientele, both cut their full year earnings forecasts on Thursday, illustrating the breadth of the decline in US discretionary consumer spending.Both retailers also reported lower third quarter profits on declining sales. Kohl’s, which operates just over 1,000 stores, reporting a 17 per cent drop in earnings to $160.2m, or 52 cents per diluted share. Net sales dropped 0.6 per cent to $3.8bn, and same store sales were down 6.7 per cent.Nordstrom, which has 169 mostly mall-based department stores, said its net earnings down 57 per cent at $71m, or 33 per diluted share, while total sales fell 8.4 per cent to $1.81bn.Nordstrom said it expected its comparable store sales to fall by 13-16 per cent in the important fourth quarter, and slashed its earnings guidance for the full year to $1.87-$1.97, from its previous guidance of $2.55 to $2.65, issued in August.The retailer also said it would reduce its planned capital expenditure, including on plans for new or remodelled stores, to $350m from $510m for the current year.Blake Nordstrom, the retailer’s president, told analysts: ”We are in unprecedented times and customers are lacking confidence”.Kohl’s said it was expecting same store sales in the fourth quarter to drop by between 8-12 per cent. It also reduced its full year earnings guidance, to $2.69-$2.84 per share, down from its previous forecast of $3.02-$3.18 per share.Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s chief executive officer, said: “we expect the holiday season to be the most difficult economic environment for the consumer in years”.“Shoppers can look forward to frequent sales events [and] aggressive discounts on popular merchandise earlier in the season,” he said of the retailer’s stores.Kohl’s said it still remained committed to opening 50 new stores next year, on top of the 75 it has opened so far this year - 46 of them in October. It also said it hoped to be able to pick up marketshare as a result of the troubles facing other rival retailers, such as Mervyn’s, the low-price department store currently going through liquidation.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chairman, said the company believed it “had started to see what we think is the start of a consolidation across many retail sectors,” with the bankruptcy filings of Circuit City, Mervyn’s and Linens ‘n Things.He said the retailer believed it could increase sales “through discplined acquisition of selected real estate across the country as other chains enter bankruptcy or liquidation.”Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on Thursday reported that its net income increased 6.6 per cent in the third quarter, on a 7.5 per cent increase in revenues to $97.6bn. The discount retailer has also said it will use its current financial strength to take advantage of any opportunities arising from the challenges facing the US retail sector.
136;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
137;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-10-24T17:16:00Z;Liz Claiborne faces bleak Christmas;;Liz Claiborne, the fashion clothing company, on Friday underlined the bleak Christmas facing retailers in the US and Europe, as it cut its holiday quarter earnings forecast on slumping demand.Bill McComb, chief executive, said the company began to see “real changes in spending patterns” in its more than 700 stores in September.The changes came as US stock markets started to fall, while its department store customers began “dramatically” increased promotional price cuts.“Traffic in malls and street locations is off in every region, including Europe,” he said.“Consumer confidence has clearly been impacted in a way we hadn’t seen earlier this year.”The company said it now expected earnings of 19 to 24 cents per share, from the previous range of 66 to 71 cents. About 85 per cent of Liz Claiborne’s business comes from its wholesale business with mainstream US department stores including Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s.Its own store network includes Lucky Brand, Juicy Couture and Kate Spade stores and the Netherlands-based Mexx.Its rivals VF Corp and Jones Apparel have also cut their forecasts, with VF citing the precipitous decline in consumer confidence in the second half of September.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, also reported a dramatic drop-off in its sales sparked by the bleak news from financial markets in September.In another reflection of doubts over discretionary spending by US consumers, Coca-Cola’s largest US bottler said this week it was expecting sales volumes in North America to fall by about 10 per cent.Following Liz Claiborne’s warning, Moody’s, the debt rating agency, put the company on review for a possible downgrade.Ed Henderson, Moody’s analyst, said the ratings agency “no longer expects the company to show a sustained improvement in sales or margins in the current year”.The company was “unlikely to maintain financial metrics appropriate for an investment grade rating”.Liz Claiborne said it expected to have a total debt balance of $750m to $775m at the end of the year, and expected to generate $300m to $325m of cash flow, which it said would leave it in compliance with covenants on its $750m revolving bank credit facilities.The company also pre-announced its earnings for the third quarter, originally due on November 11, saying it expects to report a loss per share from continuing operations of between 8 and 14 cents.Net sales fell almost 16 per cent to $1bn against the same period last year.
138;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US high-end retailers battered;;Cut-backs by America’s wealthiest shoppers amid Wall Street’s woes drove down sales at the country’s most exclusive stores in September, according to sales data released on Wednesday by leading retailers.Neiman Marcus, the Dallas-based retailer which operates 64 luxury stores, said comparable sales at its stores fell 15.8 per cent during the month, while its overall revenues fell 11.1 per cent.The retailer’s monthly sales declines are the worst reported by the retailer since September 2002.Neiman Marcus warned last month that it expected its three New York area stores, which include Bergdforf Goodman in Manhattan, to be hit by Wall Street’s troubles ands by a decline in spending by tourists taking advantage of the weak dollar.Its September sales also reflected the hurricanes that affected its Texas stores.Burt Tansky, CEO, said that “based on our September performance and the current economic environment, we expect customer demand will remain weak for an extended period of time”, and warned that the retailer had higher than expected inventory levels.Saks, which derives 20 per cent of its revenue from its flagship store in New York, reported a 10 per cent fall in its comparable sales and a 11.1 per cent fall in total revenues. Nordstrom, which targets a more mainstream affluent customer, reported a 9.6 per cent drop in comparable sales and a 5.8 per cent fall in revenues.Saks said in a statement that it “anticipates the extremely challenging economic environment will continue”, and said it was now expecting sales in the second hald of its fiscal year to drop below its estimate of a low-single digit decline.Blake Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, said that ”the consumer environment has been impacted by events in the financial markets over the past month”, as the retailer lowered its third quarter earnings forecast by 17 cents, to 32 to 37 cents per share.The dramatic slowdown in spending at Neiman, whose holiday gift catalogue this year includes exotic luxury items such as a $60,000 personalised portrait Lego replicas, contrasted with the more robust performance at Wal-Mart and at discount warehouse clubs focused on low cost food and basics.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s stores and supercenters rose 2 per cent during the month, while sales at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores rose 4.6 per cent. Costco and BJ’s, the discount club stores, saw US store sales excluding fuel increase by 6 and 5.6 per cent respectively.Richard Galanti, Costco’s CFO, told investors that the retailer was seeing high double digit sales of food and grocery items, while sales of bigger ticket items such as televisions, jewellery and furniture were declining.Stores more focused on discretionary purchases struggled. Target, the discounter that has a heavy focus on fashion and housewares, saw its comparable sales drop 3 per cent. JC Penney and Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 12.4 per cent and 5.5 per cent. Both retailers cut their third quarter earnings forecasts.Clothing retailers - some of whom report sales on Thursday - have also seen falling sales. American Eagle said its comparable sales were down 6 per cent, and lowered its earnings forecast, while youth brand Zumiez reported a 9 per cent drop.The gloomy same store sales numbers followed consumer spending data released earlier this week by MasterCard Advisors’ Spending Pulse, which reported declines in all sales categories in September.The report, based on MasterCard credit card spending data and estimates of other forms of payment, said sales at speciality retail stores - which include clothing sellers and department stores - fell 7.7 per cent aganst the same period last year, following a 4.1 per cent decline in August.

September looks as thought it will be the regional benchmark’s worst month since for 18 years.“There’s a massive crisis of confidence,” said Khiem Do, head of multi-asset at Baring Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I’m buying today. I love to buy when there’s panic. It’s the time to get companies with good long-term prospects cheaply.” He said the MSCI Asia Pacific index was trading at a bargain valuation of around 10.5 times earnings.Asian investors took their cue from the US markets, where the S&P 500 fell 8.8 per cent, its worst day since falling 20.5 per cent on October 19, 1987.

But Wing Lung Bank rose by 6.2 per cent to HK$155.10 as China Merchants completed its purchase of Wing Lung.The oil producer Cnooc fell by 1.7 per cent to HK$8.85 but mainland refiners rose as cheaper crude helps them to improve margins as Beijing controls the price of petrol and other refined products. PetroChina rose by 1.0 per cent to HK$8.00 and Sinopec gained 2.4 per cent to HK$6.03.However BYD, the battery maker, rose for the second day running after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett took a 10 per cent stake on Monday.

141;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-09-04T18:36:25Z;Thriftiness boosts US lower-cost stores;;US shoppers maintained their focus on keeping costs down as they embarked on the “back-to-school” shopping season, favouring Wal-Mart and other low-cost retailers over department and fashion stores, according to August sales figures.Wal-Mart saw sales at its supercentre and discount stores open at least a year rise 2.8 per cent, led by its grocery and health sales, which includes pharmacy. Together with its Sam’s Club warehouse stores, sales rose 3 per cent, ahead of its forecast of between 1 and 2 per cent growth.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, said the retailer had gained market share as a result of the relative strength of its business. The retailer forecast comparable sales growth of between 2 and 3 per cent for September.Wal-Mart again outdid Target, its main rival, which aims at attracting more discretionary spending. Target’s comparable sales fell 2.1 per cent.JC Penney and Kohls, the department stores, reported comparable sales falls of 4.9 and 5.8 per cent respectively on Wednesday.However, other price-focused stores did comparatively well, with the Family Dollar chain reporting a 3.6 per cent increase in sales at its network of small neighbourhood stores. Costco and BJ’s, the bulk warehouse club stores, reported US comparable sales gains of 6 per cent and 7.7 per cent, excluding their fuel sales.At BJ’s, bulk food sales far outstripped other goods, up 11 per cent, against a 2 per cent increase for general merchandise, in another indication of shoppers focusing on saving money.In teen fashion – normally a beneficiary of back-to-school spending – the lower-priced Aeropostale chain reported a 13 per cent in­crease in comparable sales, while Abercrombie & Fitch saw comparable sales fall 11 per cent.Ken Perkins, of Retail Metrics, said the data showed that “necessities have taken centre-stage against a backdrop of rising prices and less discretionary income”.Retail Metrics’ monthly index of same-store sales rose 2 per cent.Sanjay Srikanth of retail consultants AT Kearney said the back-to-school performance underlined concerns about the coming holiday season. “Everyone is tightening their inventories and expecting a fairly difficult holiday season relative to last year.”The S&P 500 was down 1.8 per cent on Thursday at lunchtime amid broad-based weakness. The S&P retail index was down 1.4 per cent, led by a 6.6 per cent fall in TJ Maxx and a decline of 5.9 per cent in Abercrombie and Fitch. Wal-Mart was up 1.3 per cent.Additional reporting by Michael MacKenzie in New York
142;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-08-27T22:21:55Z;US shoppers turn away from credit;;Middle-class US consumers are increasingly leaving their credit cards at home when they go shopping, extending a trend first shown by Wal-Mart’s low-income shoppers last year, and adding to the pressures on US retailers’ sluggish sales.Mainstream retailers are reporting that shoppers are opting for debit cards or cash instead of credit cards as they face tighter credit limits, illustrating how the wider credit crunch is being transferred to main street spending.Target, the discounter with over 1,500 stores across the US, said last week that it had seen the share of total payments made using credit cards fall for the first time ever in its second quarter, while the use of debit cards continued to rise.The retailer said the resulting slowing of credit use has in turn hurt its sales performance – which saw a slight decline in sales at stores open for at least a year during the quarter.“Clearly the aggregate access that our guests have to credit cards…is one of the issues that is determining our same-store sales performance in the current environment,” Doug Scovanner, Target’s chief operating officer, told investors.Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer whose sales fell 5.3 per cent year-on-year in the six months to August 1, also reported an increase in the mix of cash and debit card use during the latest quarter.Kohl’™s, the budget department store chain, reported an increase in the use of its Kohl’s credit card, which rewards loyal shoppers with monthly savings.But it said the share of payments made by regular bank credit cards and cash had both declined, while it also saw a rise in debit card use. The retailers’ experiences on the shop floor reflect the broader slowdown in the growth of credit.MasterCard, the payments network, said US credit card use was virtually unchanged in the second quarter, with a slight 0.7 per cent increase in total payments, against a 16 per cent increase in debit card use.Visa’s US credit card payments increased 8 per cent, while debit card use increased by 16 per cent.In addition to accepting bank credit cards, most US retailers also issue their own charge cards and co-branded credit cards in partnership with issuing banks.Retailers use these own-brand cards to promote customer loyalty through offering discounts to card holders, and to gather data on their customers’ shopping habits.However, both banks and retailers have been tightening the terms both on their existing cards and on new applicants, in part to reflect declining credit scores that are the result of the increasing economic pressures on their customers.Lowe’s said the share of payments using its own-brand credit card fell 100 basis points in the second quarter to 22 per cent.Target, which co-issues store-branded credit cards with JPMorgan Chase, has followed other card issuers by increasing interest charges on existing accounts and what it describes as “aggressive reduction of credit lines and significant tightening of all aspects of our underwriting”.Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, says it has seen “significant erosion” of credit scores which led it to reduce some credit limits on existing card holders whose cards accounted for almost 30 per cent of its sales last year.Wesley McDonald, Kohl’s chief financial officer, noted that while its charge card performed strongly in the second quarter, accounting for 44 per cent of sales, the rate at which it is issuing new cards is slowing.“Part of that is just obviously with people having more economic difficulties, their credit scores are falling across the country,” he told investors this month.
143;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-08-15T20:50:21Z;Retailer strength helps lift Wall Street;;"US stocks climbed modestly on Friday in a quiet session of trading, and made slight gains for the week, as oil prices dropped back and investors digested some positive results from retailers.Kohl’s kicked off the day in positive fashion, reporting second-quarter profit that fell less than expected. The company also forecast full-year profit ahead of previous expectations and the shares rose 7.1 per cent to $51.70.JC Penney also cheered investors with a smaller- than-expected decline in
second-quarter profit. JC Penney shares rose 8.4 per cent to $39.94.Meanwhile, Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen-focused clothing retailer, and Nordstrom, the department store chain, posted less impressive results but investors were resilient. Abercrombie held steady at $52.59 while Nordstrom rose 4.4 per cent to $31.54.The consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent. Retailers have outperformed this earnings season, with S&P 500 constituents posting profit declines of about 5 per cent on average. That compares with an average drop of 23 per cent for S&P 500 companies.The leading equity indices received a boost from a sharp fall in commodity prices. Oil fell as much as $3 while gold dropped well below $800.Bijal Shah, global chief economist at Société Générale, said: “US consumer firepower, which had been decimated by the sharp rise in energy prices into the summer months . . . is likely to recover over the coming months.”In consumer staples, Wal-Mart Stores added 2.2 per cent to $59.37 and Procter & Gambleclimbed 2.7 per cent to $71.60, helping the sector to advance 1 per cent.Reports showing a small uptick in consumer confidence and a bump in manufacturing activity in New York state in August also lifted sentiment.General Electric shares rose 1 per cent to $29.80 while Manitowoc added 4.5 per cent to $24.96 and Paccar climbed 4.8 per cent to $44.81.Eight of the 10 leading industry groups gained ground, helping the benchmark S&P 500 advance 0.4 per cent to 1,298.2.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 11,659.9 and the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.1 per cent to 2,452.52.Over another volatile week in which oil prices ticked higher before resuming their retreat, the S&P 500 fought its way to a 0.1 per cent gain – its third in a row. The Dow fell 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 1.4 per cent.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performers this week, adding 2.4 per cent, thanks to some solid earnings reports from the likes of Estée Lauder.Financials were the biggest losers after another round of writedowns and analyst downgrades and further developments in the auction rate securities fiasco.Goldman Sachs fell 7.5 per cent to $163.18 over the week while JPMorgan lost 8.2 per cent to $38.07 and Bank of America slid 5.6 per cent to $30.70.On Friday, banks fared better after S&P affirmed the credit ratings of the two largest bond insurers. MBIA and Ambac added 8.7 per cent to $11.22 and 24.6 per cent to $5.68, respectively, while the sector added 1.1 per cent.Jim Smigiel, head of investment strategy at SEI, said: “The Ambacs and MBIAs of the world are going to survive - that is how low the bar is at this point. Valuations are such that you don’t have to paint the rosiest picture to make gains in this market.”The pullback in commodities was less kind to energy and materials stocks.On Friday, Newmont Mining slid 3.2 per cent to $41.51, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 2.8 per cent to $84.39 while US Steel fell 3 per cent to $130.88.The energy sector fell back 1.8 per cent and has now lost ground in seven of the past eight sessions. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips gave up 0.5 per cent to $77.07 and 2.2 per cent to $77.66, respectively."
144;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;JC Penney suffers as shoppers cut back;;JC Penney, the mainstream department store chain, on Friday became the latest mid-range US retailer to report a fall in profits, as consumers cut back on purchases or opt instead for cheaper discount stores.The retailer’s second-quarter net income decreased 35.7 per cent to $117m, while sales fell 2.8 per cent to $4.28bn.Earlier this week Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, Kohl’s and Nordstrom all reported declining profits and sales.The performance of the mid-tier stores contrasted sharply with this week’s strong results from Wal-Mart’s Supercenters and discount stores, which reported increased traffic and an increase in transaction size. Its US store division reported a 10.8 per cent increase in operating profits, with net sales up 8.5 per cent at $64bn.TJX, which operates discount fashion stores, also reported strong results this week.Despite the stronger performance of discount outlets, executives at Macy’s and Nordstrom both maintained that their stores were suffering more from the general slowdown demand, rather than a move by customers to shop at cheaper outlets.Karen Hoguet, chief financial officer at Macy’s told investors that “we don’t think that [trading down] is what is happening. We just think customers are buying less”.Blake Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, said that the fall in sales at its up-market fashion stores reflected a “highly promotional” environment.“Customers are more cautious today. However, we see no evidence that they are trading down.”The leading US retailers are currently waging an aggressive battle for “back to school” sales, the second most important shopping season after the Christmas holidays. JC Penney, for instance, is launching special “doorbuster” sales this weekend, and offering free shipping for online orders.But Mike Ullman, Penney’s chief executive, said that the company was facing customers who were often already at the limit of their consumer credit, and that this had not been significantly affected by the receipt of federal stimulus tax rebates in the second quarter.“Consumer credit is at high levels. The stimulus package may have played that down a bit, but most of the stimulus package went to the increase in fuel prices,” he said.
145;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-08-11T20:41:12Z;US stocks up as investors cheer drop in oil;;The S&P 500 index broke through the 1,300-point barrier on Monday for the first time since late June as investors cheered another drop in the oil price and some analyst upgrades in an otherwise unremarkable trading session.The telecoms and consumer discretionary stocks were among the biggest gainers, advancing 2.7 per cent and 4.4 per cent.Qwest Communications International rose 5.3 per cent to $4.01 after Citigroup recommended that investors buy the shares, arguing the company “remains ripe for both an operational and financial restructuring to improve returns to shareholders.”Verizon added 2.1 per cent to $35.30 while AT&T rose 2.8 per cent to $31.84.Another Citigroup note, this time on Amazon, also struck home with investors. Mark Mahaney, a Citigroup analyst, reiterated his “buy” call on the online retailer, pointing to stronger-than- expected sales of the Kindle, Amazon’s electronic book reader. “Turns out the Kindle is becoming the iPod of the book world,” Mr Mahaney said. Amazon rose 9.4 per cent to $88.09.Sentiment was positive throughout the retail sector as oil wallowed below $114 a barrel for much of the session. Gap, Dillard’s and Kohl’s climbed 8.8 per cent to $19.68, 6.9 per cent to $11.60 and 8.8 per cent to $51.01 respectively.The information technology, consumer staples and healthcare sectors also advanced, reinforcing their strong comeback as investors have moved away from energy stocks and into more defensive areas. Over the past six months the three sectors are the only ones to have made ground, adding 6.6 per cent, 4.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.Brian Belski, US sector strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the sectors “offer US investors the most stable growth properties at current levels and going forward in terms of earnings and sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow”.On Monday, financials stocks were another standout, climbing 1.9 per cent as investors bought into heavily sold stocks and stalwarts alike. Washington Mutual added 3.5 per cent to $4.74, Wells Fargo climbed 4.8 per cent to $31.61 and American Express rose 3.6 per cent to $39.17.The benchmark S&P 500 gave up early gains of as much as 1.3 per cent but still closed 0.7 per cent ahead at 1,305.3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 11,781.78 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1 per cent to 2,439.95.Those gains followed a strong showing last week, when the S&P 500 advanced 2.9 per cent, buoyed by some decent results, a sharp drop in the oil price and the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates on hold.Still, analysts believe the major indices could move higher. Claire Collingwood, a dealer at CMC Markets, said: “Oil prices continue to be the main driving force behind the markets . . . as commodity prices continue to weaken then we can expect this to lead to a degree of movement back into equity markets.”With earnings season winding down, S&P 500 companies have posted second-quarter profit declines of about 23 per cent on average. Excluding financials, average earnings grew about 4 per cent.The energy sector lost 0.4 per cent after oil prices hit their lowest level since May. But coal stocks retreated. Massey Energy fell 5 per cent to $56.07, Consol Energy lost 4.4 per cent to $60.19 and Peabody Energy slid 5.8 per cent to $55.19.Among materials groups, a dip in industrial and precious metal prices shaved 0.4 per cent off the sector, making it the second worst performer of the day.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.30, US Steel fell 6.7 per cent to $128.46 and Titanium Metals gave up 3.5 per cent to $10.63.Some deal news had a mixed impact. Waste Management, the rubbish hauler, raised its bid for Republic Services, a rival, by about 10 per cent to $6.73bn. In July, Republic rejected a $6.2bn offer from Waste Management. Waste Management shares rose 0.3 per cent to $36.10 while Republic shares rose 0.6 per cent to $35.05.United Parcel Service was in focus after the UK’s Sunday Telegraph said the parcel delivery company had held talks to buy TNT for €10bn ($14.9bn). UPS dismissed the report, but it slid 0.3 per cent to $65.51.
146;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-08-07T18:26:30Z;Hard-up US shoppers spurn bigger stores;;The boost to US retailers from about $100bn of tax rebate cheques has proved short-lived, with leading chains on Thursday reporting sluggish or falling sales in July, while Wal-Mart warned of slowing sales ahead.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said it expected August sales in stores open at least a year to grow by between 1 and 2 per cent, after reporting 3 per cent sales growth in July.“With the end of the stimulus checks, we know consumers are spending more cautiously, and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month,” said Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US business.Consumers received about $100bn in rebate checks between April and mid-July as part of the Bush administrations’ economic stimulus package from earlier this year. Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales figures, said its index of comparable retail sales for July rose 2.3 per cent.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that positive factors such as warm weather and the back-to-school shopping season “could not overcome broader macro-economic drags”.The latest monthly sales figures from retailers underlined shifts in US shopping habits identified by Procter & Gamble and other suppliers, as more frugal consumers turn to discount stores, warehouse clubs and to hard discount “dollar stores” and make fewer shopping trips to reduce fuel costs.Mr Castro-Wright said Wal-Mart was also continuing “to see improvement in our customer traffic, relative to last year”, an indication that the low-cost stores are attracting shoppers from rivals.Target, Wal-Mart’s smaller and more upmarket competitor, reported a 1.3 per cent fall in comparable sales, and predicted a further decline in August.Costco, the largest US warehouse club, also reported healthy results for the month, with same store sales excluding fuel sales up 6 per cent in the US.Family Dollar, which operates more than 6,000 small hard-discount stores, saw its comparable sales rise 4.6 per cent, following an 8 per cent increase in June.Department stores and clothing retailers continued to feel the pressure on their monthly sales figures, as they try to stock less, in response to slower demand, and avoid ending up with excess inventory that has to be cleared at sale prices.JC Penney, the mid-range department store whose performance has tracked the broader decline in consumer spending, reported a 6.5 per cent fall in comparable sales, although last July’s numbers were boosted by a shift in reporting of back-to-school sales. But the company predicted sales growth in the low single-digits in August. It also raised its earnings guidance for the current quarter, from 38 cents to 50 to 52 cents, citing effective cost management and inventory control. Its shares rose more than 7 per cent.Its rival, Kohl’s, reported a 10 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year. Larry Montgomery, its CEO, said that the reduced inventory had depressed sales but led to improved gross margins.Gap, the largest speciality retailer, said its comparable sales fell 5 per cent, while the figure for its Old Navy stores was down 16 per cent. However, the company said it had successfully increased its margins, it also raised its earnings guidance, to $1.30 to $1.35 from its previous forecast of $1.20 to $1.27.
147;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wall Street shrugs off US jobs data;;US equity markets made tentative gains on Thursday but only pared losses for the week after shrugging off data showing that the US shed jobs for a sixth straight month in June and the services sector contracted unexpectedly.According to the US Department of Labor, 62,000 jobs were eliminated last month, largely in line with analysts’ expectations.Analysts noted that there was little cause for optimism on the economy. The unemployment rate, which in May jumped by the most in two decades, remained at 5.5 per cent and non-farm payrolls have now fallen by 438,000 in the first half of the year.Separately, data showed initial jobless claims hit a three-month high last week, while the Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index fell sharply in June.But equity markets proved resilient as traders bet that the poor jobs data would reduce the chance of an interest rate hike from the Fed.Industrial and material stocks were among the leading gainers, adding 1.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively as investors bought back into some of the most heavily sold sectors.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.com, an online brokerage, said: “Historically, we tend to rally before a patriotic holiday. The major players have already gone home, volumes are light and the path of least resistance is up.”Markets closed early on Thursday and are shut on Friday for the Independence Day holiday. The benchmark S&P 500 ended the day 0.1 per cent higher at 1,262.90 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 at 11,288.54 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,245.38 points.Over the shortened week, higher oil prices knocked markets. The Dow and Nasdaq slumped into bear market territory before the Dow recovered slightly, while the S&P 500 touched its lowest level since July 2006.The S&P 500 lost 1.2 per cent over the week and has now declined for five weeks in a row. The Dow Jones fell 0.5 per cent over the week.Technical analysts warned that, having broken through the psychological support of the March lows, the S&P 500 could retest its 2002 depths.Kevin Edgeley, a technical analyst with Goldman Sachs, said: “US markets have been oversold since early June but, in an impulsive trend like this, give no reason to buy.”But investors did just that by, in particular, picking up beaten-down industrial stocks. Ingersoll-Rand added 2.9 per cent to $36.65 while Paccar climbed 2.4 per cent to $40.80.Materials snapped a three- day losing streak as steel producers bounced back. US Steel rose 1.6 per cent to $155.80 and Nucor added 1 per cent to $62.54.Even consumer-facing stocks seemed unfazed by the macroeconomic data. Consumer discretionary stocks added 0.3 per cent while consumer staple stocks rose 0.7 per cent.Safeway and Campbell Soup rose 2.5 per cent to $28.74 and 2.5 per cent to $34.68, respectively, while Kohl’s and Whirlpool climbed 3.4 per cent to $42.52 and 3 per cent to $62.69.Energy stocks were among the biggest fallers however, dropping 0.5 per cent, with refiners taking some punishment. Sunoco fell 3 per cent to $39.69 while Tesoro lost 1.6 per cent to $18.98.In corporate news, NVIDIA tumbled 30.7 per cent to $12.49 after the visual computing technologies provider said second quarter sales would be well below analysts’ estimates.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said that there were some encouraging signs that equity markets might be nearing a bottom. The volatility index has moved higher in recent days, the percentage of stocks trading at or below their 200 day moving averages has increased, and energy and materials stocks have come under pressure.“While this may be seen as a problem for investors,” Mr Levkovich said, “we would stress that any weakness in the commodity and energy space can be helpful to other areas that have been crowded out by momentum-driven trading.”Still, Mr Kinahan warned that there were more losses to come. “This has been the most orderly down move of all time. Wednesday was the first sign of panic. We have further to go on the downside as we have never set a bottom until people have said ‘I have to get out at any price’.”
148;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-06-12T20:42:38Z;Wall St gains trimmed by oil rally;;"Wall Street stocks bounced back on Thursday as investors cheered takeover bid news and some better-than-expected retail sales data, but a late rally in oil prices pared gains at the close.In a largely positive day of trading the mood was barely dented by news that Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, had replaced Erin Callan and Joseph Gregory, its chief financial and chief operating officers, respectively.On Monday, Lehman spooked markets by pre-announcing a second-quarter loss and raising $6bn to help it survive the credit crunch. Its share price has been under siege ever since and has lost over 30 per cent of its value in the past week.Lehman shares fell 4.4 per cent to $22.70 but the news proved cathartic for the broader financials sector, which rallied as much as 3.6 per cent before falling back slightly to close 2 per cent higher.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 1,339.87 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent at 12,141.58. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,404.35.Wall Street had fallen sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semiconductors.Thursday, however, began in upbeat fashion after InBev, the Belgian brewer, said it had offered $46.3bn in cash for Anheuser-Busch. InBev plans to fund the unsolicited bid with $40bn of debt, highlighting that bank financing remains available for the right deals.Anheuser jumped 5.2 per cent to $61.40 and the news lifted the consumer staples sector 0.6 per cent.Consumer-facing stocks more generally received a boost from a dip in oil prices and the latest retail sales data for May. According to the Commerce Department last month, retail sales rose twice as fast as forecast, spurred on by tax rebates.At present, consumer spending remains weak but has not entirely capitulated, thanks in part to the rebate cheques – a key part of President George W. Bush’s economic stimulus package.Among retailers, Office Depot rose 5.5 per cent to $12.53, Limited Brands added 3.3 per cent to $17.72 and Kohl’s gained 3 per cent to $43.88. The consumer discretionary sector advanced
0.7 per cent.Still, observers warned that the stimulus from the rebate cheques would not last forever.Lehman Brothers analysts said: “We expect the rebate to boost spending over the next few months. But we expect it to be temporary, acting like a shot of caffeine by boosting growth in the third quarter but pushing growth to negative territory in the fourth quarter as the caffeine kick fades.”Moreover, the macroeconomic news was not all good and gains were limited by a bump in the number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits.But it was the unlikely rebound in the banking sector that hogged the spotlight. Citigroup rallied 3.5 per cent to $19.89, JPMorgan added 2.4 per cent to $38.01 and Bank of America rose 2.1 per cent to $29.44. An index of investment banking stocks gained 2 per cent.Earlier in the day, strategists at Morgan Stanley upgraded financial stocks from underweight to neutral, arguing that lower interest rates and a correction in property prices had improved fundamental conditions, while banks were deleveraging.KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, was the exception, slumping 23.7 per cent to $11.98 after the bank said it would cut its dividend and raise $1.5bn after losing a tax case that will result in a second-quarter charge of as much as $1.2bn.Technology stocks were in focus on Thursday after Yahoo said it had ended all talks with Microsoft. Yahoo shares plunged 9.8 per cent to $23.59 but the sector held its ground as Microsoft advanced 4.1 per cent and Google popped 1.4 per cent to $552.95 on speculation it would step in and partner with Yahoo.In industrials, Cummins, the maker of heavy-duty truck engines, stood out, soaring 9.9 per cent to $69.38 after rival Caterpillar said it would pull out of a key market segment.Energy was one of the few sectors to cede ground, falling 1.8 per cent in spite of the rise in oil prices. ExxonMobil fell 1.2 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.7 per cent to $92.49."
149;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-06-05T14:58:53Z;Wal-Mart sales jump at rivals’ expense;;Sales at Wal-Mart again outperformed its competitors in May, suggesting that it the US discount retailer is set to benefit greatly from federal tax refunds aimed at stimulating the economy.Wal-Mart’s US outlets open at least a year saw sales rise 4 per cent, supported by strong activity in basic goods, including groceries and pharmacy products. Including its Sam’s Club discount warehouse stores, comparable sales rose 3.9 per cent, against the retailer’s original forecast of an increase in the flat-to-2 per cent range.But a range of other major retailers saw comparable sales fall in May. Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket competitor, reported a 0.7 per cent fall in comparable sales. JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw their sales down 4.4 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, saw its global same store sales fall 14 per cent, with a huge 25 per cent fall in sales at its troubled Old Navy chain, and a 7 per cent fall in Gap brand stores.Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer, said Wal-Mart’s comparatively strong performance had benefited in part from spending linked to tax refund cheques cashed by the retailer during the month that had exceeded $350m.While he said that it was not possible for the retailer to know how much of this money had been spent at its stores, he noted that “there’s been a positive difference from that”.Mr Schoewe said Wal-Mart is also benefiting from improved operations, merchandising and marketing at a time when its low cost format is in-line with consumers’ need to economise.May was the first month in which American households began receiving tax refunds of up to $600 per eligible adult under the federal economic stimulus package.Mr Schoewe said that Wal-Mart had also seen an increase in store visits during the month, with greater increases continuing to come at more affluent stores, suggesting that the retailer is gaining market share from competitors as customers “trade down” to the low-price discounter.Customers, he said, remained focused on basics, such as food and pharmacy, which “is a big portion of total basket”.He also noted that Wal-Mart’s home business saw its first growth in comparable sale for two years, which he suggested might reflect reports that Ameicans are saving money by going out less.“While they’re under pressure and disposable income is down it appears to us that that family might be spending more time at home …we’re seeing prepared meals, pizzas and those kind of things ramping up,” he said.Costco and BJ’s, both discount warehouse clubs, also delivered strong comparable sales growth, as Americans turned to their low cost bulk sales. BJ’s, which operates 178 stores mostly in the east of the US, said its sales of food rose 11 per cent, while non-food sales were flat. Its comparable sales excluding fuel increased 6.8 per cent.
150;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-05-01T19:22:21Z;Corporate US faces changing shopping habits;;Corporate America has been dealing with the damage done by the mortgage crisis and resulting credit crunch since last year, with the effects spreading gradually across consumer companies ranging from Tiffany, the jewellers, to Starbucks and General Motors.Yet the economic slowdown has not been bad news for everyone, reflecting both behavioural shifts among US consumers and the advantages enjoyed by those companies that are less reliant on the US domestic market than most of their rivals.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has a mass discount business that is focused on low-income consumers, who have been the hardest hit by rising fuel prices and tightening credit.But its sales have outperformed other mainstream retailers, including the department stores JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s, and Target, its more upmarket discount rival. Its shares have risen more than 30 per cent since October, to hit their highest levels for four years.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, this week offered investors data supporting the view that the retailer was benefiting as more affluent customers were “shopping down”. He said traffic at the hundreds of Wal-Mart stores classed as “affluent” – serving households with incomes in the $55,000-$75,000 range – had increased in March 2.3 percentage points above the average for the entire 3,500 store network.“We are capturing our customers from the more affluent segments,” he said.He noted that Wal-Mart’s customers overall were increasingly using cash, rather than credit. The trend continued even in the run-up to Christmas last year, when the share of credit would traditionally increase.Wal-Mart’s credit receipts in February and March, fell almost 6 per cent, compared with the same period in 2007.“People don’t have as much access to credit as they used to and clearly that is having an impact on how consumers behave,” he said.“This isn’t that people have decided that they can’t spend more, but they have gone beyond their ability to get any more credit . . . they’ve topped out,” he said.Frank Badillo, chief economist at consultants TNS Retail Forward, says there is increasing evidence in the US of shoppers responding differently to economic pressures in their shopping habits. The upper income shoppers are increasingly likely to go to a discounter such as Wal-Mart to buy their preferred brands, while low- and middle-income shoppers opt for store brands that cost less.“The upper income shopper is more likely to stick with brand buys but is more likely to shift shopping channel,” he says.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, suggests that is a factor in the continued strength of its leading brands such as Pampers and Tide.The only other bright spots on the corporate American landscape are those companies with large export markets, which are helped by the weak dollar, and those exposed to booming sectors, such as energy and mining, and emerging markets.In contrast to this week’s warning from Michelin, its European rival, Goodyear, the US tyremaker, reported strong first-quarter profits as the weak dollar boosted exports.Other strong quarterly performance came from Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of bulldozers, and Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, which were also buoyed by strong demand from overseas.Meanwhile, Kraft, the largest US food brand company, is trying to hold on to customers by producing smaller versions of its pizzas and deli meat packages at lower price points – traditionally a tactic used by consumer brands building market share in the developing world.
151;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-04-10T17:45:24Z;Easter and slowdown depress US sales;;US retailers felt the brunt of the developing slowdown in consumer demand in March, with leading clothing chains and department stores reporting sales that were worse than already depressed expectations.Retailers said demand for the month was affected by the early Easter holiday, which fell on March 23 rather than in April. While Easter generally boosts sales of spring clothing and gifts, the holiday came as cold weather continued across much of the US, suppressing demand. Most retailers also missed a day because of Easter Sunday closures.JC Penney and Kohl’s – low-cost stores that focus on the middle-income heartland – said sales at their stores that had been open at least a year fell respectively by 12 per cent and 15.5 per cent. Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported an 18 per cent fall in comparable sales at its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic brand stores. Dillard’s, the medium-sized department store chain, reported a 10 per cent fall in same store sales.Larry Montgomery, chief executive of Kohl’s, said weak sales of “weather-sensitive” items such as shorts, tank-tops and sandals “experienced significant declines …contributing to our sales shortfall”.In an indication that the broad-based nature of the slowdown, Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion store, reported a comparable sales increase of just 0.4 per cent, while Saks Fifth Avenue saw its same store sales fall 2.9 per cent.Nordstrom, a fashion department store that aims at more prosperous customers, reported a 9 per cent fall in comparable sales.However, Wal-Mart, the mass discounter that is the country’s largest retailer, again delivered a comparatively strong performance, with a 0.9 per cent increase in comparable sales at its more than 3,400 Wal-Mart outlets.Target, its more upmarket rival, saw same-store sales fall 4.4 per cent.Wal-Mart raised its guidance for the first quarter, with Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, citing effective inventory management that “has resulted in lower markdowns, expense leverage and reduced shrink”. It is now forecasting first quarter earnings per share of 74-76 cents, from 70-74 cents previously.Many retailers will benefit from an extra selling day in April this year, as a result of the shift in the Easter holiday. Wal-Mart is predicting a comparable sales increase of 1 to 3 per cent.But JC Penney, which predicted a comparable sales fall in the “mid- to high-single digits” in April, said it was expecting “a continuation of the incremental weakness in sales trends we started to see in late February and early March”.
152;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-03-28T21:07:58Z;Numbers disguise mixed week for Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks ended Friday’s session and the week down in a relatively calm period of trading after the massive swings and disruptions of the previous week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a measure of market risk often referred to as the investor “fear gauge”, fell to its lowest weekly level in a month as investors paused to digest recent events.Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst, at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: “We had a pretty large gain off the bottom so you would expect the market to pause and compose itself before moving in one direction or another.”Last week markets were roiled by news of the near-collapse of Bear Stearns, the fifth largest US investment bank, until a rescue engineered by the Federal Reserve, and a host of subsidiary interventions, helped indices rebound.The benchmark S&P 500 quivered between a narrow range of gains and losses on Friday before closing at 1,315.21 points, down 0.8 per cent for the day and 1.1 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1 per cent over the week to close at 2,261.18 points, while the Dow Jones industrial Average dropped 1.2 per cent to 12,216.40.Still, the smoothed numbers disguised a mixed week of trading in which fears that the US economy had entered a recession increased and gains in the materials and energy sectors offset losses in financials.Stephen Wood, Senior Portfolio Strategist at Russell Investments, said he was surprised that markets had held up as well as they did given the trickle of negative news.“Investors are starting to discriminate between sectors and stocks again instead of fleeing from risk altogether” he said.Amidst a slew of data indicating that the US economy slowed rapidly in the fourth quarter - spluttering if not entirely stalling - investors moved into commodity-related stocks as relatively safe haven.An index of materials stocks closed up 4.7 per cent over the week while the S&P500 index of energy stocks climbed 2.8 per cent, bouncing back from last weeks losses as commodities prices for the most part resumed their rise.“The materials and commodity stocks have reasserted their leadership this week,” Mr Sparks said.“Even though it is logical to assume that they are not going to be selling as much in a recession, for now that hasn’t hit those stocks and they are still being buoyed by the fact that supply is constrained and they have a lot of pricing power.”US Steel was among the top gainers on the S&P 500 Index, advancing 9.7 per cent to $125.69 over the week, while Alcoa, the aluminium producer, added 4.1 per cent to $36.11.Consumer discretionary stocks fell as the latest data and earnings reports showed that plummeting consumer confidence was beginning to be reflected in weak personal spending.JC Penney, the department store operator, slashed earnings forecasts for the first-quarter and its shares fell 11 per cent over the week to $37.48. Competitors Kohl’s and Macy’s followed the stock downwards, dropping 7.1 per cent to $42.33 and 11.6 per cent to $21.97 respectively.Hardest hit over the week were the banking stocks, which continued to sell off as analysts began to revise their earnings estimates, mostly downwards, ahead of the glut of results reports due at the start of April.Financial stocks initially made ground on Monday and Tuesday boosted by news that JPMorgan had dramatically increased its offer for Bear Stearns and the prospect that one painful episode in the ongoing credit crunch at least, might be drawing to a close.Over the week Bear shares soared 80.8 per cent to $10.78 while JPMorgan stock lost 7.1 per cent to $42.71.But banking stocks were unable to build on that initial enthusiasm.Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers shares all fell after analysts cut their earnings estimates for the investment banks. Merrill dropped shares fell 14.8 per cent to $39.93, Goldman fell 8.5 per cent to $164.45 and Lehman lost 22.2 per cent to $37.87 over the week.The sell off of financials gathered pace after Meredith Whitney, a prominent analyst at Oppenheimer, slashed her forecasts for earnings in fiscal 2008 by 84 per cent on average and said further downgrades were likely.Housebuilders remained in focus after a raft of data and company earnings confirmed that the slide in house prices continued unabated.
153;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-03-06T19:55:46Z;Discount stores in US gain ground;;New sales figures from the leading US retailers on Thursday painted a picture of stressed shoppers “trading down” and focusing increasingly on price in the face of growing economic pressures.Monthly sales data for February showed Wal-Mart, the low-cost mass discounter, again outperforming its more upmarket rivals, reporting a 2.6 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year.Target, the rival discounter focused on more middle class customers, saw comparable sales increase just 0.5 per cent. JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-price department stores, saw their sales fall 6.7 and 3.3 per cent, respectively.“I think what we are seeing is probably the moving of shoppers from traditional department stores and speciality apparel stores over to Wal-Mart and other discount players,” said Mike Moriarty, head of AT Kearney’s US consumer goods and retail practice.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the month’s figures also highlighted the relative strength of retailers which, like Wal-Mart, sell staples such as grocery and healthcare items. “Areas of retail that are value oriented or consumer-staple oriented did well,” he said.Family Dollar, which operates more than 6,000 small stores that sometimes undercut Wal-Mart, saw its comparable sales rise 1.5 per cent, beating Wall Street’s expectations of a sales fall. Costco and BJ’s, the discount warehouse clubs, also reported comparatively strong sales growth.The figures apparently reinforce the findings of a recently published annual survey of US consumers sentiment by AlixPartners, the turnround consultancy. Fred Crawford, of AlixPartners, said the firm’s 2008 survey showed consumers at all levels were increasingly focused on price, rather than other factors such as quality when making shopping decisions.He said it also showed that shoppers were ready to shift “one level down” in terms of the type of stores they shop.“Consumers who were shopping at Nordstrom’s and Macy’s are now looking at JC Penney or Kohl’s, and those [who] were shopping at JC Penney are now at Wal-Mart,” he said.On Wednesday, both Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, said they were seeing signs of slowing demand even from affluent customers.“You’re going to see a lot more Lexuses and BMWs in Wal-Mart parking lots going forward,” Mr Crawford said.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of comparable sales rose 2 per cent, beating its forecast of a 1.2 per cent rise.
154;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-03-06T15:29:41Z;Wal-Mart sales beat forecasts;;Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said its February sales beat its own forecast, in a sign that US shoppers are “trading down” in the face of economic pressures.Wal-Mart said sales at its US stores and Sam’s Club discount warehouses open at least a year rose 2.6 per cent during the month. Wall Street analysts had on average been predicting a 1.1 per cent increase.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, said comparable sales in grocery, health and wellness and entertainment - Wal-Mart’s three biggest categories - again outperformed competitors during the month.“We’re very pleased with the way customers responded to our merchandise offerings and the ongoing ‘save money, live better’ messaging across our US stores,” he said in a statement.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s rival Target, which aims at more middle-class customers, rose just 0.5 per cent during the month, in line with its forecasts.Family Dollar, which operates over 6,000 small hard discount stores, also beat expectations with a 1.5 per cent increase in comparable sales.Sales at JC Penney, the low-cost department store that targets Middle America, fell 6.7 per cent, worse than management had forecast. Its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 3.8 per cent.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same store sales rose 2 per cent for February, beating its forecast of a 1.2 per cent rise. Last year, the index rose 2.6 per cent. However, February’s performance outstripped the 0.4 and 0.2 per cent reported in December and January.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said that while 2 per cent “is not going to make investors take to the streets and jump for joy, it has to be a sigh of relief for retailers and investors alike, as it bucked the recent decline trend”.In a further indication of pressures among more affluent shoppers, Nordstrom, the speciality fashion store, reported its third successive decline in monthly comparable store sales, with a 3.3 per cent fall. Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, both reported on Wednesday that they were seeing signs of a slowdown affecting even their more affluent customers.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, has stopped issuing monthly same-store sales figures. It recently announced plans to reorganise its US store operations, and is continuing efforts to improve sales at the May stores it acquired in 2005.
155;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-02-07T18:42:59Z;Post-holiday sales disappoint US retailers;;"Low-income customers at Wal-Mart appear to be using Christmas gift cards to buy food and other basics rather than using them on discretionary gifts, the largest US retailer said on Thursday, in a telling sign of the economic pressures facing the least well-off US consumers.Wal-Mart cited lower-than-expected redemptions of gift cards during January as a factor for moribund sales during the month. Sales at stores open at least a year increased by just 0.5 per cent, against its original forecast of 2 per cent growth.The retailer, which also blamed bad weather in the Midwest for the weak
figures, said: “Customers appear to be holding gift cards longer and using them more often for food and consumables rather than discretionary purchases.”Wal-Mart has sought to capitalise on its reputation for low pricing in the
current gloomy economic environment, announcing a range of price cuts in late January that it marketed as its own “economic stimulus plan for US shoppers”.But the poor January performance raises doubts over predictions from some Wall Street analysts that its model will perform better than its rivals as consumers become more cost conscious.Both Wal-Mart and Target, the rival discounter, reported that sales of food and healthcare items remained strong during the month. But Target reported a 1.1 per cent decline in comparable sales in January, with poor clothing sales again contributing to a slump that first hit the retailer in September.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales figures, said its comparable sales index rose just 0.2 per cent in January.There were a few exceptions to the generally bleak picture. JC Penney, the mid-range department store, said it did better than expected during the month, and issued a positive earnings forecast that drove its shares up 7 per cent, to $46.91 in early-afternoon trading.But its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 8.3 per cent as it cut prices to clear inventory, predicting earnings at the low end of its previous guidance.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chief executive, said that its “customers continue to be selective in their purchases, driven by value and need”.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, said on Wednesday that its comparable sales fell 7.1 per cent in January, leading it to cut its earnings forecast for the quarter. It also announced it was shedding 2,300 administrative jobs. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 4 per cent increase in sales.But it said even its largely prosperous customers “have continued to shift more of their spending to promotional events”. Nordstrom, another high-end store, reported a 6.6 per cent fall in comparable sales, while Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer, said its same store sales were up 3.3 per cent."
156;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2008-01-10T15:02:52Z;Wal-Mart stands out amid retail misery;;Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a 2.4 per cent rise in December sales, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 2.1 per cent, amid otherwise predominantly bleak sales figures from other leading retailers.The largest US retailer said comparable store sales during the five-week December period were driven by strengths in grocery, pharmacy and electronics.Wal-Mart’s US stores saw sales increase by 2.6 per cent. Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of the US stores unit said that “in a difficult retail environment, we were pleased with our comparable store sales,” and said strong food sales had helped bring in customers for other areas of the stores.Wal-Mart outperformed Target, its main rival, which reported a 0.6 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, after adjusting for a callendar change that saw a week of extra post-Thanksgiving sales shifted to November’s figures.Target’s sluggish performance was broadly reflected across the sector.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures said its index of retailer’s combined comparable sales figures for November and December showed a 1.7 per cent increase, the slowest growth since 2002.JC Penney, the mid-range department store, said its stores sales fell 3.9 per cent for November and December combined, citing “a challenging consumer environment”.The retailer said it now expected its fourth quarter earnings to be at the lower end of its previous guidance of $1.65 to $1.80 per share.Kohl’s, JC Penney’s rival, reported a 0.7 per cent decline in same store sales, on an adjusted basis, and said November and December sales were down 3.2 per cent. It also reduced its earnings guidance, saying that sales had occured later in December, leading to price cutting that would reduce its profit margins.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, posted a 1.1 per cent fall over the two months.Terry Lundgren, CEO of Macy’s said “macroeconomic trends led customers to spend cautiously for the holiday”.Gap’s same-store sales adusted for the calendar changes were down 6 per cent.Costco was another rare bright spot, reporting a rise of 7 per cent, beating estimates of an increase of 5.7 percent, according to Reuters.Saks, whose New York flagship store has benefited from increased European tourist traffic linked to the weak dollar, reported a 10.2 per cent increase in comparable sales over the two month period.A number of retailers cut their fourth quarter earnings guidance after releasing poor December sales, including Limited Brands, AnnTaylor, Chico’s, American Eagle and Men’s Wearhouse.US retailers have been sounding increasingly downbeat in recent weeks, reflecting growing concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending due to a broader slowdown in the economy.US retailers from Office Depot, the office supplies company, to Zumiez, the snowboarding and skateboarding clothing retailer, have been showing increasing signs of suffering over the first weeks of the new year.Talbots, the mid-range clothing chain, said last week it planned to close 78 stores focused on children’s and men’s apparel and Macy’s has said it will close nine underperforming stores.Circuit City, the struggling consumer electronics chain, said on Monday that its December same-store sales fell 11.4 per cent.
157;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-11-23T19:41:51Z;Black Friday;;Much more of this and we will need a new name for Black Friday. On Friday both JC Penney and rival Kohl’s kicked off America’s holiday shopping season at 4am, an hour earlier than usual. Some other stores threw open their doors on Thursday evening.The day after Thanksgiving there are traditionally festive scenes of Americans elbowing each other out of the way to snap up cheap handbags and camcorders. It used to be considered the day US retailers turned profitable for the year (hence “black”).Earlier openings and attendant early-bird bargains, however, point to reluctant shoppers. JC Penney, for example, has good reason to start earlier, having reported a rapid build-up in inventory during the third quarter. And it has not been alone in talking down investors’ expectations for the fourth quarter.No wonder. November and December account for a fifth of annual retail sales. This year the National Retail Federation expects holiday season sales growth to be the slowest since 2002, at 4 per cent. Falling house prices and high fuel costs weigh on spending decisions. Data released this week showed personal bankruptcies rising 28 per cent year on year in the third quarter.MasterCard SpendingPulse expects this year’s holiday weekend retail sales in the US to top last year’s $40bn. But how far that would reflect actual consumer strength, rather than a refinement of retailers’ discounting techniques, is debatable. Sales can beat (low) expectations, but what really matters is profit margin.In this environment the big discounters such as Wal-Mart – which slashed prices on thousands of lines last month – look a safer bet than mid-market retailers. The latter can open round the clock if they want. But if all that does is provide the most savvy consumers with more time to do the rounds of the early-morning specials, it does little for the bottom line. Maybe Black Friday remains the appropriate moniker after all.
158;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-11-16T01:51:17Z;JC Penney and Kohl’s slash outlook;;JC Penney and Kohl’s on Thursday became the latest US retailers to feel the impact of a slowdown in demand.Both slashed their earnings guidance and predicted a bitterly competitive holiday season.JC Penney said its mid-range department store business had seen sales “weaken dramatically” during the third quarter, blaming the increasing economic pressure faced by its customers, as well as the impact of exceptionally warm weather.Mike Ullman, chief executive, said that, in September, “for the first time we really saw a change in consumer sentiment” after previously having seen strong growth in its back-to-school sales at the end of the summer.“The combination of weak housing conditions, mortgage and credit market concerns, and rising fuel prices has clearly led to a challenging macroeconomic environment for consumers,” he said.Larry Montgomery, chief executive of Kohl’s, said the retailer was trying to establish how much of the slump was due to the weather and how much it was down to the economy.Both retailers said they expected price cutting to put pressure on their margins in the fourth quarter, with JC Penney saying it expected the tough environment to continue into 2008. JC Penney’s earnings fell more than 8 per cent to $261m, or $1.17 per diluted share, while Kohl’s earnings were down 13 per cent at $194m, or 61 cents per share.At JC Penney sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.5 per cent, while Kohl’s were down 2.6 per cent.JC Penney said its internet sales, which have been growing at an annual rate of more than 20 per cent, increased by just 11.8 per cent, while its catalogue home furnishings sales were also down.“It’s hard to sell window coverings to homes that aren’t being built,” said Mr Ullman of the fall in home furnishings sales. JC Penney said it expected slowing sales across the industry to increase price cutting during the fourth quarter and that it expected the current climate to continue into next year.“2008 is going to continue to be a very difficult selling environment…We are not going to be very aggressive in terms of spending on discretionary projects in this environment,” Mr Ullman said.JC Penney and Kohl’s have been regarded as two of the most successful mainstream US retailers, building up businesses based on their private label brands.Mr Ullman said JC Penney’s sales had still outperformed many competitors. “It’s not as if we got dumb all of a sudden.”JC Penney’s shares, which hit a high of $87 in the spring, closed down more than 5 per cent at $44.33, while Kohl’s, which reported after the close, ended the day down under one per cent at $48.92.
159;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-11-14T21:35:48Z;Och-Ziff’s shaky debut dents confidence;;US stocks closed lower on Wednesday after some upbeat comments from Bear Stearns were offset by continuing weakness in retail stocks and as the technology sector bore the brunt of another late sell-off.Shares in Merrill Lynch rose on reports the brokerage was about to appoint John Thain of NYSE Euronext as its new chief executive officer. Mr Thain confirmed the news after the closing bell.But Och-Ziff Capital Management dipped on its market debut after launching one of the largest ever hedge fund IPOs.Energy and mining stocks outperformed as metals prices ticked up and crude oil closed above $94 a barrel.The S&P 500 closed 0.8 per cent lower at 1,469.52, having traded modestly higher for most of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent at 13,214.34. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent at 2,644.32.Late selling pressure pushed volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index - Wall Street’s so-called “fear barometer” - 8.5 per cent higher at 26.15.The S&P 500 briefly pushed above its 200-day moving average, a bullish signal, but failed to sustain momentum amid continuing investor caution on the economy.Vladimir de Vassal, director of quantitative research at Glenmede Investment Management, said investors were becoming more selective. “You’re getting people starting to think about earnings and valuation across the board. People are looking at individual companies rather than a general theme.”Bear Stearns reported $1.2bn in writedowns for the quarter, but the charge was not as big as analysts had feared. The shares surged after Sam Molinaro, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, said the latest writedowns should “suffice” in accurately valuing its credit portfolio.He said Bear had cut its holding of collateralised debt obligations by more than half since the end of August and the company was “pretty positive” about its investment banking business. The stock closed 2.6 per cent higher at $103.45.Merrill Lynch rose 1.6 per cent at $57.88 on reports that Mr Thain would become the new chief. Stan O’Neal stepped down last month after Merrill made $7.9bn in writedowns.Mr Thain’s appointment was confirmed after the close of trading and was a blow for Citigroup, which is also seeking a new chief executive. Its shares pared early gains to trade only 0.3 per cent higher at $36. The S&P investment bank index gained 0.9 per cent to 192.39.Och-Ziff fell on its market debut pointing to a decline in investor appetite for hedge fund IPOs since the summer credit squeeze. The shares priced at $32, raising $1.15bn, but declined 4.7 per cent to $30.50.In contrast, Fortress Investment Group, 1.7 per cent weaker at $17.20, soared more than 67 per cent when the multi-strategy asset manager made its market debut in February. The shares have since declined as risk-averse investors have shunned alternative investment vehicles.E-Trade Financial rose 10.8 per cent at $5.54, as analysts said the online brokerage should avoid bankruptcy and amid talk it could become a takeover target.Shares in rival TD Ameritrade have lately been buoyed by talk it could benefit from its competitor’s troubles. Its shares rose 0.2 per cent at $19.20.Bond insurers were in focus on reports they are seeking reinsurance from Berkshire Hathaway. Ambac Financial rose 4.9 per cent at $30.46 while MBIA slipped 1.7 per cent at $39.80.“I’m sure there was a tremendous amount of shorting going on in these stocks. Now I’m sure you’re seeing some short covering. You’re probably also seeing some value players taking positions,” Mr de Vassal said.In other company news, Wendy’s, the hamburger chain, fell 2.7 per cent at $30.81 after Nelson Peltz, the billionaire investor, tabled a smaller offer than the $3.2bn he previously said the company was worth.In economic news, retail sales rose an expected 0.2 per cent last month but slowed from a revised 0.7 per cent in September,The S&P retail index declined 1 per cent at 431.37. Sears fell 4.2 per cent at $120.71. Kohl’s slipped 3.7 per cent at $49.35. But Wal-Mart, up 1 per cent at $46.43, added to the previous day’s stellar gains.
160;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-11-08T16:03:40Z;Weather and economy hit US stores;;One of the largest US retailers sounded a warning on Thursday over the prospects for holiday sales, after economic worries and warmer than ususal weather led to disappointing October sales.Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, said his mid-range department store chain expected “the challenging retail environment to continue for the foreseeable future”, after announcing that sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.8 per cent in October.”Our customers are clearly facing headwinds that are impacting both sentiment and discretionary spending levels, including weak housing market conditions, high energy prices, and uncertainty in the mortgage and credit markets,” he said.Bob Ulrich, chief executive of Target Stores, noted that for the second month in a row the discount retailer experienced soft sales in higher margin categories, including clothing and warm weather items, as the company reported comparable sales growth of 4.1 per cent.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, reported a 1.5 per cent fall in same store sales, while Kohl’s said same store sales fell by 3.8 per cent. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store that traditionally outperforms the sector, reported a 2.4 per cent drop in comparable sales.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chief executive, said sales of outerwear, fleece and sweaters “experienced significant declines …contributing to our sales shortfall” as a result of the warm weather.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, also reported soft apparel sales as it announced that its comparable sales increased by 0.4 per cent during the month. Wal-Mart, which launched aggressive pre-holiday price cuts in October, said it expected comparable sales to increase by between 0 and 2 per cent in November.Speciality clothing sellers were also hard hit. Limited Brands saw its comparable sales fall 6 per cent, while Gap posted an 8 per cent drop. Chico’s FAS reported a 10.6 per cent sales drop and added profit would fall sharply in the current quarter.Retail Metrics, a firm that tracks the monthly same store data, said that its index of sales increased 1.9 per cent for the month, following a disappointing 1.6 per cent increase in September.“There is virtually no momentum coming out of September and October as we head into the thick of the holiday shopping season,” the firm said in its analysis of the data.
161;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-08-21T19:17:20Z;Target shrugs off economic woes;;Target on Tuesday underlined the resilience of middle-income US consumers by reporting strong quarterly earnings in spite of worries over the housing market and energy costs.While the US discount store chain said it would be slightly more conservative in its planning for the remainder of the year, Bob Ulrich, chief executive, said the company continued to believe it “will deliver strong sales and profit performance in 2007”.He said that Target’s forecast earnings of $3.60 a share for the year remained “within the range of likely outcomes”.The results from the retailer, known for its “cheap chic” offerings, contrasted with last week’s lowered earnings guidance from Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer.Wal-Mart cited economic pressures on its lower income customers, saying it was seeing evidence that its customers were running out of money at the end of each month.However, Target’s stronger performance was mirrored in robust results last week from JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores that serve similar customers, and from Nordstrom’s, the upmarket fashion store.US retail stores have seen monthly comparable sales growing at a slower rate this year compared with 2006, which analysts attribute to the impact of higher energy costs and interest rates.Mr Ulrich noted that Target’s sales at stores open at least a year had increased by almost 1 per cent less than last year during the first six months of the year.“We’re not anticipating that will soften. We’re saying we’re at slightly more modest pace than we were last year, and we see that continuing into the fall season,” he said.Bob Buchanan, retail analyst at AG Edwards, said on Tuesday that “overall …the consumer seems tired, and dragged down by such issues as the weak housing market and the related negative impact on personal balance sheets”.He forecast that the six-month average of AG Edwards same-store retail sales index would slip further during the second half of the year, from an expected 2 per cent for the six months up to August.For the quarter, Target reported net earnings of $686m, or 80 cents per diluted share, on a 9.5 per cent increase in sales to $14.62bn.Target also reported that earnings before tax from its large credit card business increased 34 per cent to $163m against the same period last year, in part due to an increase in late fees.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer, said the retailer was not concerned about any increased strains on its credit card business as a result of the macro-economic environment. “We have a high degree of confidence in the continued health and prosperity of our credit card business.”
162;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
163;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-08-16T22:20:29Z;JC Penney upbeat amid retail gloom;;JC Penney, the US department store chain aimed at middle-income shoppers, on Thursday issued an upbeat earnings statement, in sharp contrast to both higher-end and bargain retailers which earlier this week said they were suffering from depressed consumer demand.The company narrowly beat analyst expectations with second-quarter earnings of $182m, or 78 cents a share, compared with $179m, or 75 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast earnings per share of 77 cents.Internet sales and the back-to-school season helped the company in “a challenging retail environment”, Myron Ullman III, chief executive, said.Other major retailers including discount-store Wal-Mart as well as Macy’s and Bloomingdales said their profits were hurt in the quarter by the continued housing market gloom and high fuel prices which are tightening consumers’ budgets. Both companies cut their full-year outlook, furthering concerns about market conditions.JC Penney raised its 2007 earnings-per-share forecast by a cent to $5.50.Fashion department store chain Nordstrom also reported second-quarter net profits just above analyst expectations on Thursday at $180.4m, up 6 per cent from a year earlier. Rival Kohl’s saw net profits rise 16 per cent to $269.2m.Online sales at JC Penney were particularly strong, jumping 17.4 per cent and offsetting a 2.3 per cent decrease in direct sales. Same-store sales increased 1.9 per cent in the quarter, which the company said was the seventeenth consecutive quarter with positive growth in comparable sales.The chain’s own brands, including lines by Liz Claiborne, contributed most to its sales performance, the company said.JC Penney’s share price was up 1.02 per cent to $63.21 by mid-afternoon.Analysts said the company fared better than other large retailers because of its successful long-term strategy.“JC Penney has been deft at flowing inventory from store to store and offering better style and quality at moderate prices,” said Bernard Sosnick, an analyst at Oppenheimer, noting that the company was “entering into a growth phase”.The company has sought to lure shoppers from former May Department Stores – which includes Filenes and Marshall Fields – whose prices were raised after it was acquired two years ago by Macy’s.JC Penney has been broadening its reach in the US market in recent years, securing space for its first Manhattan store in Herald Square, where it will be competing with Macy’s iconic flagship store.Founded in 1902 by James Cash Penney, the company re-emerged from near-bankruptcy in 1999. It operates 1,048 stores across the US with sales last year bringing in almost $20bn. It has pledged to accelerate its store opening programme, with 50 additional stores planned this year, up from 28 in 2006 and 18 in 2005.
164;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-08-16T20:40:48Z;Bargain hunters push S&P 500 higher;;US stocks closed mixed on Thursday after another volatile trading session in which financial stocks led a dramatic late rally.Countrywide, the beleaguered mortgage group, prompted an early plunge in stocks by saying it would have to draw on $11.5bn of credit and an official reports showed new homebuilding dropped to a 10-year low while building permits were at an 11-year low in July.But after the late rally, the S&P 500 finished the day 0.3 per cent higher at 1,411.26 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to close at 12,845.78. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.3 per cent at 2,451.07 and the Russell index of smaller companies was 2.3 per cent higher at 768.83.The Chicago Board Options Exchanges Vix index, a measure of equity volatility, soared to its highest level since 2002. The index finished 0.5 per cent higher at 30.83, having hit an early high of 37.50.The early market panic over the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis was exacerbated by William Poole, president of the St Louis Federal Reserve, who denied that the subprime issue pointed to a systemic crisis in the financial system and said only a “calamity” would justify an interest-rate cut.Markets were not calmed by a senior Federal Reserve spokesperson in Washington saying Mr Poole’s views were not representative of the central bank’s policymaking Open Market Committee as a whole.“While Fed officials are proceeding as if the calamity has yet to occur, it would appear that some in the market believe the calamity is simply yet to be fully appreciated,” said analysts at Interactive Brokers.In early trade, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell to more than 10 per cent below the 52-week highs they hit in mid-July. That is a drop investors usually define as a market correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to 9.5 per cent below its 52-week high.Nerves were not soothed by the Federal Reserve pumping more liquidity into the system on Thursday morning. The New York Fed announced an overnight repurchase agreement worth $12bn and a 14-day repurchase worth $5bn, while signalling that it expected to make similar repurchases on a more regular basis over the coming days.Attention continued to be focused on Countrywide Financial after the mortgage lender said it had been forced to tap an $11.5bn credit line to fund operations. It also had its ratings downgraded by Fitch and Moody’s. The shares were down 11 per cent by the close to $18.95, following a 13 per cent fall on Wednesday.Traders seized on a statement by Fannie Mae that it was in “constructive” talks with regulators about the need to lift its portfolio cap. Shares in the mortgage finance company rose by 6 per cent to $65.15. That lifted other financial stocks, with Bear Stearns up 12.9 per cent to $116.44, Lehman Brothers rising 6.2 per cent to $54.75 and Merrill Lynch up 3.2 per cent to $71.13.An hour before the opening bell, the Commerce Department released a gloomy report on US housing starts, showing that construction of new homes last month dropped to its lowest level in 10 years. The figures underlined the woes that have beset the homebuilding and mortgage sectors in recent weeks.Following disappointing quarterly earnings from other big retailers, JC Penney reported second-quarter financial results ahead of analysts’ estimates, with profit increasing 1.7 per cent to $182m, or 81 cents a share, from $179m, or 76 cents, for the same period last year. The retailer’s shares closed up 2.5 per cent at $64.14.Amgen was in the spotlight after the biotechnology company cut its profit guidance on lower-than-expected sales of its anaemia drug and said it planned to reduce its workforce by up to 14 per cent. Its shares dropped 2.3 per cent to $49.41.Cognex fell the most since October 2006, losing 11.9 per cent to $19.09. The maker of machine vision systems said third-quarter sales would be $50m-$55m, below analysts‘ average estimate of $58m.Lamson & Sessions posted its highest gain since 1980, rising 31.4 per cent to $25.80 after the maker of electrical outlet boxes agreed to a $27-a-share bid by Thomas & Betts, whose shares finished the trading day 3.7 per cent lower at $52.84.
165;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-07-16T18:04:14Z;Ackman takes 9.6% stake in Target;;Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has taken a 9.6 per cent share in Target, the US discount retailer, and says he will push for changes at a company whose shares have risen more than 45 per cent in the past 12 months.Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Investment fund has given no details of objectives, but Wall Street analysts expect him to focus on capital structure rather than the company’s much-applauded operating performance.In a regulatory filing on Monday, Pershing Square said it believed Target’s stock “is undervalued and [we] intend to discuss with management ways in which this …can be corrected”.The filing also said Target, led by Bob Ulrich, its chief executive, had “the strongest operating management in the retail industry”. Mr Ulrich was recently named CEO of the year by Chief Executive magazine.The retailer serves more prosperous middle-class customers than the bigger Wal-Mart and has set standards for its effective marketing and creation of “cheap chic” private label brands by designers including Isaac Mizrahi and Michael Graves.Target would not comment directly on Pershing Square’s stake but said the company welcomed “a dialogue on company strategy and performance with any member of our investor base and the financial community”.Wall Street analysts expect Mr Ackman’s discussions with the retailer to focus on its lucrative credit card portfolio and property holdings. Target, which operates 1,500 stores across the US and had sales last year of $57.8bn, owns about 85 per cent of its real estate.Other top US retailers – including Macy’s and Kohl’s – have sold their credit card businesses but Target says the business is integral to its effort to build relationships with its customers.In an unusual development, Pershing Square also said it would donate a third of any after-tax profits resulting from its investment in Target to its charitable foundation, set up last year, which funds inner-city development and human rights work.Mr Ackman has previously staged activist campaigns at McDonald’s and Wendy’s. Pershing Square’s stake in Target is valued at more than $5.6bn.
166;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-07-12T20:31:00Z;America’s chain stores feel the breeze;;US shoppers are feeling the strains of a gloomy housing market and high fuel prices, according to figures released Thursday by leading US chain stores.Wal-Mart, the largest, reported stronger-than-expected like-for-like sales in June, but sales in chain stores overall grew less than the year before, continuing the trend of the year so far.Retail Metrics, which surveys monthly figures, said its same-store sales index for the month rose 2.6 per cent, supported by Wal-Mart’s performance. But this compared with an average increase for the past six months of 2.9 per cent.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, warned that there would be no let-up for the sector. “The month was still soft …and we would expect that to continue for the rest of the year,” he said.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the June figures continued a “soft patch” for US retailers. “The good news is that the soft patch did not get deeper, raising the threat of it continuing for longer.“The underlying dynamic is still with us, and the soft housing market in particular,” he said.Wal-Mart reported same-store sales up 2.4 per cent, more than double analysts’ estimates.The retailer benefited from a 6.9 per cent increase at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores, which cater for small businesses and prosperous shoppers. Sales at its discount stores and Supercenters rose 1.6 per cent.Target, its main rival, reported a 3.3 per cent same-store increase, but expected stronger sales growth in July of 5 to 7 per cent.US department stores also delivered worse results than expected. Macy’s, struggling to integrate its 2005 acquisition of May’s, reported comparable sales down 2.7 per cent. It predicted a sales drop of up to 3 per cent in July and cut earnings guidance for the quarter.JC Penney and Kohl’s reported sales declines of 1.5 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively. Comparable sales at Saks, the luxury department store, were down 5.6 per cent.The US Commerce Department will release its June consumer spending figures Friday.
167;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-06-07T22:33:14Z;Warm May lifts sales at US retailers;;Leading US chain retailers on Thursday reported solid sales in May, as warm weather released pent-up demand from a dismal April and helped offset continuing consumer concerns over petrol prices and the housing market.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales numbers, said sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 per cent for the month, supported by good performances by upmarket department stores and some speciality clothing retailers.Nordstrom, Saks and Bon Ton department stores all beat Wall Street forecasts. However, Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, missed market expectations for the fourth consecutive month, with a 3.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, highlighting concerns about its integration of the former May’s Department stores it acquired in 2005.At JC Penney, comparable sales dropped 2 per cent, with it citing soft sales in jewellery, women’s accessories and household products, while sales at its rival Kohl’s saw a 10.5 per cent increase.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported a 7 per cent fall in same-store sales in North America, with sales at its Gap brand stores down 3 per cent. The retailer is pursuing a turnround while searching for a chief executive to replace Paul Pressler, who stepped down in January.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported that sales at its discount stores and Supercenters rose 0.3 per cent, although its Sam’s Club warehouse sales were up 5.4 per cent to give a total comparable sales increase of 1.1 per cent.Wal-Mart again said that its consumers continue to be troubled by rising petrol prices, which hit $3.20 during the month.The company said sales of clothing and home goods remained sluggish, but it expected to see improvements in the categories in its third quarter and “significant progress” in the fourth quarter. It said it expected sales in June to be between flat or up 2 per cent.Target, its smaller upmarket rival, said its same-store sales rose 5.8 per cent.
168;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2007-01-04T14:45:02Z;Warm Christmas hits US retailers;;Christmas resulted in disappointing sales for many clothing retailers in the US who blamed unseasonably warm weather and price cuts for lower than expected sales growth.Last month was the warmest December for 10 years, according to forecasters, and led to higher demand for out-of season clothing rather than winter items.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, confirmed that total sales in December had risen 1.6 per cent against its own estimates of 1 per cent sales growth. Sales at its US store network rose 1.3 per cent.Wal-Mart said that it had seen a “very strong performance” in electronics, where it launched an aggressive series of price-cuts at the start of November. But it said that apparel and home sales had been “soft” as expected, although price cuts in apparel had helped to boost sales. Target, Wal-Mart’s leading competitor, reported sales growth of 4.5 per cent, in the middle of its own forecast range, but below Wall Street’s average estimate.Retailers’ holiday sales are vital because the two months before Christmas can make up for 20 to 40 per cent of annual sales.Costco, the warehouse club that compete’s with Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club, delivered a 9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales, beating analyst’s forecasts of 5.7 per cent growth. Sam’s Club sales rose 5.6 per cent. But BJs, the third largest warehouse club, saw its shares drop 14 per cent after it reported sales growth of just 0.6 per cent, and cut its profit forecast.Gap said same-store sales fell 8 per cent, a worse figure than expected, despite swingeing price cuts designed to bring shoppers into its Gap and Old Navy stores. Out of all of its brands and regions only Banana Republic in the US and Canada reported sales growth, with an increase of 2 per cent on last year. In North America Gap and Old Navy saw sales fall 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, and internationally sales fell by 8 per cent.The struggling retailer also cut its outlook and said it was reviewing its brand strategies for Gap and Old Navy.Department stores delivered a mixed picture. Saks and Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department stores, saw sales jump 11.1 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, both roundly beating Wall Street forecasts.But Federated Department Stores owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said sales at its stores, excluding the May stores acquired in 2005, rose by 4.4 per cent, below its own forecast. The company said sales at more than 300 former May Department Store locations, which have been converted to the Macy’s banner since their acquisition in 2005, “remained weak”, without giving details.JC Penney said same store sales increased 2.6 per cent in December, beating analysts’ expecations of 2.4 per cent and last year’s figure of 2.2 per cent. Children’s clothing and jewellry proved popular with shoppers. Its rival Kohl’s saw sales rise 3.4 per cent, below forecasts.AnnTaylor, another major apparel seller, said it had suffered a 5.3 per cent drop in same-store sales and said its full-year earnings will come in lower than its original guidance of $2.07 to $2.12 a share.Pier 1, the home-furnishings retailer, saw a 10.7 per cent drop in same-store sales, even worse than the 9.4 per cent fall Wall Street had anticipated.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, saw a 4 per cent gain, well below the 9.3 per cent Wall Street expected.Zale said sales increased by 2.3 per cent for the combined months of November and December. It said profit margins were lower than expected because of price cutting.American Eagle Outfitters, the teen apparel retailer, said on Wednesday that same store sales grew 13 per cent for the month, beating Wall Street’s expectations for 8.7 per cent growth.
169;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2006-12-26T21:49:58Z;US stocks rally in thin holiday trade;;US stocks rallied on Tuesday, as lower oil prices helped offset weakness in retailers amid reports that holiday sales had fallen short of expectations.The majority of gains arrived during the last hour of trading, with volumes at the New York Stock Exchange the lowest seen this year, as stocks enjoyed a rebound after last week’s broad losses.Analysts expect window dressing in stocks could dictate moves this week, as investors purchase those that have experienced solid gains this year in order to embellish their portfolios. This is seen outweighing sales of poor performing stocks, made by investors to lock in a tax loss for their 2006 tax returns.The S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent, or 61.4 points to 1,416.90, on Tuesday. All 10 major groups in the index settled higher, led by the Materials and Financials sectors, while the energy sector reversed weakness seen earlier during the day as oil prices slid.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent, or 12.33 points to 2413.51. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 0.8 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent, or 64.41 points higher to 12,407.63. Boosting blue chips were, Walt Disney, up 1.1 per cent at $34.53, Dupont, up 1.2 per cent at $49.15 and Citigroup, higher by 1 per cent at $55.12.Despite the reversal in oil prices, shares in Exxon Mobil gained 0.9 per cent to $76.05, as investors cheered news the company had won a contract with Libya’s state-run National Oil Corp.Shares in Ford rose 0.9 per cent to $7.49, off a high of $7.57, as news that company officials met with Toyota last week surfaced.Small capitalised stocks fared well, with the Russell 2000 index rising nearly 1 per cent per cent to close at 788.25, and its gain of 17.07 per cent for the year beats the Dow’s rise of 15.77 per cent.The retail sector opened under pressure on Tuesday, and despite paring some losses, closed lower on the day.According to SpendingPulse, which analyses the performance of retailers based on MasterCard data, US holiday sales grew by 3 per cent from the day after Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve this year, compared with 5.2 per cent growth in 2005. The figures were adjusted for the fact that the holiday shopping season was one day longer than last year. Without the adjustment, sales grew 6.6 per cent in 2006, compared with growth of 8.7 per cent in 2005.The S&P 500 retail index was 0.2 per cent lower at 496.89, after hitting a low of 493.86 for the day in early trade.The S&P Department stores index closed 1.2 per cent lower at 262.81.Shares in JC Penney fell 2.3 per cent at $77.74, Kohls was down 01.3 per cent at $68.89 and Federated Department stores slid 0.9 per cent to $37.76.

Wal-Mart rose 1.2 per cent to $46.11In the internet shopping space, shares in Amazon were 1.1 per cent lower at $39.80, despite experiencing its best holiday sales season in history according to company officials. Meanwhile, eBay’ shares rose 0.3 per cent to $30.32, down from an earlier rise to $30.63.Staying with technology, shares in Microsoft had rebounded from earlier weakness and rallied 1.2 per cent to $29.99. The stock price was buffeted by reports that its latest computer operating system, Windows Vista, has potentially serious security flaws.Shares in Savvis gained 2 per cent to $35.92, after the information technology company sold a business unit to Level 3 Communications for $135m. Shares in Level 3 were down 1.2 per cent at $5.59.Shares in Telik plunged 70.7 per cent to $4.77, after thedrug developer said its Telcyta drug did not show asignificant improvement in survival rates for lung cancer patients.In deal news, CPAC said it had agreed to a $42.8m private buy-out. Shares in the maker of consumer and industrial products rose 7.6 percent, to $8.45.Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission announced they had approved Freeport McMoRan’s plan to buy Phelps Dodge in a $25.9bn deal and create the world’s largest copper miner. Shares in Freeport rose 1.3 per cent to $54.54, and Phelps closed 1.5 per cent firmer at $118.63, down from a peak of $123 for the day.
170;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wal-Mart suffers for its fashion mistakes;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on Thursday issued a sombre forecast for sales in December, blaming mis-steps in its efforts to introduce more fashionable and expensive clothing and home furnishings into its low-cost discount stores.The retailer said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to grow by no more than 1 per cent, after comparable sales fell by 0.1 per cent in November – the first drop since 1996.The company cited continued problems with its home and clothing categories, where its core customers have not responded well to its drive to introduce goods such as the Metro 7 women’s clothing range across its entire store network.Eduardo Castro-Wright, chief executive of Wal-Mart’s US stores division, said: “The home and apparel business is challenging and this will continue throughout the fourth quarter.” He noted that basic items in both categories continued to sell well.The company said it did not expect to see improvements in both categories until spring.The drive to persuade more prosperous customers to buy more than food and basics at the stores has been the focus of an overhaul of the retailer’s marketing strategy over the past year – sometimes at the expense of its traditional low-price message.Mr Castro-Wright said the retailer’s pre-Christmas marketing would focus on “communicating price leadership” and that it would deliver further price cuts in the run-up to the holidays.Wal-Mart’s poor performance in November contrasted with Target, its more upmarket rival, which reported a 5.9 per cent increase in comparable store sales, and predicted growth of 3.5-5.5 per cent for December.Overall, leading US retailers reported a subdued November. Retail Metrics said its monthly index of same store sales growth rose 2.2 per cent, and that more than half the retailers reporting missed their forecast numbers.Several clothing retailers cited the impact of unseasonably warm November weather on sales of winter clothing, and this was also cited as a negative factor by Ann Taylor, the women’s clothing retailer, and Kohls, the low cost department store.The big three traditional department store chains, however, again delivered above-average performances. Federated said November same-store sales rose 8.5 per cent at its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores, and raised its estimate for December sales. Saks and Nordstrom saw sales growth of 7.2 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, saw its sales woes continue at its Gap and Old Navy stores. The group’s overall same store sales were down 8 per cent, and total net sales slipped 2 per cent to $1.4bn.
171;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2006-11-24T18:52:47Z;US retailers fire starter gun on sales;;US shoppers on Friday launched their frantic traditional post-Thanksgiving Day assault on stores and malls across the country, amid predictions of a solid but not spectacular holiday season for the retail sector.The annual Friday ritual of early-morning openings and “door-buster” limited availability offers is used by retailers to mark the start of the holiday shopping season.However, most leading retailers now launch their Christmas marketing campaigns at the beginning of November.This year the event again crept into the Thursday holiday itself – led in part by online retailers, who last year saw a spike in transactions from customers shopping from home on the holiday.Underlining the trend, Amazon, the largest online retailer, staged a Thanksgiving afternoon promotion in which it sold 1,000 Xbox 360 systems for a third of their advertised price. Kmart’s 1,400 discount stores opened for the first time on Thanksgiving Day, while CompUSA, the computer retailer, opened its stores from 9pm to midnight. FAO Schwartz, the Manhattan toy store, also opened on Thursday.Department stores, including JC Penney, Kohl’s, Saks and Macy’s also launched “pre-Thanksgiving” sales in the week before the holiday.A number of malls owned by Simon Properties opened their doors at midnight on Thursday. But the early Friday morning remains the most bitterly contested retail battleground. The focus on the day after Thanksgiving continues a tradition that dates back to the days when department stores reopened their stores with Christmas decorations and settings on the day after the holidays.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, and Best Buy and Circuit City, the largest electronics retailers opened their doors at 5am on Friday, with customers in some locations queuing all night for “door-buster” bargains, traditionally advertised in Thanksgiving Day papers.In an effort to thwart websites that have managed in the past to publish details of its door-buster offers ahead of time, Wal-Mart this year announced 17 “secret” items on its website on Thanksgiving Day – including the latest Xbox game console that would be limited to just six per store.The hooplah this year also included a stunt by David Blaine, the escapologist, in New York’s Times Square sponsored by Target, Wal-Mart’s main rival.Overall, economists are predicting stronger consumer spending over the holidays than last year, despite an initial level of pessimism based around high fuel prices and interest rate concerns.The National Retail Federation in September predicted a modest 5 per cent increase this year in sales in November and December to $457.4bn against a 6.1 per cent increase last year.But Wayne Best, Visa USA’s chief economist, said earlier this month that it expected growth of 7.5 per cent, as lower fuel prices and a buoyant stock market have improved consumer’s confidence.
172;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2006-11-02T21:31:52Z;Retailers drag Dow below 12,000;;Wall Street stocks declined on Thursday, hit by generally weaker sales figures from leading retailers and a surprising stall in US productivity during the third quarter.The nation’s largest retailer Wal-Mart confirmed meagre sales growth of 0.5 per cent at its stores for October and is now predicting flat sales during November. Shares in the retailer closed down 1.2 per cent at $48.29.Gap also missed sales and Citigroup downgraded the clothing chain to a “hold” from a “buy”. Its shares fell 5.5 per cent to $19.50.Wholesale retailer Costco and other retailers, Target, Dillard’s, Kohl’smissed analyst expectations.Costco rebounded and setteld up 0.2 per cent at $53. Target was off 1.3 per cent at $56.96, Dillard’s was down 1.7 per cent at $29.29 and Kohl’s was 0.75 per cent lower at $70.54.In contrast, Nordstrom and JC Penney enjoyed a solid October, with their shares up 1 and 2.4 per cent at $46.76 and $76.93 respectively. Federated beat sales but fell 3.9 per cent to $41.35 on a weaker sales outlook. Saks also enjoyed good sales and rose 1.5 per cent to $19.48“It’s striking that the discounters are seeing disappointing sales, while high-end retailers are holding up,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management.Beyond monthly sales figures, he believes the real test for the consumer will come when a spillover from the slowing housing market into job creation occurs. “The consumer will follow the economy into a slowdown, not lead it.”The next test for stocks will be the October employment report on Friday.The S&P 500 settled 0.47 points, or 0.03 per cent, lower at 1,367.34, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.33 points, or 0.01 per cent, lower at 2,334.02.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 12.48 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 12,018.54, having earlier slipped below 12,000.To date, 385 of the S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly earnings, with 74 per cent above estimates, according to Thomson Financial.Earnings for the third quarter are running 18.6 per cent higher versus a year ago, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.Shares in Intel were off their lows, down 1.6 per cent at $20.68, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the chipmaker from “buy” to “neutral” amid weakening demand and persistent excess capacity. By contrast, Dell shares were up 3.3 per cent at $24.80 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the group from “sell” to “neutral” citing disciplined pricing and attention to sales mix.In earnings news, International Paper missed estimates as it reported 39 cents a share versus a forecast 43 cents. Its shares were down 1.6 per cent at $32.50.
173;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Strong month for US mid-range stores;;JC Penney and Federated Department Stores on Thursday highlighted the renewed strength in the middle ground of the US retail sector with strong September sales figures, contrasting with the sluggish performance of Wal-Mart, their supposed nemesis.JC Penney reported that sales at stores open at least a year increased by 8.7 per cent in September, and raised its earnings guidance for the quarter.Federated, the owner of Macy’s, reported a 6.2 per cent increase in comparable sales, following a 16.3 per cent increase announced earlier in the week by Kohl’s.Wal-Mart, in contrast, said sales at its Supercenters and discount stores increased just 1.3 per cent, and expressed disappointment with its clothing sales – despite cool autumn weather that boosted clothing sales at competitors.Lower fuel prices also contributed to a strong month for retailers overall, with Retail Metrics’ index of same-store sales up 3.8 per cent, or 6 per cent excluding Wal-Mart.Donald Soares, a retail consultant at CapGemini, said: “Contrary to the doom and gloom scenario that has been painted over the last couple of months, consumer confidence has rebounded and that is what is driving sales.”While the monthly sales figures can be volatile, the latest numbers reflect a steady shift in the landscape for the mid-range and lower- cost department stores.The segment was once widely seen as trapped between the discounters and high-end stores.Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo, an investment bank specialising in retail, said “the middle tier is fighting back and fighting back effectively …they all realise the exciting thing about retail is that you have to change”.Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, argued in research last month that the “retail hourglass” that existed in 2000 – with growth at the high end and low end but not in the middle – had “played itself out by the end of 2005” and that “a new chapter is now beginning”.She cited a series of factors, including the consolidation among companies “stuck in the middle” that led to last year’s takeover of May Department Stores and the sell-off of Saks’s department stores.In another apparent sign of confidence in the department store sector, Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, recently moved significantly to increase his holdings in Federated shares.Not everyone prospered in September. Dillard’s, the regional department store chain, saw its shares fall more than 10 per cent on Thursday, after it announced flat September sales.Gap also reported a 3 per cent drop in same-store sales, despite a huge US marketing campaign aimed at reversing two years of falling comparable sales.
174;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2006-10-04T16:56:49Z;Wal-Mart lowers sales growth estimate;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, suffered a blow to its reputation for effective handling of its sales information, as it was forced on Wednesday to revise downwards an initial estimate for September same-store sales growth.The retailer said it was revising its estimate for sales growth at US stores open at least a year to 1.3 per cent, from the 1.8 per cent estimate it released on Saturday.A Wal-Mart statement said the error in the growth figure was due to approximately 235 Wal-Mart stores and Sam’s Club warehouse stores being “incorrectly coded for the calculation of the comparable sales estimate during the five-week reporting period”.The company said that its overall sales in the five week reporting period – which it be released today along with other leading retail chains’ data – were unchanged.Same-store sales are seen by investors as in important indicator of a retailer’s fundamental performance, since they exclude sales growth due to the opening of new stores.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, speculated that the error might be linked to a change this year in the period used by Wal-Mart to calculate its same store sales – moving to an industry standard of stores open at least 12 months.The retailer has adjusted its initial sales estimate before, he noted, but not by such a large number. “Maybe a tenth, or two tenths. But this was big.”Investors have been looking for signs of improvement in Wal-Mart’s sales growth as the retailer pursues a range of new initiatives aimed at improving its performance, including persuading customers to buy higher margin items such as electronics and clothing.Wal-Mart’s original September sales growth estimate had already disappointed the market, which had expected lower petrol prices and cool September weather to support sales growth across the sector.The retailer cited a difficult comparison with the previous year, when sales where boosted by shoppers in the southern states stocking up ahead of Hurricane Katrina.Wal-Mart’s sales have also been dampened this year by an ongoing drive to remodel hundreds of the company’s stores.On Tuesday, Kohl’s, the low-cost department store, said its sales at stores opened at least a year rose 16.3 per cent in September, and increased its profit forecast for the quarter.
175;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2006-08-27T16:55:46Z;Kohl’s focuses on May fallout;;Kohl’s, the mid-ranged US department store, said it believed it could win customers disenchanted with the impact of last year’s $17bn takeover of May department stores by Federated, the owner of the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s names.Kevin Mansell, Kohl’s president, said he saw consolidation in the sector, and in particular the Federated deal, as creating “tremendous opportunities” for the retailer, which operates more than 740 standalone “big box” stores across the US.“The merger is creating an opportunity for Kohl’s – probably the likes of which we’ve never had – to win business that is very much up for grabs,” he said, citing store closures by Federated, and customers unhappy about the extension of the Macy’s nameplate across former May stores.Kohl’s, which had sales of $13bn last year, is planning to open another 80 stores this year, and plans to expand to 1,200 stores by 2010.Mr Mansell said last week’s announcement of a deal with Vera Wang, the leading US fashion designer, was part of its drive to attract shoppers to Kohl’s stores. Ms Wang and Kohl’s announced a multi-year deal to create her first low-cost range.“We’re trying to take the fashion and the style at speciality stores and department stores, and make it more available at lower prices,” Mr Mansell said.The deal is the latest in a trend that has seen the development of “cheap chic” designer lines by Target, a discounter, and by JC Penney, the mid-range department store that competes for the same customers as Kohl’s.Vera Wang made her name in the 1990s as a designer of wedding dresses. Her ready-to-wear dresses sell at department stores for more than $500. Kohl’s most expensive dresses are priced at $62, although the company said it expected the Very Vera label to be priced above current levels.Gilbert Harrison, chief executive of Financo, an investment bank specialising in retail, described Ms Wang as “one of the most talented American designers”.In 2003, Kohl’s began selling a line of private label cosmetics and skin care products produced by Estee Lauder. It also markets a line of casual clothing by Polo Ralph Lauren.
176;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2006-05-15T17:42:34Z;Target profits surge 12% with credit cards’ help;;Target, the US discount retailer, on Monday highlighted the strong performance of its credit card business as it announced that its first-quarter profit rose 12 per cent against the same period last year, to $554m, or 63 cents per diluted share.While other leading US retailers, including Federated, Kohl’s and Neiman Marcus, have sold off their credit card operations over the past year, Target said the contribution of its card portfolio to net earnings before taxes rose 59.5 per cent during the quarter, to $162m.Douglas Scovanner, chief financial officer, dismissed suggestions that Target might consider selling its card business. “The credit card portfolio continues to generate very, very strong absolute performance and spectacular year-over-year performance,” he told analysts.“This business had been a fabulous tool for making our guests want to visit our stores more often, and spend more on each visit across a long period of time, and our margins today are as wide as they’ve ever been.”In spite of the rise in profits – and a 12.1 per cent increase in quarterly sales to $12.8bn – Target reported larger-than-expected increases in its expenses, which grew faster than sales, and a slight decline in its gross margins.Mr Scovanner said store payroll and operating costs, including power and light, accounted for about 40 per cent of the increase in expense rate, with the remainder put towards initiatives aimed at increasing overall profitablity. For the full year, he expected expenses to be “up slightly” as a percentage of sales.The retailer, which has built a reputation around selling “cheap chic” style in its clothing and home furnishings, also indicated it had overshot its customers’ willingness to spend on home furnishings.Greg Steinhafel, Target’s president, cited in particular price markdowns related to its annual “Global Bazaar” promotion of ethnically styled home furnishings.“We upscaled too far at this particular point of time,” he said. “We will be bringing those price points down. . . We’re going to make the kind of changes that are going to stimulate impulse buying and people not waiting for the assortment to go on sale.”Mr Steinhafel also dismissed current efforts by Wal-Mart, its larger rival, to offer more upscale products. “We have seen just a limited amount of upscaling in home, and a slight upscaling in their apparel.”Target’s shares were down 4.4 per cent, at $49.40, by lunchtime in New York.
177;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2006-03-02T21:55:25Z;Wall Street lower on retail and crude worries;;"Higher crude prices boosted the energy sector on Thursday but Wall Street fell as soft sales figures from retailers and higher bond yields kept buyers on the sidelines.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session 0.3 per cent lower at 11,025.51, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite each fell 0.2 per cent to 1,289.14 and 2,311.11 respectively.Retailers put in a mixed performance as a drop in temperatures and a heavy snow storm in the US northeast kept shoppers indoors.The unexpected cold snap also sapped consumer appetite for spring apparel, putting a squeeze on clothing retailers.Same-store sales figures from Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch both fell short of analysts’ expectations. Gap, which unveiled an 11 per cent drop in February sales, saw its shares fall 2 per cent to $18.28, while teenage fashion retailer Abercrombie tumbled 9.2 per cent to $61.55Discount retailers and department stores provided some relief for the sector, however, as Costco Wholesale gained 1.2 per cent to $52.80 and Kohl’s rose 0.5 per cent to $49.03.Along with retailers, investors also had their collective eye on energy stocks, which rose as concerns over possible disruptions to supplies and the threat of further violence in Nigeria pushed crude futures above $63.Energy service providers were among the top gainers in the sector.

178;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2006-01-05T18:49:47Z;US retailers post modest sales gains;;US retailers reported solid holiday sales boosted by a late shopping surge and big markdowns. But a profit warning from Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, raised concerns about the impact deep discounting could have on earnings.Wal-Mart expects fourth-quarter profits to come in at the low end of its forecast of 82-86 cents a share. Kohl’s, the mid-priced department store, also lowered estimates.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics research, said the margin impact of the promotional activity app-eared to have hurt some retailers, but the lower earnings guidance was “not as significant as many had feared”.Analysts were watching December sales as consumers delayed shopping until late in the month, with many opting for gift cards. Retailers book the revenue from the cards when they are redeemed, not when they are sold, which usually boosts January sales. Gift cards accounted for an estimated 15-18 per cent of consumer spending this holiday season.There were also fears about Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday, starting late, the lack of hot “must-have” items and whether the transit strike in New York would hurt the city’s big retailers.Overall sales rose 3.4 per cent, said Mr Perkins, better than his 3.1 per cent forecast. Factoring out Wal-Mart, sales were up 4.3 per cent. Sixty-four per cent of the Retail Metrics index beat expectations.Wal-Mart confirmed that December same-store sales – from stores open at least a year – rose 2.2. per cent, its weakest December sales increase in five years. The mediocre gain is a blow to the retailer in the wake of an aggressive holiday marketing campaign launched early in the season after it stumbled in 2004.Sales at Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, rose 3.4 per cent, beating expectations.“We are pleased with Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s performance in December, despite disruptions caused by the . . . strike the week before Christmas,” said Terry Lundgren, Federated’s chief executive.The biggest positive surprise came from Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen speciality retailer, which reported a 29 per cent jump in sales. The gain was impressive as most of its merchandise was sold at full price during a season of markdowns. Aeropostale, another teen retailer, surpassed expectations with a rise of 11.4 per cent against expectations of 4.4 per cent.Sales at Target, Wal-Mart’s discount rival, rose 4.7 per cent, while Nordstrom, a luxury retailer, beat expectations with a gain of 7.7 per cent. At Gap, the floundering apparel retailer, sales tumbled 9 per cent – worse than the forecast 3.8 per cent decline.
179;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2005-08-30T21:28:07Z;Federated completes May takeover;;Federated Department Stores on Tuesday completed its $17bn takeover of May, creating a national chain of more than 950 traditional department stores with sales of around $30bn.The merger creates a national chain of 950 traditional department stores which will have annual sales of around $30bn. Federated has said that starting next year it will convert 330 May stores - currently trading under a range of regional names - to its national Macy’s brand.Terry Lundgren, Federated’s chief executive, described the closure of the merger as a landmark day in Federated’s history, and said the company’s immediate focus would be on “serving customers and delivering results through the holiday selling season”.The company, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, also said it had agreed to divest a further 7 stores at shopping malls to meet concerns of state competition regulators, bringing the total of merger-related closures to 75.New York state regulators said Federated was required to ensure that 26 of its divested stores in five states were replaced by a “full service” department store, which would in turn be obliged to continue to operate as a department store for a further seven years.The agreement cites a list of suitable potential buyers which omits a range of potentially interested retailers, including JC Penney, Kohls, Target, Sears and other lower cost broad-range operators. It also sets a March 2006 deadline for agreements on the sale of the stores.Eliot Spitzer, New York attorney general, said in a statement that placing divested department stores under new ownership would result in “lower prices, greater choice, and increased services” for consumers at the three New York state sites affected.Federated has yet to decide whether it will continue to trade under one of the best known of the May names, Chicago’s Marshall Field’s, which operates the recently renovated landmark store in the centre of the city, as well as a network of 60 Midwest regional locations.There is also speculation over a possible sale of the New York flagship store of May’s 58 store Lord & Taylor chain. Located on Fifth Avenue, close to the Empire State building, the store is only a few blocks from Macy’s main store. Federated has said it will not convert the Lord & Taylor chain to the Macy’s name, and that it has not taken any decisions yet on its long-term future.The company said again there be no job cuts before March 2006, and that the “vast majority” of employees from the affected stores will be offered positions at other Macy’s or Bloomingdale’s locations.
180;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wall Street climbs as oil price eases;;US stocks rallied sharply on Monday as US investors expressed relief that oil prices eased off of another record high, but many analysts doubted that the bounceback would last.Strategists said the rally was also partly a bounceback from an oversold condition, as stocks skidded to 12-month lows late last week.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 1.3 per cent to 9,954.55, while the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent to 1,079.34. The Nasdaq climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,782.84.However, many analysts were sceptical the rally would last. Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management, said investors still had plenty of reason to be cautious, but added that the strong showing was all the more impressive after an extremely weak report on manufacturing activity in the New York region.Nonetheless, upbeat news from a handful of retailers drove a broadly based rally, and sent the sector to the S&P 500's best showing, up 2.8 per cent.Lowe's rose 5.3 per cent to $49.14 after the home improvement chain posted higher earnings, and said August sales were better than expected. Investors overlooked the fact that the company missed analysts' forecasts as the company guided earnings estimates in the current quarter slightly higher than Wall Street's consensus. It was among the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500.Rival Home Depot, due to unveil earnings on Tuesday, rose 2.5 per cent to $33.98.Elsewhere in retail, Kmart Holding, the operator of the discount chain, rose 17.2 per cent to $76.05, after the company swung to a second-quarter profit, thanks to lower costs and promotions.Kohl's climbed 2.3 per cent to $47.17, after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “in-line.”Insurers rallied as investors expressed relief that the latest estimates for the cost of damage caused by Hurricane Charley in Florida at the weekend between $5bn and 10bn are lower than previously feared.Further, investors hoped the disaster would help stabilise the slide in rates for property insurance. The S&P 500 sector rose 1.8 per cent.Allstate, the home and auto insurer rose 1.4 per cent to $46.55, in spite of warning the potential losses from the disaster could hit its current quarter results. AIG, the world's biggest insurer, climbed 2.4 per cent to $68.05. Renaissance Re, the reinsurer, rose 1.9 per cent to $51.83. St Paul Travelers added 1.9 per cent to $33.58.Mike Holton, portfolio manager of the T Rowe Price Financial Services Fund, said that $5bn-$10bn amounts to just 2-3 per cent of the industry's capital. “The industry can absorb that kind of blow and not skip a beat,” adding “In an industry plagued by over-capitalisation, any time you take capacity out it's a positive.”Toy companies were also in focus, after last week's restructuring announced by Toys R Us. Mattel shed 1.3 per cent to $16.96, after it was downgraded by both Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney. It was among the session's worst performers on the S&P 500. Hasbro dipped 0.2 per cent to $17.60, after it was also cut by Lehman, down to underweight from equal weight.Continuing the recent spate of M&A activity, LifePoint Hospitals said it would buy Province Healthcare for $1.7bn. Markets voiced their displeasure with the deal's 66 per cent premium for Province, sending LifePoint shares down 15.4 to $27.70. Province soared 41.4 per cent to $19.25, the best showing on the New York Stock Exchange.Sysco, the food distributor, dropped 7.3 per cent to $31, in spite of posting rising earnings, as investors worried about margin-pinching inflation and softening sales. The company said it saw slower sales in its fourth fiscal quarter, which have continued into the current quarter.One of the session's top movers was Ciphergen Biosystems, which climbed 21.4 per cent to $3.29, after the company announced promising results from a study in the detection of early stage ovarian cancer.
181;KSS;Kohl's Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
