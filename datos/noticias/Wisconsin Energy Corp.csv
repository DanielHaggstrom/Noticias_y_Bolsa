0;WEC;Wisconsin Energy Corp;2014-06-23T21:32:54Z;BlackBerry rises on ‘meaningful progress’;;BlackBerry shares rose above $10 apiece for the first time since March after brokerage Evercore lifted its view as the company makes “meaningful progress” on its turnround.Analysts with Evercore increased their rating on the company to equal-weight from underweight, marking the first time in at least two years that three-quarters of investment banks have rated BlackBerry a buy or hold equivalent.The smartphone maker, which has turned its focus to software and its BlackBerry Messenger service, said last week that it had swung to a profit in the three months to the end of May compared with a loss a quarter earlier.“We stick to our call that we like BlackBerry’s plan, albeit late, but now acknowledge stabilising cash burn . . . and a good plan to hold on to the core subscriber base,” Mark McKechnie said.Mr McKechnie projects the company will grow BlackBerry Messenger to a $230m business and continue to win back corporate subscribers who had switched to other platforms including Good, which recently filed paperwork to float shares publicly.BlackBerry shares climbed 3.24 per cent to close at $10.85.Shares of Micros Systems rose 3.36 per cent to $67.98 after Oracle agreed to buy the company, which sells internet-based cash registers to retailers, for $4.6bn in cash.Micros investors will receive $68 a share, according to the terms of the deal.Like other, older, software makers, Oracle is having to rapidly adapt to an era of so-called cloud computing, in which customers receive software online and pay for it as they use it rather than on an annual licence model.Oracle shares rose 0.69 per cent to $41.10.The merger blitz on Monday was not left solely to the tech industry after Wisconsin Energy agreed to buy rival Integrys Energy for $9.1bn in cash, shares and assumed debt.The deal expands Wisconsin’s customer base – for both gas and electricity – into Minnesota and Michigan.Combined, the company will have about 4.3m customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota.Gale Klappa, chief executive of Wisconsin, will run the combined company and insisted on Monday that the acquisition would “create the premier regulated utility system in the Midwest”.The companies said the acquisition valued Integrys at $71.47 a share.Wisconsin, whose history dates back to the late 19th century, said the dividend of the combined company would be about 65 to 70 per cent of its earnings.Shares of Integrys rose 12.14 per cent to $68.35 while Wisconsin fell 3.45 per cent to $45.27.Lululemon advanced as speculation rose that the company’s founder could mount a bid to take the Yoga-apparel maker private.According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Dennis Wilson is working with Goldman Sachs as he debates launching a proxy fight for extra board seats.Mr Wilson may also partner with a private equity firm to purchase Lululemon outright.Shares in the Vancouver-based retailer rose 2.54 per cent to $41.25.Nordstrom was under pressure on Monday after broker Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the department store chain to neutral from buy.The investment bank, which expects overall discretionary spending to accelerate after the harsh winter, believes Nordstrom shares have outperformed and have little upside left.Nordstrom shares fell 0.53 per cent to $67.73.US equity markets ended the day flat after six consecutive advances despite better than expected manufacturing and home sales reports.The S&P 500 fell 0.01 per cent to 1,962.61 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.06 per cent to 16,937.26. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.01 per cent to 4,368.68.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
1;WEC;Wisconsin Energy Corp;2014-06-23T20:09:19Z;Wisconsin Energy in $9bn Integrys deal;;Wisconsin Energy will acquire Integrys Energy Group for $9.1bn, including debt, in the latest sign of the flurry of consolidation in the US utility market.The new company, to be named WEC Energy, will serve a combined 4.3m customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota, making it one of the largest Midwestern utilities. It will be the eighth-largest natural gas distributor in the US.The $71.47 a share offer represents a 17 per cent premium on Chicago-based Integrys’s closing price on Friday. Integrys shareholders will receive most of their payment in Wisconsin shares, with 26 per cent coming in cash.Gale Klappa, Wisconsin chief executive, will lead the combined company, which will hold a 60 per cent stake in American Transmission Co, a transmission-only utility.He said the combination would “create the premier regulated utility system in the Midwest, with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come”. He said Wisconsin would have to pay Integrys a break-up fee of 3 per cent of the deal’s value if it were terminated.Charles Schrock, chief executive of Integrys, said the company had analysed potential combinations with other companies, but did not solicit bids.Shares in Wisconsin, which has a market capitalisation of $10.3bn, were down 3.48 per cent to $45.26 by the close in New York. Integrys shares were up 12.14 per cent to $68.35.The merger is the latest sign of the consolidation sweeping the utility sector, as companies seek to limit exposure to volatile energy markets and cut costs in the face of a slow economic recovery and lower demand. It follows Exelon’s $12bn acquisition of Pepco Holdings in April and the combination this month of the power generation businesses of PPL Corp and Riverstone Holdings.“In order to really drive earnings you need to cut costs and I think mergers have shown the ability to drive costs out of the system,” said Andrew Bischof, analyst at Morningstar. “There are significant advantages to being a larger utility.”Last year saw a flurry of big ticket deals, capped by MidAmerican Energy’s $10bn acquisition of Nevada’s NV Energy.In 2013 Duke Energy became the largest US utility with a market capitalisation of about $48bn, when it completed its $26bn acquisition, including debt, of Progress Energy, and Exelon bought Constellation Energy for $10.6bn including debt.Wisconsin was advised by Barclays and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, while Integrys was advised by Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Foley & Lardner and Lazard.The deal is expected to close in the summer of 2015 and requires approvals from federal authorities and officials in four states.
2;WEC;Wisconsin Energy Corp;2012-05-20T16:27:49Z;Safety on Wall Street;Though far from Greece, fear is beginning to set into the US equity market;It has recently felt like the final, slow-motion seconds before a car accident: breaking, skidding, the other car floating closer, a sense of unreality and the hope that the impact will never come. Saturday’s G8 declaration offered no help whatsoever. It is increasingly possible that Greece will exit the eurozone and, if it does, the repercussions – barring extremely aggressive action by the European Central Bank – will be hugely nasty.Investors in markets one small ocean away, in the US, seem to think they can slip by unharmed. The S&P 500, for example, is a mere 8 per cent down from its recent peak six weeks ago and the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio remains high. Still, a more granular look at the equity market shows that fear is beginning to set in. Of the 20 big-cap ($10bn and over) US and Canadian stocks that have performed best in the recent pullback, six are utilities or their cousins the pipeline companies, according to CapitalIQ data. Many of the others are classic defensives as well: Hershey, Verizon, Kimberly-Clark and so on.Utilities look like the easy trade here. During the last market crash far the best-performing group was consumer staples. But if the goal is to find non-cyclical companies with no exposure to Europe, investors who have bid up Wisconsin Energy or Pembina Pipeline have the right idea. And dividend-paying utilities will benefit if central banks respond to a European crisis by printing money, keeping discount rates low.Remember how little relative outperformance can mean when things get ugly, though: in real money utilities dropped 46 per cent in the last crisis. Unless you have a stock-only mandate, sector allocation during a collapsing market is like deciding whether to use the salad fork or the dinner fork to stab yourself in the eye. The right question may be: how much money belongs in stocks at all?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
