0;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2017-05-04T16:26:52Z;US hospital stocks turn softer ahead of healthcare vote;;It’s deja vu all over again for US hospital stocks ahead of an expected vote coming Thursday afternoon on Republicans’ latest attempt to pass healthcare reform.The S&P 500 healthcare facilities index — a gauge that tracks acute-care focused HCA Holdings and behavioural-care geared Universal Health Services — was down more than 0.7 per cent on Thursday, just hours before the US House of Representatives is set to vote on the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace portions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.Obamacare has been a boon to many hospitals and healthcare providers in reducing the number of uninsured Americans and expanding the Medicaid programme for America’s poor and disabled, which has helped providers cut write-downs on emergency care provided to individuals regardless of their ability to pay.Hospital stocks have risen and fallen on Republicans’ efforts to deliver on the Obamacare repeal and replace that many have promised. For instance, the facilities index fell 11.2 per cent from when US President Donald Trump — who frequently targetted Obamacare on the campaign trail — was elected in November until the end of 2016.The day that Republicans abruptly pulled the plug on their first attempt to pass legislation to gut Obamacare in March, the index rallied 3.2 per cent, and it rose an additional 4.6 per cent the following trading day.Individual companies that also operate healthcare facilities were also tracking lower on Thursday, with Tenet Healthcare down 0.5 per cent, Community Health Systems off 1.66 per cent, LifePoint Health off 1.9 per cent and Acadia Healthcare declining 0.12 per cent.The outcome of the hastily assembled legislation, however, remains far from certain, meaning that there may be more twists and turns for hospital stocks before the day is over.
1;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2015-06-25T17:44:48Z;Obamacare ruling ignites health stocks;Sector surges as US Supreme Court backs healthcare reform;US hospital operators surged amid frenzied investor demand on Thursday after the US Supreme Court backed a key component of President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform.Shares in HCA Holdings, the sector leader, jumped 9 per cent to a new record high of $90.72 on the back of the ruling. The climb added more than $3bn to HCA’s market value, bringing it to $34.5bn.Universal Health Services, another large operator, also saw its shares hit a new high of $140.78 following an 8 per cent gain. Rivals Tenet Healthcare advanced 12 per cent to $56.21 while Community Health Systems added 13 per cent to $62.45.Hospital groups have been significant beneficiaries of Obamacare, which has expanded health insurance in the US. A ruling against the administration had been expected to put coverage at risk for more than 6m Americans and ripple across the healthcare industry in the form of reduced revenues and higher unpaid hospital bills.UnitedHealth Group, Anthem, Aetna, Humana and Cigna — the five largest for-profit health insurers in the country — all also rose on the news, booking in gains of between 1 per cent and 7 per cent. The ruling has fuelled speculation of further takeover talks in the sector.UnitedHealth has reportedly approached Aetna about a takeover while Cigna recently rebuffed a $53bn offer from Anthem. Meanwhile Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn.Elsewhere, Eli Lilly jumped after the US drugmaker won a patent case that bars rival Actavis from selling a generic form of its blockbuster Alimta cancer drug in the UK before the patent expires in 2021.Alimta is Eli’s single biggest selling producer. It generated $2.8bn in revenues last year — or 14 per cent of total group revenue. The verdict, which reverses a 2014 decision by the English High Court, will also apply to France, Italy and Spain under a legal system of corresponding declarations, according to Eli.Shares in the company rose 3 per cent to $84.80, extending the stock’s gain this year to 23 per cent.Another dismal quarter of sales declines and losses pushed Barnes & Noble shares 1 per cent lower to $25.94. The struggling bookstore chain saw revenue for the three months to May 2 fall more than 10 per cent to $1.18bn as sales declined across all three of its businesses. Nook, its ereader business, registered the biggest drop, with sales down nearly 39 per cent compared to a year ago. Sales at its bookshops were down 9 per cent.The broader US equity market on Thursday continued the previous day’s losses.The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 2,102.31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 17,890.36. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite decreased 0.2 per cent to 5,112.19.
2;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2015-04-15T20:20:07Z;Delta Air Lines takes off on tripled profits;Carrier said it would reduce seating capacity on overseas flights;Shares of Delta Air Lines bounced after the carrier said first-quarter profits tripled and added that it would reduce seating capacity on overseas flights.The US airline reported profits of $746m or 90 cents a share, compared to $213m or 25 cents a share in the year ago period. On an adjusted basis, Delta reported earnings of 45 cents a share, ahead of forecasts for 44 cents.Sales rose 5 per cent to $9.4bn in line with expectations.On the earnings call, the company said revenue per available seat mile should decline 2-4 per cent in the second quarter, better than buyside expectations for a decline of 3-5 per cent, according to Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Co.Delta also said it would reduce international capacity by 3 per cent year on year for the winter period.In the December quarter, the company said it expects a 15-20 per cent cut in service from Japan, a 15 per cent reduction in Brazil and 15-20 per cent reductions in Africa, India and the Middle East. It also said it would suspend operations in Moscow over winter.“This is music to the ears of many investors who believe Delta should not overgrow capacity,” Ms Becker said. “The international capacity reductions will be focused on countries that have been hardest hit by the strength of the US dollar,” she added.Delta shares, which have gained 36 per cent in the past year, climbed 3 per cent to $44.20 and were among the best performers on the S&P 500.Intel shares gained 4 per cent to $32.83, after the US chipmaker announced a 3 per cent rise in profits and said sales were being driven by the “internet of things”.The company reported first-quarter profits of $2bn or 41 cents a share, on sales of $12.8bn, largely in line with analysts’ estimates.Revenue from the Internet of Things Group slipped sequentially but rose 11 per cent from the same period a year ago to $533m. “Year-over-year revenues were flat, with double-digit revenue growth in the data centre, IoT and memory businesses offsetting lower than expected demand for business desktop PCs,” said Brian Krzanich, chief executive.Shares of American hospital chain HCA Holdings were buoyed after the company lifted its full-year earnings and sales expectations. President Barack Obama’s overhaul of healthcare insurance, through the Affordable Care Act, has lowered the number of uninsured Americans and helped improve patient trends, the company said.The operator now expects sales of between $39bn and $40bn this year, from previous forecasts for $38.5bn and $39.5bn. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation will range between $7.55bn and $7.85bn, up from previous estimates for as much as $7.65bn.Shares of gunmaker Smith & Wesson popped on Wednesday, after the company raised its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings and sales guidance on better than expected orders in the last quarter of fiscal 2015. Smith & Wesson shares gained more than 15 per cent to $14.97.A rally in oil prices lifted the S&P 500 energy sector up 2 per cent on Wednesday.The S&P 500 climbed 0.5 per cent to 2,106.63, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 18,112.61. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent to 5,011.02.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
3;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2014-07-16T16:43:22Z;HCA Holdings buoyed by strong results;;"US hospital operators were buoyed on Wednesday by preliminary results from HCA Holdings, the largest for-profit hospital chain in the country, which far surpassed market expectations following recent healthcare reform.The $27bn valued company, which operates some 165 hospitals throughout the US, said its results “exceeded” its own expectations as admissions and revenues per admission increased at its facilities.Benefits from the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature law, lifted the company’s results as more patients used Medicaid or health insurance purchased through an online exchange.The company said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings as high as $7.15bn, or $4.25 per share, compared to Wall Street forecasts for $6.82bn. Sales are expected to range between $36bn and $36.5bn, also ahead of consensus expectations.“We think it is possible more of the beat was due to healthcare reform; in which case it would appear that HCA’s increase in guidance for the year is rather conservative since that benefit will continue,” Wells Fargo analyst Gary Lieberman said.The results sent shares of HCA almost 11 per cent higher to close at $60.99. Rival hospitals also climbed following the report. Tenet Healthcare advanced 8.32 per cent to $48.71, Community Health rose 8.57 per cent to $46.25 and LifePoint Hospitals increased almost 6 per cent to $65.06.Shares of US homebuilders rose after a report from the National Association of Home Builders showed confidence of builders touching a six-month high in July.The housing index climbed above 50 as sales slowly picked up after a slump exacerbated by the cold winter. A reading over 50 indicates more home builders view the market positively than negatively.Confidence was lifted by rising buyer traffic and improving expectations of sales in the coming six months.“This is the first time that builder confidence has been above 50 since January and an important sign that it is strengthening as pent-up demand brings more buyers into the marketplace,” Kevin Kelly, the chairman of the association, said.Lennar shares rose 2 per cent to end at $40.69, KB Home advanced 2.21 per cent to $18.01, Hovnanian increased 3.14 per cent to $4.60 and DR Horton climbed 2.15 per cent to end at $24.69.Yahoo was under pressure after the Sunnyvale-based web portal and search engine said sales continued to slide. Yahoo said first-quarter sales, excluding traffic acquisition costs, fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $1.04bn.Chief executive Marissa Mayer said she was “not satisfied with the results” and that Yahoo had to “work faster to ameliorate the negative trends” in the company’s display advert business.Ms Mayer has relaunched several web portals in the past year in an effort to woo consumers to its sites, including new sites on food and technology.Despite those investments, the company continues to forecast declining sales. Yahoo executives expect third quarter sales to fall as much as 6 per cent from a year earlier to $1.02bn.Shares of Yahoo slipped 5.11 per cent to close at $33.79.Intel rose 9.27 per cent to $34.65 after it reported revenues climbed to $13.8bn from $12.8bn in the same quarter a year earlier, helped by corporate demand for traditional PCs.Sales of PCs in the US rose in the first quarter, according to research groups IDC and Gartner, as companies ditch computers using Windows XP, Microsoft’s now obsolete operating system.The unexpectedly better picture for PC sales has helped make Intel one of the best-performing technology shares this year.International Game Technology shares advanced 9.16 per cent to $16.92 after Gtech, the Italian-owned gaming technology group, said it would buy the company for $6.4bn.Gtech, which is best known for operating Italy’s state lottery, said it planned to merge with IGT under a newly formed UK holding company.It added shareholders in Las Vegas-based IGT, which designs and makes computerised gaming systems, would receive $13.69 in cash plus 0.1819 shares in the new company, equivalent to $18.25 per share.Overall, US equity markets drifted higher. The S&P 500 climbed 0.42 per cent to close at 1,981.57 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.45 per cent to 17,138.20. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 0.22 per cent to end the day at 4,425.97.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"
4;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2012-07-25T11:15:22Z;IHH gain defies market gloom;;"Shares in Asian group IHH Healthcare defied wilting global stock markets with a 10 per cent jump on their first day’s trading on the Kuala Lumpur and Singapore bourses in another sign of Malaysia’s strong listings pipeline.As with the IPO of palm oil group Felda this month, the $2bn float by IHH was heavily supported by cash-rich Malaysian pension funds and a raft of cornerstone investors including BlackRock and Temasek, Singapore’s state investment agency.The debut makes IHH the world’s second-largest publicly traded healthcare company with a market capitalisation of M$24.89bn (US$7.8bn). It trails only HCA Holdings, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Its Malaysia-listed shares rose 10.4 per cent to close at M$3.09 on Wednesday while on the Singapore bourse the stock gained 10 per cent to S$1.23. IHH was the first concurrent float on the two countries’ exchanges.Both IHH and Felda received political backing from the Malaysian government, which has been pushing through the divestment of a series of government-linked companies in sectors deemed strategic, including healthcare.That has ensured strong local support for big-ticket initial public offerings even amid weak global equity markets. Further listings are planned over the next six months.The IHH float highlights the growth of the private Asian medical sector, which is profiting from a rising middle class increasingly able to spend on healthcare.According to Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy, “medical travel” revenues generated by patients destined for Singapore are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.7 per cent.IHH owns Parkway, the largest healthcare company in Singapore by number of beds. It has a presence in Malaysia where it is ranked second by number of beds, and a majority stake in Acibadem, the largest healthcare company in Turkey.All three markets “act as important hubs for medical travel within their respective regions”, according to IHH’s prospectus.Hospitals in Singapore and Thailand are cashing in on growing “medical tourism” by wealthy individuals seeking treatment outside their home country.IHH was 62 per cent owned by Khazanah, Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund; Japanese trading house Mitsui with 26.6 per cent; and Abraaj, a Cayman Islands-incorporated company with 7 per cent.Abraaj was the selling shareholder, and traces its ownership up through four subsidiaries to The Infrastructure & Growth Capital Fund, a Cayman Islands-domiciled private equity fund with 98 partners.It said its original investment in IHH in 2007 was based on a belief that rapid demographic changes in Asia coupled with rapidly rising incomes “would lead to increasing demand for quality healthcare which the public sector alone could not provide”.Abraaj said the cornerstone investors, which included Newton Investment Management, Och-Ziff Capital Management, and the Kuwait Investment Authority, accounted for 62 per cent of the share offering.Malaysian bank CIMB, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank were joint global co-ordinators of the IPO.Bursa Malaysia said that IHH Healthcare would be included as a constituent of the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI index on August 1, rather than after a regular review of the index’s components in December, as its market capitalisation was “significantly large”."
5;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2012-07-12T12:21:56Z;Malaysia’s IHH priced near top of range;;"An offering to institutional investors of shares in Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare, one of the biggest initial public offerings this year, has been 132 times subscribed as the country’s IPO market continues to defy global uncertainty.Demand for the 6 per cent of shares set aside for foreign and Malaysian institutional investors was high enough to set the price at the upper end of the range, at M$2.80 and S$1.13 respectively, two people familiar with the situation said.IHH is set to be the first concurrent listing on the Kuala Lumpur and Singapore bourses on July 26. It will be the second-largest publicly traded healthcare company after HCA Holdings, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and will raise about $2.5bn.Malaysia is a rare bright spot in the global IPO market as cash-rich domestic pension funds and other Malaysian investors are supporting big ticket floats, providing encouragement for foreign investors to come in.Sixty-two per cent of IHH has been taken up by “cornerstone” investors, including Temasek, Singapore’s state investment agency, and BlackRock.The IPO is also a sign of the growth of the private Asian medical sector, which is profiting from a rising middle class increasingly able to spend on healthcare. Hospitals in Singapore and Thailand are cashing in on growing “medical tourism” by wealthy individuals seeking treatment outside their home country.Sixty-two per cent of IHH is owned by Khazanah, Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund; Japanese trading house Mitsui has 26.6 per cent; and Abraaj, a Cayman Islands-incorporated company, has 7 per cent.Abraaj is the selling shareholder, and traces its ownership through four subsidiaries above it to The Infrastructure & Growth Capital Fund, a Cayman Islands-domiciled private equity fund with 98 partners that are not named in the IHH prospectus.IHH owns Parkway, the largest healthcare company in Singapore by number of beds. It also has a presence in Malaysia where it is ranked second by number of beds and a majority stake in Acibadem, the largest healthcare company in Turkey.All three markets “act as important hubs for medical travel within their respective regions”, IHH’s prospectus said.According to Frost & Sullivan, a consultancy, medical travel revenues generated by patients destined for Singapore are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.7 until 2016.IHH comes only weeks after another big Malaysian IPO, that of palm oil operator Felda, defied market uncertainty to debut higher on its first day on Bursa Malaysia.Like Felda, IHH is part of a programme initiated by Najib Razak, Malaysian prime minister, to divest government-linked companies in strategic sectors .Among IHH’s 22 cornerstone investors are the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, the city-state’s investment agencies; Och-Ziff; AIA, the Hong Kong insurer; Eastspring Investments, Prudential’s asset management business in Asia; and Hotel Properties, run by Ong Beng Seng, the Singaporean tycoon who brought Formula One to the city-state."
6;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2012-06-28T23:12:26Z;Health companies’ reactions mixed;;US healthcare stocks were volatile after the Supreme Court upheld the Obama administration’s healthcare law, as the ruling revealed the sector’s winners and losers after months of anticipation.Shares in the biggest US hospital groups jumped more than 10 per cent on Thursday, as investors bet that the sector was the industry’s biggest winner from the decision. The ruling means that fewer patients will turn up at emergency rooms without the ability to pay for their treatments and force hospitals to absorb the costs.Analysts said that the decision was ultimately a friendly one for most of the industry.“I think the reluctance from industry to support the bill has had more to do with politics and less to do with the impact on their business,” said Les Funtleyder, a healthcare analyst and portfolio manager with Miller Tabak. “Pharmaceutical and managed care companies helped craft the bill and it’s certainly friendly to hospitals.”On Wall Street, the S&P 500 health sector declined 0.3 per cent as general insurers suffered heavy losses. Aetna, WellPoint and Cigna, three of the US’s largest health operators, were among the biggest decliners on the main US market. Analysts said investors were sceptical of health insurers’ ability to execute the complicated changes that are set to take place with the law upheld.But hospitals and Medicaid insurers enjoyed a bounce from the decision. HCA Holdings, the largest US operator of hospitals by revenues, rose 10.8 per cent to $29.47. WellCare Health Plans, a Medicaid-based insurer, gained 8.8 per cent to $53.98 and Molina Healthcare moved 8.6 per cent higher to $23.16.“The decision means that hospitals now have much-needed clarity to continue on their path toward transformation,” Rich Umbdenstock, chief executive of the American Hospital Association, said.Investors in the top managed care insurers sold off shares. Although insurers will potentially gain 30m new customers, they will also be required to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions and will face tougher scrutiny over price increases.Karen Ignagni, chief executive of the industry group America’s Health Insurance Plans, or Ahip, praised the expansion of coverage but warned that certain provisions could disrupt coverage and increase costs.“Major provisions, such as the premium tax, will have unintended consequences,” Ms Ignagni said.Paul Keckley, of the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, said that the decision could bring more consolidation in the insurance industry, with insurers under more pressure over premium increases and from the creation of state insurance exchanges.Reaction in the pharmaceuticals sector has been mixed. Drugs companies offered generous concessions in exchange for supporting the healthcare law, and many were fearful about the prospect of a mandate being struck down with other provisions left in place.Industry experts continue to have mixed feelings about the future of the law, but many were thankful to finally have clarity.“You’ll see an acceleration of the government completing the regulations,” Charles Boorady, healthcare analyst at Credit Suisse, said. “The government has been slow-walking the regulations ahead of this decision.”However, some remained doubtful that it will achieve its ultimate goal of reducing medical costs.“The access problem is largely being addressed for low income people, but cost moderation and runaway entitlement spending is still an issue,” Ana Gupte, healthcare analyst at Bernstein Research, said.
7;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2012-04-03T13:28:09Z;Investors warm to US leveraged IPOs;;After a year-long hiatus, investors are again welcoming highly leveraged companies back to the public markets.Surging equity prices, led by the S&P 500 index enjoying its best first quarter since 1998, alongside returns on recent US initial public offerings of nearly 20 per cent so far this year, have reopened the window for IPOs of debt-laden companies backed by private equity firms.It will be a challenge to keep investors’ interest if the economy begins to show signs of slowing, however. In less bullish markets, IPO stock buyers are highly sceptical of leveraged companies.Last year, the IPOs of HCA and Nielsen required large payments of debt in order to make them palatable to the markets. Their offerings raised no money for the private equity firms backing them.But for now, hungry stock buyers appear to be increasingly tolerant of indebtedness. Their fears over debt have been eased by an improving US economy, which promises sales growth and possibly inflation, both of which make debt payments easier.They are also comforted even as Treasury yields begin to edge higher, as yields on corporate debts, even the riskiest tranches, remain near historic lows. That means debt would be cheap to refinance in the event a company is unable to produce enough cash.The result has been some bold IPOs. Allison Transmission, a maker of automotive components backed by Carlyle Group and Onex Corporation, raised $600m two weeks ago despite increasing its leverage ratio from net debt of 4.3 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation, to 4.4 times, by announcing a dividend for buyers in the offering. The S&P 500 average for leverage is 2.3 times.Nationstar Mortgage, a mortgage servicer backed by Fortress Investment Group, raised $233m last month despite having a post-IPO leverage ratio of 7.8 times – the highest level in at least three years for any US initial offering, according to Morgan Stanley.Private equity firms are eager to withdraw from current investments as they have already begun to raise money for new ones and need to demonstrate strong past exits.Firms are on the road raising $126bn from US investors, according to Preqin, the private equity data tracker. That is the most since early 2009. Two private equity firms themselves are also in the process of going public: Carlyle Group and Oaktree Capital Management. They have been behind two deals, Allison Transmission and the upcoming sale of Aleris, an aluminium products producer, respectively.“Private equity firms see the IPO process as another major step in that cycle of deleveraging and monetising these portfolio companies,” says William Sanders, global co-head of financial sponsors banking at Morgan Stanley.But to get them done, deals have been downsized, with owners typically selling less than 20 per cent of a company’s shares, and often at reduced prices.Rexnord, an industrial equipment maker backed by Apollo, sold shares last month at the bottom of its projected range. Caesar’s Entertainment, the casino group, sold fewer than 10 per cent, to test the waters in the public market.Yet buyers’ appetite for leverage has its limits. Private equity holdings such as Toys R Us and Avaya are unlikely to go public soon because they are not achieving enough organic growth.The market mood could also change quickly, as it did last year. Following three of the biggest private equity IPOs, for HCA, Kinder Morgan and Nielsen, in the first quarter, the window slammed shut as US and European sovereign debt woes threatened another global recession.“It really depends on the environment. If you truly believe growth is picking up, then the investments will work,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “We do have that bias, but I’m not sure I’m ready to bet the farm on it.”Even so leveraged groups continue to come to market, with increasing levels of debt. Dunkin’ Brands completed a secondary offering despite a ratio of almost 5 times, and Michaels Stores just filed to raise $500m in an IPO with a ratio of more than 5 times.There is one ultimate backstop that puts many investors at ease: the Federal Reserve’s loose monetary policy, which may continue to make debt historically cheap to issue.“If interest rates remain low through 2014, income-seeking savers and institutions should continue directing capital into high-yield bonds and leveraged loans,” says Martin Fridson, head of credit strategy at BNP Paribas Investment Management. “Strengthening of the economy might divert some of that flow into equities, but not so much that refinancing of existing speculative-grade debt would become difficult.”
8;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2012-02-09T21:57:41Z;Muted share price reaction to foreclosure deal;;US bank stocks saw a mixed reaction, as US regulators announced a deal that could be worth up to $39.5bn to resolve allegations that the largest US mortgage lenders improperly foreclosed on homes.The five biggest lenders will take a $25bn hit on mortgage principal writedowns and interest payments but the majority will come out of existing reserves.This is just a shuffling of losses. There will be almost no impact on bank balance sheets this quarter,” said Richard Staite, US bank analyst at Atlantic Equities. Bank of America, which has $30bn in loan loss provision and an additional $8bn in litigation reserves according to Atlantic Equities research, climbed 0.6 per cent to $8.18, its highest level since August.But JPMorgan fell 1.2 per cent to $37.86, despite announcing that it will not require new reserves to cover its share of the settlement. Citigroup was off 1.7 per cent to $33.66 and Wells Fargo fell 0.2 per cent to $30.58.Exposure to legal risk stemming from the housing crisis has weighed heavily on bank share prices.But Tom Burnell at Wells Fargo cautioned that the banks remain open to litigation on mortgage origination and securitisation practices, as well criminal prosecutions by federal and state governments and claims brought by individual homeowners.News that leaders of the main Greek parties had reached a deal on spending cuts broke just before markets opened in New York, but US stocks barely flickered in response.“The market has seen such a big move up, that to break out again we need to see a significant catalyst, which the Greek deal is not,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.The S&P 500 closed up 0.15 per cent to 1,351.95 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1 per cent to 12,890.46.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,927.23, as Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, set an all-time high of $496., before falling back to $493.17, still up 3.5 per cent on the day.Reports suggested the company may launch a new iPad model in March, while Canaccord Genuity analysts said Apple shares could climb as high as $665 after its retail checks showed “strong sales trends for the iPhone 4S at all three US carriers and overall strong iPhone sales in international markets”.The S&P 500 is just 12 points short of its post-financial crisis closing high of 1,363 hit last April with Apple at the centre of that recovery.Technology stocks now account for 20 per cent of the benchmark US index’s market capitalisation, an increase of more than 10 per cent since April. The weighting of financials remains a full percentage point lower than last April. Payment processing companies have been one of the few bright spots for financials and Visa climbed 3.8 per cent to $112.42 yesterday, after reporting strong results that suggested new regulations on card payments were not weighing on the company.Visa’s shares are now up 60 per cent since the start of 2011, while those of MasterCard have climbed 77 per cent over the same period.But Donald Fanetti at Citigroup warned that credit card companies are likely to see a seasonal uptick in delinquencies when they publish data on parts of their portfolio next week, which could weigh on the stocks.Shares in PepsiCo fell 3.7 per cent to $64.27, after the company said it would cut 8,700 jobs and said “structural” changes, such as divestitures or joint ventures, would be considered if the North America beverage business does not show improvement in the next 18 months.Shares in Groupon fell 13.7 per cent to $21.75, after the discount coupon website declared a loss in its first quarterly earnings report as a public company.That eradicated gains made in the first two days of February, when Facebook’s IPO filing triggered a rally in social media stocks. It may also have generated profit for short-sellers, who had borrowed and sold more than two-thirds of available Groupon shares ahead of earnings.TripAdvisor fell 14.6 per cent to $28.29, after the online travel-recommendation service missed analyst estimates with its first earnings report since being spun off from Expedia.Lorillard, a cigarette maker, climbed 9.7 per cent to $124.37, after it lifted its dividend 25 cents to $1.55 in strong results. That helped rival Philip Morris climb 2.8 per cent to $80.06.Akamai Technologies surged 10.5 per cent to $38.06. The network server provider reported quarterly sales and profit that topped analyst estimates.Shares in Diamond Foods fell 37 per cent to $23.13 after the company ousted its chief executive and said it would restate its accounts after a probe. That put at risk Diamond’s planned purchase of the Pringles brand from Procter & Gamble, although shares in P&G were up 0.6 per cent to $64.04.Hospital operators sold off as a note from Gary Taylor at Citigroup said inpatient admissions in January fell 1.75 per cent compared to the same month in 2011.Tenet Healthcare fell 4.8 per cent to $5.58 and HCA was off 4 per cent to $27.80.
9;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Last year, private equity groups received 78 such recapitalisations ­globally, according to Preqin, a data ­provider.The company unveiled plans this week for a dividend of $2 per share, totalling $870m, after reporting a rise in earnings related to the acquisition of the Denver-based hospital group HealthONE.HCA said the proceeds of the junk bond sale were for “general corporate purposes”, which might include financing the special dividend. It also stressed that the dividend would leave its leverage up only slightly at 4.63 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Public shareholders also benefit from the dividend.HCA was taken private by Bain Capital and KKR in a $33bn leveraged deal at the height of the buy-out boom in 2006. The two private equity groups own about 40 per cent of the company after an initial public offering last March.Vicki Bryan of Gimme Credit, the research group, said the legacy equity owners of HCA had already received $5bn of dividends and management fees, excluding their share of the proceeds from HCA’s IPO last March, more than their initial investment in the group.The special dividend comes as private equity is under scrutiny for its business practices due to the US presidential hopes of Mitt Romney, former Bain Capital chief executive. Republican rivals have sought to ­portray the industry as full of corporate raiders and asset strippers.Bain Capital and KKR declined to comment.“The business is extremely cash flow-generative, so bondholders let the company get away with [the bond sale],” said George Strickland, managing director at Thornburg Asset Management. “They have the luxury of saying: ‘Do we want to lower leverage or do we want to pay ourselves a dividend?’ The worst thing is when a company levers up to pay themselves a dividend.”The flood of cash into funds that buy junk bonds since the start of the year also makes it easier for companies to sell low-rated debt. HCA was able to increase the bond sale from the $750m originally planned.“The resistance to dividend deals weakens when fund flows are high,” said Martin Fridson, head of credit strategy at BNP Paribas Investment Management. “The managers are paid a fee to analyse and buy high-yield bonds. [They] do not really have the option of resisting deals by instead staying in cash.”
11;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-12-07T00:03:28Z;Boomtime buy-outs face further distress;Moody’s report highlights mediocre performance;Large leveraged buy-outs struck at the height of the credit boom face more distress after underperforming the wider market in terms of ratings, default rates and revenue growth, according to a report from Moody’s.The rating agency struck a gloomy note in its analysis of 40 large buy-outs completed between 2006 and 2008, arguing that, even after a slew of restructurings, nearly a quarter of the groups remain at a high risk of further problems. Another three have already filed for bankruptcy.“A number of companies have done a series of distressed exchanges and may do more,” said Lenny Ajzenman, senior vice-president at Moody’s. “We have questions about whether they will be able to refinance these large maturities.”High-yield bonds for Clear Channel and Harrah’s Entertainment, now renamed Caesars, both of which have already restructured, are trading close to 70 cents on the dollar and slumped lower earlier in the year as debt markets seized amid the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In the most recent quarter, TPG, which owns a big chunk of Caesars alongside Apollo, valued its equity at 60 cents on the dollar.The senior bank debt of the largest LBO ever, that of Texas utility Energy Future Holdings, is trading at 60 cents on the dollar. But its owners, KKR and TPG, value the equity at 10 cents on the dollar. Generally, however, the equity in LBOs only has value when the debt trades at par.The mediocre performance of large leveraged buy-outs is not the only legacy from the credit-fuelled bubble years between 2005 and 2008, when the sector raised nearly half of the $3.9tn in equity capital it accumulated since 1969.Even the best-performing buy-out funds have so far only returned about 30 per cent of investors’ capital, according to estimates by Triago, which advises private equity groups on fundraising.The vast majority of the remaining capital is locked in their portfolio companies or unspent.The Moody’s report does not address the wide variation in performance among the largest private equity firms. For example, TPG’s flagship TPGV global fund is valued at 84 cents on the dollar, below cost and far worse than comparable funds at its main competitors Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR.Aside from rare success stories – such as HCA, the US hospital operator taken private by KKR, Bain and Merrill Lynch for $31bn, which floated earlier this year or KKR’s Dollar General – private equity groups have struggled to exit large deals.Only seven companies in the Moody’s group have managed an initial public offering, sometimes after paying dividends to their backers, while two more have distributed a pay-out to sponsors.The 40 deals have suffered more downgrades than the wider corporate universe since being taken private, said Moody's. While they have also lagged behind the wider market in terms of median revenue growth, they have kept pace in terms of profit expansion – a sign that private equity’s laser-like focus on costs and efficiency may have borne fruit.Private equity firms have, however, been a big part of refinancings in the past two years. For example, in 2009, borrowers were looking at $430bn in high-yield debt coming due, according to data from JPMorgan. But today that figure has been almost halved to $220bn.
12;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Roar turns to whimper in US IPO market;;"The roar has become a whimper in the US initial public offerings market. After the excitement at the start of the year that the market was beginning to burst into life, sentiment has turned sharply amid worries about the eurozone crisis and the economic slowdown.There are still dozens of companies seeking to take the plunge – more than at any time since 2007, according to Dealogic – and there are still investors with money to buy them.But the market closed down in September, despite predictions that the post-Labor Day period would see a burst in activity. So what is the problem?In part, IPOs are a victim of their own success. After convincing investors that they were growing quickly, hopes were high that performance would continue; that becomes much less certain if the US economy slows.“The most compelling investment thesis is ‘promises made, promises kept’. If a company falters immediately after they go public, it shakes investors’ confidence,” said Dan Cummings, global co-head of equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.This summer, a number of high-profile debutantes missed earnings in their maiden quarters, including private equity holdings HCA and Kinder Morgan and Russian web group Yandex.Among the private equity-backed groups that make up the bulk of the pipeline, just over half are not profitable on an operating basis, according to Renaissance Capital, the US-based IPO research firm.“That stands to test investors’ risk appetite,” says Stephanie Chang, analyst at Renaissance.But the demand side of the market is not necessarily the issue. Fund flows into equity mutual funds have been positive for three of the last four weeks, according to Lipper, which tracks flows, despite a big outflow in early August.Michael Shinnick, portfolio manager at Wasatch Funds, says that the beginning of autumn is also the end of the reporting year for many mutual funds, so managers are selling losing positions. “People have some money to spend, and they are looking for some new ideas,” he says.Instead, the problem is one of timing an offering at a very uncertain moment. Are companies willing to endure a poor debut if it happens to come on the same day that, say, a European sovereign defaults?Not all companies need the cash from an IPO, enabling them to time their exits for when conditions are just right. “Through the crisis, firms became very efficient, and they can fund themselves with cash flow,” says Marc Zenner of JPMorgan’s corporate finance advisory unit.The rise of structured equity investments by private firms, as well as record low rates for investment-grade debts, allows firms to be choosier about how they fund themselves.“If I were sitting in an issuer’s shoes, I’d be thinking very hard about the various funding alternatives,” says Craig Orchant of EA Markets, a capital markets advisory.For many companies, an IPO is marketing event, especially when there is the possibility of a huge “pop”, such as social network LinkedIn’s debut earlier this year, when its shares nearly tripled in price.The threat of a first-day decline is a huge risk. Many Chinese groups have cited the “pop” as a reason to go public in the US, even if it means generating less cash in the offering. “An IPO is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and you don’t want to do it when market conditions are not optimal,” Mr Zenner says.Among companies trying to manage that timing are Groupon, the online coupon-seller, and Zynga, the social network games maker, who have delayed hoped-for September offerings into October.With so many companies on offer, both issuers and investors are waiting for the biggest names to take the first step. “As the execution of the pipeline slows down, the bar for companies that want to go public is a little bit higher,” said Mr Cummings. “You tend to find demand only for the best-in-class.”"
13;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-09-13T22:09:57Z;HCA: victim of political surgery;The position of for-profit hospitals will remain subject to political surgery;If US equities are feeling sickly, shares of hospitals are comatose. HCA, the largest by revenue, is down more than 40 per cent since the market’s 2011 peak. Its peers are barely healthier.The trouble started in July when HCA reported a disappointing quarter. Margins were hit by a shift away from complex, high-profit medical procedures. The problem was worst among patients insured by Medicare. HCA brought profit growth guidance down a few percentage points, to the low-to-mid single-digits. HCA shares, and the sector, slumped. On Monday, Tenet also reduced expectations, citing similar difficulties. HCA affirmed its outlook the same day, but its shares fell 4 per cent on Tuesday morning.Then there is the threat of reimbursement cuts to Medicare, which accounts for almost a third of HCA’s revenue. Last month’s debt ceiling deal requires a 2 per cent cut to Medicare reimbursement for hospitals, if Congress cannot find savings elsewhere. The news hit hospital shares again.HCA looks cheap, with an enterprise value under six times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. An investment opportunity? By the numbers, yes. While HCA carries $25bn in net debt as a result of its time under private equity ownership, the company generates ample operating cash flow ($3.5bn in the past 12 months) to cover the interest or pay down the principal. Analysts’ estimate that if the Medicare cuts come through, the negative impact on HCA’s profits would be less than 10 per cent.But the legislative overhang will last. While positive Medicare news will boost the shares in the short term, with the presidential election cranking up and Obamacare under attack, the position of for-profit hospitals in the US healthcare system will remain subject to political surgery.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The sale was increased from $1bn.“The more chaotic and irresponsible the governments of the world behave, the more investors will flee to other domiciles, like emerging markets, other currencies and corporate credit, even within the same country that is having the setbacks,” said Greg Hopper, senior portfolio manager at Artio Global Investors.For US states like California, a US default could jeopardise their budgets and borrowing plans by disrupting financial markets, resulting in knock-on downgrades and delaying federal payments for healthcare, transportation and other services.“California had to obtain this interim financing to protect the state from the immediate, drastic consequences of a failure by Washington to resolve the debt ceiling impasse by the August 2 deadline,” said Bill Lockyer, treasurer of California.California, like some other states and cities, sells short-term notes each year to cover its bills until seasonal tax revenues arrive the following spring. California had planned to sell its so-called revenue anticipation notes in late August, but the state was worried that “capital markets likely would be thrown into chaos” if no agreement on the debt ceiling is reached. And if the federal government prioritises payments to conserve cash and avoid default, it could disrupt federal transfers to states, California said.Maryland, one of the 5 states that Moody’s has warned it could strip of its triple A rating if the US loses its top notch assessment, shelved a bond refinancing this week, but it proceeded with a bond sale meant for capital projects.“There is just a lot of uncertainty,” said Patti Konrad, Maryland’s director of debt management.Still, the municipal bond market where states and local governments raise money was little changed in light trading on Tuesday. In a sign that banks are eager to pick up the slack, California’s loan, which comes due on November 22, yields just 0.237 per cent.

Nine of the S&P’s 10 major sectors declined, the softest being telecoms services, down 1.4 per cent, and healthcare, down 1.1 per cent. Utilities, a defensive sector, rose 0.3 per cent.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 2,842.80, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,592.80.Investors are waiting to see whether Congress can dissolve partisan deadlock and raise the $14,300bn debt ceiling and avoid potential default before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.Republicans and Democrats announced rival plans to increase the US borrowing cap.John Boehner, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, proposed raising the ceiling in two steps.Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, announced a separate measure to raise the debt limit by $2,400bn in a single move.Anthony Conroy, managing director at Convergex, said: “When Congress fails to agree, it’s certainly not viewed as positive. Any uncertainty is creating volatility, and we’re witnessing that volatility today.”The Vix index, a measure of equity volatility, rose 11 per cent on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. “It still appears very unlikely that the US will actually default, since the political cost of being seen as the group which triggered one could be very high,” said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.“If there is a deal, even if it limits the growth in Treasury issuance over the next few years, it could remove the roadblock of budget uncertainty from both the economy and markets, an eventuality that should prove stock-positive and bond negative,” he added.The second-quarter earnings season was being overshadowed by the debt ceiling impasse.“We don’t have much in terms of economic news, so the focus is on what is not happening with getting the debt ceiling lifted,” said Marc Pado, US markets strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “I think there’s still juice in this market if they get a deal done.”Lorillard, the maker of Newport and other cigarette brands, fell 4.5 per cent to $107.29 despite reporting quarterly net profit that beat expectations. Analysts speculated that the shares were hit by investors taking profits since the stock had gained 37 per cent this year.Shares in Kimberly-Clarkfell 2.1 per cent to $66.48 after earnings dropped 1.8 per cent as higher costs weighed on the manufacturer of Kleenex tissues. The company also warned that its 2011 earnings could arrive near the lower end of its forecast.Eaton, a US manufacturer, gained 2.8 per cent to $52.59 after beating profit estimates, citing fresh demand for electrical systems and a strengthening truck market.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, reported second-quarter profits that beat forecasts.“The structural improvement in the underlying operations at [Baker Hughes] is no longer a secret to investors, but we expect that [second-quarter] results should help solidify recent improvement in investor sentiment towards the name,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.The stock rose 0.1 per cent to $79.94.A handful of downstream oil companies were also strong. Marathon Petroleum rose 2 per cent to $41.37 after investment bank Dahlman Rose rated the stock a buy. Tesoro, an independent oil refiner concentrated on the US west coast, rose 3.2 per cent to $25.16.Research in Motion announced it was cutting 2,000 jobs.

16;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-04-17T18:14:58Z;Private equity: Uncertain prospects;Private equity appears to have revived but challenges lie ahead;"Anyone wanting to check the health of the private equity industry could do worse than look at HCA Holdings. In late February, the biggest operator of private healthcare facilities in the US filed to go public in a listing that raised almost $4bn and allowed its private equity owners to repay some of the debt used to buy the Tennessee-based group for $21bn in November 2006.The purchase by Bain Capital, KKR and the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America symbolised a sector apparently at the height of its powers. As David Rubenstein, co-founder of Carlyle, the buy-out fund, told a conference last autumn: “By the time the bubble burst in 2007, the industry had over $1,000bn under management and had become the face of capitalism to some extent.”When it came, the bust was harsh. In the year from the third quarter of 2006 to the second quarter of 2007, private equity firms announced deals totalling about $910bn. For the 12 months ending at the end of the first quarter of this year, the total was a mere $213bn, according to Dealogic.Now things appear to be on the mend for the industry. The HCA listing is one example of how large investment firms have recovered from the bust that followed their leveraged buy-out binge. As well as the money from the listing, the health group’s owners had already paid themselves $4bn in dividends. They are not alone. Today, by many measures, private equity firms appear to have returned to business as usual, cashing in on investments made in the boom years that ended abruptly in 2007, returning money to their own investors and making new investments from São Paulo to Shanghai.Yet under the apparently bright surface, things are not as healthy as they might appear. A wave of challenges from regulators, investors, competitors and indeed mortality is forcing the biggest buy-out firms to diversify into new businesses and new markets and take on more risk.As a result, the “face of capitalism” may lose some of its attraction in coming years. If that is the case, it would be a dramatic reversal in the fortunes of both the firms and their founders. “The industry will become smaller,” says Tony James, president of Blackstone, one of the industry’s biggest funds. “We will have bigger organisations but we will have less capital than we can put out. The economics of the business will be much worse.”If he is right, the effects will be felt well beyond the industry. Private equity firms have become a big force in the capital markets. They compete with industrial companies as they scour the world for attractive merger and acquisition candidates. In the good years, the presence of a potential bid from the buy-out firms supports stock market valuations and drives activity in the junk bond market.But whether their model is ultimately a force for introducing more efficiency and accountability to companies they control or whether their formula is more of a machine for self-enrichment remains a subject of debate. The more powerful they grow, the more other companies imitate the private equity model: huge incentives for those at the top if they perform well but also a lot more debt, providing their acquisitions with less of a cushion when times are hard.Mr Rubenstein says the power of the top-tier buy-out firms has depended on three factors. One, the rates of return “turned out to be better than almost anything else you could do with your money”. Two, the pension funds that invested in private equity groups needed those returns because they were badly underfunded, given their huge and growing liabilities. And finally, the model included taking 20 per cent of the upside of any deal. “If you can make 20 per cent of the profits on other people’s money, you are going to make a lot of money if you are good at what you do.”Before the bubble burst, the private equity template appeared very seductive. Debt was cheap, enabling buy-out firms to swallow large listed companies without a hiccup. Even a price tag approaching $50bn was not a problem. In 2007, when KKR and TPG bought TXU, a Texas utility now called Energy Future Holdings, they had no difficulty financing the deal.Moreover, these firms used very little of the equity capital in their own funds, preferring to load their acquisitions with borrowed money – the “leverage” in leveraged buy-outs. When, for example, Bain and Thomas H. Lee, two Boston-based firms, agreed a deal to buy media company Clear Channel in 2006, only six cents of every dollar was from their own funds. The rest was from banks and debt investors.The business was expanding rapidly. As the boom gathered pace, firms such as Blackstone and TPG were raising $20bn funds. The founders talked confidently of quickly moving on to $50bn funds. The fees these firms were paying the banks were far larger than fees from companies such as General Electric, making them Wall Street’s most powerful clients – and increasingly competitors as well.Today, however, valuations have come down considerably. For example, KKR and TPG are valuing their investments in TXU at a fraction of what they paid, according to confidential letters sent to investors in their funds. The debt load still totals more than $40bn but the firms have been able to restructure some of it, taking advantage of debt investors’ search for meaningful returns at a time when the US Federal Reserve and other central banks are keeping interest rates at rock bottom levels. It is a practice others have followed.At least so far, none of the firms’ worst fears has materialised; though some – such as Guy Hands’ Terra Firma, which was left with huge losses after losing music group EMI to Citigroup this year – would probably struggle to raise a new fund. A few others, such as London-based Candover, have exited the business.Despite the huge borrowings that paid for the biggest acquisitions, there has been no wave of defaults, as some pessimists anticipated. US-based fund Apollo, written off by many competitors in 2008 because it had bought aggressively into hard-hit sectors such as property, did such a good job the following year buying the debt of its own deals and those of its rivals at bargain prices on the open market that its funds were among the best performing in 2009 and 2010.Similarly, cash-strapped investors including pension funds and wealthy families may have been forced to sell their stakes in funds at a loss. But virtually all honoured their obligations to write cheques for new deals when asked.However, though private equity firms survived the global financial crisis better than many had privately expected, it is not clear that the outlook is so promising.Several have paid fines for practices that regulators are clamping down on. These include paying fees to agents who introduce them to important figures at public pension funds with the expectation that those fees will ensure that the pension fund doles out money to them. In March, for example, Calpers, the California state pension plan with $225bn under management, released the conclusion of an investigation it had commissioned into possible wrongdoing by agents who were paid by private equity firms to help get them money from the pension fund, the largest in the US.One result is that fees from such large pockets of capital are likely to be far smaller in future. Those who carried out the study recommended that the pension fund “use its size and reputation to secure the best possible terms on fees it pays to have its money managed”.Sovereign wealth funds, another popular source of capital, are also demanding concessions and better terms. “We have no leverage to say no,” says Mr Rubenstein.There may be more to come. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into private equity firms and their relationship with sovereign wealth funds. Senior executives of the firms have wined, dined and provided perks to potential investors from these large pools of money. They also used placement agents to secure allocations. These are just the sort of practices deemed at least inappropriate at Calpers.But perhaps the biggest challenge is the mortality of the firms’ founders. Most, such as TPG’s David Bonderman, KKR’s cousin founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts, Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Carlyle’s Mr Rubenstein, are in their 60s. All will sooner or later wish to take some of their own money off the table. The best way to do that is to go public; Blackstone and KKR have already done so, as has Apollo. Carlyle is expected soon to follow suit.That shift will mark an end to an era dominated by characters seen as larger than life, with charisma and swagger their successors have yet to match.By listing, the buy-out firms are also changing their model, much as they may deny it. Public markets want firms to maximise the value of assets under management, while the traditional investors in the buy-out funds care much more about the performance of those assets.“Private equity firms should not seek public listings,” says Georges Sudarskis, former chief investment officer for private equity at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, who now runs his own private equity firm and was speaking at the Private Equity International Asia Forum in Hong Kong. “Suddenly they have two masters: the public market and their limited partners.”Today most of the big buy-out firms are investing more outside the US in an attempt to escape the competitive landscape and falling returns of developed markets. Last year, the Asia funds of both TPG and KKR were up by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. In contrast, one of TPG’s flagship US funds with more than $17bn under management was worth only 90 cents on the dollar at the end of 2010.However, with so many entering the same places, such as Brazil and China, the effect is to shift the business to more risky countries without escaping the intense competition that prevails at home.For example, there is estimated to be about $50bn in funds raised for China deals but no indication that there are that many deals to be had in a country where rules increasingly favour local players.Many of the private equity firms are debating the wisdom of venturing into more dangerous markets such as Russia, where the rule of law has generally been weak. Moscow is planning to set aside $10bn to co-invest alongside firms potentially including Apollo, Blackstone and Carlyle in Russian companies that it plans to sell at attractive prices to foreign buyers. It has asked Goldman Sachs to advise it. The Russian government may also invest directly in the funds of the private equity firms to help overcome any reservations they may have.Executives at these private equity firms say they are trying to balance their desire for the money with their concern about the risk. The Russian overture is particularly tempting because it comes at a time when executives at these funds find that their traditional investors are growing sceptical about the need for large funds and large fees.For its part, Carlyle, one of the more adventurous firms, has just announced a fund for sub-Saharan Africa. It may not turn out to be successful but it has the advantage that there, at least, the competition will be minimal.Meanwhile, these firms seem determined to ignore the advice of Mr Sudarskis and others like him. “These are smart people,” he says. “You always have the feeling they are selling out at the top of the market.”…………………………………………..The return of leverage provides the fuel for new dealmakingPrivate equity’s comeback has been boosted by the return of leverage. This practice of using as much debt, and as little equity, as possible to fund buy-outs – thus multiplying returns when assets are sold – all but dried up in the credit crisis. As bond markets recovered, so has leverage, writes Anousha Sakoui.Measured as a multiple of a company’s net debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation, leverage reached a high of 6.6 times in Europe and 6.2 times in the US at the height of the credit bubble in 2007, according to Standard & Poor’s LCD.When the crisis hit, banks and structured vehicles that provide loans were laid low and with that went the provision of debt financing for deals. Because private equity groups typically fund the cost of takeovers principally with debt, they were hit hard.Last year it was 4.6 times net debt to earnings in Europe and 4.7 in the US. In the first quarter of this year, leverage levels have seen a further boost, reaching over five times.A signal of the return of banks’ appetite for riskier lending came in September 2010 when CVC, a private equity fund, secured SFr2.55bn ($2.85bn) for its buy-out of Swiss mobile phone operator Sunrise. It was the biggest leveraged loan in Europe since Lehman’s collapse heralded the drying up of credit markets.“Raising up to $10bn in debt for a buy-out is possible, if you access the dollar market,” says Karen Simon of JPMorgan in London. Theoretically that would allow for a total deal value – debt plus equity – of around $14bn-$15bn, she adds.More debt is available because as interest rates have fallen to historic lows, investors have ploughed funds into higher risk corporate debt – “ junk bonds” – in their search for yield. Private equity groups are now tapping this market for funds, making up for the loss of appetite by banks, which were left burdened with buy-out loans following the crisis.While banks are still not willing to lend to private equity buy-outs to the same degree as pre-crisis, rising junk bond issuance is helping grease the wheels of private equity dealmaking by providing a new source of debt funding. In the first quarter of 2011, private equity buy-outs totalled $55.9bn – 71.3 per cent higher than the same period last year. They accounted for 9.6 per cent of global mergers and acquisitions deals, according to MergerMarket – up from 7.1 per cent in 2010, but well below the boom years when it was about one-third.Still, actual deal opportunities are hard to find. Corporates, flush with cash, are not selling assets as rapidly as some might have expected. Moreover, when assets are spun out from big companies or put up for sale by private equity firms, corporates have an advantage.“Some of the major global [private equity funds] are saying backlog is as low as it’s been for many years …good quality corporates have sold what they needed to sell and are flush with cash and looking to buy, not sell,” says Steve Conway of Citi. Where private equity groups are winning deals, Mr Conway believes they are paying “full prices” – that should tease out sellers, and thus more potential deals."
17;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-04-09T15:38:40Z;Big divide in demand for initial public offerings;;As the second quarter begins, the market for initial public offerings in Europe and Asia is showing cracks, while the US continues to power ahead.This week, investors in Europe were given another reminder of the fragility of the markets, which have been unsettled by concerns including monetary policy tightening, nuclear crisis in Japan and eurozone sovereign defaults.Edwards Group, the UK vacuum technology supplier to the world’s biggest chipmakers, on Thursday shelved plans to raise £350m after investors spurned its offering, even at the bottom of its price range.Other recent IPOs floundered in secondary markets. Austrian aluminium group AMAG listed its shares in Vienna on Thursday at €19 but they fell to a low of €17 on Friday.Perform, a London-listed digital sports media company that priced on Thursday, saw its shares fall on Friday from an opening of 260p to close at 220p, a 15 per cent fall on the first day of trading. The listing was delayed by a day after the proposal of new German gambling laws.Bankers said the fate of Edwards and Perform highlighted the fragility of the market and selectivity of investors. “The market is very fragile, there is a lot of macro risk,” said one equity capital markets banker. “Europe is probably still more fragile.The US is different, it’s more mature, deals can be smaller. We will see a fair amount of IPOs but there will be soft patches throughout the year.”Two US IPOs launched on Friday, CVR Partners, a fertiliser storage group, and Golar LNG Partners, which stores liquid natural gas.Both companies are structured as partnerships that pay high yields to investors, and their shares were each up more than 11 per cent by midday on their first day of trading.That is consistent with the generally strong performance of US listings, which led global volumes in the first quarter, raising $13bn, according to Thomson Reuters.Shares of US IPOs in their first month of trading were up 20 per cent in March, according to Barclays Capital. “It’s very unlikely that a new issue is going to be delayed because of market conditions in the US at the moment. Volatility is low, markets are stable, fund flows are positive and deals are trading well,” said Joe Castle, head of equity syndicate for the Americas at Barclays CapitalEight deals are on track to list next week in the US, according to market sources. The most anticipated are a $125m IPO of Zipcar, the web-based car rental group, and the $874m US listing of Arcos Dorados, an operator of McDonald’s in Latin America.Demand for shares of private equity-backed companies remained intact.This year, large US IPOs of groups such as HCA, the hospital group, and Kinder Morgan, an energy pipeline operator, have been in strong demand, following the healthy performance of last year’s IPOs in Europe by Amadeus, the Spanish travel reservations group, and Kabel Deutschland, Germany’s largest cable company.On Friday the owners of Amadeus, a private equity backed group that went public last year, were able to sell a further 10 per cent of their holdings, more than they had initially planned.Bankers were also able to price an offer of shares in Turkish supermarket group Migros, representing about 17 per cent of its market capitalisation, which is being sold by UK private equity group BC Partners.A further test of the UK market will come in the next week or so when Skrill, the online payments group that operates as Moneybookers, is expected to price its London IPO, which could value the company at up to £415m.Bankers and investors are most interested in the progress of Glencore, the commodities trader, which is expected to sell about $10bn of shares in the coming weeks in one of Europe’s biggest IPOs.
18;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-03-28T22:20:39Z;NXP Semiconductor launches secondary offering;;NXP Semiconductor, the private-equity owned technology group that went public last year, is launching a secondary offering of some $700m worth of shares, as its private equity investors move to profit from the company’s improved valuation.The sale of 25m shares is part of a wave of exits by private equity firms from companies taken private during the credit boom in 2005 and 2006. Many of those companies have sold shares in initial public offerings to pay down debt and are now selling more shares to repay their private equity owners.During the financial crisis, NXP racked up some $5.5bn in losses. Its IPO last August struggled, pricing below its projected range and raising $476m versus an initially sought $1bn-plus.However, since its IPO, the shares have doubled in price as growing demand for new mobile electronics products and hopes for a global economic recovery have lifted the sector.The proceeds of NXP’s share sale will go directly to private equity firms and their investors, not to the company, according to a filing with regulators in early March. That contrasts with the use of the proceeds of its initial public offering last August, which went to paying down debt.The Netherlands-based technology group, at one time a unit of Philips, sold an 80.1 per cent stake in the company, along with $5bn in debt, to private equity firms including KKR, Bain, Silver Lake and Apax in a 2006 leveraged buy-out.NXP is trading at $28.69, a rise of nearly 105 per cent since the IPO. The company is now valued at $7.2bn. At the time of the IPO, its value was $3.5bn, or $2bn less than what it was valued at the time of the buy-out in 2006.Currently, there are some $150bn in public company shares still owned by private-equity firms, according to figures from Barclays Capital.IPOs of private-equity owned companies this year such as Nielsen Holdings and HCA have seen the proceeds mostly go toward debt repayment rather than liquidity for the buy-out groups who own the companies, in order to ease investor concerns about the companies’ leverage.Bankers say the second half of 2011 will be busy with secondary offerings raising cash for private equity firms. Already this year, Sensata and Avago, two private-equity-owned firms that went public last year and in 2009, respectively, have made secondary offerings.The underwriters of the offering, according to the regulatory filing, are Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays Capital.
19;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-03-14T04:36:49Z;HCA’s share sale raises bar;;The private equity industry has high hopes for a series of challenging buy-outs this year and next, following the successful sale of shares in HCA, the US hospital group taken private in a $31bn buy-out in 2006.HCA became the largest US private equity initial public offering on Thursday with its $3.8bn listing, according to Dealogic. On paper, the sponsors gained some $10bn in equity value for just five years of work.Along with HCA, share offerings from Nielsen Holdings, the media measurement group, and Kinder Morgan, a gas pipeline operator, were in high demand from investors.“The 2011 class of IPOs have thus far been for well performing, larger companies. An IPO is a natural alternative for those companies,” said Paul Donahue, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Morgan Stanley. “Investors are less focused on gearing when they are confident in a company’s or sector’s prospects.”HCA and Nielsen both saw the majority of the proceeds of the IPO go towards debt repayment, rather than to the private equity firms and their investors.That has become a typical concession for firms in IPOs, and investors have welcomed the shift so far.“Rather than providing de-levering from existing cash flow, private equity firms are doing that in a primary offering. Once they get the right business conditions, they will sell their own shares,” said Dan Cummings, head of global equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Many of the buy-outs still in the pipeline are more cyclical or more highly leveraged, and enjoyed less operating success during the crisis.That group includes Freescale Semiconductor, computer chip maker, Caesars Entertainment, the casino operator, and Toys R Us, the retailer, each of which has filed for a public offering.Further down the road are companies including TXU, a power utility renamed Energy Future Holdings, Clear Channel, the advertising and media group, and Hilton Worldwide, the hotel chain, which have not yet filed for offerings.“We’re not in a rush to do an IPO,” Chris Nassetta, chief executive of Hilton, said last week. Hilton has cut its debt load through a restructuring.
20;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-03-10T21:43:33Z;Tech stocks drag down Wall St;;A pull-back in technology shares matched a broad decline in US stocks as confidence in the economy was hit by troubling data.The Nasdaq Composite index, weighted towards tech groups, dropped 1.8 per cent to 2,701.02, below its 50-day moving average, a key technical marker.Especially troubling was a report from China that Hewlett-Packard, the personal computer maker, was considering spinning off its PC business.HP said the unit was not for sale, and many analysts discounted the likelihood of such a move.But HP shares were off 1.4 per cent to $41.48, their lowest level of the year. Rival Dell was off 1.2 per cent to $15.24.The moves followed a report from analysts at JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday that supply of “tablet” PCs, like Apple’s iPad and Motorola’s Xoom, could outstrip demand by 36 per cent. Shares in Apple were off 1.7 per cent to $346.67.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2.5 per cent, adding to its 3 per cent drop on Wednesday, to below its own 50-day moving average.“Semiconductors are the best indicator, because they go into everything, from toasters to aeroplanes,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Adams. “The shares always top out first and bottom out first.”Micron Technologies fell 3.8 per cent to $9.93 a share and NXP Semiconductor was down 4.6 per cent to $26.51 a share.NetApp, a provider of data storage, fell 6.1 per cent to $48.41 after it sold its external data storage unit to LSI, a rival. LSI rose 3.1 per cent to $6.32.The broader S&P 500 index was 1.9 per cent lower at the close, at 1,295.11. The Dow Jones Industrial average was also off 1.9 per cent to 11,984.61. Both were, like the Nasdaq index, below their 50-day moving averages.A negative jobless claims report was received as evidence emerged that rising oil prices were a threat to the economic recovery. The US labour department reported that 397,000 people filed unemployment claims last week, against a consensus forecast of 378,000.Trade data were also troubling. China reported a $7.3bn deficit as its exports, a key measure of global economic activity, declined. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit, widened to its highest level in five months in January. “To the extent that this surge reflects the strength of domestic demand . . . it isn’t necessarily a disaster,” said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics.“Nevertheless, it is a concern, particularly when we know that the latest surge in the cost of imported oil will drive the deficit above $50bn over the next few months.”Energy shares pulled back as US oil prices fell, though they remained above $100 a barrel.The S&P 500 sector fell 3.6 per cent, its worst one-day decline since last June. Chevron, the oil group, fell 3 per cent to $99.08, and rival ExxonMobil fell 3.6 per cent to $81.38.Materials and industrials groups were also hit hard. Caterpillar, the producer of industrial equipment, fell 3.9 per cent to $98.39 a share. Alcoa, the aluminium group, lost 3.1 per cent to $15.80.Shares in General Motors, the US carmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $31.42 after it said that Chris Liddell, chief financial officer, was leaving the company.“Now [GM has] talented people in all the right spots but they don’t seem to want to hang around,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. He said it was reassuring when Dan Ammann, the incoming CFO, said he planned to stay indefinitely.HCA, the hospital group that went public in a $3.8bn deal on Wednesday night, opened at $31.02, a 3.4 per cent rise from its issuing price of $30 a share.Starbucks, the coffee and beverage retailer, was the top gainer in the S&P 500, hitting an all-time high.Shares were up 9.9 per cent to $37.97 after it made a deal with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, makers of the Keurig single-cup serving system, to allow it to use Starbucks brands. Shares in Green Mountain soared 41 per cent to $61.71 a share following the deal, a record high.Iron Mountain, which handles data storage for companies, saw its shares jump 5.2 per cent to $27.66 after Elliott Management, a hedge fund, nominated four members to the board.Elliott has argued that Iron Mountain could unlock value if it spun off its warehouses used for storing documents into a separate property company.
21;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-03-04T19:52:31Z;US private equity: unknown unknowns;Reading the political tea leaves correctly is no guarantee of success;Any investor, particularly one pondering a huge bet with borrowed money, would relish the opportunity to glimpse future newspaper headlines. After all, clever analysts can make all sorts of confident-sounding projections about economic growth, commodity prices, market share and the like. Their crystal balls are far murkier though when it comes to future public policy.But as two of the largest leveraged buy-outs in history demonstrate, even reading the political tea leaves correctly is no guarantee of success. When KKR and TPG undertook the leveraged buy-out of TXU, the largest in history, the big risk for the coal-burning utility was seen as cap-and-trade legislation. Despite Barack Obama’s victory the next year, along with solid majorities in both houses of Congress, the rules never materialised. Unfortunately, a glut of natural gas and a subsequent collapse in power prices has pushed the company, now renamed Energy Future Holdings, close to default on much of its $41bn in remaining debt.Hospital chain HCA, taken private in a $33bn deal the previous year by KKR, Bank of America and relatives of Bill Frist, then Republican Senate majority leader, seemingly fared far less well in Washington. Mr Obama’s victory and unexpected success in passing healthcare reform ostensibly threatened private healthcare providers. But HCA is the very picture of health, set to re-emerge as a public company later this month at a price that will make it one of the most lucrative buy-outs ever.It seems that buy-out titans could have learnt something from Donald Rumsfeld. They reckoned that, barring exogenous threats, businesses with historically stable cash flows could service an outsized chunk of debt and magnify equity returns. In the end, it was not the known unknowns but the unknown unknowns that made or broke these deals. Leverage and hubris are a volatile combination.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
22;HCA;Hca Holdings Inc;2011-02-23T14:50:01Z;KKR boosted by recovering equity markets;;Buy-out equity company KKR reported a 39 per cent gain in earnings for its fourth quarter to $714.6m, helped in part by strong stock and credit markets.Using economic net income, the preferred measure for listed alternative investment companies, KKR reported profits of $2.14bn for the year compared to pro forma earnings of $1.95bn in 2009. That measure excludes certain charges stemming from its listing.KKR declared a fourth quarter dividend of 29 cents a share.Henry Kravis and George Roberts, company founders and cousins, noted that KKR’s private equity funds returned 33 per cent for the year, “significantly outperforming the S&P 500 return of 15 per cent.”The earnings announcement came the same week as KKR and its partners in hospital firm HCA Holdings announced they were scaling back the largest-ever planned initial public offering of a private equity-owned company on record.Benign capital markets have enabled buy-out firms to list some of their companies and to take their money off the table by refinancing others and then paying themselves dividends.KKR, which played the boom years more aggressively than many of its rivals is slowly nursing many of the largest companies it owns back to health with the help of the capital markets. But others, such as Energy Future Holdings, the former TXU, which was bought at the peak of the market, remain in intensive care.On a GAAP basis, the company earned $189.6m for the fourth quarter and $333m for the year. KKR continued to grow its capital markets business, more than doubling its fee-related earnings to $37.7m for the quarter.Assets under management rose almost 17 per cent to $61bn, as the company raised $5bn last year to invest in a range of initiatives including a China growth fund, infrastructure and debt funds.While Blackstone and KKR continue to outperform the public markets, and their companies have generally enjoyed improved operating performance, many investors remain skeptical of their ability to do new deals on anything like the scale of their transactions before the global financial crisis.The gap between what buyers like KKR are willing to pay and what sellers are willing to accept remains large, bankers say. At the same time, companies are cash rich and are now willing to outbid the once mighty private equity groups.KKR shares were up 2.3 per cent in pre-market trading at $16.55.:
