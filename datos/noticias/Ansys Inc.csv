Instead of spending time and money building prototypes and then testing them, a growing number of companies are using simulation software to virtually model processes and design innovative products faster and cheaper.Emhart Glass Manufacturing, a US subsidiary of Switzerland’s Emhart Glass group uses software developed by Ansys, a 41-year-old company based in Pennsylvania. Emhart Glass manufacturing is a supplier of glass forming machinery to the container industry, says Pierre Ngankeu, a senior mechanical engineer in the Process Automation & Simulation group at Emhart Glass Research Center.“We don’t make glass ourselves; we make machines that make the containers. We make forming machines and we also make inspection machines,” he explains. Emhart Glass Maufacturing’s customers include many of the leading brewers and soft drink distributors.Computer-based engineering simulation is now being used by companies in many industries during the early stages of the development process, allowing engineers to refine and validate designs at a stage where the cost of making changes is minimal.Ansys pioneered what it calls ‘simulation driven product development,’ using engineering simulation software to predict how product designs will operate and how manufacturing processes will behave in real-world environments. Its customers include Dyson, Cummins, Speedo and Panasonic and the scientists who designed the Large Hadron Collider at the European organisation for Nuclear research (Cern.)“Companies can use the physics that are embedded in the Ansys software to virtually find out what is going to happen to their products under normal, or even abnormal, wear and tear and use,” explains the company. “It enables users to subject their designs virtually to the forces that their design might encounter in the real world.”The software often allows companies to solve manufacturing design challenges before the first prototype is even built by creating virtual products on a computer. Manufacturers can also shorten – and in some cases avoid altogether – the costly and inefficient prototyping process, thus reducing manufacturing costs and reducing time to market.Those are key considerations for Emhart Glass manufacturing. “Sometimes our customers come to us and say, ‘we want to be able to make this,’ and because we have the knowledge of the glass forming, we can tell them, okay, you can do it this way or that way,” says Pierre Ngankeu. “To be able to make the machine you have to understand how the process works so that is where I work in the process engineering and automation and simulation of this process using the Ansys software.”When Mr Ngankeu joined Emhart six years ago, the company was already using simulation software, but he says that over time the company has upgraded the software to add more capabilities.“We discovered that there were huge benefits because in the container forming process, or when glass is being formed in those moulds, you cannot see inside – there’s no way for you tell what’s going on in there. I was amazed the first time I saw one of these forming simulations because I was like, ‘wow.’ Every time you have a problem, a new problem and you start putting it into the software sometimes it shows you things that you wouldn’t imagine.”Using the Ansys software, Mr Ngankeu says Emhart has been able to simulate many aspects of the forming process. “I am not going to claim that we have been able to simulate all of them because there is always limitation to what the software can do, but we have been able to get some really basic, fundamental answers about why things do what they do.“That has helped us in the design of equipment, for example, in mould design and in defect resolution. It allows us in general to focus on what really is the cause of a variation or a defect in the process and that is much better because when you know the real cause, the solution you take usually ends up being more precise and less expensive.”Instead of making informed guesses about the solution to a particular problem and then making incremental changes to a prototype until the problem is resolved, the simulation software enables the engineers to identify the problem and the solution much more quickly. “We have the ability to do all this virtual prototyping and then maybe at the end you only have two candidates instead of 15 to build and then you can test them and see what’s going on,” Mr Ngankeu explains. “The software takes you 90 per cent of the way.”“I had a project I was working on and we were trying to figure out angles and things like that. We only built two prototypes and they were pretty much what we wanted because all we did was simulate the heck out of it. We removed things, we added things and then we ended up building straight from the prototype. Better prototyping gets you closer to what your product should be like in a shorter amount of testing time.”Consumer product companies have discovered similar benefits. For example, during the design phase of Dyson’s ‘bladeless fan, ’ the engineering team was able to design and model up to 10 geometric variations of key dimensions in a single day and then to compute the results in a batch overnight.Over the course of the design process, Dyson’s engineers steadily improved the performance of the fan to the point that the final design has an (air) amplification ratio of 15 to one, a 2.5-fold improvement over the six-to-one ratio of the original concept design. In total, the team investigated 200 different design iterations using simulation, 10 times the number that would have been possible had physical prototyping been the primary design tool.Physical testing was used to validate the final design, and the results correlated well with the Ansys software simulation analysis. The result was an innovative product that has won considerable critical acclaim."
